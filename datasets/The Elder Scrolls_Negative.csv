Negative,"BUYER BEWAREI have been a long time casual player of ESO. I am a mom who likes to unwind and just chill and is not competitive and usually plays solo. However, last week, I was banned for no justifiable reason. When I tried to log in and received a message that I was banned, I was shocked. I filed a ticket, received a generic copy/paste message that I was 'cheating' with no further explanation. I have NEVER cheated in a game, including this one. And when I responded to the ticket asking for further elaboration, I have gotten nothing. No further responses. I know for a fact no investigation was done because if it had, they would have found I wasn't cheating. I HAVE NEVER CHEATED. Yet, I can't get a response or any explanation from this company. I have spent hundreds of dollars for it to be taken FOR NO REASON. I am furious that this is how innocent players are treated and I would warn you not to spend a dime on this game since it can be taken from you in a moment for no reason with no recourse and no explanation."
Negative,"The community is good and I've had a great time over the years until now. The company literally hates its player base by refusing to listen to feedback on how to make it better, obvious the dev's don't really play themselves or they would know. They shut down any criticism and leave bugs hanging for months if not years and ask you keep spending money. The cash shop is ridiculously over priced and the crate system and gems are as most games, a rort. New dungeons that should be included with new map DLC are sold to you as micro DLC's like a damn EA game. They flat out refuse to fix the PVP content and fix the issues in cyrodiil and server lags. The fact they out right silence criticism tells you all you need to know. I'm sad that this game has gone in this direction of instead of making great content they just add more crap to the cash store when game content is what will bring players back old and new. I've spent a shameful amount of hours in this game since launch so this is not a drive by thought. Bottom line, they don't care about game play, only cash shop."

Negative,"I love this game, but I think it's time that I air my grievances.As you can see, I have spent quite a lot of time in ESO. I have probably played ESO more then any of its developers, and all we as a community ask from them is that they listen and understand our problems. So, that's why I am writing this rant as a means of informing the devs. However, any ESO dev has probably already stopped reading and decided to play a match of Tales of Tribute, or, as I call it, a waste of time. Speaking of Tales of Tribute, to even play that, you need too pay for it, so let us discuss...1: A history of free and paid content in ESO:April 2014 - Release.May 2014 - Added Craglorn Zone - FreeJune 2014 - Added Veteran Crypt of Hearts Dungeon - FreeAugust 2014 - Added Ability to dye armour - FreeSeptember 2014 - Added Upper Craglorn and the Dragonstar Arena - FreeNovember 2014 - Added Veteran City of Ash Dungeon - FreeFebuary 2015 - Justice System and Champion Points Update - FreeMarch 2015 - Tamriel Unlimited released, crown store introduced.August 2015 - Imperial City DLC - $25 (Now Free)October 2015 - Orsinium DLC - $30 (given away for free as a daily reward once)March 2016 - Thieves Guild DLC- $20 (given away for free once)May 2016 - Dark Brotherhood DLC - $20August 2016 - Shadows of the Hist Dungeon Pack - $15October 2016 - One Tamriel Released - FreeFebuary 2017 - Housing Update - Free?

Some will argue that you can just buy the monthly subscription, but why is it that games such as Wow and Warframe can give away their new and old content for free? Sure, ESO DLC's have one major quality that others lack which likely contributes to the price, full voice acting, however, they use the old Bethesda trick of hiring the same actors to voice countless NPC's but, whatever I guess...I'm not asking for everything to be given away for free, I am quite literally asking for scraps that are several years old. You can however, purchase things from the crown store with gold. This is done via in-game gifting. So, you would send a player gold, and in return they will spend their crowns to gift you the crown store item that you want. This is not without its problems, with the biggest obviously being scams, but, getting DLCs this way is fine... I guess. However, if you do get scammed, you will have to contact support, and speaking of support...2: Zenimax as Developers and as support:While I do somewhat respect @Bethesda_Kraken for responding to reviews, I personally think that no response, is better than a copy/paste generic response. Anyway, let me walk you through communication between the players and Zenimax, in my own experience.Experience 1:1: Ignore the steam forums.2: Several players post a bug/problem, in my case, a bug regarding a lead.3: Players say that the lead is not dropping and that it is probably bugged.4: Zenimax says that it is not bugged, and that it is very unlikely that something like this would be bugged.5: Time passes.6: Zenimax says that it has been bugged, and that they will work on a fix.The fact that this has happened several times is hilarious.Experience 2:1: Players ask for something meaningful to be added or fixed.2: Zenimax releases an archeology/antiquity minigame.3: Players once again ask for something meaningful to be added or fixed.4: Zenimax releases a card minigame.5: Players complain.6: Forum thread locked/deleted.This game has come a long way in 9 years, and I don't want it to fail or get worse, but for many like myself, we play this game because we like the world of the Elder Scrolls. So when the Elder Scrolls 6 is released, why should I stick around and play this? When I compare this to something such as Warframe or Destiny 2, which also had rocky starts and have changed dramatically over time, I can't help but feel disappointed and cheated. Both of those games are free with zero subscriptions. and yet I feel that they are less predatory than ESO. Anyway, I will continue to update and change this review over time, thanks for reading.Edit April 2024 - Recently, a few ESO DLCs were given away for free. On one hand, this is great, but......Why not just make these 8+ year old DLCs free and/or part of the base game. They did it with the Morrowind DLC. For example, WoW makes it so that when the new DLC is released, last years one is made part of the base game. I'm not saying ESO should do this, but nearly decade old content should should just become part of the base game, instead, they do this limited time FOMO crap......It's all so tiresome...TL;DR: Game is pretty good, and yet horse amour has better value."

Negative,"I have played this game for the past 3 years and would not recommend it. I would like to start with the positive aspects first.    ESO has great graphics for an MMO, and the environments look amazing. Its possible to use Reshades to make the game look even better to look at. The cities are really big and its possible to visit most the interiors of most buildings.    The world feels very alive as there are players everywhere, in every zone even the most outdated ones. It makes it easy to find people to do activities such as world bosses.    In game community is often helpful, lots of people have helped me out when I was new, but the endgame community can be toxic.         The dungeons are fun and have some cool mechanics. They each have a story in them and also each dungeon is unique and the bosses are quite challenging. I had a lot of fun playing them with friends.    The story and questing is one of the biggest aspects of ESO, and I have mixed feelings about it. Some of the zones have really interesting and engaging story lines, such as Grahtwood and Orsinium, but I found most of it boring. The main story quests of most zones are ok doing it once but it lacks replay value since there are no actual choices you can make that affects the story to a large degree. Most of the choices left to the player are really small and they mostly show up in side quests. I don't like the side quests most of the time because its often about helping someone who really doesn't have any proper background and isn't interesting, and the quest bosses are highly repetitive and too easy to kill.    The soundtrack is good I guess but I feel that the best tracks are remastered from the previous Elder Scrolls games. I found  the combat music to be pretty annoying.    I found the combat to be awful, mainly because of animation canceling as well as the combat feeling floaty. So the animation canceling is when you can perform a light attack between abilities. All skills have a one second GCD, but light attacks are on a different timer, which causes this issue. Animation canceling increases DPS by a lot and its essential in endgame content. It requires a significant amount of skill to perform correctly, but it just isn't any fun. What's more is that it makes the character look like they're having a seizure, and it clearly isn't an intended feature. The game makes no mention of this anywhere, but if someone wants to do any endgame content they need to be able to do it, as otherwise most guilds will not consider them.        Another issue is the champion system, its meant to be the endgame progression system. There are 810 points to obtain in total, and they are obtained by just gaining exp. But the system is boring and it just offers something like +1% damage or +1% magicka recovery and stuff like that. There are no class new abilities added with this system and it isn't really fun for endgame progression.    Classes feel too similar to each other. ESO has 6 classes, but there exists two variations of each class, magicka and stamina. The stamina version wan't intended by the developers(I think) because there currently is stamina sorcerer and stamina necromancer which don't make much sense. But due to the way abilities work it was found that stacking stamina in builds results in being able to do good dps as well. The problem is that every single class has the same types of abilities, just with different colors and effects. Every class has a similar ground based DOT, one spammable, one buff which grants increased damage, one defense ability which boosts armor and so on. When performing dps rotations, every class plays almost the same due to this. But some classes are tweaked every patch which keeps shifting the meta, so one needs to have every dps class available.    PVP is too laggy and not fun or balanced. The PVP in this game was intended to be a major aspect, however these days it seems to be neglected. The game was supposed to support 200 vs 200 battles, but even with 20 people on the screen it starts to lag and sometimes gets disconnected. FPS also drops, however the game doesn't use a lot of system resources either. Its also unpredictable to tell what enemy players are casting because of the combination of animation canceling and lag. The PVP isn't balanced in the sense that sometimes one faction has way less players than the other one. Also some classes are just better in every way than other classes, and some sets are overpowered.    Endgame trials(raids) are also laggy, and the trial design is bad in my opinion. There are only three or four bosses in each one of them, and there is too little trash mobs in between bosses. Bosses have some interesting mechanics but it just isn't very fun due to the poor combat, lag and low fps. Trials also don't drop very powerful gear which is worth chasing after or any cool cosmetics.      Too much focus on crown store. The game is very hard to play without the monthly subscription as inventory space is highly limited. Even after subscribing, too many things are pay walled, such as mounts, pets and housing. The monthly crowns which are provided are so little that its possible to only buy a pet or a costume. The game has 95% of mounts pay walled with no other way to get them. The better mounts are kept in the loot crates which use another currency system called crown gems, and the coolest mounts are called as radiant apex rewards which cannot be obtained with even crown gems and must be gambled for. Housing in this game is really fun and its possible to make all sorts of structures, but its so ridiculously overpriced, the best houses are crowns only, and even then the best furniture is sold exclusively through the crown store.        The problem with this is that there is very little incentive to play through the game and collect stuff. And now even skill lines and skill points will be sold through the crown store. Skill lines are an important part of the game because they have important passives which are needed in more difficult content, but they are grindy and boring to level up. It literally takes a 100 hours to grind all the skill lines such as mages guild, undaunted, psijic order and to collect every skyshard to unlock all the abilities on one character. Many players have asked for it to be account wide, but in the end the solution is sold through the crown store. So the crown store isn't limited to cosmetics only, there are game play impacting items as well. I would call it pay 4 the convenience 2 win or something like that( p4c2w :)).I wouldn't recommend this game due to these reasons, as the game is slowly being designed with only the cash shop in mind. I've spent a lot of time and money on this game and I regret it a lot. I mainly maxed out my all of my characters skill lines and skyshards, as well as spent many hundreds of hours becoming a master crafter. Almost everything is available for purchase through the crown store these days, its so bad that its possible to become a master crafter in just a couple of minutes with the crown store. I would only advise this game for TES fans who may be interested in playing the story casually, because as an MMO its just not that good for the amount of time and money that it asks."
Negative,"A great Elder Scrolls experience, but the price gouging surrounding content for it has reached the point of being ethically unacceptable on the part of the publisher."
Negative,"As veteran players, who played this game for nearly 3 years and spent all money for full DLCs and update in-game, I cannot recommend this game anymore.The last privacy agreement update in this game said they can collect and also sell users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies. Nah, no thanks. I will keep my wallet for another Steam sale."
Negative,"That's right, played it for nearly 4000 hours and wouldn't recommend it to other players. Why not? Because the developers are more interested making money via re-skinning the same old crap in the crown store, than they are in fixing the many, many bugs. Newer content comes out? So do new bugs. Patch updates or maintenance? More new bugs. Fix certain bugs? Break something else instead. And not fix it for ages, if ever. Because, y'know, crown store shinies more important.Add to that the incompetent and clueless customer service (e.g. expecting me to acknowledge T&C/TOS in a language that was _never_ selected as my own; ridiculously long gaps in addressing forum concerns) and the ongoing price for having such basics as a crafting bag, etc. Why keep paying over and over for a game that is this broken, with crappy developer service, when there are other games you can enjoy for a one-off price? Would you keep paying an electrician or plumber to fail you month after month? I wouldn't. Enough is enough."
Negative,"Update:After buying him a monthly pass and him losing interest. I ask him ""What happened with ESO?""Son: ""Its boring, the people are toxic and the cool items are a lot of dollars.""So thats it for us. Good luck!Old review:Just came back after 5 years. My son is as old as the game and I bought him a copy.""This game is awesome"" is all he keeps saying. I bought the Duo-Dynamo and we cruise around together. Creating the next generation on gamers.(Update- Also educating them in the scams that they sell to young and ignorant people - ""Thats a lot of money for a item, dad. Yes it is son, yes it is.)Parents against gambling and extortion. Cheers."
Negative,"Lately it seems like ZOS cares less and less about the community, and it kind of sucks considering a lot player have been ESO Plus member for years at a time. Looking back at the past there is a night and day difference. Previously when there were issues that the community presented to ZOS they were met with appropriate response. Even looking back at the past few years it is quiet clear that ZOS's mean focus is how can they can get Microsoft the most dividends. Instead of improving performance whether is is Cyrodil, Imperial city, or veteran trials. Take for instance the final boss in the Vateshran hollow hunter's grotto, Rahdgarak has been bugs for months at this point. It is very well known in the community that he is broken and nothing has been fixed or even addressed by ZOS. This type of bug is the prime example of what type of business model ZOS has. Ignore the few long term customers because they aren't going to leave, and focus on the new players who are dumb enough to spend tons of cash on a game. Then once those new player reach the end game content they realize that most of it is unplayable due to bugs. How long did it take for Zos to fix the poison on Veteran Sanctum of Ophidia, or the bug in Veteran Rockgrove."

Negative,"ESO, is one of my favorite games. Before you take that, and run with it, I would like you to know that I have played ESO an unhealthy ammount of time.          I had this game before it was on steam, and played the Beta on my relatives account. ESO would have been that ""WoW Killer"" type MMO. It was good, I paid my sub just to play just like most MMORPG's. They were constantly improving the game up untill it stopped. When they did the update to make it free ""Tamriel One"" I believe it was. The game has went downhill. When a bug or exploit shows itself in the combat/play through experience , it takes almost a full year cycle before it gets fixed. Turn the table a bit, and if there is a problem with one of the cosmetics that you can pay for with real money, they have it patched in a week. Now that can just be a coincidence, but I'll let you decide.     If you are looking to have a great PvP experience, DO NOT waste your time. The pvp has been untouched since early 2016. Almost nothing ""NEW"" has been brought into the game in over 3 years when it regards PvP. You go to duel someone, and they are in the cheesiest builds. You want to do group PvP? Ok well, go into Cyrodil (the pvp map) and run into ball group after ball group (These are tightly packed groups that spams heals and are nearly impossible to kill). 1vX used to be a thing where you can have a fun time solo playing. Not anymore sadly. If you don't have 15+ people don't bother. Unless you want to come at 2 in the morning and boost AP to get on the leaderboard. Cause that still hasn't been fixed.   If you think im done, I'm not. You can get hit one time in PvP and be ""Combat locked"" which means no mount and locks you from doing other things. You can be combat locked for hours at a time. Just from being hit once.   In regards to PvP....Just don't, save your time and patience and don't even try.   Now the PvE, has it's ups and downs. They have beatiful Dungeons/Trials and what not. They have long questlines and countless things to do sure. If you want to casually play this game, I don't see a problem with it. Zenimax is now catering to the casuals. Which is fine.   The PvE (endgame) is a joke. Use this set that everyone else has used. You don't like the old playstyle? Well here is Arcanist. Just hit 1 button and do better than someone that has to juggle 40 buffs, and timers. Oh Necromancer? You actually want to play necromancer? That class was just a cash grab.  The cash grab is crazy. like 98% of the coolest mounts in the game are locked behind a gambling service. So is most of the other cosmetics. The gambling service (crown crates) is a money trap. There is a pity system tho, so I will give them that.   It seems that Zenimax cares about pushing more content to buy/ crown items, then they do about the overall gameplay and experience.   The only reason I played as long as I did, was because I really did Love this game. I still try to love it, but with the constant disappointment, I think it's time to move on from it."
Negative,"I've played this game for over 2 years, closing in on 3 years in December. I've played WoW for 14+ years. I'm not new to MMOs. I can tell you, without a shadow of a doubt, that the developer of ESO, Zenimax, is putting this game on maintenance mode. If you want to play this game, just know that it is not as good as it used to be, because they have shifted a lot of their dev team off this game.They are currently working on another MMO and ESO has been put onto a minimum effort content cycle of wringing money from people's wallets whilst they go full steam ahead on another game. New content is half-assed and designed to get you to spend money for minimal effort. Not only that, but they've started putting very overpowered gear into each new expansion/DLC to get people to purchase them, and then they nerf those items within a few months. It is downright scummy.The game itself is fun and the base content is plentiful, but if you want to do more than casual leveling you have to pay for a subscription as it functions as a solution to every problem that is introduced if you want to do more than questing. Professions? Get a sub. Endgame? Get a sub. Participate in auctions and trading? Get a sub. Housing? Get a sub. Make your character(s) look cool? Get a sub.Should mention how bad their forum is as well. They have a salaried group of people whose sole job is to police their forum hardcore. You cannot post anything negative about the game there. Ever. You will get your posts removed/edited by their mod police, if not get outright banned. I wish I was joking. Just browse through it and look at how many posts get edited by ZOS mods lol.And if you want to know how Zenimax treats their playerbase, let's look at something that happened last year in 2021: https://old.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/pfgvvn/entire_raid_group_banned_for_reporting_a_bug/They will outright ban people for reporting bugs. This is not the first time, nor the last time, that Zenimax has banned people for bug reporting. REPORTING. Not even taking advantage of a bug, but just experiencing it and then reporting it, like they are told to do. And bugs in this game are so frequent that you have to tiptoe over eggshells lest you might get banned. Currently, there is a re-occurring bug with daily login rewards that can give the reward multiple times. People have accidentally gotten multiple rewards because they don't even know it's a bug. Many of those people ARE GETTING RETROACTIVELY BANNED. For something that this inexperienced dev team can't properly fix. Talk about sad.I've made a lot of friends in this game and had a ton of fun, but it is absolutely not a game worth investing in anymore. Just find something else.Also, that 21 million players thing is a load of shit. Their highest player peak was under 50k and the daily peak is like 20k and declining. And looking through the recent reviews on here, it looks like ZOS may be buying positive reviews. Accounts that have not even setup profiles, but go out of their way to review a single game? Yeah that's not questionable at all.Edit 2 months later: My friend with 12000 hours was permabanned. No prior warnings, straight to permanent. He had pretty much stopped playing the game already, so kind of weird to get banned when he had not much game time. He also wrote a negative review on Steam, so it's not surprising to come to the conclusion that my friend was revenge banned by ZOS for the review. I'm probably up next for a ban."
Negative,"The hours you see listed is only a fraction of the time I invested into this game, not including the non steam launcher that I used for many years prior to getting the game on steam which allowed quicker log in.I've invested enough of my life into this game to give a truly honest opinion which is as follows;In the beginning I was hopeful and defended this game even when I knew it was heading in a not-so-great direction, blindly devoted to the hope it could be something better, with the removal of the subscription and the prospect of One Tamriel it seemed somewhat hopeful. Over the years, the game devolved into what one might only call a Cash Farm, The only feature of their game that actually has never broken, and works as intended, is their micro transaction store known as the Crown store. Where you can buy player housing costing a premium price that could net you a brand new release game (15k Crowns, you wont get much change back from £100), or many recoloured re-skinned variants of the same 6 or so mounts and a bunch of other assets they have used on the various content they have produced.Most new content seems to be made of older assets, slopped together in a means to pander to non concurrent players, just to lure fresh players into the cash farm, rather than fixing long, long standing issues for current players. Cyrodill the always laggy open map PvP *cough* and we can't forget the Dungeon Finder, one would think fixing one of the only core utility enabling players to do dungeons together in an mmo, would be more important than making some new re-skin of a pet that does nothing for the low price of 2000 Crowns (£18) or so would be more important, not to them, apparently.So no, I strongly do not recommend The Elderscrolls Online."
Negative,This potentially good review is locked behind a 60$ dlc and will be nerfed in three months anyway
Negative,this was a game now its just a microtransaction disguised as a game
Negative,"Cant recommend the game anymore, uninstalling and cancelling my subscription.. Its been a year of the devs not caring about the players and squeezing them out of every cent, im tired. Broken updates that literally destroy the combat mechanics (for example, not being able to use your shield as a tank) take almost a month to get fixed, but they do still put out a new pet or cosmetic almost every week. Yeah, its not the same team, but if they put the money that goes into a bullshit amount of cosmetics into hiring another dev, thatd be better. but they dont. They act like they care about their community but their coms are almost non-existent and they even have the gall to say the players are being unfair when they call them out on broken updates that nerf everything but the new 2 or 3 things from the new expansion, so that you go and buy it to get the new powerful items. So, to summarize:-Pay to win in the form of artifacts that are released ABSOLUTELY OP-No care about the mechanics (Its like the eighth time they do deep changes to the whole combat mechanics, its been years of beta testing for them and they change and change.-No real new content except for quests. We get a new zone (if you pay for it of course, and you also have to pay your subscription if you want to play the game because if you dont your inventory will fill in 10 minutes, the game becomes a logistics nightmare and you spend more time organizing than you do playing, and you OF COURSE also pay the game, which I think is worth it for the content it offers, but when you add the subscription and paying for expansions, they are nickel and diming every player and its wrong) but thats it. Its been so long since we had a new class.. But they do have the time to make fucking cosmetic animations to sell you even more.-PvP is absolutely destroyed, even tho they fixed some issues with the servers, its just wack and the balance is non-existent-PvE is oriented to catch new players, hook them up, then take a hot dump on their throat when they reach end-game. I'm not saying there isn't toxic end game players, there is, but they keep dumbing down the game and making years worth of effort null and void with changes that NO ONE even asked for, they say they do them because they want the game to be more inclusive and to help new players, yet those same changes complicate things for new players too (Go check the forums on the first combat update of high isle)-They dont care about destroying the balance of the game if they can sell a new toy.. They will put out those aforementioned op items while nerfing everything else, even if it means destabilizing everything the players have learned until then. -They do not seem to have a QA team. EVERY. SINGLE. UPDATE. BREAKS. SOMETHING. I'm fucking tired of having to go check which character I wont be able to use each update because they either made a skill not work or bugged it so hard that if you use the character you would be exploiting a bug, even if you didnt want it, then get banned. Hell... For a month you couldnt fucking tank. Imagine if tanks in wow stopped working for a month. Imagine that. At this point I dont care who I'm blaming, maybe zenimax, maybe bethesda, hell, maybe even microsoft, I really dont care who is fucking up THIS BAD, but it needs to change, the game is losing people left and right and yeah, new people will come in.. But good luck learning end game without raid leads.. Ive been a raid lead for months, helping new people learn the ropes, then everything got nerfed and my work was even harder, I had good people dying because the devs ""forgot"" that healers are important too and that there were heal checks in the game.. Which mathematically couldnt be passed without trial gear.. And you needed to pass that check to get your trial gear.. See the problem? The devs don't play the game at all and act like the end game community is just trash.. The truth is there is some trashy people but the rest of the end game community has been giving this game their all for many years and we are the sole reason why new players can get into trials, because we do them for them, because devs cant be fucking arsed to even make a god damn tutorial of the game for the new players that covers more than the movement and some common keys. They are milking the hell out of the game and its players with 4 different ways of making money, again, game, dlc, subscription and microtransactions (and the game is now also p2w, either beicause of artifacts that you need to buy an overpriced dlc or becuase you can just buy gold with your crowns)For bethesda: Im tired, you destroyed a game I loved and you know what? Good for me, cause I cant keep wasting my time on this, fuck your addictive mechanics, your continuous disrespect for the player base, you carrot on the stick behaviour.. You should be ashamed that you had so much potential and you just didnt have the balls to go against the higher ups that tell you do destroy the game, this new age of short term return on investment is ruining games, im out to play dwarf fortress, see ya."
Negative,"The game is not fundamentally bad, work well with proton on Linux, but has been made frustrating on purpose because... money $$$The publisher of the game voluntarily make the game painful to use because inventory management without paying for the auto-renewed monthly subscription is quite horrible. Having smaller bank for non-subscriber is not great, but what kills the fun is the hundreds of crafting ingredients that are useful to keep around... But if you don't pay monthly for the craft bag, you are in hell. Every time you run out for a quest, you spend a boring amount of time of thinking what you need to throw out of your inventory instead of playing the game.I can deal with paying for the game, paying for the chapters, paying for the DLC, paying (or not) for the gold edition : but needing an auto-renewing monthly payments for not having an on purpose frustrating game is not a game design practice I can stand by !Make crafting bag free and i will change this comment.--------------------Edit : Wow, this review blew up.IMPORTANT UPDATE : a few comments called me or every person sharing the same opinion ""pathetic m*ron"", ""whiny idi*t"", ""lazy"", ""sp*iled brat""... Let me address that real quick : the rumors about unlocking an achievement in the game for flaming me with insults are false. *Flaming other players does not unlock an achievement*. So quit doing that ok ?More seriously, it's totally ok to disagree with my comment and many replies expressed different opinions about that in a respectful way. Thank you ! Please, follow that example when you talk to others (internet or IRL), you will most of the time get a more positive outcome.You could get away with being some amount of disrespectful 99% of the time, but then at one point in your life, it will really matter. You won't know it beforehand but based on how respectful you are, this person will think of you completely differently, this will change your life. At some point in time you will get fired or promoted, you will get appreciated by your peers or cast out, you will get loved or discarded like a level 1 pewter dust molecule. It all trace back to the few moments you gained respect by giving respect, without even noticing it. At one point in your life, maybe you will remember this comment, maybe this will help someone, and ultimately it's a lot more important than crafting bags.I realize i could have worded the original review better and it would have led to a more positive outcome, i'm sure :)This text is not important : Back to crafting bags... Please, be aware that I'm describing my own experience. I understand people really liking the game and getting in the habit to work around the issue by giving up loots, getting an amount of extra slots with easy to get in game credits that allow you to only discard 50% of the materials you collect instead of 70%, creating 9 accounts as a mule, using 3rd party tools, or ""if you dont craft you dont need a crafting bag"" (Roll Safe meme comes to my mind with this last one). It will help some players who can enjoy the game despite this limitations.However, I stand by my comment. It's not an idiotic thing to request good game design. I have played many games with limited inventory, paid a fair price for some space in them (never regretted supporting the game developers) and/or worked around the limits. But ESO+ crafting bag is not just about quantity of stuff you store, it means no time wasting with inventory management. I think i really addressed that particular problem in my original review (that you can read unedited above). I could have been more careful about how it only reflects my own experience, but i thought it was expected that any review express the opinion of it's reviewer. Everyone should play a game because it's fun. For me, the extra amount of time spent doing inventory management is unfun, even with workarounds properly used. You get to try crafting bags during some ESO+ free weeks, so I know the difference.*Renting* a good UX or working around a bad one, neither of those choices looks appealing to me. I compared this experience with the one i get in other games, decided to stop playing ESO, and left this explanation here."
Negative,"Updates in comments.------------------------------It offers nothing new in the sense of what MMOs have been offering since 2008, and for a game that was released in 2014 that is still receiving updates to this day that is not trying to mix up or innovate in that aspect, i think it's pretty bad for it.There's a ton of content to playthrough for sure, but once you put in few tens of hours, you might start noticing that the content just repeats itself but with a different set of fluff and paint, dungeon layouts gets re-used, quest structures are the same, the plot and story for said quests repeats alot, the only few times when it does manage to be original are so few and far apart, or it's in content that would require a dedicated group to even attempt, you don't really notice it otherwise.The balancing is all over the place in the game, some classes and race combinations are sought after more often than others due to how the games mechanics and enemies are balanced, so if you go into this game making a race and class combination that ends up not being as sustainable or worthwhile as others, which you won't notice till after like at least 100 hours into the game, you just end up feeling like you wasted your time because now you have to make another character that can get your job done even better.Then there's the Skill Lines for the Classes, Crafting, Guild and such, all of it does offer a nice variety and selection of things to fiddle around with, but therein lies another problem with this, for you require Skill Points to unlock and improve these Skills and Passives, how do you obtain those? From leveling up to level 50 which gets you 64 Skill Points alone, completing certain quests and activities also rewards you with Skill Points, there are also Sky Shards mapped around each part of the game which in when you collect 3 of them rewards 1 Skill Point, why do i see this as a problem then?Due to the amount of skills and passives that the game offers, just getting the ones you need and want requires a ton of time and effort to have all the Skill Points for the skills and passives, in my experience of nearing almost 400 Hours played, i barely have enough Skill points for the things that are a necessity for my 1 character.In that last you may have noticed how i specified my 1 character, ESO does offer multiple character slots for you to make, however their progress, excluding Champion Points, are all individual, meaning you have to get all sky shards, quests, locations, skills and crafting recipes for your new character individually again, or unless if you pay money for the Crowns that they offer in their Crown StoreThis leads up to my biggest problem with the game, it's monetization, for example, once you find all Sky Shards in a given location, the game advertises that you can now purchase those same Sky Shards for another character, giving them the Skill Point for each 3, the prices on these vary from 150 Crowns to 900 Crowns, so if you spent the time to find all the Sky Shards in the game by the time of me writing this, you could end up paying around 23,000 Crowns to unlock them for 1 of your other characters, that's over 130€ worth of Crowns for that 1 character alone should you buy the Sky Shards.Then there's the DLC and additional content aswell, that also cost Crowns, these things have rewards and places that you can only access if you own them, the combined price for all of the additional content by the time of me writing this, is around 34,500 Crowns, that's around 200€ if you just own the base game and are willing to buy the additional content.But don't worry too much now if the price of the DLC seems like highway robbery (It is), because ESO offers a Subscription model starting at 13€ per month, with this subscription they give you access to all the DLC at once, while also giving you 1500 Crowns for each month that you stay subscribed, this may seem like value for your money, however i'm indifferent to this, because while the subscription does offer those benefits, along with increased experience gains and a ""Craft Bag"" that has unlimited space for materials used in crafting, and the reason why i'm indifferent to this opinion is that, once you start paying for this subscription, it's really easy to get stuck paying with due to needing access to certain content all the time, so if you stop paying for it, you lose access to the content among with the benefits, so you could end up very easily spending more on the subscription than if you were to pay for each DLC and additional content separately in due time.The Crown Store also offers different kinds of other cosmetic stuff for varying prices, but i'm someone who plays games for their gameplay, not to dress up my virtual Barbie doll, so i don't have much of an opinion on here other than the cosmetics being over priced, and how i think it's scummy that some of them can only be obtained from their ""Crown Crates"", they're just lootboxes.Now lets talk about that ""Craft Bag"" i mentioned earlier, if you wish to dabble at crating in ESO, you're going to end up spending alot of time collecting many and variety of resources and materials in the games world, so much so that you will find that even with a fully upgraded Backpack capacity (Yes you do need to spend tons of in-game gold to upgrade the capacity of your Backpack), you're not going to be able to fit all the resources and materials in it, you could store them in your Bank for the time being (Something you can also spend tons of in-game money on to upgrade its capacity), but then you have that slowly filling up till it ends up being full and can't store anything else, however with the ESO+ Subscriptions Craft Bag, all the materials and resources gets stored into its own little section that has unlimited space, this is a problem in my eyes due to the game offering so many different materials and resources that you will feel inclined to get the subscription, this only applies if you're going to be dabbling in the games crafting however, because you can buy the stuff from other players.Zenimax is literally selling you a solution for a problem they came up with.The player driven trading economy, the game offers a form of player trading through its player trading system and Guild Traders, so if you're looking to obtain specific items or gear, you can usually find them from the Guild Traders for a pretty high price usually, depending on how rare or sought after the stuff is, this may seem okay at first glance, however considering that you can kill huge groups of enemies and only be rewarded with a measly amount of gold not even in the triple digits, the only time you may get that much is from completing a quest, when you see that you have to spend nearly 30,000 in-game gold for 1 piece of equipment, it can have a very crushing feeling on you due to how little money the activities in the game itself reward you with, so the only way to make any proper gold in this game is to take part in the player trading economy, whether it's trading directly with other players or joining a Trading Guild with their Trader in a high traffic location (Usually these guilds require you to pay a fee for them to stay as a member there due to how Guild Trading is set up in the game), you're going to have a pretty miserable time obtaining any proper gear as a result, unless if you somehow manage to find yourself in a group that runs Dungeons and Trials regularly that are willing to help you.Then there's the PvP in this game, if you haven't played the game since its release and have many different gears and equipment, don't even bother with it, it's filled with just people who live and breath the mode, so you as a new player will get curb stomped for days on end till you finally manage to obtain at least decent PvP gear.So with all that, i can finally say, that i can't recommend this game."
Negative,"-EDIT-On the 25th of March,1 month after my purchase and after being rejected for 4 times (and not asking for a refund for the 5th time) steam just magically decided to refund me the game, out of nowhere! Now why did they do this now and not when I asked them to do for 4 times, I don't really know, but i have a strong guess: this review getting over 1500 upvotes and ESO being on a free weekend, so this reivew has hurt ESO's reputation very, very badly.So well, yeah, you can get a refund eventhough you have more than 2+ play time if you point out the fact that you have been downloading 140GBs for 17 hours. But there is one slight problem: If you don't have a review rocketing over 1500 upvotes chances are you are not getting a refund ;) However, I thank the people on steam for atleast looking at the reviews and giving some damn about us, sincerely, thank you. (If you wish to know what caused all this, you are free to read below)Warning!If you play this game and do not like it, there are NO REFUNDS.That is because as of 24.02.2018, steam downloads 66 GBs on it's own, after that download is finished, ESO's own launcher opens up and downloads 80 MORE GBs, and all the time this 2nd download counts towards your in-game time since the launcher is working. And unless you have NASA level internet speed, you will exceed the 2 hour refund limit without even playing the game. I asked for a refund from steam, not once or twice but for 3 times, I explained them the 2nd download situation - tons of topics about that on the internet btw so they KNOW it- and I don't even think they read my emails, my tickets, or anything. SO  be cautious, watch a lot of youtube videos instead of trying to play the game, or you'll have just fed the monster more $$$ for a game you might not like."
Negative,"I used to love this game. i have spent over 400 hours in this game. Multiple characters and spent more than i would like to admit on crowns. Because the game used to be good, and i felt like i was supporting that. But in all honestly i was contributing to a greater problem. This game has become nothing more than a cash grab. the quality of the content has gone down hill and they care very little for quality of life applications. Everything in the crown store, including the crowns themselves, is over priced. which makes it no surprise that the in-game currency has lost its value exponentially. Forced and unnecessary rarity of resources breed toxic behavior, and with pricing of items, including those needed for common crafting skyrocketing to astronomic proportions makes it as much or more of a grinding slog to acquire the money than it is to get the actual items. Also inventory space is locked behind a paywall, either with large amounts of in-game money or with actual money, and any attempt to dedicate to any crafting is impossible without the extra space locked behind the monthly pass subscription. Simply put, the game is designed to be unplayable without sinking endless funds into dwindling phoned in content."
Negative,"Great game which I just came back to after some time off, unfortunately to discover they changed the privacy policy while I was away. Definitely not buying any DLCs or ESO plus, as you can get the extra money by selling my personal info instead.Sells your personal info to anyone with the cash, including: ""username, name, demographics and other characteristics or descriptions, email, address, telephone number, and other contact information, account credentials, communications preferences, billing and payment information"". Change the privacy policy if you want a positive review, and also give me some compensation for this breach of trust (not a refund, actual COMPENSATION for copy and pasting my personal details all over the internet). Pretty annoyed that I paid for this, for you to later decide it wasn't enough and try to get that extra cash out of my personal details too.Update: Yes, I still play the game as pointed out by the commenters, no I won't be supporting them by purchasing ESO Plus which I might otherwise have happily purchased, or the DLCs. I expect free games to sell my information, not subscription services - especially when they aren't that cheap. But the free version will keep me ticking over until ES6 arrives."
Negative,"So, I've thought long and hard about this, and I can say now, without a doubt, that I do not recommend this game.Let's start with the pros to playing this game.+The Story The game does, for the most part, have an engaging storyline. At least in my opinion. Without going into detail and spoiling anything, if you like the side quests in skyrim, you'll like the story and playing through the zones in this game.+The Crafting SystemWith crafting motifs and different materials and upgrades available, the crafting system is an indepth and interesting system. From alchemy allowing you to mix and match different reagents in different ways, from enchanting giving you an interactive experience in creating your runes, if you are a crafter, you'll find a way to fill out your niche in this game.+The AtmosphereThis game has an atmosphere unique to the elder scrolls series and you'll see all the familiar sights and some new things as you explore the world. Whether you enjoy playing as an argonian in the swamps of the black marshes, or you prefer being a wood elf in the great forests, you can experience all the different scenery of the elder scrolls series and their respective moods.+VisualsThe game looks pretty appealing, visually. This does come with the drawback of some heavier processing requirements. And now, we get to the negatives of this game, and some of them are fatal flaws I cannot forgive.-The CombatThe combat system is clunky. Swapping between bars in combat has a brief period where you cannot do anything, and its just long enough to feel irritating for me.Combat feels samey in all respects, with no fights standing out in regards to uniqueness or mechanics.Unless theres a major combat overhaul, I don't foresee myself ever getting any interest in the game again. Its plain boring.Even with the stunning mechanics, all enemies feel like meat sponges for you to inflict numbers onto.There's no satisfying feedback when you pull a big attack off. And this point leads into another.-Class IdentityAt some core point in the game, when you finish leveling multiple characters, you find yourself settling into a rotation.If you wish to perform decently well at endgame, you will discover that for stamina characters, the rotation is almost exactly the same on other classes as it is for the class you started out with in the beginning.Tanking is the same way, with your abilities all feeling similar to another one in another classes kit.And Magicka dps, unfortunately, falls into the same trap.Magicka dps even feels similar to Stamina dps, you buff yourself before the fight, you lay down your aoe abilities, then start applying dots. Its the same old song and dance for each character.Some of the classes are even difficult to determine which is which until you see their ultimates, which ultimately do the same thing as another classes, but with a different skin.-DirectionThere's no clear direction to go with in this game. Sure, you can fall into all the same trappings as other mmos, trying to hit the level cap, and all that jazz.I made it to CP220~ish, and I can tell you that every level beyond CP10 has felt hollow and empty.The way that gear scaling works in this game, it makes acquiring gear only an imperative need once you get to a point where it isn't hitting as hard as it needs to, or giving you the mitigation that you need.The scaling system takes a lot of the wind out of the sails of the progression in this game.A lvl 30 set of gear is sufficient to level all the way to 50.Not to mention the fact that there is no unique gear to shoot for aside from monster sets and some of the arena rewards, but they don't provide anything but some number boosts, rather than a unique mechanic to base a playstyle off of.You also make your own legendary gear.This may sound cool, but upgrading a piece of common gear all the way to legendary literally only makes numbers higher.It doesn't impart any interesting or unique benefits. Its just a path from making a 10 become a 12.-Skill ProgressionSkills are necessary in every mmo. So why does achieving new skills in this game have to be such a drag.Half of the time, you don't even use them to gain the new skills in the tree, you just have them slotted in the bar while you wait to use the skill you actually want. It's not interesting, or fun to have to wait to use a skill because you haven't leveled a tree that only has boring skills on the path to the one you want.Guilds are one of the biggest sore thumbs sticking out in regards to this system.Grinding for the Mages Guild ultimate took a serious effort, and the end payoff wasn't anywhere worth the time I put into getting it.The fighters guild is the same way. You need to kill a stupid amount of creatures to rank your Fighters guild up, for something that will only marginally benefit you.This isn't the straw in the camels back for me, but it definitely doesn't help with my urge to play the game when I make a new character I have to wait for an inordinate amount of experience to use a skill in a tree I want. If you're someone like I am, someone who likes to make alternate characters in order to see everything thats available to you, to play and enjoy, then these issues only stick out more and more on each successive leveling.This game is just tedious. Like a grindstone slowly wearing away the edge of a knife.Maybe some people can let the game sand them down enough to enjoy it, but I can't. Frankly, I've done everything I can to give this game a proper go. I've tried the pvp, leveled multiple characters to 50, hit 200+ in the CP, crafted as much as I can, explored plenty, and I still find myself asking""Why am I still playing this game.""Needless to say, I do not recommend this game. Thank you for reading this if you made it this far."
Negative,"Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will ""sell"" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really."
Negative,"Don't let the low pricetag fool you, you're basically forced to pay a subscription or dump cash into the game at some point, the $20 into is to lure you in, and once you're invested, you're going to get slapped.This game is plagued by completely unethical business practices, at every corner they're jabbing you for more and more money.ESO Plus: - You get a ""Stipend"" of 1650 crowns for subscribing, which is about $15. This is mental trickery. You're paying for crowns, and being given access to things you -should have access to in the first place-. IE: Crafting Bag, More Storage, old DLC/dungeons, ect.- Game is ""Buy to Play"" but you have to either buy the DLC areas, or subscribe to ESO Plus to ""unlock"" (most) of them without having to back-pay. If you want to permanently unlock these additions, it's ~$15-$35 each. About $350 worth at a -modest- estimate. Not only do you have to pay for old expansions. You have to pay for modules (such as the thieves guild) and dungeons.- ESO Plus doesn't include the newest expansion, so tack on another $40-$60So that's ESO Plus, that doesn't even touch the cash shop and other poor practices. Here's some more.- There's 3 alliances, dictated by what race you play. Unless you pay $20 for the any race any alliance upgrade, you're stuck in that alliance. This only counts for PvP anymore, but when the game came out, it mattered a lot.- Appearance ($10), Alliance ($25), or Name/Race Changes ($25-$35) are all horribly, horribly priced.- You can't trade cash shop currency/crowns with other players. You can ""Gift"" packs of crowns to other people. This has resulted in a network of scamming where people wish to pay others ingame currency for cash shop currency, and get ripped off/scammed.- The mount system is -garbage-. In other MMO's they scale all mounts to the best one you have (on that character). In ESO, you have to ""train"" your mount skills. Per Character. They sell shortcuts for this arbitrary grind in the cash shop.- Want to do crafting? They sell shortcuts for that grind too.- Mobile Banker / Merchant? $50 a piece.- Cosmetic outfit slots? Sorry, those are per-character only. They're also $15 a piece.- Player Housing is a mixed bag, because some stuff can be purchased ingame, and other stuff can only be bought with crowns.- Player housing crafing benches? $30 a piece, and it can only be used in one house.- Endless amounts of cosmetic mounts/outfits/pets.TL:DR for all the MTX in this game.[/b]Arbitrarily small bank/character storage you can pay/subscribe to increase or improve? ☑Inability to trade premium currency between players easily? ☑Per-character upgrades that -should- be account-wide? ☑Cash shop items to skip grinding? ☑Expensive player housing items? ☑Rotating deals in the storefront? ☑Overpriced convenience items? ☑Normal Mounts/Cosmetics? ☑Lootboxes? ☑Honestly, if it weren't for the horrible, horrible monitisation, I'd love this game. I love running around as a cat person or lizard, actually playing things in-character with friends, and learning about the Elder Scrolls universe, but, it's just too greedy.*Appended Edit* 12/8/20A lot of people have been coming to this review, saying none of these things are ""necessary"" to play the game. That isn't the point of this review. This review is to warn people that this game sells an -insane- amount of microtransactions, a lot of which are time-skips or solutions for systems they put in place.If you can look past all the money grubbing, and just want to play a game set in the Elder Scrolls universe, you might be fine. Grab a subscription and go for it. This game -does- have some pretty good quests, and tons of lore, but the main point this review is this: The price you pay is the just the entrance fee, and they're going to be asking for a lot more.People are wired differently. Some people can completely ignore MTX. Some people don't care how their character looks as long as they can pump big numbers in raids, but personally, the -sheer amount- of stuff they have for sale in this game keeps me away from it. The cash shop is pushed in your face on every log-in. It takes months to max out your mount on -each- character. Things that -should- be account-wide, are not. The -worst- thing out of it all, is that you can't trade other players crowns, they can only be gifted, and that's a big giant rotten scam."
Negative,"This game is decent if all you're interested in is the world, lore, and questing. The game's world is amazing, and there's hours upon hours of quests to get through, if you're into that sort of thing. I say I don't recommend it because once you realize doing anything more than exploring and questing ends up being quite a struggle, interest in sticking with the game tends to fade fast, in my personal experience. The cash shop appears fair enough until you play for a while, then you realize how predatory it really is. Most of the things in it are cosmetic, which is fine, but they constantly use FOMO (fear of missing out) to try to coerce players into buying things, and most of the more interesting stuff they place behind their crate gacha/gambling system.The game is pretty much impossible to play without paying for the monthly subscription. Sure, you can do it, but if you want to have any bank/inv space (the game floods your inventory with numerous crafting materials you can store in a separate bag with the paid service), or play any of the dlc without shelling out a good amount of money to buy it all, you won't be able to fully enjoy the game as a long term player. Several aspects of the game are only really accessible if you are able to join and maintain membership in a successful guild. You are unable to sell items to other players in game unless you are in one of the big trading guilds, most of the end game dungeon and raid content is closed off to people who don't have serious guilds to run content with, as the public group finder for this content has a long history of being difficult to work with or downright broken. On top of all this, the game has several long standing bugs and glitches that affect gameplay, and the devs of this game seem like they're always too busy pumping out new dlc and cash shop gambling cosmetics to spend the time/resources to fix them. They will even sell things in their cash shop that are directly affected by these bugs, an example being the ""personalities"" that they sell, which changes the style of your character's walk, jog and sprint animations in-game. What they don't tell you is you won't see these animations under certain circumstances, such as if you use a keyboard to move and don't have the mid range of movement speed that a controller offers, or if you build too much movement speed on your character these animations will break and not play at all, even though you've paid to have them. This is one example, but there are numerous bugs and glitches that stay in the game for long periods of time, and it just seems really unprofessional to me, as this game is run by a big company that should have the resources to fix stuff like this. Just dumb stuff like animation bugs, weapons getting stuck in your hands, clipping into the floor when you try to sheathe them, it's really immersion breaking and it's been one of the major things that put me off of playing this game for any real length of time.I have played this game for a while and while there are things I like about it, I also have a lot of problems with it, and I won't seriously recommend it to people as a good MMO experience. I would suggest playing this if you want to experience more of the Elder Scrolls world and lore, or if you like running around and doing quests for NPCs."
Negative,"Storage space ""mechanic"" exists solely to force you into a subscription.  Just as annoying as FO76."
Negative,"It suffers from the typical MMORPG issue of the quests being lame and long. I struggled to find my immersion. There are a couple worthwhile story-lines and areas, and a handful of well-written lore, but the vast majority is trite nonsense content. To be expected with MMORPGs, I suppose. The exceptions to this rule are:The Clockwork CityMorrowindThe DeadlandsNecromSummersetThe ""Overland"" content is a joke. Not a single challenge. The dialogue and stories are largely hammy, soulless, and often miss the point.The written lore is 15% good, 85% droning.Truly a shame considering the Franchise.Some very high quality voice work, though. A+The most recent ""expansion"" has a fitting name.ZOS might as well say what they expect from this game. They find every way to entice you to pay for store content. They have a LEGION of players who drop tons of money on, say, a chair or painting for their house. A 'flashy' mount. A face tattoo. A different colored crab pet. There you are, likely thinking, ""Well you can just ignore it, this guys bent out of shape over nothing,"" and you may be right, but to that I say: In your weakest moment, late on a Saturday night, after you actually had fun with your guild trying to finish that trial on hard mode, and maybe you've had a little bit of your favorite medicine, and that one mount in the store looks really cool... I hope I've made my point. To make matters worse, that mount is more than likely in ZOS's monthly Crate. Meaning, to ""purchase"" it you have to drop real money to receive a minuscule chance at getting it. If you don't, you'll have to spend anywhere from ~$200 to ~$400 (maybe more) to get enough crates to hopefully get enough items to then break down into 'gems' to then spend an inhumane amount of them on that one mount. Furthermore, if you spend, say $100 on crates and don't get what you wanted, you'll have to bank those gems, buy more crates when you can, and hope you do this in a month's time since you won't get the chance again for ~6 more months (or more...or never). Gambling is practically the only way to get that mount, and they motivate you to do so with every psychological trick in the book. You know in other similar games when you spent all that time doing various time-consuming tasks in order to complete a rare achievement so you can get that really cool, mostly unique, thing? Well, you're not going to find that here. The only animated effect mounts are in the store. The raddest pets are in the store. The best homes are in the store. The coolest costumes are in the store. 90% of these items are on a monthly rotation that follows no discernible schedule and require you to gamble.Yes, there are still ""prized"" things to achieve. There are a few for Exploration, Crafting, and Fishing. Some Veteran Trial/Dungeon achievements provide decent cosmetic goodies. There are 5 quest-lines that end in getting various homes. I could count the things I found worth it on one hand though. Don't get me started on Seals of Endeavor...This currency is supposedly to stop naysayers like me from complaining about the store by offering a way to purchase your favorite shiny trinket (provided it is available that month) with in-game currency you can earn. But let me tell you, with 3k hours under my belt, and a concerted effort to gain these seals, I was never able to actually purchase a single top-tier mount, which are the only ones worth purchasing, I'd argue. I had one friend with more hours and dedication that managed to purchase a single top-tier mount.ZOS should, and probably does, hold a masterclass on: ""How To Create Whales, and Milk Them""Truly they could teach Vegas Casinos a thing or two.If you were to critically analyze the ""Good Content"" vs the ""Bad Content"" in PvE, I believe most would agree (even current players) that its a 10/90 split. The fun in the game comes from joining endgame guilds and socializing, which, I realized at some point, was the only reason I continued playing.I'd argue, in fact, that it is required to join an endgame guild and socialize in order to even attempt the hard modes.Quick preface to show I am qualified to understand the concepts that follow this section: I have led hundreds of Trials/Dungeons from normal to veteran hard-modes, and formed a couple guilds over my playtime to successfully complete a good deal of the end-endgame. I was a raid lead in 6 guilds, and held scheduled trials twice weekly. I had it down to a science with how to get my trial group through a trial quickly, efficiently, enjoyably, and to completion. I have every class leveled to max with endgame gear. I have participated as every role in all the content...I primarily played PvE content. Nothing in the following section is geared towards PvP endgame content.I would like to point out a glaring mega-con that many of the people I am about to call out will inevitably tell me I just have a ""skill-issue"". I'll let you be the judge of it:The DPS role is a joke. There is a certain point where you realize that you cannot get the harder, more important, content done unless you reach a certain threshold of DPS. Hey! This is fine, that is every MMORPG! Dear reader, get ready to hit that ""hot take"" button. Let me introduce you to the concept of ""Light Attack Weaving"".The premise is simple: Put a light attack in-between every skill cast you make. Sounds easy, right? Wrong. Particularly on keyboard, the input timing is so strict and erroneous that unless practiced heavily, you will never achieve the level necessary to step into the easiest of endgame dlc veteran content.Your rotational damage primarily comes from your light attack, NO MATTER YOUR CLASS. The recent addition of Arcanist had attempted to fix this, and allowed people like me to finally be able to join harder end-game content as DPS instead of being locked into a support role. But of course, the fun was short-lived. Whilst this is still a viable class, it continues to get nerfed in the name of balance, or perhaps in the name of appeasing the Elite Jerkwads who think because they had to practice for hours days on a training dummy to get their LA Weave perfect that you should have to suffer in kind. LA weaving DOES NOT WORK for my brain, and I am not the only one. The concept is simple, but it takes an incredible amount of practice for the average player to achieve a modicum of the DPS necessary to enjoy Hardmode Trials/DLC Dungeons as a DPS player. NO ONE can say that they 'had fun' doing this, and not be trolling. All this can be avoided by being a support role, but I am sure seasoned MMORPG players understand the downside to always being the Tank or Healer. Further, far more often than not, the DPS role is: Stand in the right spot, do your dps. Move when needed to avoid mechanics. Whereas the Tanks and Healers are required to know everything about the mechanics and make sure the DPS take care of business as safely as possible. 9/10 times your raid lead will be a support, and they will be primarily herding your DPS around.I recently uninstalled and since then I have had a much more enjoyable time playing various other games instead of being glued to a single one that doesn't respect my time or wallet (or maybe respects them too much). I write this review in order to hopefully save at least one person from buying into this and wasting 3k hours of their life, and possibly thousands of your local currency. More info in the comments...Not enough space to fit it in review."
Negative,"I've already spent much time on the game and enjoyed the time I had, but I can't recommend it in the state the game is right now. The development team/management seem to be too worried about making new content and make money out of it, instead of improving the base game. On top of it, its monetization model is a total shame compared to other MMOs on the market. In ESO you HAVE to pay for an ESO+ Membership in order to have fun (otherwise, you will frustrate yourself spending most of your time just managing your inventory and bank); the cool new mounts they showcase on their social media are just obtainable with real money (crowns); If you are not ESO+ Member you have to pay for each of the DLCs they offer (they launch 3 DLCs EACH YEAR, adding little payable content); the differentiation between DLCs and chapters are very confusing for new players; the base game does not include all the previous chapters (you have to buy them all separately or pay more for the whole upgrade); AND FINALLY, one of the most frustrating aspects of the game is that there's no difficulty selection for the overland content, so every monster you kill or fight throughout the map will be easy to kill (your level doesn't matter, it just can make it be even easier).So yeah, I have many hours played and I love the game and its potential, but I cannot recommend it because I don't think they are fair with their playerbase. I hope they start paying attention to reviews."

There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really."
Negative,"I really don't know how to articulate why, after 1400 hours over 3-4 years, I don't recommend this game but here's a Good vs Bad. MMO wise I've played GW2, WoW, FF14, and New World at an endgame level.PVE SIDEThe Good:-Huge zones with a ton of quests to do. You are constantly fed rewards through experience and skill points for doing literally ANYTHING. If you're a completionist, you will have well over 500 hours worth of just exploration.-Skills and builds, on a casual level, are fun to play around with. This will bleed into the bad...-A progression system that rewards you post max level without giving you too much of an advantage... but more on the bad sideThe Bad Combat (gets its own subsection): -If you want to play casually, its.... OKAY. The hits don't feel impactful like New World or Dark Souls and can be very 'floaty'. -On a DPS Meter level: The skillcap between your 'average player' and an ESO 'meta slave' is so incredibly high that you can have 2 identical characters with the same exact stats and they will perform on 2 extreme levels. The casual will struggle to pull 10k DPS, while the ESO ""Vet"" Will be doing 100k dps and it bleeds into both PVP and PVE. -To tie into the previous point, the main factor behind this is something called weaving, better known as animation canceling. This is something that ESO has never addressed after 5 plus years. You essentially break your cast animations by either bar swapping, rolling, or attack canceling at just the right time to essentially DOUBLE your combat tempo. -Doing this, and i have on veteran dungeons and raids to 120k dps, is so unfun that it makes FF14s black mage rotation seem simple. its awful, its not explained or naturally incorporated in the game, and is dependent on your system hardware. If you want to push content on an MMO, this is not it.The Bad (Everything Else)-The abiility to make your own build? Sure, if youre a 'filthy casual'. Endgame requires your to study spreadsheets and find the right set and skills. Everyone in PVP and veteran raids has the same cookie cutter build for each class.-The progression flat out sucks. How the game works, rather than scaling in the way that WoW or FFXIV does it, the game ""upscales"" you to max level. Every enemy has the same HP and damage for all players and aside from gear sets and learning new abilities, your damage never really goes up. In fact, as you level up, your current gear actively scales down and gets worse so you actually get weaker unless youre feeding yourself constant upgrades.-The PVP is flat out awful due to the lack of content developed for it and the aforementioned combat. Even if you are good at pvp in general and have the awareness, the skillcap is worse than Chivalry. You can play against an animation canceling exploiter who has the same stats as you and they can completely global you. There's also no rating or progression for arenas.-P2W? The game toys with the Pay-To-Win formula of incentivizing you to spend cash. Nearly every point of progression in the game can be paid for. Dont want to wait 2 months to upgrade your mount speed? (which requires logging in every single day) Well for $20 in purchases you can have a maxed out mount. Want to have more bag space? Well we have a membership that essentially becomes a requirement for anything other than the basest casual and bagspace purchases. Nearly everything is monetized asides the barebones starter game.Overall - Decent time killer but I could never recommend making this ""your MMO"" and believe me I tried and wanted to so bad but I cant."
Negative,"I have several thousand hours into this game, so I think my opinion might hold some weight to some people. I will start off by saying the good things about this game, the reasons why i started playing in the first place, the reasons I have thousands of hours into the game, the reasons why I am giving this product a thumbs down after all this time, finally followed by the reasons why I quit. I will keep it brief yet detailed as I can. This game has fantastic visuals, character customization, and environments to explore. That being said, the quests are intriguing, stick with original lore of Elder Scrolls while adding fresh content to the stories, and keep you entertained. They are more than ""fetch this for me, take it to another person, gather 10 of this."" There is content there.The multiplayer experience is average of an MMO, but personally, as being the leader of several guilds and a member of countless others, this community is one of the least toxic I've encountered. There is lots of inclusive people with open minds and good hearts, Ive met some friends on there that even tho we dont play ESO together anymore, we send Christmas cards to each other. Social is A+Let's get to the bad. If you enjoy having thousands of hours into a game with virtually nothing to show for it, then this is the game for you. MEANING: all my skins, emotes, houses, (housing system has severe pros and cons I don't have the time to address in full detail, but I will say that each house in the crown store costs $100 each) and titles were GAMBLED. If you want an in-game skin, you have to buy it. If you want an in-game house, you have to buy it. WITH REAL MONEY. Sure, that's fine, why not support a ""free-to-play"" title? Except that it's not, not entirely.Let's delve into the ""free-to-play"" lie that they slap on their title. You have to buy the base game, every major dlc at almost a triple A title price, and if you truly want to have a stress-free experience and not have to sell items or find measly storage in your bank, which costs a small fortune to upgrade to a meaningful level, you can purchase ESO plus! You'll get basic mechanics found in other games for the low, low price of $15 A MONTH. They add dungeons and smaller scale content that you can get access to buy purchasing eso plus. This EXCLUDES major dlcs like Morrowind and Summerset, for example. That's all fine and well, I've bought my game, I bought my dlcs, I bought my ESO plus. So what? It's worth it right? The amount of content in the game.... Yes, there is a lot of quests and areas to explore. You're in this deep already with money, you've been playing, how do you get all these cool mounts and pets and skins that you see others in? Oh, right. You must purchase crown crates.Crown crates. Holding items of value you want, at a percentage of a chance to obtain them, with no indication of what that chance is. You could spend 20$ and get that mount you wanted! Yay! Praise the RNGesus! Or, you could spend hundreds, and still not get that skin you wanted. Sure, you could convert items you already have into yet another currency to spend in their store, but that is only obtained through buying Crown crates. In recent dev blogs they have explicitly stated new content will be available through the crown store, or through crown crates. There are some really cool titles and skins to earn in-game.I had a max level character, unkillable in pvp. My toon did unbelievable damage for their class. And still finding a group to do a Trial (essentially a raid) with 12 players of equal skill to complete the challenges to earn said titles and skins was nearly impossible. People have lots of paid runs where they will carry players, either costing exorbitant amounts of gold in the process or real money which is against ToS. Good luck getting those skins naturally, and some of them aren't even close on the scale of ""Coolness"" when compared to skins they expect you to gamble for. They're just skins, so what? I don't need cosmetics. Okay, that's fine. You know how they boast about being ""One Tamriel""? That's only true if you buy the upgrade in the crown store. You want to make a Dunmer in alliance with the Altmer? Sorry. gotta pay another 15$ to do this. Okay that's fine, I'll just stick with the alliance my race is associated with by default, not a SUPER big deal.... At least there aren't any paid potions or scrolls to make you level super fast or anything? Right? Right? Cause wouldn't that be pay to win?Right?!I repeat, this MMO is HEAVY ON PROMOTING GAMBLING.As a final note, please keep in mind this game is published by Bethesda, not developed by. Zenimax Studios has full control over their monetization, not Bethesda. Bethesda themselves and Zenimax (on their Twitch live-streams) have stated that they are separate studios entirely, albeit they have rights to the ""Elder Scroll"" name through Bethesda. To be more clear: They are a separate studio not entirely owned by Bethesda, just working WITH Bethesda. Even FO76 has a way better monetization system. (albeit not that great, but still 100 times better than ESO's) If you enjoy throwing money like hundreds of thousands of other people at developers who despite all their greediness, still cannot add any meaningful end-game content that is not stuck behind a pay wall. But hey. I only have about 3800 hours into this game, and have spent countless dollars to feel cool or was pressured into it by their horrible monetization system, which I can only imagine would translate to younger people not so well, so either take my word for it, or don't. There are better MMO's out there with better monetization. I hope this helps."
Negative,"I loved the game dearly, there's some really great content there however I found the grind a little tiresome to justify ESO+ at the moment, thus comes the major gripe, so now I've left the subscription model, despite purchasing High Isle at £32 (and a few releases before) I cannot access the dungeons for the DLC I've purchased without spending a futher £11 or continue paying the subscription? Maybe I've missed something somewhere, but if you purchase a DLC, it shouldn't be pay-locked further still."
Negative,Don't bother buying this game if you don't want to pay for the ESO+ subscription. It's that simple.
Negative,"I logged on recently after not having played for 2 years.Upon inspecting my inventory I found over half of my collectibles to be missing, a lot wardrobe and mounts. And a home went missing as well. (Yes, I tried entering it regardless and it didn't work, next patch though amirite?) All were purchased from the crown store or with crown gems.This was 20+ collectibles missing so I sent a ticket.They told me ""It's almost impossible for collectibles to go missing"" - LizForeshadowing their plans to be unhelpful in the endeavor to recover my missing items.Also if it's ""almost"" then it's possible.The final ticket they sent a response that said ""Unfortunately, I was not able to to find any other record of the other collectibles you mentioned on your account. You will have to redeem those items as they become available"" - RossThey were not transparent with the records that they do have. I asked them on three different occasions if they had any receipts of my purchases but was ignored every single time.If they did indeed have these records then this situation wouldn't have been an issue and I would be given back my missing items. The amount of crowns I have spent don't correlate with the items I have currently.Hundreds of dollars and hundreds of hours spent on this game to have my items I spent real money on to go missing without an explanation.Do I recommend this game? No. Not with the possibility that you'll have to pay for their mistakes. Like they suggested I do.I regret my investment into this game and company. It's as if you were to invest in a company and you found your shares disappeared  and your broker told you that they couldn't locate your shares as well as not having a proper way to store or keep track of those shares, instead told you to just buy those shares again. Effectively putting the responsibility onto you for their incompetence. It's an unacceptable business practice.In my experience, they are unwilling to fix their mistakes, unwilling to offer transparency, and willing to take from their customers.There's also the insincere communication towards players, poorly managed pvp, outdated game engine, bugs and glitches, lag and control issues, and horrible servers that have plagued the game for years yet they claim to just start fixing it now.Don't buy or invest your valuable time and money into this game. Personally, I'm done with Elder Scrolls. Thank you for reading.TLDR; In short I don't like the company"
Negative,"I want to like this game, I really do, it has so much potential and it really feels like I'm in the Elder Scrolls universe sometimes. It has a wide range of content and appeal for players of multiple skill levels. The community is generally pretty nice too.I'm not here to talk about questionable balance or gameplay design choice. If you're considering buying this please know that the monetisation model is complete and utter dogsh*t.  Buy to play - subscribe for quality of life improvements (lmao) and DLC.  No sub no DLC, unless you buy each DLC individually in the crown store.  If you want cosmetics you'll more than likely have to participate in the awful lootbox system. It just sucks! Which brings me to the real letdown with this game which is the incompetentency of the devs. If you get invested in this game prepare to bang your head against the never ending wall of connection issues and bugs.  This is especially bad on EU servers.  Every update, tweak, chapter release, stupid in-game event they do renders the game unplayable.  This is not an exaggeration and it has got to the point where the European community have taken to jokingly calling the game the Elder Scrolls Offline.  If you see a 2 hour maintenance announcement it is likely that this actually means 6+ hours with a plethora of issues once the server comes up again.  If you do manage to get past char selection (if you're lucky) prepare for never ending loading screens when you try to switch zones or walk through a door, problems with dungeon finder, partying, in game chat, input lag, combat desyncs. If you visit the forums during any major update you'll find so many people who are just fed up. The most recent example of this was the release of the Greymoor chapter and on release day neither me nor anyone in my guilds could get on at all. I quit the game a few months ago and on return it really feels like nothing has changed.This has been my experience and the experience of my friends on the EU server as someone who has been playing since about a month prior to Elsweyr release.  Probably the worst period I can remember was the 2019 halloween event which had such widespread connection issues they had to extend the event by a significant period.  The amount of day to day bugs from a big AAA MMO - which I've noticed mostly in their 4 person content - is also pretty astounding.  Stuff like having to spam click the queue button (like really spam click it) before it lets you queue, bugged aggro making it unable to go through doors, enemies clipping through walls, stuck audio.  My personal fave is Wayrest Sewers as it seems to reliably bug out for someone every time we queue into it.  It just makes the whole experience feel really half-assed and its pretty funny for a while but then you realise its been happening for 1 year plus...If your plan is to buy this game and not pay another dime more you'll be pretty much limited to questing (which, in their defense is the one thing they really nailed IMO, if you've played a Scrolls game before you can expect something similar). If you do want to get serious about raiding, end game, crafting you'll have to cough up in order to farm passable gear.Its embarrassing in this day and age that you consistently can't access a product that you are paying for and its a real damn shame because I really love this game and I've met some amazing people through it. My advice?  Play a different MMO and invest your money elsewhere if you want to play something long term.  The game asks way too much from its customers for the online service it provides.EDIT: More thoughts, formatting"
Negative,"Going to be clear and concise, this is not the typical Elder Scrolls game that you are probably expecting.It's different.It has the same feel and tone, but it lacks in immersion.The gameplay is bland, the characters are forgettable, the graphics are decent. It's your typical MMO. I really want to enjoy this game though.  I've played thousands of hours on the ES series and ESo somewhat fixes what has been lacking. However, it has forgotten what made Elder Scrolls what it is."
Negative,"I've been playing this game for 4-5 years and I can safely say that this game is a rat wheel. It will suck you in. You won't be able to enjoy other games as much. It's like being in a love & hate relationship. It's also expensive. you WILL spend many dollars to play the game properly. Its subscription system, ESO+ is predatory. It locks you out of certain game features that should've been in the base game. Inventory management really sucks. You have to pay for an ""expansion"" ever year which is actually a glorified DLC (that should've been included in your ESO+ plan)."
Negative,"I love ESO. One of my favourite games ever. Great class / build diversity, good PvE content, fast and slow options for leveling so everyone can take their own pace, really nice visuals, typically fantastic scoring (Elder Scrolls music is always good), good crafting, nice housing, just... good. It really is, I love it.Sadly, I can't recommend it though. Not as an Australian consumer. There's no OCE server, so the best ping I can get to the game is 250+ and it's just not conducive to a good gaming experience. Especially not when timed blocking / interrupting / dodging (the whole combat system) is concerned. If they ever add an Oceanic server, or find a way to connect international servers like WoW does so everyone can play with low ping, I'll be back in a heartbeat.If you live in the U.S. or in the EU, you'll have a phenomenal time with this game if you like a good MMO."

Negative,"There is a review by someone named Vaaluin who has it spot on but he doesn't have the hours that I do in this game. I actively steer my friends away from ESO. The game is beautiful, fun, incredible soundtrack, absolutely engrossing in every way but it is dangerously predatory, in a way that should honestly be illegal. You have to pay for this game, pay for a subscription to get access to very important features, pay a minimum of $40 a year to get the newest expansion, and they have micro transactions to get most of the aesthetically pleasing items in the game. Not to mention, on top of all the money you put into this game, it will still require an unreal amount of time to get some of the best items functionally. Even if you don't care about any of that, you can make it through all of the solo content in this game and a good chunk of group content just to find out that you basically don't even know how to play because you can't do 80-100k DPS or whatever because the game does a terrible job of gradually upping the difficulty or explaining the deeper mechanics and how to get good at this game....but thats getting too deep, Just know this game consumes your life and money in a way that makes it uncomfortable to think about or recommend, if you are a teenager with a job, absurdly strict parents, and can't do anything else, try it at your own risk. Everyone else...Please don't put the time I have into this game. Its not worth it."
Negative,"I want to say, this game gets a lot of things right; it has a rich story world, and the way the classes work is really interesting. However, there are aspects that keep me from enjoying it fully. It doesn't mean that you can't have fun with this game.The first aspect to consider is the MMO part of this game. There are lots of players everywhere, and the game feels well-populated. However, there is little to no interaction with these people. The majority of them are minding their own business and do not react or respond to you. In a dungeon, the only conversation you might have is a 'hi' at the beginning and a 'bye' at the end. There is no real interaction. Even if you try to talk to them, they ignore you, or you might get a 'shut up and play, we need to finish this in 10 minutes.' The same is true in the open world. No one seems interested in interacting with a random stranger. You might attempt the same open dungeon or a quest with a stranger, and they may refuse a party invite. It doesn't feel like an MMORPG. Instead, other players feel like better NPCs living in the world.Also, the questing doesn't really fit with group play. I tried to play this game with friends, and the questing experience was horrible. Not everything counts for all members, and when a quest has different dialogues with different tasks, it can quickly happen that the same quest you and your friend are on becomes different. It feels more like the game doesn't want you to do this in a group, and this, in an MMORPG, is really strange.The next aspect is the difficulty, or rather, the lack thereof. This is a shame, as the world design is incredibly good, and the level designers did a fantastic job. However, the perceived dangers of this world are not reflected in the actual difficulty of the game. It's nearly impossible to die. You can run through all the mobs and kill the ones you need to kill. There was one moment when I played with a friend, and we were in a dungeon, facing a little challenge. Later, we realized that it wasn't an open dungeon but a four-man group dungeon, and we managed to complete it together at around level 20, even though we didn't really know how to play at that moment. The lack of challenge may also be the reason why nobody wants to interact with another person.The last aspect that concerns me is the theme park design. When you finish a zone, there is nothing more to do there for you. This is not something I expect from an Elder Scrolls game. Also, the older areas are really tightly created; you don't have much to discover because the majority of the space is used for a quest. I miss the discovery aspect of an Elder Scrolls game; I want to discover secrets.I want to immerse myself in the world, but this becomes really hard due to inconsistencies within the game. For example, the watchmen allow a Daedric creature in the city, but not a skeleton. Why are Daedrics accepted? It doesn't feel right.Most of the time, I played as a tank templar, and my friend played a necromancer. We played the complete Daggerfall Covenant areas and some DLC areas. I have to say the DLC areas get a lot more right. For example, open-world bosses are more dangerous, the quests are not too nearby to each other, and there is a lot more space between them to discover. But it's not enough to enjoy the game the way we really want to.What I would like to see is a hard mode server, where the world is really dangerous, and you really need to think about what actions you will take. This could be interesting and may bring people together to face the dangers collectively."
Negative,"The nickel and diming of Elder Scrolls Online would put most free-to-play Korean MMOs to shame. I've played this game for 1326 hours over two years (Steam doesn't show since ESO has its own launcher.) In the last few months, Elder Scrolls Online shifted focus from adding content to draw in new players and improve upon the experience, to adding content for the sake of purely monetizing it.There are many examples of how the focus on purely monetizing in this PAY-TO-PLAY MMO has gotten out of hand, but here are the top ones: The Homestead update which added player housing is designed so that acquiring a house and furniture is extremely inconvenient to entice players to spend $100+ on a furnished house for the convenience. The most recent house added to the game can ONLY be purchased with real money for $100 to $120 USD, depending on whether it’s purchased with or without furniture.Morrowind, the “expansion” that adds one zone goes for $40 for standard upgrade to $100 for a Collector’s Edition. It includes a new playable class, the Warden. However, there is no new character slot to accommodate the new class. Instead two character slots will be purchasable for $15 EACH. That’s right, ZOS is making players pay an additional $15 on top of the $40 or $100 spent in order to play the new class added in Morrowind. Having a new extra character slot when a new class is added in a paid expansion is standard practice in all the other MMOs.A mount added to the store for 3 days in December went for about $40 USD.The addition of Crown Crates, which are gamble boxes, when opened can give a costume, pet, or in almost all cases, just pure consumable junk. A pack of 15 such boxes goes for $40.00 USD, and recent player reports suggest that they are rigged to give worthless consumable experience scrolls over costumes/pets/mounts for the rarer reward tiers.A HAIRSTYLE added to the game for 3 days went for $20 USD.Meanwhile bots run rampant in the game, some camping in obvious areas called dolmens to the point that they are causing lag due to their sheer numbers. Others farm materials and mobs, crashing prices of crafting materials. Nothing has been done about them for months.A year ago, the game was at its best when new zones and content were added that subscribers ($15/month) could access. It was a time when it did not feel necessary to spend hundreds of dollars to fully experience the game like Homestead did. A year ago, the Crown Store had cosmetic purchases that could be made with real money without the astronomical prices like it does now, and it actually felt like a fun extra to the game. Now, the development of the game feels purely focused on adding the next $100 item to the Crown Store rather than on actual game content.Until ZOS (the developers) shift their focus back to the game itself and stop treating players like bags of meat with wallets, I cannot recommend this game."
Negative,"I would only recommend this game at a steep discount, which it is often priced at. I love this game and easily have 100's if not 1000 hours on the PS4 edition. However, the game has many glaring problems, most glaring of which is the game's horrendous monetization. I would describe the monetization simply as OPPRESSIVE for it seeps into practically every aspect of the game. You cannot change your appearance at any point in the game after character creation, you MUST pay for a character edit token, and this includes your hairstyles. Seriously? I have to pay real money because the idea of a barber shop is too crazy a concept for Zenimax (the devs) to comprehend? Items in the crown store, the premium currency store, are priced at genuinely ridiculous costs. Some of the in-game houses easily cost $100 in premium currency WITHOUT FURNITURE INCLUDED. The most insanely priced items in the store are the DLCs, of which I found 37 listed online. Let me just rant about the DLC pricing for a moment, because it ties into their premium subscription, ESO Plus, very heavily. The cheapest DLCs are ones that only include dungeons generally, and they are priced at $15 USD worth of premium currency at the cheapest, assuming you don't somehow find a sale for their currency. These dungeon DLCs include rare and highly sought out crafting styles which look very good compared to base-game styles (generally) and often sell for a very, very, high price on the player guild auction houses. Some are priced at $20ish and some are $30, those of which are usually the large expansion level DLCs. That's an insane amount of money considering how little content is honestly in them compared to expansions for other MMOs. So how does anyone afford this? Well, they just go and subscribe to the premium subscription, ESO Plus. ESO Plus gives access to all DLC so long as the subscription is active. This is THE way to get the most out of the game, which is ironic considering this game prides itself on not requiring a subscription unlike most other MMOs such as World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy 14. Sure, it isn't required, but it's the best way to have fun. ESO Plus includes several other benefits such as: an UNLIMITED extra inventory for crafting materials, 1650 in premium currency (crowns in ESO) every month, +10% gold, experience, and crafting research, and double the amount of furnishings allowed to be placed in player housing. There's a few other minor benefits besides those that I don't feel are worth mentioning. The Crown Store (premium currency store) also includes a massive amount of costumes, hairstyles, mounts + pets, and other things that are simply unobtainable otherwise, and they all have an absolutely ridiculous price. The only justification for these prices that I can come up with is that the developers expect you to have an active ESO Plus membership, which, over enough months, would give you enough currency to buy many of the items listed. For an example of the batshit insane pricing, you can only buy ONE loot box (yes there's fucking lootboxes) with $8 worth of crowns because they are priced at 400 crowns and the $8 pack of crowns only gives 750. I should also point out that these loot boxes give fairly worthless items most of the time, like you're going to be getting straight up garbage out of a lootbox worth roughly FOUR DOLLARS EACH in USD. Again, I love this game, but I'm also a legit hater because of the monetization and would advise you to do your due diligence before buying because you might as well be paying for WoW or FFXIV, and they are honestly far better at being MMOs than this game. It's not all bad with this game though. The combat is pretty fun and rather hands-on for a game of this type. Enemies can be interrupted with shield bashes, staggered and knocked down with heavy attacks, and you can Dark Souls roll out of danger. A huge amount of the world can be interacted with like in previous Elder Scrolls games, in the sense that most drawers and barrels and etc can be looted. The character customization is pretty good, if simple, but the models are 100x better than the abominations everyone was in Oblivion and the freaks elves were in Skyrim. This game can honestly be played as a straight up singleplayer game if you'd like, the story is fully voice acted (the voice acting is far from great though) and every zone has its own storyline."
Negative,Paying for a subscription just to have more inventory space made me not want to play anymore.
Negative,"I don't recommend this game for oceania players, this game only have 2 servers which are NA and EU, 8 years since it released but still only have 2 servers :("
Negative,"So evidently I've hardly got into the game yet, but I'm already not happy seeing that the DLC is sold using the manipulative marketing tactics that I can't believe are rapidly becoming the norm.I'm leaving this review as a negative despite my inexperience with the game as I think it's insane that we, as consumers, have been conditioned to find this sort of thing acceptable.    They use the method of ""purchase a premium currency, use that to actually purchase DLC"", in this case using their 'crown' store. There's literally only two reasons companies do this instead of just allowing you to buy things outright, the first is as a step to dissociate you from the money you're spending, and the second is so they can price things in a way such that you always need to spend more money than you want.  So I checked out the crown store and sure enough, the latter is definitely true, at least for the more substantial DLC.The 'full sized' DLC, those that contain new quests and locations (aka game packs), are sold at the following prices, I'll list how many of these DLC are sold at each price so you can see how many you'd be overspending on.  1500 crowns (9)2000 crowns (6)3000 crowns (1)3500 crowns (3)4000 crowns (2)To their credit, there is a 1500 crown pack, so you could buy 9 of the 21 aforementioned DLCs without overspending.  The next package up gives you 3000 crowns, so you could get that one 3000 crown DLC, making 10/21 DLC possible to buy without overspending, but that's the final number, the literal majority of the DLC will cause you to overspend.  You're already overspending with the 3000 pack if you want any of the 2000 crown DLC, but are shy if you want any DLC costing 3500, and the next pack above that jumps all the way to 5500 crowns, so you're overspending if you want either a 3500 or 4000 crown DLC.  And of course, the smallest package is 750 crowns so even if you try to make up the difference this way you're still overspending.Yes, sometimes it'll work out that buying a large pack lets you buy a full 2 DLC, but firstly the number of DLC divisible in this way is actually quite small, and secondly if you didn't want that DLC to begin with and are getting it because you're forced to overspend on what you did want, that's still manipulative marketing.  But hey, you can always get ESO+ which gives you all game packs for a monthly subscription right?Nope, because they now specify ESO+ grants you access to game packs from the crown store, but they've also started selling DLC that can only be purchased NOT on the crown store (i.e. as a physical copy, or digitally through steam or their website).  This is almost certainly done to circumvent the promise of access to 'all game packs' ESO+ was meant to provide, but by doing so they've also gone ahead and proved that the crown store is entirely unnecessary, as they're evidently perfectly capable of selling you the DLC directly when it suits them.I don't know if I'm just being petty, since this doesn't seem to bother most people these days, but I think it's fairly ridiculous that it's become normal for a company, and one that you are already actively trying to spend money with no less, to use these sorts of blatant tactics to get you to overspend and/or purchase things you have no interest in."
Negative,"Decent 8/10 game that I would normally recommend that gets the red thumb due to terrible customer support for non cash shop related problems. Sent a cash shop related ticket and got a human response pretty quickly and situation resolved. Sent a non cash shop ticket and got nothing but robot responses. Going on 2 1/2 months with nothing but a single initial robot response and another robot response when I sent a follow up email. They closed the ticket despite ample evidence supporting my case(9 screenshots detailing the entire situation), none of which was probably seen by human eyes. It's a shame, I did like this game as my 1000+ hours played shows. Don't know if this is one I'll continue to play or support.*EDIT*Updating my review. In response to the developer response I received I decided to send another ticket. I made it even more clear and concise than the previous ticket. I received the standard robot response and replied to it so the ticket would (hopefully this time) be seen by humans. Not only did I NOT receive a human response but I received no response period. After 25 days of nothing I looked up the status of the ticket and saw that it was marked ""answered."" I figured maybe I just didn't get the email so I checked out what the ""answer"" was. There was no answer, they just closed the ticket and marked it answered. I sent a ticket, and they closed it without any response. I would've taken a ""sorry but we can't help you with this situation"" but instead I got literally nothing with both the previous ticket and this one.With customer service like this I can no longer support this product or recommend it to anyone. I planned on getting Greymoor when it went on sale however I won't be getting it now, nor do I see myself returning to ESO."
Negative,"I hate to say it, but this game is a total cash-grab. Don't get me wrong its a fun game; big map lots to do, intresting systems and mechanics and more. The thing that makes it a cash-grab is the amount of single zone or Dungeon DLC and don't even get me started on the cost for those small DLC. That's not even including the larger DLC like Morrowind and Summerset, and as a recent addition Greymoor. It's like i'm buying the game all over again. It's a decent enough game for a causal player like myself; but be prepaired to fell frustrated at all the cool stuff you can't do unless you want to drop 80 or 90 dollars to get all the cool DLC. But hey, who the hell cares what I think? I'm just another random guy on the internet trying to give his opinion, try the game for yourself when it goes on sale, I think its like what? 20 Bucks?"
Negative,"If you like overpriced micro transactions, a dev team that doesn't know where they're going, a pvp environment where you're fighting the game performance more than the person you're fighting then ESO is the game for you! Don't forget about their yearly chapters where they reskin a new territory and resell it to you for 40 bucks with some pay to win mythic items and some of their famously dull uninspired easily missed questing.  If you stick around long enough you'll eventually pick up on the fact that the cash shop showcases are more in depth and frequent than their content that you pay for with real money. ""Zenimax needs money"" the copium addicts scream from the hilltops, not realizing they're already paying minimum $180 a year for a craft bag."
Negative,"After 7 years, as a loyal customer who has invested in this game that I once loved, the people at bethesda/zenimax now have finally put the final nail in the coffin for me.   As a player, I don't go on gen chat due to toxic garbage that people spew, I just play and mind my own business.  But now, for some reason, some  character names that I have had for years, apparently are offensive to some snowflake schmucks at Bethesda/Zenimax, that in their infinite stupidity, i am now permanently banned...without any recourse or arbitration.  Great business model you got there. Congrats on removing a long term player that has given you a positive revenue stream.  Game loyalty means nothing to them.   I suggest that all of you be mindful and don't waste any more time or cash on this game.   There are many better ones out there, and more cost effective to your wallet."
Negative,"Once there was a positive review for one of my favorite games here, but now there is only an irritation. The developers deprived players of a legal way to exchange crown gifts for in-game gold, apparently reasoning that money is not enough for them and that now someone will seriously buy a pixel house for a price tag close to half of the average monthly salary in Ukraine. I gave an insane amount of hours to TESO and enjoyed creating in it. More than twenty houses were decorated, some on empty plots built from scratch. My friends and I have closed vet dungeons, completed events, and played more than one story in it, using vast opportunities for roleplay. Vast is when everything is available to you. When you can freely present a bum in the party a new robe, or exchange your gold for another furniture set.What happened in the game in 2023 is a nightmare. Especially with the current prices for direct purchases. The impressions of the developers' amazing attitude towards players are multiplied when you remember that it all started with the disabling of the ability to gift crown crates — and the accompanying lies that it wasn't a deliberate action, but a bug. The lies lasted for six months.The whole situation left an exceptionally nasty feeling. This game was an important part of my creative life at one point, and I didn't think I'd ever tear it down for good, delete all bookmarks, and cringe at the mention of it.I sincerely wish the worst for the greedy ghouls who deprived me of a comfortable haven."
Negative,"Devs: ""Hey guys lets make content more accessible for everyone! How do you ask?! By nerfing everyone! Great right!""Every large update feels like it's turned into ""pin the tail on the donkey"" were the devs with half-assed ideas screw over players, this time it's everyone getting a nerf in the name of ""accessibility"" to help low/mid players. So how is making content harder and take longer going to help these players? Well glad you asked, it's NOT. As much as I loved playing ESO I cannot recommend this game to anyone, slowly it's been getting worse and worse: - More focus on adding new overpriced items to crown store and (clown) crates to get people to gamble. Oh and want the new 2 person mount? Well enjoy playing 5k crowns which equals 50$ CAD, yes you heard me right, they are asking 50$ for a TWO PERSON MOUNT.- Adding less rewards to end game content (more focus on adding ""cool"" stuff to crown store).- Intentionally adding overpowered items (like mythics) to new xpacs so people buy the content, then nerfs it a month or two later.  (And don't forget the horrible rng hours or longer grinds it can take for some mythics items, enjoy wasting time grinding only for it to become useless)- Terrible PvP performance lag, desync and disconnect errors. And don't forget exploiters and cheaters. (Some modes of BGs can be exploited and there use to be an old exploit in Cyro were people could resurrect themselves were they died). And even though some of the exploits are ""fixed"". there is always a chance that new updates will bring them back. This has happened with many bugs.  - Bug that have been in the game for YEARS still not fix or brought back with a new update. There are literally bugged mechanics in content for example that can completely ruin a run. vBC2, last boss you can die to fall damage. vICP, last boss, jumping through the portals can kill you with fall damage. vFH, 3rd last boss, randomly resetting mid fight (last boss adds can bugs as well). vVH, Minotaur boss, when trying to reach the starting point you can be insta killed from environmental damage (this bug came back after an update). The list goes on.. and that's just me mentioning a few 4 man and 1 solo content, there are still even more and that's not including overland, trial, quest, dailies, etc.- As mentioned above ""pin the tail on the donkey"" updates every few months that leave people scratching their heads. Rather then changing skills/sets/ by a few %, they go full on crazy and hard nerf or buff. People go to the PTS and provide feedback about under-performing or over-performing sets/skills and then the devs just ignore most of it, like what is the point of wasting time of PTS? Then only months later actually change said under/over-performing set/skill after realising players are right. And to top it off they ask for ""trust"" but fail to understand that it needs to be earned..I would recommend staying away especially if you're interested in end game or pvp. You'll just end up being disappointed with the constant heavy handed changes and unfixed content."
Negative,"Don't purchase if you are from the SEA and Oceania region. This game has no servers besides NA and EU, and is relatively unplayable from other regions. You have been warned."
Negative,"New players, be ware:• Base game has very limited content;• You need either ESO+ subscription to access DLCs or buy each of them separately;• There is a 'feature' called Craft Bag that is only accessible through ESO+ subscription and it's completely game changing for those who intend to play the game seriously;• In order for you to be efficient in combat, you have to engage with 'weaving', which is a mechanic of cancelling a combat animation in order to speed up rotation, and it feels very clunky;• Not all achievements are account wide, and you will have a separate completion progress for each character;• Because prices are not regional, ESO+ subscription is one of the most (if not the most) expensive subscriptions for an MMORPG in Brasil and some other countries."
Negative,"I bought ESO not expecting to have to pay a subscription on top of buying the game. ESO+ costs around $15 while I spent a whole $20 on the game. Wow. I can still play though, and if the story stopped there I would have made this absolutely a recommendation to buy this game. However, one thing really ticks me off - there are loads of items in this game and inventory space is very sparse, relatively speaking. Of course, if you buy the subscription you get an unlimited bag to store all crafting materials in. This is huge, but it's also left me disgruntled. There are so many crafting materials that are worth keeping that the only way to manage without this crafting bag is to use mules, spend half an hour after every quest running from house storage to bank, or to somehow get 10 active accounts to have your own personal guild bank. These sort of situations where a problem is invented and then they sell you the solution is the scummiest shit ever. Until we get some sort of limited crafting bag or the problem is otherwise alleviated I can't recommend this game in good conscience. This sort of thing is absolutely despicable, and while most f2p players will simply throw away most of the loot they encounter to avoid this issue I find the crafting system to be one of the biggest pulls of this game and this whole situation is scummy. Developers should not invent problems in their game and sell you the solution."
Negative,"The blatant greed in this game is getting much worse. I'm fine with buying cosmetics, but they keep hiding them in loot boxes and consistently lowering drop rates, not to mention splitting cosmetic armor into pieces so you have to keep buying to get the whole set. Want to bank on the go? That's $50. Want to buy a house so you can put all those cosmetic items somewhere? $50 to $150 for anything worth buying. Not to mention the subscription of $180 a year without buying the $60 expansion. If you plan on playing for any decent amount of time, the subscription is definitely required, otherwise you lose half your bank space and the crafting bag which is infinite.Look, love this game and the community, but ZOS is a terrible company who only wants your money. They don't listen to the community and keep jacking up the prices. I only hope Microsoft can fix the mess they've created"
Negative,"I've played the shit out of this game since I got it, and am pretty much done with it now. Before critiquing it I want to quickly list the things I love about it.PROSGraphics:This game is pretty as fuck. The architecture, the scenery, the weather, all of it comes together beautifully. A lot of work and thought went into the art direction and environment design for Tamriel and its connected areas. Revisiting the areas I saw in Skyrim and other areas that were only referenced (Elsweyr, Alik'r Desert, etc) was also very cool, as many areas from the lore have been brought to life. Quests:Holy shit, does this game have quests for you. Prepare to be bombarded with miscellaneous quests everywhere you go. All the lines of dialogue are voice acted (passionately, I might add), so none of it feels too stale and repetitive...ish. I'll get into that later. Regardless, you will always have something to do, if solo questing is your thing.Combat:This is where the game really shines. For an MMORPG, the combat in this game is extremely satisfying. You're able to alternate between active combat (clicking to attack, parry, holding a click to strong attack, roll dodging, etc) and a more passive ability-based combat, whereby you use magicka and stamina for abilities. There are no cooldowns on your abilities, so you can almost always be attacking in some way. The combat is fast paced and well animated, and one of the most creative combat experiences available in any MMORPG today. Audio:The music and sound effects of this game are fantastic. Crisp sound quality, satisfying combat sounds, and a beautiful soundtrack really help bring this game to life. PVP:I personally had a great time with the PVP in this game. The game modes are fun and engaging, and the combat really shines when you get to test it against other players. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let me get into my criticisms. CONSDifficulty:This game is frustratingly easy. Typically, in an MMO (at least, how it used to be), your progression through the game is based on your player level and gear. Meaning, you'll start in a starting area where everything is relatively easy to kill, and you progress through it whilst levelling up, preparing you for higher level areas with more difficult enemies. If you go to one of these areas before levelling up enough, you get smoked. That isn't the case in ESO. In an effort to make the game more accessible to the mass audience, ESO has level scaling, meaning, every player and enemy in the game are scaled to one another. If I am level 50 (champion level), and I play with my friend who is level 1, we can complete the same quests and fight the same enemies with the same level of difficulty. Here's the problem I have with that; the difficulty level is extremely low. Most regular enemies can be absolutely decimated by low level characters in seconds, and do little to no damage in return. This does not change as you level up, if anything it becomes easier, as you unlock new abilities and passives. This results in an almost monotonous experience questing and even dungeoning. Mind you, the max level dungeons can be challenging, however any dungeons before max level can basically be solo'd by most competent players. Also, the roles of tank, healer and DPS are rendered useless as every class can do all 3 roles at any time. Every class type has a healing ability, a tanky AOE ability and DPS abilities. When you enter a dungeon, everyone just starts blasting through mobs and bosses without any real critical thinking or strategy, as it isn't necessary. Sometimes you can solo a dungeon without even having to heal yourself because of random self healing abilities. It's frustrating as someone who has been gaming for a long time and enjoys a good challenge. This game is not challenging whatsoever.Progression:Building on my last point, another downside of level scaling is that it causes a complete lack of progression. There is literally no feeling of accomplishment by levelling up. Your stats essentially do not increase, if they do it is marginal at best, your gear scales down level by level and getting new gear simply returns you to the stat level you were at a few levels prior (a level 1 character and a level 50 will both have a sword that does a max of 1300 damage, for example). When you level up to ""champion,"" you feel basically nothing as you can still get bested in a duel by a more skilled level 5 player, because there is no progression and therefore no hierarchy. I understand the company wanting to make this game more accessible to everyone, as now you're able to travel to any area of the map at any time, however I find that it takes away from the fun of building your character. You put all this effort into levelling up, getting gear, finishing quests, all for the enemies and bosses to be easy, the gear to be basically pointless and the levelling up to change virtually nothing.Microtransactions:You knew this was coming. You can pay to win everything in this game. You unlock mounts and cosmetics through ""crates"", which is a horse shit money grab gambling system whereby you purchase crowns (in game currency) and spend them on boxes you open which have a chance of giving you good loot. Most of the time it is useless potions and dyes. The game makes it nearly impossible to find cool cosmetics and mounts in the actual game, because - big fucking shocker - they want you to spend your actual money on it. Fuck that and fuck them. I know microtransactions are a normal part of most games now but I still find it disgusting and greedy to put so much good content behind a fucking paywall when people have already paid for the game and the endless DLC content. So, did I have fun with this game? Sure, I enjoyed levelling my first character and learning how to play it. It's a beautiful world to explore. I like the general feel of it. But I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking to spend money on an MMORPG. It is simply too easy and too ""accessible."" There is no sense of progression and therefore accomplishment. Everything is blended together too much and the game is either way too easy (95% of the content) or inexplicably hard (dragon world bosses, trials, which I actually appreciate, but the lack of in between difficulty makes absolutely no sense.) It's pretty monotonous to just run around and easily destroy every enemy and ""boss"" you come across. This game leaves a lot to be desired, and if they ever revisit the level scaling and make the game a little harder, I might revisit. Until then, I'm done. Sorry for the damn essay."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU LIKE PVE CONTENT. (Also if you like PVP content, though I don't do as much of that.)I have sat through years of this game being buggy. The dungeon finder never works so the community finds ways to queue properly like having a certain group comp and a certain person being lead. Enemies get stuck in walls and you can't progress because you're in combat. You're lucky if you can actually do the content you're paying for if you don't have a full team of four. But that's not all!Do you like hardcore endgame content? This game has super fun mechanics and gameplay -- until it doesn't work anymore. Tonight my prog group had mechs that weren't appearing (but still managed to kill us), mechs that doubled themselves so that we couldn't complete orb running, and at least four other bugs. People were dying without any evidence of why until they checked the recap. This isn't new. This is years of content that should have been fixed but wasn't. They cancelled two dungeons this year (which is half of them) to do bug fixes that they should be doing as developers -- and then the game isn't any better at all.We get 12 people together every week who love the game and have put a lot of work into it. And we don't ever have an instance that goes well. You deserve better than this game. If you fall in love with it, you will be disappointed because the developers don't care about you or the game. They will mock you in streams. They will leave the game buggy. They balance combat in ways that makes no sense.People I know who've played at the highest levels for years are quitting in droves. Don't get sucked into this game. There are games out there that are well maintained and actually respect your time and money.The quests are okay. If you liked Skyrim, it really is okay. Here's the issue: because you can play in any order, there's no sense of progression. A queen whose life I saved once barely remembers me in another zone. I am the champion of an arena in a zone and didn't even get a title for it. Nothing you do matters, which sucks because I really love the stories, the books, and the gameplay.I have played this game so much and I am so disappointed in it. Get out before you get sucked in."
Negative,"This game is cool, genuinely enjoying it so far.BUTThe people who make the decisions for ESO are extremely money hungry.It can completely ruin the experience for some. You would expect most of the micro-transactions in this game to be in a free MMO not a AAA $60 gamebut other than the greedy micro-transactions, It is a pretty great MMO--------Things i wish i would have done before spending $120 on DLC and other content----------1. DO NOT buy the regular edition of elder scrolls! get the New Blackwood edition if you plan on buying dlc later, it comes with all the major Dlc, Greymoor, elswyr, summerset etc. (the regular edition does not) It will cost you ALOT more to purchase each one individually, which is what i did.also comes with a mount. 2 if you get the Collectors edition.2. Get the ESO Plus subscription. yes they have a stupid Netflix style system. its $14 a month and you get access to all the extra DLC, not the major DLC though (there is alot of side dlc dungeons etc.) and you would have to buy each one seperately without ESO Plus (Over $100) just cancel Plus when you wanna stop playing. and rejoin when you decide to play.You get to keep the stuff you unlock when you cancel.. From what i heard. If you don't, They are legitimate scum for using this business model.3. Do not buy a mount. Get the blackwood or Blackwood collectors edition if you want 1-2 cool mounts. Plus the Major DLC which comes with other stuff.If that edition is no longer available at the time you see this, See what ""New"" editions are available.4. Do not buy the loot boxes.... Ever.. unless you want potions..I bought 15 of them and mostly received Potions!! some face paints, body paint & a couple pets, like a stupid sheep is one of them. (I think that's their way of calling us sheep!! lol)5. If your gonna buy stuff with crowns don't buy skins, mounts etc. Go play the game and unlock the DLC outfits, mounts etc.Spend your crowns on increasing riding capacity or riding speed. (This pay2win micro-transaction almost ruined the game for me) but going fast & carrying more is far more important than looking cool. at least to me it is. I don't recommend buying any crowns but if you do.6. Do not buy the loot boxes.... Ever.. in case you forgot.."
Negative,"Hi, I'm a ESO PLUS player.This critic is based on the abusive commercialism of Zenimax. Thanks to the enormous differences of gameplay between those who pay the Plus and those who do not, the game ends up shielding against attracting new players and seems to be more interested in creating a sect of PLUS players.The CRAFTING STORAGE is a huge problem for all the non-plus players. The game has LOTS of crafting materials that we all want to store. PLUS players have a unlimited automatic storage for all this materials, meanwhile, non-PLUS players have NOTHING like that; so they must do a lot of tedious and boring work to simply get this materials stored, ocupying bank space or even inventory space, but most important; wasting time.Some months ago I invited some friends to ESO, they payed the game but not the PLUS, cos' they want to test the game before paying some kind of mensuality. When they crash with the fact of how materials and the storage works in this game... all the tedious work mentioned above... they get bored, and after some time left the game.Zenimax dosen't even give them a limited crafting storage. They only want easy money. So they make sure to give the free players the worst kind of experience and so, they' re stuck, do they keep playing like that or pay up? It's way too greedyThis is what we have for now. I really hope for a change. I want more players and more friends ingame and not only a sect of fanatic PLUS players. Thanks for reading.09/10/18 First of all, I want to thank everyone who participated in this debate. I am agree with the fact pointed by many of you; ESO grants beneficts to those who pay the montly subscription unlike others MMOs (like WoW)Now, sadly, this cool fact is not the way zenimax choose to promote the sub, they choose extort their players with the playability. Crafting bag is not a luxury item, it's a feature that change significantly the game experience; if you don't have it you will lose a lot of your time , and ingame resources. And this fact stablish a harsh difference of real gameplay. If they extort you, then the choice is yours, you can remain silent and continuing playing (and paying for playing well). Or you can say something about how bad this sittuation is, because it's not only greedy, it's also very unfair.Cosmetic freebies and dlc access for subs? Great. Gameplay advantages for subs?... the choice is yours."
Negative,"So after seeing my playtime someone asked me if I would recommend this game and I actually said no so... Let me go through it a little bit. It doesn't mean that I don't recommend it under any circumstance, in a way it's actually both a very fun MMO, and a very fun solo experience. It's just the more I think about it, the sadder I get, so that's why I personally can't give a recommendation. On top of that, the PvE content is heavily skewed towards dungeon content, and we are sorely missing more variety with PvE releases. - We get 1 12-man trial per year with a story zone expansion that costs like a full priced game (40 euros) for a total of 12 trials in the game as of the end of 2023;- We get 2 4-man dungeon packs with 2 dungeons each per year which cost an in-game currency equivalent of 13 euros each (and dungeons make up the majority of group content in the game now with 52 dungeons); - Once per year we also get zone DLCs that cost about as much as the dungeons and only gives you access to a new zone and item sets/antiquities that come with it;- The game only has 2 group arenas;- The game only has 2 solo arenas;- The game now has 1 solo/duo infinite dungeon that is, as you guessed it, infinite and thus reuses assets from older in-game content;- The game's PvP ONLY has 1 big open world PvP zone, 1 smaller PvPvE zone, and 4-player battlegrounds with only 5 play modes. PvP content hasn't been updated in ages, no new PvP zones or PvP modes being added;- The game is 10 years old in 2024.Releasing a mini-trial pack (of which, btw, there are only TWO out of 12 trials total) or a solo/group arena pack instead of a dungeon pack would go a long way, since if we compare the numbers, there are too many dungeons, and too little of anything else, and it gets extremely repetative. PvP is very much long due for an update, either with releasing some new PvP/PvPvE zones, or adding modes to battlegrounds.- There are so many item sets, and most of it is just bloat, since there's always just about a dozen meta sets that are in use and then nothing else, and they swap around each patch based on what was added, what was buffed, what was nerfed.- Based on the above, it's very much possible that whatever build you are using can be rendered useless next patch, forcing you to grind the next best thing.- PvP and PvE are not balanced separately, which leads to grievances on both sides of the playerbase.- ZOS has a lovely tendency of making new classes overpowered on release (same goes for sets and mythics, tbh) and then nerfing them into near uselessness down the line (e.g. thrassian, oakensoul, necromancer and warden classes).- With the hybridisation changes playing different classes and different resources (mag or stam) feels basically the same. While it did add good quality of life, it absolutely murdered build variety.- Performance is still jank with things plainly refusing to work and bugs not getting fixed for years, or being fixed and new renditions reintroduced in newer patches (hello, block bug).- The current release schedule feels more like maintenance mode.- I don't want to talk about the monetisation, because it's another big can of worms. Just, for new people, before going to buy something off of crown store, check if you can get it in game for free or for gold first. Because I guarantee you, for most of those things you can. Yes, even the DLCs, which leads me to the next point...- The game doesn't have an in-game gold-crown exchange. Instead, it allows people to do such exchanges themselves (you pay gold for crown gifts, or you crown gift to get gold). So it's unsupervised and scam-prone, so that's not ideal, but it is an option if you don't want to pay real money for crown store goods.- Big in-game houses cost an absolutely unhealthy amount of real life money. The housing aspect of the game is quite good though sadly, the houses don't have any uses beside being a crafting base at best and a decoration set at worst."
Negative,"I've played this Game for years with expansions and DLC's purchased whenever they've launched. I also continued to pay for my eso+ subscription every month. However, since you increased your prices for Turkey 3 times over, I've cancelled my subscription and I don't plan to resubscribe or continue this game unless you pull back this price increase. Purchase power here did not increase, so why did you raise your prices?"
Negative,"cmon guys, invest in a damn asia server. We exist too you know?"
Negative,pay for base gamepay for dlc for your favorite racepay for the classpay for the mappay for next dlc pay for more bag spacepay for vey basic thingspay for every shit
Negative,Its fun if you have ppl to play with but they try and squeeze money out of you at every turn. Not quite pay to win but if you dont fork over for eso plus your not going to have a great time. Its cool being able to explore most of tamriel but gotta give it a negative over all for the scummy micros
Negative,"There's things I like, and things I don't, but overall the game is good. That said, everything being scaled is kind of killing it for me. Part of the fun of an RPG is progression. The feeling of growing in power as well as technique. Balancing the risk of taking on harder content but with the promise of better rewards. The whole One Tamriel thing is a cool idea, but... It's making all the enemies I fight feel monotonous and same-y. And not only that, but it's all exceedingly easy.  You're never really going to be in danger. You have no need for the food or drink mechanics to get stronger, there's no real reason to worry about your gear being at your level as much as possible, and I'll be surprised if anyone feels the need to ever sip a potion. At least, while leveling. And while the questing can be really enjoyable, the fighting segments of them become a drag. Few enemies really do anything unique or unexpected and it just further makes them all feel like reskins. 'Ah, this one is channeling and I need to interrupt it. Like all the other ones.' 'Ah, this one is doing a heavy blow and I need to block it. Like the other ones.' 'Ah, this one is starting an AOE and I need to avoid it. Like the other ones.'It's like the game is a really tasty, delicious cake, but they put a bunch of really plain, cheap icing on it. Each bite has that flavor of something special, but it's kind of being drowned out by the flavorless mush covering it and clings to your tongue until you feel like you need a taste of something else to wash out the lingering flavor. If it were at least difficult, if it at least engaged you on a more regular basis and gave you more to think about during a battle other than 'God I can't wait to kill Scamp #33 so I can continue this cool questline' then maybe the scaling wouldn't be so bad. A world where anywhere you go you're being challenged in a fair and entertaining manner and adventure with anyone you want, whenever you want. That said, apparently the PVP is on point and if it's your jam then the game is worth a look. I've dipped my toes into it only lightly in my 69 (nice) hours and supposedly it's the best part of the game, so if that's more your jam then you'll definitely be entertained."
Negative,"As someone who loves this game, and has loved it since the first time I played it, it hurts me to be forced to write this review. Note, that this is written on a saturday, 1.12.2018. (It is important to remember that it is a saturday).ESO is an MMORPG that puts you in Tamriel, in a time before the ''Oblivion crysis'' amd the Skyrim's dragonborn storyline... (as seen in ESO IV and V). You are in control of a character that you can create from scratch: name it, pick the appearance of it, pick a class, an alliance (which is not that relevant) and ofc the race. After this, you are put inside a HUGE open world and pretty much left to choose what to do and where to do it. The world is absolutelly HUGE and quests are everywhere. All of them are voice acted, some tell a funny story, others are much more serious. The world is completely open to you, as everything will scale to your level. It is a true MMORPG paradise and you have all of it at your disposal. Well, almost all of it. A number of zones are locked behind purchasing a DLC needed for them. There are story DLCs and dungeon DLCs. Personally, I find story ones absolutely worth the money, while the dungeon ones aren't that great. But that's only my opinion. Also, if you choose to be an ESO PLUS subscriber, you get all of the DLCs to be unlocked while your sub is active. You CAN buy them permanently, but this is also an option. There are other benefits to being in ESO PLUS, but since I am not a part of it, I can't rly say too much about it.The game itself, is an amazing experience. The community can be good, or bad. Depending on your luck I guess... I was lucky enough to have a perfect guild, with great, chill people. And this game, for me, is rly all about relaxing and playing it in my free time. Which brings me back to today being a saturday...You see, ESO is developed not by Bethesda, but by a company named ZeniMax. There is a common opinion among people playing ESO (especially steam users) that ZeniMax does NOT care about steam users / EU crowd. Their ''server maintenance'' is always on a saturday, during prime time (10 am to 4 pm usually). Every time it happens, you are forced to just - not play and wait. But this is NOT the worst of it. --- After the ''maintenance'' is finished,  steam users can not log in for hours. This happens EVERY SINGLE TIME they do their ''maintenance'' and the discussions board is full of topics to prove this. It is AS IF ZeniMax is a developer that really does not care about a large portion of their player base. And all the complaints so far have gone unanswered. To put it in short - ESO is a truly great game, that is being slowly ruined by it's developers. If you want to play it, do yourself a favour- do NOT buy it trough steam. Buy it directly from them and avoid steam completely. It might help and let you play them when you want to, not when you are allowed to."
Negative,"Do not buy this if you are in Asia /Australia  , the servers are too  far, ESO is too greedy to invest in other mega servers, the ping makes it imposible to play . on average your ping will be 300-700 ,i have tested with multiple ISP networks (5 in total) ,here are the problems1. Bad pings means pvp is impossible you get disconnected every few mins if servers are full2. your attacks are weak in PVE because no matter how fast you use your keys the combos are slow because of the ping, basically if u are in USA and did the same combos u will be dishing out 40,000k-80k damage,  but in asia you will be dishing out 12k damage, meaning you can never be of any value in  trials and dungons3.combat is very bad by itself"
Negative,"I tried to know as much as I can before buying this game, but after buying this game, I realized I made a mistake. I couldn't refund as the installation of the game after downloading took around 1.5 hrs which steam considered as gameplay hrs. The character creation was so detailed, it took around 20 mins to create a character and when i finished the tutorial-ish part of the game, it was already 3 hrs of gameplay. So no refund possible at this time.So, what was the mistake I made? What did I not know before buying this game?This game has only 2 megaservers NA and EU. There is no Asia server. I had to choose one of those servers and the ping/latency are so bad it is unplayable as I am from Asia. The best ping I got was around 180 and this maintains only when i am roaming, But if I decide to get into a fight it is at 999+ ping constant which totally ruins the experience. It was my mistake, I should have done a bit more detailed research about this game. Finally, I do not recommend this game to anybody who is from Asia."
Negative,"I'm not even that mad about performance issues. I'm more disgusted at the increasingly shady practices by the company and the excessive monetization. I'd be okay with the subscription and chapter purchases and possibly some direct COSMETIC purchases from the crown store like costumes and polymorphs, but the fact that gamble crates exclusively contain the absolute best cosmetics with nothing even remotely comparable being obtainable through game-play is just downright terrible game design which gives the player fewer reason to actually play the game and more reasons to gamble... Sure, we got some 'rewards' via game-play and events (re-skins mostly) but not one of them are anywhere near the quality of gamble crate stuff. It's just shady business practices tainting a once-great franchise. ""Service Tokens"" are another thing which should have some gold alternative in place. If the dev team didn't deliberately destroy build diversity in favor of the cash shop then I probably wouldn't have much problem with such tokens but as it is, every update they force changes upon players which nobody wanted just to keep their sales of ""service tokens"" going. Deliberately design a pain-point in a new system, offer a cash solution a month or two later, it's basic mobile-game, monetization garbage only designed for an MMO... and it's tainting Elder Scrolls. Update: Zo$ added ""Endeavours"" (think a really shitty Battle Pass) to basically skip around the legal issues of their gambling crates. The problem is, this new system requires like 6 months of flawless daily logins to be able to get anything good from the 'endeavour store', which is usually too late to get something you want since gamble crates and other good offerings are typically ""limited-time"" offers... What a scam."
Negative,"Update for winter 2019 (don't look at in-game hours, it's just game launcher time not gameplay time):TL;DR - game has a lot of quality PVE content, interesting engaging PVP, almost no grind, active combat system and no pay2win. All of this suffers from server problems and game barely can handle peak hour amount of players. I won't recommend buying this game until performance problems are fixed.Detailed review:1. PVE solo content - i.e. questing - game has very good lore, writing and formiddable scale, it may take enormous time to complete all main questlines. Design of base game zones varies from awesome to mediocre, DLC zones are all good. Main downside is lack of any combat difficulty as well as lack of worthwhile rewards... I never played anything more pointlessly easy and boring in terms of combat as ESO PVE overland2. PVE group content - is very beatiful and interesting and top end trials (veteran DLC hardmode raids) and top achievements require big group effort, experience and skill. Normal versions on the other hand are relatively easy and accesible to any players. As of late (last 9 months) game suffers from performance problems, as well as ground breaking nerfs which led to decrease of end game population in several times. PVE group combat efficiency, basically group dps is very dependent on precise timings and with bad game server performance many raid groups are simply locked out of top achievements. There is no variety in builds, generally everybody uses absolutely the same gear (within same raid) and same classes. Latest chapter was clear PVE P2W with new class overperforming old classes for more then 10%.3. PVP in ESO is real fun and here game combat system and variety starts to shine. But with all it's good sides, it hurts from bad performance most of all and most interesting and effective combos can't be completed when all server starts to lag as hell. Also you can be freezed/kicked by server anytime leaving your character in place as free frag and it happens very often, basically once in 1-2 hours of gameplay such situtation will happen sooner or later.Overall, I may say game and it's performance improved from summer disaster, but it is still bad performance and there is no real roadmap on improvements (i.e. server upgrade), devs are just tweaking code which leads to nerfs and simplification and can ruin your build which you honed for several months..4. Cosmetics. All the well-made mounts and pets are cash shop exclusive with no way to obtain them through gameplay other then by black market exchange of in-game currency for crown gifts. Even worse best quality mounts are locked behind random lootboxes with abysmally low chance of drop. So if you want to gather all mounts etc, prepare to spend thousands and thousands of $$$.On the other hand character outfits can be all obtained through gameplay without excessive grind and there are 75+ styles already with light, medium and heavy armor version of each style.5. P2W - technically there is no P2W in the game, other then yearly chapter with ton of content. No OP equipment, consumables, boosters, nothing proving advantage is available from cash shop.6. Grind - grind requirement is very low, with exception of some RNG items. After you acquire them little to none grind is required.Update for summer 2019 - PC EU server is overloaded to unplayable state. PVP and trials are a real challenge with regular freezes and abnormal lag. (my Overwatch lag 60, ESO lag in peak hours - 340+)Initial review:There is a lot of depth and good things in ESO, mostly in PVE and questing content. PVP can be enjoyable too if you invest time and effort to be good player, but..UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS GAME FROM STEAM - all new steam account experience some problems with game accesibility - be prepared to be treated like 2nd priority customer - game will be often unplayable, you have some limitation in content, and what's most frustrating nobody in developer team show any ideas or effort to fix ""steam login"" issue - situation which happens after very patch when game becomes totally unplayable for you approximately for a day.. your guild, your trials, your plans to do some content - all of this can be ruined any moment."
Negative,"Base game is not recommended especially without ESO+. You will often find you have no inventory space if you plan to partake in everything the game has to offer (and there is a lot). Taking the time to sort your bag or swap between characters will eat up all your time and fun. crafting mechanics introduce 100s of different materials to make the process tedious enough. there is add-on support which do half the developers job for them for some quality of life improvements, but those only take you so far. Not recommended unless you plan on paying month to month and have enough time on your hands."
Negative,"I can't recommend this game for the particular reason that the monetization model (or models) present in the game are rampant, oppressive, and manipulative. The content and gameplay are fantastic but are buried and blocked off by so many layers of paywalls that it (often overtly) tries to bait players into.There are 4 (four, for emphasis) layers of content purchases: Initial game purchase, Optional Subscription, In-Game Store (Rotational), In-Game Lootboxes (Separate Economy)After playing this solo and with friends both on PC and PS4, I can say that I've gotten a feel for the core of the game and watched it change and grow for quite some time. I'm not very optimistic for the future, as the monetization models used for the game have gotten progressively more abusive towards the player over time.First, there are mandatory buy-ins for the base game and major expansions. Minor expansions must also be purchased for play, or may optionally be open for play while holding an active (optional) subscription. Sales are not uncommon on many platforms for the base game, and bundles that lower total price are available.Like many other MMO's, ESO dropped the subscription requirement some time ago. An optional subscription service remains, and rewards the player with access to minor content updates (not including major expansions such as Morrowind and Summerset at release). The service also provides a crafting bag, something that felt very necessary to well paced play given my playstyle (crafting is quite inhibited without it). There are further experience gain benefits as well as a more newly implemented daily reward system that can give power enhancing items as well as a variable number of lootboxes.The in-game shop opens access to purchased, non-game currency items. These items rotate in less of a seasonal manner and rather in staggered time-tables that seem more like an attempt to generate false scarcity of the items in the shop, making players feel more pressure to buy while they are available. ""Crowns"" are the premium, purchasable currency available and are used to purchase anything from cosmetic body coverings to massive player homes...and now, even lootboxes. The costs are very high, however. For example, a recent top-tier player home exclusively available in the Crown store asked for a price, converted from crowns, of well over $100. When buying crowns during a sale, this price could fluctuate down, but outside of those time-gated circumstances, this is very indicative of the game's scaling for costs of buyable items.The lootboxes in this game are called ""Crown Crates"" and are, in my opinion, very insidiously implemented. The crates hold the majority of items, cosmetic or otherwise, available in the game at any given time. What I mean by this is that the reward pool for crown crates hold more mounts, pets, cosmetic body coverings, and player power items (revives, health/stamina/mana potions, poisons for weapons, etc...) than are available for direct purchase in the store at any given time.In a game that already places a large cash shop advertisement in the middle of your screen upon logging in(!), more and more emphasis is being placed on gambling for items in lootboxes instead of making a direct, informed purchase. A character was even added to the game as a form of lootbox opening screen that constantly tells you to ""...buy another crate"", reminds you that ""You're out of crates"" or that the next lootbox might contain what you were actually trying to get. This constant reminder of the lootbox purchases and the outright begging they do in the form of this character to attempt to get players to play a virtual card game/slot machine is, in this reviewer's opinion, disgusting on a higher magnitude than I ever expected from this developer.The stellar gameplay and worldbuilding that orignally attracted me to the game is being crushed under the weight of poor monetization strategies built around (and increasingly through the core of) them. The lootboxes seem to have become a crutch to increase sales numbers, which in the end is crutch to offset low interest in low quality content in the store. Here's to hoping they come to their senses or the industry finally forces reforms of abusive monetization models. Most of us didn't come here for online casinos."
Negative,"Terrible inventory management for non premium players, the game pushes you to buy the eso plus to have a normal gameplay without having to visit a merchant every 5 minutes to empty your bags out."
Negative,add the italian language
Negative,"The game is fun when it works, but there are severe bugs resulting in faultless player deaths when you get into endgame content.  There are also endless smaller bugs which interfere with groups making progress (desyncs, crashes, required game mechanics randomly not working during a run...)  Developer Support is nearly non-existent for things which do not involve monetary transactions; bug reports generally ignored or closed with ""thanks for the feedback"" resolutions.  Game balancing changes seem largely designed to drive players to buy new content or invest more playtime in farming gear rather than address any actual balance issues.  It is not clear that the dev team understands the community.Becoming effective in the game requires the support of an out-of-game community (this would be fine if it were required to /excel/ but it really is required if you are going to /survive/ endgame content).  Voice chat on PC requires a separate program (Discord everywhere I've seen).Many no-brainer improvements to the game are provided by addon community.  It is expected that you will use an addon to replace the UI, addons for group info sharing, addons to make the in-game traders usable, addons to make a player house seem like a guildhall...  In the few cases ZOS attempts to provide similar functionality it does not fill the actual need.  Example: saving gear loadouts is provided by an addon - you 'can' use the armory, but this saves/restores full character snapshots so it is most useful for characters who are topped out on all skills - otherwise you get rolled back to an earlier state and have to reallocate the extra points.  Having more than two loadouts requires purchasing of additional slots /per character/ at 1500 crowns each... and the armory does not allow you to swap while inside vet content.  Armory has its uses, but it does not solve the original problem and costs real world money to begin to make it worthwhile.If you do not subscribe with ESO+ the game tends to turn into an inventory-management sim, with reduced bank & housing space and no access to the 'craft bag' (which holds unlimited amounts of the tiny crud you pick up all over the place in the course of playing).  Having ESO+ gives access to 'DLC' but does not reduce or contribute to the cost of yearly chapters.  If you are planning to really play this game, expect to pay more than $250 a year for the subscription + the essential yearly chapter.The game is pretty.  The voice cast is great.  The music is wonderful.  The content team makes interesting environments... but there are technical and developmental scope issues which boggle the mind.  I do /want/ to recommend this game to new players, but I cannot invite anyone to enter into this one-sided relationship."
Negative,"I'm so torn on it. On one hand they've created a huge portion of Tamriel and while it's not as deep or lived-in as I'd expect from the single player ES games, it's pretty cool to explore.But on the other hand it's over-monetized as all hell with countless microtransactions on top of microtransactions. Want a new mount that isn't a horse? Gotta pay, baby. Maybe $10. Maybe $30. Want a new cool house? Grab your wallet, my guy. That'll be $150. Not exaggeration. Sick armor, or mount you see on another player? Probably a microtransaction! Most likely not earned through gameplay.This is on top of $15 a month for what should just be included in gameplay. The craft bag. This is a gameplay mechanic that you have to pay monthly for or you lose it. You like hoarding resources in single player ES games? Not here! Not without paying $15 a month anyway and it's just as important as in those games. More so even.That's on top of a yearly expansion that costs $40+ depending on the version if you want to play the newest content.This is a perfect example of a decent or even good game ruined by corporate greed. It could be so much more than it is but they've chosen the path of mediocrity and price gouging. The only reason it has a decent player base and ""Very Positive"" reviews on Steam is because of the Elder Scrolls name. If this wasn't part of a massive, popular brand like Elder Scrolls, It'd be ""Mixed"" reviews or worse, and have a dwindling player base. This game is, in nearly every mechanic, just a worse Guild Wars 2 with a ridiculous paywall."
Negative,Don't bother wasting your time like I did
Negative,"Do not buy this game.I admit, I spent way too much time trying to enjoy this game. The stories can be good. But the predatory practices of Zenimax know no bounds and far outweigh any positives. Buy an expansion pack? Don't expect to be able to access all the content in that pack without buying all the other expansion packs. It's just plain dishonest."
Negative,"The game is pretty, and the stories are a genuine good time in most of the areas! Definitely worth checking out if you want to explore some areas and get some lore on races that are rarely or never touched upon in the mainline games. However-Retcons big choices in the story at random ✅Unstable connection/gameplay ✅Corrupted dungeon/raid instances ✅De-synced telegraphs on important boss mechanics ✅Devs actively despise tank players ✅Community is full of toxic casuals ✅2 hour dungeon queue, but the tank and healer are fake ✅Devs remove fun gear-set interactions players discover ✅Only one class gets attention per expansion ✅Lootboxes ✅Sells you a game with a problem (inventory) ✅Also sells the solution to that problem (craftbag) ✅✅Community will tell you the above is ""free if you pay for it"" ✅Negative feedback is blocked ✅Devs will blame YOU before acknowledging that a glitch exists ✅Gaslight ✅Gatekeep ✅Dremora boss ✅I legit feel bad for one of the community team-members for being tossed to the players with zero news and told to say something."
Negative,"At every update, servers are getting worse. Bethesda and Zenimax prove with each decision that their focus is money and certainly not their customers. The subscription is mandatory if you want to enjoy this game. Each expansion is just adding to an ongoing grind of cosmetics and as there is no new level cap, they nerf to death every single viable build to force everybody to buy and farm the new DLC. Rince and repeat this with never ending pointless grindy events ad nauseam to collect a 78956th variation of indrik mounts. This has nothing to do with the elder scrolls anymore aside from a thin coat of pretended ""story"" that is anyway broken and against the lore to the worst possible way. Worst let down I had on an MMO. And you can tell by my played time that I was investedEDIT: Given the comments, regarding the ""play"" time, just to make it clear, having the launcher opened, but not with the game running still counts in the time played on steam. So no, I didn't play 10k hours, but the launcher was opened for that time. Which is still there to give you an idea since how long I played this game and saw it evolve. Hell my wife is totaling 19k hours according to steam!"
Negative,"First things, first.  I did beta test The Elder Scrolls Online, and did not overly care for the game then.  However, I figured I'd give it another go when it finally went on sale.  BIG MISTAKE.While the game is absolutely beautiful and has an amazing soundtrack, this is not enough to pull this game out of the gutter.   I went into this knowing full well that this was not ""Skyrim"".  Having played MMORPGs for 15+ years now, I was looking forward to the adaptation of the elder scrolls universe into MMO format.  With all the MMOs that have come and gone, you'd think the newer ones would have noticed what companies did right, and what they did wrong.  Zenimax Online is clueless, utterly clueless.The biggest problem is, the game does not know what it is trying to be.  Sure, there are lots of people around, but it still feels like a single player game most of the time.  The group finder tool used to put together random parties for dungeons is absurd, it does not check that the right classes are being put into a random group.  Both attempts I had put me in a group without a healer, making the dungeon impossible to complete.Selling items to other players is a hassle and a real throwback to older MMOs like Everquest.  There is no public auction house like in most MMOs of the last decade.  Instead, there are guild shops.  Items are listed by members, and only available for purchase by other members, severely limiting a customer base.  This in turn has people flooding the zone chats with their wares in hopes of finding a buyer.The crafting system is decent, however VERY tedious.  You would think that the most effective way to level up a craft would be to actually craft stuff right?  Wrong, in ESO, you get by far the most exp by breaking items apart into their base ingrediants.  This itself isn't a bad thing, however, the experience difference is so big, that it makes leveling through creating items feel like a waste of time.  The crafting can not be automated like in most MMOs, so you are stuck sitting there tapping the ""R"" key every few seconds (just like in Skyrim).The combat system is clunky at best for an MMO.  Healing especially is hard to deal with.  After my failed attempts to run a dungeon due to lack of healing, I created a healer and leveled it up enough to do the first dungeon.  It was painful to say the least.  There is no targeting someone and casting a heal spell on them.  Almost all of the heal spells are area of effect based, and target seemingly random wounded allies.  It does not prioritize the most wounded, and with target number limits, more often than not, the people who need healing the most, do not get it.  There are some spells that are single target, however, targeting them is so much more diffficult with this combat system.  Standing still is a no-no in this game, there are always lots of enemy abilities causing you to move.  Casting a spell on another player requires facing them and having your reticule over them when you hit the button.  If they are comstantly moving, it becomes very difficult to actually hit them with your spell.  If they move right as you cast the spell, you instead cast it on yourself, wasting the resources it took to cast it.Those of you that have played previous Elder Scrolls and Fallout games, will know that bugs were commonplace and usually left for the modders to fix.  Apparently that philosophy carries over to the online version as well.  The game is plagued by so many bugs, you would expect it to still be in beta.  I personally experienced a bug that forced me to log out and back in if I killed an enemy using a specific ability.  It left me unable to interact with anything because it thought I was still in combat.  I skimmed through their customer support forums, lots of reported bugs, but I didn't find a single response from their customer service team.My verdict, only play this game if you are interested in the lore, as there is tons of it.  All quests and dialogues are voice acted, which is nice, however, all that voice acting does make the game file size insanely large.  They also reuse previous voice actors.  It felt a little odd hearing one of the commonly used voices from Skyrim in ESO.  Even if you find this game on sale again, it is not worth it.  Judging by the number of guilds full of people dying out due to inactivity, this game will go free to play or shut down completely within a year."
Negative,"Day 4 of trying to play.Got in the game, played it for a bit, bought a membership.game crashed and i had to reboot.Did that... logged in, need a code sent to my email, logged into email and no code, told to try again in 24 hours.contacted support and they don't reply. found out i was banned within the 30 minutes of playing because my name was extremely offensive to the point i had to be instantly and permanently banned without a warning or a ticket to change my name, MIND YOU THEY MONITOR NAMES AND APPROVE THEM PRIOR TO CREATION... SO HOW DID I GO THROUGH THEIR SO CALLED BREACHED TERMS AND CONDITIONS...My name was ""Drunkenelf"" If thats so offensive then why have alcohol in the game? there are literally NPC's stumbling around with ale... bruh"
Negative,"A game is allowed to age with time, but ESO's performance takes a nose dive with each and every patch. Disconnects, dozens of loading screens as you ride your mount from a keep to a satellite resource, stuck in combat bugs, endless bar swop issues and health desyncs.  Oh and the lag.This could have been the MMO to top them all. Instead, it has devolved into a glittering theme park surrounding a cash shop centrepiece. I have over 5,000 hours invested into this game and my last vapours of optimism that the corporate overlords at ZOS will deliver on the ESO performance improvements they have been promising for the past 5 years have evaporated.  It's sad the launch of the Skyrim Chapter will see an inevitable influx of new players. The surge in population will only serve to further cement the development team into this downward spiral of prioritsing new shiny content over meaningful game performance fixes."
Negative,"You can't adequately play this game as a MMO wihout ESO Plus (monthly subscription). You absolutely can play it like a normal Elder Srolls game (done and gone) if you just want to do story and don't care about anything MMO related at all (crafting/farming/trading/collecting/min-maxing).You can do all questlines of the all available zones, some dungeons, etc, but again you still don't have access to almost half of the game without ESO+ or buying each DLC individually (and they cost just stupidly A LOT of money).Also CraftBag (or atleast CraftBank) should be in the main game, otherwise you just pay for convenience."
Negative,"2k Hours in and I think I will give it a negative review. While I have had a great time playing it with basic version only and no sub, game has many flaws, from game design to monetization. How is it possible that buying or getting ""Collection Gold Road"" Edition doesnt unlock every single map and dungeon? That's some kind next level of lack of transparency not to mention pure extremely greedy. 60€ should be enough to get you all content but somehow it doesn't and they dont tell you that, so if you are new you will not know it and will have to refund it because its a waste of money. Basically every single DLC dungeon is locked behind sub unless devs gives them away like they did a few weeks ago.A sub is nearly mandatory due to inventory space, you get what it feels like a ""cheat"", an unlimited crafting bag so you dont have to worry about space issue and such things. On the other hand, you get crowns every month which you will have to use to buy new classes that are included in the Collection edition but not in the sub.Lootboxes, complicated and extremely confusing monetization system starting from Steam store page leads to disappointment.I could name more issues, traditional of mmorpgs, like balancing issues. Latest class, Arcanist feels so strong in pve, that puts to shame some old classes and devs dont seem to care like Nightblade. Then on the other side of the spectrum, Nighblade is one of the meta classes in pvp despite being one of the worst for pve.They tend to ignore feedback or literally not answer to what people say in Test Server forums. In the end is a game I would only recommend for the base game, do main story mission and move on. If you want to do engame or anything else, its extremely hard for a newbie to catch on, expensive and takes too much time which people dont usually have these days."
Negative,"I'e been a fan of TES since finding Morrowind in around 2002, and have been actively playing each installment consistently since then, minus of course the mobile titles. This is just a shame, the ""one huge server"" thing doesnt work at all, it's impossible to find people to speak to as most of the time the zone and world chat is like the Tower of Babel, the zone phasing is pointless and serves nothing than to separate you from friends you want to play with.The game plays like an unresponsive Morrowind, without the charm. The skills in game don't seem to have a decent GCD and you can't ""queue"" skills to be used in succession, while normally this would be fine in a single player game, in an online game with latency, it's important to have some leeway with timing. Multiple times I found the music and ambient sounds just stopping for no reason, I found an Argonian blacksmith with the soundbank of an Orc blacksmith and occasionally my weapon wouldnt make any sound whatsoever when in use, not great for a bow user, especially when half of the time my arrows didn't even appear after being shot.Further to this, the game would often just fail to load an area and I'd be looking at an empty camp for 30 seconds while the game tried to remember who to pop in there, i'd load into an area only to be attacked by enemies that hadn't even rendered on screen yet. Not to mention missing models in game that are just placeholders of a big red box that says ""MISSING"" 3 times down either side, way to break immersion by just not including all resources in the initial download, no Zenimax, i'm not going to trawl your support forum looking for files to drop into my directory. Honestly, if you can bring yourself to download this, which is (I believe) currently one of if not ""the"" biggest download on Steam right now, then try it just to make sure you don't like it, sort of like you would with pegging or dripping chilli sauce onto your eyeball, just make sure you cancel your subscription before you're charged.Having said that, if my £50 helps to develop Fallout 4 or TESVI then I can let it slide. Treat this like you treated Redguard, it just never happened, and we shall never speak of it again."
Negative,Great game. DO NOT BUY THROUGH STEAM.I love the game. But I have constant issues trying to log into the game because there is some issue between steam and ESO that locks a lot of us out of the game randomly. I wish I had never bought the game through Steam. Save yourself the headache. Buy it directly.
Negative,"Like a lot of people, I picked up this game mid-2020. For some reason I had a lot of time on my hands... Funny that. Anyway, I burned through almost a thousand hours of the game during which I- honestly, I don't even remember. The game passed the time, but that was about it. It didn't leave a lasting impression on me one way or the other. I bought some DLC for the game and I did have an ESO+ subscription for a bit, but I never got into the ""true"" endgame content of veteran dungeons and trials. I just sort of... Wasted time? Again, I don't really remember. The game was just so forgettable.It's now 2023 and I hear about a new class being added. So, I reinstall the game and see what I forgot. And, yeah, the game is super forgettable in so far that's it's literally just grind. Every character you make has to go through the same grind of exploring, and questing, and finding skyshards, and training your horse to go faster, and leveling up crafting, and... Ugh. How did I play this for almost a thousand hours? Oh, right, pandemic.If you're already playing the game, you probably aren't looking at reviews. So, really, this is aimed at the people who might want to get into this game almost a decade past launch. And to those people I say... You're a few years too late.The game isn't dead. Certainly. But, for anyone coming fresh into the game, it does feel a bit barren. There are so many places now that outside of a few areas the game doesn't feel at all populated. There's also the issue of DLC bloat. You can either fork over something like $150 in premium currency to buy all the DLC ""forever"" (forever meaning until the game shuts down, whenever that is) or maintain a ESO+ subscription at about $15 a month to have access to all the old DLC. And, yeah, you sort of do need access to it all. DLC doesn't just mean a new area to explore, but rather it means access to dungeons that drop specific sets, specific skill lines, access to specific NPCs and traders, and even something as fundamental as re-crafting set drops.The game feels purposefully built to wring as much money out of you by stringing you along as possible. To give an example- it takes literally half a year to fully upgrade your mount on a single character. You need to log in, talk to an NPC, pay some gold, and then wait till the next day- for 180 days. OR, you could always spend money to buy riding lessons from the premium store!Look, the game isn't ""bad"" and it will certainly waste your time in a, mostly, unremarkable and inoffensive way. But, it's entirely forgettable. It's like mediocre pizza. Yeah, it's pizza, but after you're done with it you'll probably never think about it ever again; it filled a need at a specific time, but that's all.Side note, it's been about three years since I've played and some of the same bugs still exist, are well documented, and have not been patched. I'm not saying the developing company is, at this or any other point, making a cash grab out of an established IP, but I'm not not saying that either."
Negative,"What should I say, this is an absolutely amazing game that unfortunately carries a dark secret.I have been playing this game for a few hours and it is by far one of the best MMORPG games which really emphasises the RPG aspect.I am an old WoW player who sought to find an alternative game when WoW at times become unplayable for various reasons. Compared to WoW, the questing and feeling of progress while leveling is great and it features a rather complex (but unnessesarily timeconsuming) crafting system. The world feels alive and breathing with all the events, mini-bosses and unique campaigns that you come across as you discover the landscapes. The most important aspect of this matter is that old content still is relevant unlike in WoW where previous expansions are just dead content.Since my purpose of getting this game was to find an alternative to WoW, and my primary objective is to engage in end-game content, I started getting gear, finding guilds and learning my class to be able to perform as well as possible. That's where I discovered something I cannot forgive this game for. It is called animation cancelling, and it is a ""feature"" you must utilize in order to perform optimally. Animation cancelling is when you cancel your attack animations in order to get more hits on your target. It is performed by making a light attack and then immedietly use an ability or weapon swap which will remove the animation of the light attack and make you perform both attacks at the same time. It is annoying, boring and doesnt feel like it should be there. I would go as far as to call it a bug, and this is something Zenimax are aware of and choose to ignore. It completely breaks the fun since I cannot build my class the way I want because my abilities must consist of spells that perform well in combination with the animation cancelling.So to summerize it all, this game is absolutely amazing in many ways. It is a blast of an MMORPG and if your main purpose is to explore, quest, discover lore and explore areas, this game is totally for you. On the other hand, I just can't say anything good about the competative part of this game since exploiting animation cancelling ruins all the fun. I advice you to give it a try and see for yourself what you think of it. For me, I cannot look past this exploit and choose other spells and just roll with it, because I will always know that I will perform poorly compared to what I could do. It gives a bad taste in my mouth and I feel like I can never start playing this game again."
Negative,"WARNING! Long review ahead! So, I'm almost reaching 1.5k 4k hours in this game, so I think this review deserves a few tweaks. ESO is most likely the best MMO avaliable nowdays. I'm quite addicted to it and play every single day for hours. It has tons of different types of content and I'm pretty sure everyone will be able to have fun in this game. From the casual RP'er to the sweaty metalords. The community has some toxicity like any other, but in general people are rather nice. And you can always look for guilds that match your playstyle.  The reason why this review is still negative though is for the fact that ESO has a bunch of cashgrabbers that really pisses me off, on top of some things that seem like either sloppiness or lack of planning to me... First of all, let's not forget this is a paid game with a rather expensive membership subscription called ESO+. I mean, in my currency it costs literally the price of the base game per month! And this membership gives you access to all DLCs + the Craft Bag, which gives you unlimited space for crafting resources. And honestly, trying the crafting professions in this game without the Craft Bag is a complete nightmare! There are just too many different resources for you to store, so you will probably never have enough space in your bank + chests to keep all the materials you need and any important items you may want to keep. Also, the DLCs you can access may have exclusive skill lines, and even crafting professions. Oh, and they also hide the huge majority of the meta gear used on late-game content. So ZOS tries to convince you that the membership subscription is fully optional, but actually your experience with this game will be severely limited without it. (I should also add that the most recent chapter is not avaliable for membership users. They sell it separately for the price of a AAA game for an year before adding it to ESO+) On top of the membership thing, the game still has a cash store. Which sells pretty much anything that looks rather decent and a bunch of game helpers/upgrades. I mean, do you want to look nice, have a good looking mount, pet, and NPC assistants in the game you paid for and pay more every month for the membership benefits? Well, don't look foward to getting them in-game, because you will actually have to spend some more money on Crowns to get this stuff... I'm not even talking about those fancy MMO stuff. I'm talking about a regular bear mount, more than one outfit slot, and a personal banker, for example. Not to mention that not only the cash itself is quite overpriced, but the items in the cash store are also very overpriced. I mean, with 340 BRL you can get 14k crowns. For comparison: Elden Ring, recently launched AAA game costs 250 BRL. Those 14k in-game can buy... A big house. Maybe not even that depending on the house. Can also buy a few game upgrades, almost 3 NPC assistants (there are 4 types available, so you can even get them all)...  Honestly ZOS, your crown store really need some tweaks. If the whole store were at 75% off I would consider getting some. I'm sure you would end up selling way more if you give your pixels a less insane price. Also, you have tons of different fancy textures for each type of mount and pet. Show some respect to the consumers paying for your game and spread at least the more basic ones through in-game content. There are only about 3 mounts you can get doing content, and it's always some absurd stuff like doing no-death speedruns on hardmode of the hardest trials... The whole game would feel so much more rewarding if we could get some stuff by questing, or following secret steps like the Bogdog from Blackwood. But you decided to lock everything behind another paywall. I'm also pretty sure it would add a lot to the world building if stables in different regions sold different mounts you know... Now for the worst part: If you want to get decent stuff, you go to the crown store. But if you want actual impressive stuff to show off, you still don't go do content to get it... You gotta go to the goddamn loot boxes........ Yeah, this paid game has a membership plan, a cash store, and in said cash store there's a lootbox store with exclusive and seasonal content! I know it's all cosmetics and all those arguments, but still: you pay for the base game, pay for the membership plan, buy the new chapters, and yet most of the remotely interesting stuff is locked behind a damn lootbox?! This is just bullshit! To try to amenize the lootbox issue they added two things: first are the crown gems that allow you to destroy items you didn't like to turn them into gems, so after spending your whole salary on crates you can destroy enough trash to buy something you like; And then the Endeavors, that allow you to get a small amount of a currency every day, so after about 6 months completing Endeavors' tasks every single day you can buy something nice. Yeah, they are just there so ZOS can say that ""there are ways around the lootboxes""... smh And after all this cashgrab nonsense I still haven't spoken about the sloppy/poorly planned stuff! First, since I was talking about cosmetics, the game loves to blatantly recycle whole models and animations. Mostly for pets and mounts. Countless times I was looking at a seemingly interesting mount from the lootboxes just to realize it's just a painted bear or something. Bruh, even the Blackwood pre purchase mount is just a retextured Senche-Rath... It feels like the game has only about 12 enemy models that they reskin to use on a bunch of places. There's also some issues with the servers. First there are only two megaservers around the world: North America and Europe, what leaves most of the game playerbase in a quite laggy situation. Personaly I've never played this game with a ping lower than 200ms. A game with such a huge playerbase should really have a couple more. And this is clearly not a budget issue, as we can tell from all the cashgrabbers...  And also, the servers are not interconnected at all, so you cannot transfer anything between them. Which means if you have a high level account in NA server, and want to play with your friend who also has a high level account but in EU server, one of you will have to start the whole game again. What not only means losing all your progress, but also any cash item you've ever had! I have a friend who accidentally played on the EU server for over an year before meeting me and my friends who play in NA. And when he tried to contact ZOS to transfer all his stuff to our server (including tons of crowns he bought) they simply told him that nothing could be done! Come on, interconnected servers were already a thing on very old free-to-play MMO's.  But I guess they are just too busy improving the cashgrabbers to improve the game itself... Not to mention it has only four languages avaliable, leaving tons of people in the dark when trying to play it. Honestly I find all this nonsense inexcusable for a paid game with a membership subscription."
Negative,"Legitimately the most predatory systems I've seen in any MMO still being run by the original publishers. Holds inventory space hostage, employs arbitrary timers and restrictions on shops and crafting to ensure daily logins, extortionate cash shop with lootboxes and to top it all off, disrespects established Elder Scrolls lore. Bugs persist for years before being addressed, if at all. Quality of life features are non-existent. This game does not respect your time in any way."
Negative,"This game has come a long way from where it was on it's premature release. It can offer a lot of fun in exploration and story but it falls stale in so many places that I often find myself frustrated too much of the time. It's unrealistic to believe this to ever be as good as Bethesda's single player masterpieces but I still expect more from my favorite company's legacy which causes me to have to thumbs down it till it better meets those expectations hopefully. I kinda wish there was a Neutral option. At an On-Sale price I would recommend it.🐾 PvE:Equipment drops are heavily RNG (random). It can be painfully impossible to get the dungeon set you want, even simple unpopular ones, since there're no PvE token systems like many of the best MMOs already offer. Gear caps at ""CP"" Lv.160 which is a veteran level reached after hitting Lv.50. Drops are generally useless below that. This creates a VERY negative atmosphere when a Lv. 160 player is farming for drops and queues into a group with someone below Lv.160. It creates a problem where the lowbie player is basically a parasite that slows down the group offering nothing in return since if he gets the drop the Lv.160 player has sought for 100 runs it's useless to him since it'll be a Lv. 10 item. To remedy this problem players will often kick lowbies immediately. There's no jewerly crafting. Obtaining purple/gold jewerly takes forever/impossible.Crafting trait research time-gating sucks. Takes upwards to an entire month to research one trait depending on how many you researched. Can only research a max of 3 at a time per profession.The Dungeon Queue system is extremely broken. It will often kick the entire group after joining along with a multitude of other bugs. If a bug causes you to have to re-queue you're stuck with a 15 minute wait penalty.If you're a DPS (which everyone is) the queue times are eternal, which is worsened when the queue finally pops only to bug out. (This is why Holy Trinity systems suck) If you aren't a META DPS build or close to it your damage is terrible. Everyone wants to play DPS but few are very good. There're so few healers and tanks that the queue is often literally 1-3 seconds as one. You're better off just make-shifting your DPS into a hybrid healer/tank to get him anywhere, although the Marrowind resource nerfs coming up may make that difficult to do.The game's practually Pay2Play considering how limited your inventory is because it suffocates you in attempt to make you buy ESO Plus: 15 dollar subscription: Because it gives you a crafting bag (and soon double bank space) that endlessly sinks all your thousands/millions of crafting items into it. There's no free limited version of this bag like other games offer for free or even a permanant purchasable version. Inventory upgrades are limited to 240 account wide bank, 200 character (including 60 days of mount inventory training). Very small, very expencive.Player housing is also restricted to ESO plus if you actually want to have a decent amount of room to build. Limit is small regardless and housing offers no storage space.There's no way to personally organize your bank/inventory. It's all crammed into one spot: A missed opportunity with housing.They push the need for ESO plus so much that it feels like it steps all over people who prefer to just buy the DLC outright like I did.ESO simply begs for many Quality of Life features but they leave that to player add-ons to fix, and the game is untoleratable without certain add-ons.You have to join a guild that won a bid on an Guild Store location to sell your items on the ""Auction House."" Limit 30 items per 1 of 5 guilds. Many crafting items sell to NPC merchants for 0 gold making them useless unless you let them pile up and sell on guild store when you finally have a store slot for it.Achievement Points are useless. This also make completing all the quest rather pointless reward-wise when you don't need XP anymore or have enough CP levels to not care as much.Story choices don't matter much. Well, except that multiple skill point one I think.Justice system is rather simple. Get caught stealing/murdering and NPCs molest you and that's all.Your overall damage is based on your Max Stamina or Max Magicka making many skills useless on certain builds. All Class's stamina builds generally play the same.Light/Heavy attack animation is dull.Bows do terrible damage. It is not useful as a primary weapon. Sorry Wannabe-Archers. You'll actually be kicked for trying.Fishing has no mini-game.No diving underwater.🔪 PvP:Enjoying PvP is near impossible till you spent 60 days training your time-gated mount's speed.Mount training isn't account wide. Have fun logging into every character to herass the stablemaster every day.Cyrodiil runs like crap and is full of bugs and memory leaks.You have to grind PvE for PvP gear.PvP gear just = a trait that has little to no use in PvE but a lot of use in PvP causing you to need 2 sets of gear in a game that hates giving you inventory space or the drops you need.Power difference between levels is gigantic. Prepare to be 1-2 shot for most of your innocent life.Aldmeri Domonion and Ebon Pact players: Stay off the Bridge, it doesn't help the faction. Bridge should be removed.Animation canceling is required. Shouldn't be, but everyone uses it and will expect you to.The game has Execute skills (more damage on lower HP targets) that essentially make a 3rd of your HP bar pointless since you'll get nuked, instantly trigger execute, and die.Play Magicka Sorcerer High Elf for free, easy kills.💊 Misc Stuff: This game just simply loads slow in general compared to other games regardless of PC specs or ISP. It's not very optimized. I can probably blame that on Consoles. They gotta keep the game dumbed down so it can play on both PC and Console.Don't dottle too long making your character... the idle disconnection function isn't disabled there. The idle dc timer is kinda annoying in general. I feel like it's too short, but whatever.This game seems to simply HATE certain people and disconnects them randomly -constantly. It's a complete mystery to the entire community why this happens.The Mail system just straight up confuses me. For some reason when you buy something or are sent mail for whatever reason the time you receive it is completely random. Sometimes instant, sometimes a few minutes, sometimes it take so long you have to force it to come to you by changing zones or relogging. You have to click delete and then confirm delete for every single mail one at a time no matter what kind it is. It's annoying and takes forever. I have to use an add-on to remove the confirm box. Still doesn't give me a delete-all option for everything without an item/gold attached.Not being able to interact with gathering nodes, chest, food in inventory, NPCs, -just about anything while in combat, or while your party member is in combat (no matter what distance he is from you) regardless of whether anything has even hit you or not... is annoying. My god is it annoying. I don't even know how to explain how annoyed it makes me feel.You can't move or travel easily with UI windows open as they pause your character.  Opening Menu while doing an action like gathering, an emote, etc cancels it. (requires add-on)You can't dye costumes without ESO Plus: Which is just stupid.You can't reskin armor/weapons or dye your weapons. All end-game weapons look like filthy red dog d***s cuz they're made of ruby ore.Size matters if you wanna reach the cheese on top shelf easier.Can't buy majority of the new cash shop cosmetics directly. Game wants you to gamble with 60+ dollars of RNG loot boxes instead. Cash shop items aren't tradeable.This game does have a teleport to friend/guildy feature usable from anywhere with no gold cost. Probably the best (only) amazing QoL feature in the entire game.I'm outa space now. Get out. 🖐"
Negative,"Kk at 5000+ hours Pros:meet cool people semi fun content ( grind if you want )lots of collectables(you may find that some are free but they push the crown store HARD and buying crates and stuff trust me)Cons:constant changes, they are unable to fix their own servers and issues that appear on them.you farmed for these sets? we the developer want you you go farm other sets because we just realised after years that these sets are to good, not when we released them ( like the community and testers have said they are but when we want to).Like to gamble , welcome to t he crown store and crown crates where the drop rates are so low you can spend $100's and not get that one epic item you want . (don't worry we wont post the drop rates we don't want you to know how much we are trying to dig into your pocket.)Server LAG... JESUS you guys haven't fixed it since 2014 ( a billion dollar company ... and you make more that that i know it don't lie to look good you look stupid when you lie not good). Features that should be in the game will will put behind a paywall. ( Craftbag and such things)Even if you unlock all the bag space in the world guess what? there is more mat types than bag space type... looks like you will have to pay for Eso+ if you wish for a good time. Guess what did you report a error that happens constantly? ( we don't care. Wayrest sewers . even if everything is dead you are stuck in combat and cant move to the next area. go into stealth and wait for a  minute and then you can progress. notice how i said if everything is dead. Wayrest isn't a Dlc dungeon it's base game.)let me talk about dungeons being broken Ever play a game and not queue dungeons because if you get certain one at certain bosses the game will crash? welcome to Elder Scrolls Online . where for a couple weeks Lich bosses had the right to crash your game and nothing was done about it,( not days weeks.)hey guys we just got a good idea lets keep the crown store running but let's not fix problems that are being reported on the forums. i literally know at least 50 people that have played this game and they quit this game. this game is risky and not the good kind of risky. i mean not to sound mean or disrepsectful . i should have know this game would run up **** creek ( i censored myself). from how you guys treat gaming and your community in general it shows you care about money and money alone I personally don't care like i said July is the end for me ( if i could refund the sub money my friend paid  you bet it would be done without a blink of an eye)i say invest in the game if you want to i did when i thought it was a good idea , i changed my mind now and you can bet when my sub ends no sub from me i own enough dlc that if i want to go back and play i can but for now as Randy Jackson used to say ... It's gunna be a no for me DAWG."
Negative,Great quests and open world.Criminal market system designed to trick new players into spending the in-game money you have to spend real money on (but can earn in game) on stupid things you can get easily.
Negative,"Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will ""sell"" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really."
Negative,"As a total elder scrolls lore nerd (I actually sit and read the books in daggerfall/morrowind/oblivion/skyrim out of genuine interest if that helps paint a picture) I figured I would run through the chapters of ESO and see what they're all about. It has some fun moments but 90% of the questing in this game is an absolute chore of just mashing the same attack on mobs over and over. I played through the entire base game story and a few of the minor dlcs but it never really hooked me. I couldn't name a single character or mission in particular that was memorable or fun, so I don't see any indication that I would enjoy any of it further. Character progression doesn't really seem to be very interesting either -- everything scales to you so there's not really any reason to seek out new gear or skills, the numbers kept getting higher but the gameplay never felt any different from level 1 to level 50. I guess if you are into PvP and want to grind dungeons for gear you might enjoy it, but my brain kinda just rejects grinding in games and wants to do literally anything else after like 10 minutes so that's not for me.I leave this review with almost complete and total apathy toward both this game and the franchise's future in general."
Negative,"Was literally the best mmo with the most fun combat system. Crafting was unique and well made. Every expansion was awesome filled with dungeons and puzzles. Made great friends with this game. But with every game... the devs pushed out all creativity. They watered down and kept watering down and kept watering down all uniqueness. Eventually there was no difference between a magic character or a melee. The fun came out of creative builds but when everyone runs the exact same thing no matter class or range it isnt fun. (if they fixed it I would love to come back but now its a memory of once was.) We overlooked lag, latency, performance, and lack of content for months at a time cause we believed in the combat system."
Negative,"HEED MY WARNING:     In the steam shop it appears that the whole game content is distributed between the base game and the 3 DLCs (Morrowind, Summerset and Elsweyr chapters), costing around 60 dollars, which is a reasonable price...  But... ITS A TRAP!  There are plenty of other DLCs, whole maps and dungeons which are only available if you buy them with real money (crowns) once inside the game, resulting a cost of 100+ dollars if you want to unblock all of the content, or if you pay for a monthly subscription (around 10$ each month).  The DLCs that arent included in the Steam shop (which it should at least inform the players of all the existing DLCs, besides the 3 main ones, instead of us finding out once the game has already being bought).  The DLCs that arent listed in the steam shop are are:   - Imperial city DLC   - Orsinium DLC   - Thieves guild DLC   - Dark brotherhood DLC   - Shadows of the hist DLC   - Horns of the reach DLC   - Clockwork city DLC   - Dragon bones DLC   - Wolfhunter DLC   - Murkmire DLC   - Wrathstone DLC  and the upcoming:   - Scale breaker DLC   - Dragonhold DLCBETHESDA has truly become one of the most mischievous, money driven, and cheap companies on the market. They constantly lie to its customers and will keep doing so; dont buy any of their content, ever."
Negative,"I cant honestly recommend this game. I have enjoyed the few hours of it that i have played, but i have come to realize, that while this game is not technically pay to win, its at least pay to enjoy.After  playing my character to level 18 or so, i have come to realize that crafting is essential to success in this game. The problem with that is that unless you are a plus member, paying for a monthly subscription, your inventory and the amount of crafting supplies you can carry, is limited to the point that crafting becomes such an inconvenience that i would imagine many just give up and buy the subscription. Of course you can always buy a house and storage containers for it, the problem with that being that eso house prices are crazily expensive unless you buy crowns in the crown store for actual cash or are an eso plus member who gets free crowns.Finally, if this were an elder scrolls game, i might just compromise my principles on pay to play games and just buy an eso plus sub, but it isnt an elder scrolls game its an mmo, imagine WoW with an elder scrolls skin.So in short, if you are looking for an elder scrolls game, imo this isnt one and if you do buy eso, be prepared to pony up for a sub if you plan to have your character be a success in the world.That said, it is a fun game and if it werent for the pay to enjoy aspect of an ongoing sub, i probably would have already bought at least one or two of the dlc. Also i am still trying to get access to the forums and bethesda has so far not responded to my emails, so be aware that being part of the community of players may not be something that bethesda makes easy for you."
Negative,"Disgusted if their T&Cs state that they will sell your personal information to third parties. I don't sign up for that kinda stuff, this ain't Google and err 'free' android excuses. We've all paid for this game and NOT for third party abuse of our data (which is often hacked and ends up being sold on, on the dark web..FACT). Furious actually. Do I get a refund for not agreeing to these T&Cs, well do I?"
Negative,"If you're in Australia, NZ or anywhere in the Oceanic region and you want to play PVP, strongly suggest you do NOT buy this game because there is no such thing as Zenimax Oceanic servers... For some, the rubber banding is so bad that PVE isn't even possible."
Negative,Re-enable crown gifting you greedy bastards
Negative,Got banned after like 4 days for no reason. Completely unable to appeal or even contact customer support because the website either bugs out or puts me in a redirect loop. Absolute joke.
Negative,Do NOT buy from Steam. Buy directly from ZOS. No support from Steam and ZOS when game login stops working *only* for Steam users. AVOID STEAM.
Negative,"I played this game for roughly 800 hours. Then they decided my character name Badtouchuncle was offensive. Permanent ban without warning, when I wrote back saying I'd simply change the name - they stated that my offences were so bad that they were simply permanently banning my account. That is literally all they were banning me for. Cest la vie, but buyer beware. Instead of giving a warning, they may decide to simply permanently ban an account, no appeal, no discussion. Check it out online, there are many stories such as mine, they have very light fingers on permanent bans."
Negative,there is another 20gb added after steam download.. this has caused me to be unable to recieve a refund because the download has taken longer than 2hrs and steam has detected this as gameplay.  steam needs to look into this as this is just not acceptable not everyone in the world can own a fibre connection.
Negative,"This is a great game, but in its current state its impossible to recomend. The balance for the past several years has been terrible. Powerful fun class defining skills get nerfed, and the most imbalanced gear sets ever get added and remain untouched for years. Most importantly the servers just do not function when they need to. Playing in cyrodil in primetime is a nightmare, and its not much better outside of primetime.  This game sits on a pile of lost potential, but now they only want to drive you to the crown store. Skip on it and replay skyrim if you need an elder scrolls fix. It's a better game."
Negative,"Let's start with the good. The combat is enjoyable for an MMO. The graphics are great. There's lots of story, if unfortunately a quantity over quality thing. Crafting is extensive. And that's all the praise I can think of for it, now the bad.First and foremost, the level scaling is poorly implemented. It's sophisticated, it works, and it makes having a level system pointless. There is no sense of progression with the system, however there is a constant sense of regression as every level gained makes you weaker until you get level relevant gear. Crafting resources also scale to the player, which causes problems if you want to use a high level character for quick gathering. Honestly, the game would be more enjoyable if levels were removed entirely since they serve no purpose beyond making equipment obsolete.The game mechanics revolve around the end game. Lvl's 1-50 are a thing to rush through as quickly as possible to get past what is now the worst part of the game, only after that all there is left is grinding more numbers.Inventory management is atrocious unless you subscribe. If you enjoy crafting, forget it unless you are willing to pay an overpriced subscription fee. If you don't want to spend more time managing inventory than playing the game either pay up or stop looting.Sharing resource nodes and treasure chests. Not all world loot is shared, but having to race other players to a chest or crafting resources leaves players resenting other players being in the game. Most modern games understand that forcing players to compete for loot does not endear them to the idea of playing together and cooperating, nor does it make the community friendly. Fortunately loot from kills and events are not shared and each player gets their own, but it is still a terrible oversight.Story. The quantity over quality approach to quests and content combined with the mechanics revolving around the end game leaves players rushing through dialogue in order to check off the next quest. It doesn't help that the writing is verbose, bland, and repetitive (occasionally has its moments, but rarely) and does a disservice to all the animation and voice acting that went into the game.The cash shop makes it feel more like a F2P with freemium options, with inventory management being the biggest offender. The cosmetics in the cash shop are well priced and have a decent variety, but then the ability to dye costumes is locked behind a subscription. Housing is a massive cash sink but is also easily ignored. Then the mounts all cost $10-20. Aside from a bit of price gauging, this could have been overlooked if it wasn't for the fact that dying costumes and crafting material storage are only available with an overpriced subscription. This is also a bit dishonest since the game advertises itself as buy once play forever  but in fact is balanced to be a miserable experience unless you subscribe.Edit:Just to clarify, I'm not against the idea of level scaling, but I believe the way it was implemented is terrible."
Negative,"From someone who has played this game for a long time, here's how it falls out.ProsScenery. There's no doubt that this is a beautiful game, even having been around for so long. It's even a nice place to just go for a walk.Somewhat related to scenery, it has an excellent, up-to-date graphics system that still looks very good.The player community. For the large part, I have had a much better experience with the people I've met in this game vs most others (such as WoW, which has a mostly mean, grouchy, self-entitled player base).Voice acting. Every exchange with every NPC is voice acted by (mostly) people that are good at it. A handful of them stand out as simply marvelous. Cadwell, voiced by John Cleese, is wonderful, as is Malcolm McDowell as Molag Bal. Plenty of other good ones, too, including Robin Atkin Downes of Babylon 5 fame and Mary Faber as Eveli Sharp-Arrow. Kate Beckinsale as Queen Ayren, is not good, despite the name recognition, delivering every line in the same uninterested monotone. This may be the fault of the director. Who knows? There are also many exchanges that are beautifully acted by those with less name recognition, but who do a great job.Excellent crafting system that makes sense.Dungeons. With a good group and good gear, they can be fun and challenging.General game play is handled pretty well. The game engine usually handles large groups of people and NPCs/monsters doing their own thing all at the same and manages to keep up.Good quest and dialog writing. Most of the quests have a little more to them than ""Go fetch me 10 of this random item"" or ""go kill 12 of these bad guys"" like some other MMOs. A lot of the quests here have actual substance and an interesting story (although, granted, there are some of those errand quests and kill-this-many quests). Their character dialog is usually good, too, and on occasion, downright excellent.The game has generally good playability. Quests are initially interesting and challenging.Excellent add-on support and a good add-on community.ConsItems may vanish from your inventory, never to return. Don't expect help from support - they assume that their code is correct, not you. (Note that their support reps are usually very nice people - they are just not empowered to help you in these cases). Many other players have reported similar issue. However, when reported, they are merely dismissed.If you want to do any crafting, you are pretty much locked into paying the subscription of $15/mo. Without it, you can't hang onto enough crafting mats to accomplish anything.If you want to purchase items in the Crown store, they're always overpriced. You always feel that, ""well, I really want that, but wow, is that expensive for a few animated pixels."" You may catch an occasional sale that makes some items more approachable, but many of those sales only apply to people paying the monthly subscription fee. Worst jumping mechanics of any game ever created.Devs routinely lock you out of parts of the zone by placing invisible walls that make no sense. This is insanely frustrating when you're just walking along and you can't go any further for no good or apparent reason.They're running out of ideas. While the Blackwood zone in the most recent expansion was beautiful, scenery-wise, it had little in it that was original and interesting. The zone story was a long cliché that not many people actually cared about. Most of my friends still haven't bothered with it.Crafting of gear has been made largely pointless by other additions to the game such as farmed gear and monster sets, which are much, much better. Crafted gear is now only useful for beginning characters.Devs occasionally change the game system and screw the players over. The recent Champion Point System overhaul is a good example. Many of your previously useful champion points go completely wasted unlocking the route to the CP skills you really want. This does not count the many minor nerfs they do all the time.Stuga. Most annoying NPC ever created, and they refuse to turn her off. ""But she'll go away if you just do her quest!"" I've done it 8 times. I'm not doing it again.Disk space. Be prepared to sacrifice 100+ GB of your disk drive for this beast.While ESO has a lot to offer, some of their deficiencies are deal-breakers. If I work hard to get a rare item and it vanishes, I have a hard time forgiving that, especially when they imply I'm lying and won't return it. If I invest time in a game and they dramatically change it for the worse, nullifying a lot of that work, I feel like I wasted precious hours of my life. If I want something from the store, I don't want to feel cheated by the cost. Time to move on to something better."
Negative,"Gifted from a friend and over 5000 hours, the game used to be good. Keywords; used to be. > Performance issues galore. Support will blame you, your internet, or your computer (not just with specs) before actually helping you troubleshoot the problem. > The community has gotten to a point where it's politically toxic and raiding guilds have to have their drama with their raids. In fact I've been through most communities and it's like a YouTube comments section.> With so many core concepts of the classes changed as well as how original UI designs worked, they decided to fix something that wasn't broke instead of fixing things that were ACTUALLY broke.> Exploiters and bots run rampant (Jessica and Gina say they squash them, but I haven't seen a Gamemaster since I was gifted the game and that's more than a year).> The need for cash grabbing- I've seen so many limited exclusive offers that cost more than some of the DLC. A mount shouldn't be worth 40 bucks.> Endgame there's nothing fun to do. Raids? Been there, done those. Not enough to call it endgame. PvP? When it works it's fun, but with ZoS unbanning a lot of exploiters why bother?> Subbing went from optional to near mandatory due to inventory management. ""Oh you can manage it without!"" Sure, if you use character slots to mule around and have maybe four or so playable characters.> RNG. Orsinium's been out over a year and some people still haven't gotten their drop they need to remain competative in PvE.> Inconsequential storytelling; Side quests are rarely memorable. Main quests the only thing that were good was the voice actors. Missed opportunities with storytelling- especially with Morrowind.> Moderation inconsistencies. Again, they unban exploiters all the time and they can't keep botters banned yet claim they have systems and algorithms to detect these things and that they would be met with harsh consequences. I could go on and on, but I'm not going to. I'll go in and visit with the friends that I made, but I'm not going to recommend this. If I wanted crap that this game offers, I'd play WoW."
Negative,"**Steam asked to revised review based on additional hours, so ok - my revised review is identical to prior comments. Love/hate relationship - ESO is still great game, but also still plagued with frequent lag, both in PVE and PVP - especially prime time and/or events. If you know ESO, you know how constant and frequent events are, so it's not event lag is a rare unicorn once/twice a year.Big balance changes that keep cementing at least the perception, if not actual reality, that devs have no actual ""standards"", or ""plan"" - just massive buff then nerf, buff again then nerf rinse and repeat cycle.Bottom line still the same - if you've invested lots of friendship and social connections, would be waste to quit. But any new user that has never invested 1 hour of time or have any in-game friends, guilds, trial cores to lose, then advice is find another MMO to invest your time in. That new MMO might be worse, but ESO is basically a known mixed bag for veteran players, and new players that have nothing to lose might as well try a new MMOLove - hate relationship with the game. Over 7700+ hrs in last 6.5 years so obviously, game is still worth playing. But why the overall don't recommend rating?Because if you are current player with lots of time invested, characters built up, etc - then might be worth sticking around to hope the devs finally stop making massive balance swings to hugely rebuff what they had just hugely nerfed after the massive buff before that - with the laughable explanation they have a vision to equalize 'standards' across the game.If you are a new player who hasn't sunk anything yet into the game, stay away, find a better MMO. The core issue with ESO for a long running stretch is absolutely atrocious performance at times (server lag, desyncs, rubber banding, etc), with now PVE affected and not just PVP, and a dev team that constantly redesigns the game every 6 months. Change in an MMO is no big deal, happens all the time, but ESO devs have clearly no grand plan and just swing the massive redesign hammer willy nilly hoping one day they will strike gold.3/10 rating"
Negative,"Hey there, I've been playing Elder Scrolls Online off and on for years. Despite that, I've never really posted a review for it.The best way I can put it is an interesting, fun game overburdened by microtransactions and predatory marketing. What Elder Scrolls Online does well is used sparingly, and usually anything and everything that players are enticed with are usually locked behind the payment of real currencies.Despite it being 'Buy to Play' in which there's an optional subscription I wouldn't believe what it's marketed as. You'll be playing at a handicap compared to players whom are subscribed. But don't think that subscribing will allow you to forego all issues, as it's simply the next step in their scheme to get you to pay more and more; for digital items. When you subscribe you're given 1,500 crowns (read: monthly currency used for items) so that you can buy things on their store. However the majority of the things you may buy are intended to systematically gut you with a sizeable amount left over, and simultaneously be out of reach for things that are actually interesting.That's not touching on the idea and practice of loot crates.Outside of that, there's a lot of issues with the game right now. Yes, it's fun, but it's also resembling a post-apocalyptean landscape. With the release of U35 and U36 (aforementioned updates to the game) there's been a huge upset to people playing, and overall made playing harder, leading to an exodus of veterans in both PvP and PvE. Where there used to be a bunch of guilds interacting and playing with one another only few now remain, effectively conglomerates to survive. People who've been wanting and advocating, insisting for verifiable, positive change are usually ignored.Like, don't get me wrong: It's a fun game to come back to. But the entire modus operandi of the game is a skinner box. It's intended to make you pay for things you don't need, and put excessively timegated restrictions on things that you'd like to do.Some leads take actual months to find. Some skill grinds are horrifically long and tiring.It doesn't help that the store actually has upgrades that aren't aesthetic, effectively making the game pay to win, but I've already explained that.In my own conclusion: Play it for a bit, get it on sale, don't fall for expansions. And then take a long, long break from it. It isn't that good compared to World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV -- It's competitors -- and both are more respectful of your time and money, too!"
Negative,"As much as I want to recommend this game, I just can't. The storylines, crafting, and combat are top notch but the whole experience is ruined with overwhelming monetization and poor support. If you want to buy and own all the content in this game, be aware that not all of it is listed in the Steam store. You have to buy the base game/package then open the in-game store to see even more content to buy if you want to access all the areas/dungeons/etc. On top of that you'll have to buy every expansion when it comes out or you can skip all that and just pay a flat monthly fee. Normally I'm fine with a game like this asking for a monthly fee for more content but what's also included is a crafting bag which allows you to store your crafting items and this is the only way to access it. There is no flat fee you can pay for this service permanently, meaning that players who pay monthly will always have an advantage in crafting as your bank space is limited and there are a lot of crafting items. There's loads of other convenience/cosmetic items in the shop too but that's pretty much expected out of MMOs these days. Despite all this, I decided to give this game another shot to play with a friend. I played this game back in the open beta and wasn't terribly impressed at first. After it was released I eventually picked it up and played it for a while but didn't really get hooked. Every time I've tried to play this game I've had issues with the launcher always needing to repair the game files with pretty much every major update. I put it down for many years and now I finally came back to it and I'm still having the same issues with the launcher. I was able to get it to run only to find out that I don't have access to the Warden class which is a part of the now free Morrowind expansion. I have waypoints all around the map included in this expansion, yet I don't have access to all the content included in it. When I tried to contact support I was prompted to sign in. Trouble is that none of my login info worked and after clicking around and finding out how to sign in with Steam, I was kicked out of the submit ticket screen and I was still being prompted to sign in and was still unable to do so.I hope that newer players don't have the same experience I did and I really wish I could recommend this title for its excellent environment and atmosphere but its blatant anti-consumer features foul the whole thing. If you're really invested in playing this game be prepared to reach a point where you will be heavily encouraged to start paying monthly and still constantly bombarded with reminders that the in-game shop exists and you can spend more money in it."
Negative,"I love the elder scrolls franchise, I love the lore of it all and i love how this game expands upon it.The way your class skills and talents are a nice shakeup from similar mmos, namely WoW, it still feels somewhat rigid in terms of what you can do with your class but it is still very fun and grants a lot of replayabilityThe game however is way too expensive,needing to pay money for things like crafting material bags and small quest lines is what ruins it for me. It feels punishing too because the default zones are really forgettable compared to what's offered in the DLC. I love the idea of this game, I dislike the way it executed in terms of dlc, larger expansions with more content would simply be better. It is for this reason that I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to new players unless they large amounts of cash to burn."
Negative,"Pay for the base gamePay for the yearly expansionsPay for lots of DLCs or subscribe to ESO+ which gives you access to all DLCs (but not to the most recent expansion) for the duration of your subscriptionOptional: pay for Outfits, Housing, Skins, Mounts, ... in the Crown Store (ingame shop)Get outdated Graphics but also bad performanceIncredibly plain looking attacks/skillsBad server connection (+100 ping from Germany to ""EU""-Server)Beware of the Crown Store, some item descriptions are missing crucial information, some are misleading, few are plain lying. Crown Store items are apparently not refundable.Mediocre quests, few bad ones, few good ones, all in all mediocreFriendly and alive community (2020)Good Events"
Negative,"Bear with me. Chapters are expansions, dlcs are seasons, so if you buy one you don't get the other, but they never REALLY tell you this. So if you buy just the base game you get also the Morrowind chapter; but if you get ESO+, the subscription service, you temporarily unlock the DLCs and you also get Crowns to spend on the Crown Store that  allow you to buy the Seasons but not the expansions, those are sold separately. Everything is buried in terminology and jargon, purposefully to mislead you into spending money on the wrong thing so you spend more to get what you actually wanted. Not to mention it also feels like the original idea got diced into bite-size-sold-individually-pieces. Edit:  After another 40 hours in this game, I can safely say that it has enough paywalls to make any maze game blush. Edit 2:  And now after 100 hours I can safely say this game is timegated up the ass with full force; and that's just bullshit."
Negative,"Game is overpriced. Pandering DLC's. Overpriced addons. The base game is DECENT. Mind you, I've played across platforms since beta. They sell DLC home's for storage in game for 80$... But on top of stealing your money for a good play experience- they also sell all of your data including your geolocation, billing info, email, name, and more. Read the privacy agreement and see if you still feel comfortable giving this lackluster company your money and information. Disgraceful."
Negative,"You want a manageable inventory? Too bad, get a monthly subscription or inventory management is going to be your main struggle in this game.Annoying people with little inventory space, making the game tedious in that way to get to your wallet is just plain wrong imo.Huge fan of the series, hoped more of this."
Negative,"I think after around 400 hours of playing it's time for me to write a review.First off, I'd like to say I LOVE this game. Especially since I've been a big skyrim fan ever since I got that game. But despite me loving ESO I just cannot recommend it to anyone except if you're rich, patient, live in NA, be familiar to laggy servers and have played at least one other elder scrolls title. Here's why:Unless you wish to grind forever and play the constant mini-game called ""Oh shit what do I throw out now"", you'll need ESO+. Yes, it's a subscription. To me, a subscription in a game is a big no no. For a year long subscription they're asking you to pay a little under 12£. I play almost all my games for around 2-3 years, so if you were to have ESO+ for 2 years that would be around 250€. That's quite a bit of money, not to mention the CHAPTERS aren't included in ESO+, so you'll have to buy them seperatly in order to get newly released chapters, or you could just wait 1 year before they release a new chapter and the previous one becomes a dlc. So if you wish to get access to new chapters once it releases, you'll have to pay 40€ for each new chapter, that'll be 80€ for two new chapters (one each year). If you also got the game full price, you payed another 20£. Now we're up at 350€. Imagine how much you could buy with 350€.Not to mention how horrible their crown store is. If you ever want a cool looking cosmetic, polymorph or skin, you'll get it in the crown store. You won't find it in the vanilla game. There are some decent looking cosmetics but you'll only get them from dlcs and chapters. If you want more of a taste of how bad their crown store is, if you ever wanted to change your name you'd have to pay 2500 crowns. Which is around 20€ FOR A NAME CHANGE ON A CHARACTER! Also, their SMALL houses are around 2250 crowns, which means you'd have to pay 20€ for a pathetically small house. This is with the house UNFURNISHED, which means you have to get the furniture itself later on. This isn't even the worst of it. They sometimes release ""special"" houses that cost an insane amount of crowns. One of their ""special"" houses furnished will cost you around 15,000-18,750 crowns. That's more than 85€! Which is sick for A HOUSE in a GAME!Now you may wonder, can you get these ""special houses"" with in-game gold? Nope. Crowns only. But if you want a big house you can get manor houses that all are around 3,780,000+ gold. If you didn't already figure, this will take you forever to get. Moving on, if you ever want to have access to important things like the jewlery crafting station and the transmute station you'll need summerset for jewlery crafting, clockwork dlc for a transmute station, or you need a rich friend or you need to be in a guild with a rich leader with a guildhall that has access to these stuff. As for antiquities, you'll need to buy greymoor.Last but not least let's talk about the devs and their HORRIBLE servers. Players have complained since forever to make them fix their server issues, what they do instead is they ban all threads in the official ESO forums that complain about server problems. Which is just pathetic. Their servers have extreme ping spikes (especially in PvP) and huge skill delays which is super annoying and can really ruin your flow. Instead of fixing server issues or bugs they instead add new things like pets and cosmetics to the crown store. Clap clap. I've heard the NA servers are better and a lot of people from EU decide to play in NA even though the ping there is higher for EU people.At last, I would like to tell if you decide to buy this game, get a sugar dadd.. High level player to help you out by crafting you exp gear and teaching you game mechanics. When I started it was really confusing at first. Im so happy that I had high level friends who helped me at the start."
Negative,"Cheap nostalgia bait ""chapters"" with the content of a WoW .5 PATCH for the cost of an expansion, the greediest micro-transaction store I've ever seen. Writers who're so TERRIFIED that you might do the zones in the wrong order that they refuse to both advance the timeline and properly acknowledge your previous deeds.The upcoming chapter, Necrom, comes as they announce they'll but cutting two DLC's this year. They're even bringing in a new class because that's what their over-moderated hugbox of a forum seemed to want (Though now they've announced it, that's stopped being the case as people ask where the Spellcrafting they promised almost a decade ago is).ZOS is working on other projects, ESO is on maintenance mode with a skeleton crew pushing out cheap chapters full of nostalgia bait and absolutely nothing of substance that steps on the lore over and over again. Ever wanted to fight and defeat a Daedric prince? YOU CAN DO THAT TO THREE OF THEM HERE.I used to love this game but it's been in steadly decline since Morrowind and the chapter system became a thing in 2017. If you MUST play then the vanilla zones, Orsinium, Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood are all really good (Though the latter two have a frustrating grind behind them).Does the pvp look fun to you? It's not. There are two builds. Unkillable wet noodle and oneshot ganker. Pick your poison. It's also the most unstable thing in the game in a way that'd make early access MMO's blush.But surely the dungeons must be fun, right? No. They're the worst in the genre. If you want fun dungeons go play, god forbid, World of Warcraft. I hate them regardless but even I can see they're better than the trite ESO CHARGES for.Ah but I heard the lore was good! Oh yeah there's some gems. But there's also a ton of catastrophes to races like the Dunmer and higher concept stuff like the Daedric Princes. Also it's NOT CANON. At all. Sure ZOS say it is, but do you really thing Bethesda's gonna put this trash in TES:VI? Maybe. If they do I'll personally mod out EVERY SINGLE REFERENCE I find because the vast VAST Majority of Elder Scrolls Online lore is GARBAGE that destroys the setting at every turn. It's not canon and never will be.Maybe one day ZOS'll stop whale hunting and start making a good game but by then their next project will be done and ESO'll finally be taken out back and shot like it should've been before launch.Thanks for reading. :)"
Negative,"This game is a prime example of why RPG's and MMORPG's are two totally different genres. This is without question an MMO, this is not the same as a stand alone ES game. If that is what you are looking for keep moving. As MMO's go it is beautifully conceived, with living background a gorgeous visuals. It also has exciting combat that contrasts against the usual cool-down monotony of WOW clones. The quests are original and entertaining. With so much positivity what could be wrong? It isn't Elder Scrolls VI. It's that simple. Immersion is  constantly and consistently broken in over-populated dungeons with scores of other ""one of a kind hero’s"" slaying spiders. Let's talk about loot for a second, I was so excited when I took out my first enemy, I only got 1 gold, but that was okay it was my first level. At level five, I was still getting the 1 gold coin at level 10 I wasn't even shocked anymore. Any dreams I had of braving the horrors of forgotten dungeons and hauling massive amounts of treasure out where quickly snuffed out.  I could go on about how the feel was off, the backtracking, the horses, and the other nitpicky things that bugged me... but this review will probably never be read and this is just for me to vent my disappointment.If you are wanting a very expensive MMO where you can say ""Oooo I play pretty MMO's"" then this is for you. If you want to feel like the Hero of Kvatch, just equip your boots of blinding speed and speed off. That's why I came to the party, and it feels like a member of the Dark Brotherhood has showed up to pick us off one by one with his dagger of disappointment. There is nothing to Fus Do Rah about here..."
Negative,"Edit: I can no longer recommend this game so I am changing my review. The primary reason I don't recommend is something I touched on in my original review: the monetization. Simply put, the developers prioritize monetization before the community's experience.The developers aren't transparent about their intentions and road maps for the future. They make changes that are obviously aimed at generating more profit on the bottom line, even if that sacrifices long time players who aren't spending as much on things like crown crates or boosts. It's clear that their mentality is to bring new players in as often as possible even if it ostracizes long time players.I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt for as long as I could. I stayed when update 35 gutted the endgame community.  I even built a guild dedicated to teaching new players how to complete endgame veteran content. But I cannot and do not recommend this game anymore.If you want something casual to play, by all means, please do. Just beware.Original:I started this game back in beta and enjoyed it for a year or so. I then left for several years and came back to it in 2022. I've been playing it daily for about a year now and I do really like it, however there are some considerations before going in.Pros:Gorgeous graphicsEpic musicElder Scrolls settingFun gameplayGreat group contentReally nice community (in general)Cons:Constant class and gear re-balancingPredatory crown store and cratesToxicity from the developers in response to any feedbackMany of the earnable aesthetic styles are beyond the reach of a casual playerESO Plus is practically requiredYearly new DLC essentially requiredIf you can get past the obscene monetization you will likely really enjoy this game."
Negative,delusional developers out of touch with gameplay mechanics obsessed with actively sabotaging end game pve/pvp (update 35)edit: update 36 made everything worse
Negative,"I really like this game, but many mechanics are an insult to players. And the monetization is down right appalling for a pay to play game."
Negative,"Elder Scrolls series had a lot of potential especially with Morrowind. ESO stories and quest lines are not integrated with the users experience. On the outside it looks good, but on the inside it is empty."
Negative,"I highly recommend not buying this game from Steam, especially if you plan on buying crowns or going Plus membership. If you do, any billing issues are ignored and they send you back to Bathesda, who in turn, sends you back to Steam so your money is just taken with no options to get any support whatsoever."
Negative,"It is extremely inconvenient and annoying to play this without ESO+It makes you terribly inferior to other players just because you don't pay money to them monthly. Unfortunately, I wasted a lot of time before realizing that because I wasn't watching youtube tutorials or reading guides from the start. And when I finally learned about it I tried to convince myself that I could manage without it because of all the time and effort I've invested, I've considered for days whether I should spend more money on this or not. That is the trap, don't fall for it.If this was a free to play game, sure, maybe acceptable, big maybe. This game is everything that makes Warcraft bad and nothing that makes it good.I have no respect for this game or Bethesda. Modern age scammers."
Negative,"I recently spent hundreds of dollars purchasing this game for my entire family, because I have been a fan of the Elder Scrolls games since Arena was released (1990s).  As I am writing this review, my family is waiting in a queue to log into the North American server.  Bethesda announced two hours ago that this measure has been taken, because the servers are overloaded.  While I am glad to see that the Elder Scrolls are still popular, it seems that much has changed since Bethesda's early days.  Nearly everything in this game requires an additional outlay of money (e.g. changes to characters, access to familiar quest lines like Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, etc., inventory and bank space sufficient to play the game, etc.).  The entire game seems to be designed to lure you in and slowly suck you dry.  Meanwhile, instead of adding servers, Bethesda has chosen to make its customers wait in line to play the game.I miss the Bethesda and the Elder Scrolls I once knew."
Negative,"This game has really good potential and has a unique combat system unlike any other game. When the game works (keyword when) it is really enjoyable, especially open world PVP. That said, the developers really only care about profit and it really shows. Game performance is on a rapid decline and it's even starting to seep into pve content. Performance in pvp is unplayable during prime time and marginally better during off hours. During this past year the developers have subjected pvpers to multiple tests as if the game was in beta or early access to try to determine the cause of lag and what they can do to improve it. Nothing they've tried has worked and it only shows their incompetence. The only way to fix this terrible performance would be for them to invest in new and better servers, or just move all the calculations they switched to the server back client side and invest in anti cheat software. Of course none of this will ever happen so it is likely ZOS will continue to throw tests at their community and after each one just throw their hands up in the air and say ""this test has shown no appreciable improvements"". Pve is not much better as the game still suffers from crashes and positional desyncs so if pve is what you're interested in then you're still out of luck. Coming from someone with over 9k hours of playtime my final conclusion is the game is in a pretty bad state so I encourage anyone to not waste any money on this until they fix it."
Negative,"I cannot, in good faith, recommend this game to anyone who cares about raiding in MMOs or finds their enjoyment in end-game content. The developers have little to no sympathy or care for raiders and at times seem to actively work against them, especially lately.As a raider, your only motivation outside of loot to clear content is for a decently cool title. Other rewards for completing raids are ok at best and downright insulting at worst. You're basically raiding for clout instead of tangible rewards. In terms of rewards in the first place, there is absolutely no reward structure in the game meaning you only get something when you reach the finish line as opposed to anything to applaud your progression.You can get skins(some are ok, others are just bad), adornments(which are very uninteresting), titles(the harder to obtain ones are cool, but this is literally the only positive), and mounts. There are only 3 mounts you can obtain from raiding, and they are each fairly difficult to obtain. So what's the problem with these? They look absolutely awful, and 2 of them even have basically replicas that they sold on the crown store(the cash shop). This means that despite all of your hard work in obtaining the mount, it's nothing special. There's literally another version that was sold for money, which is the running theme here. The Godslayer mount looks ok, but they literally copied it and put up a red version of it on the crown store. The Planesbreaker mount doesn't have a crown store replica(yet), but it's incredibly boring due to the lack of flair and effects. The Swashbuckler mount is quite literally a recolor of another crown store mount of the exact same design, but instead of red, it's blue with some coral brushed onto it and some meh effects added.ZoS also continues to make changes that nobody wants. These changes actively damage and kill the small amount of class identity that there is in the first place. There is barely an identity difference between stamina-based and magicka-based characters. They are actively making universal skills(skills that any class can use) more useful and important than class-specific skills. This is causing basically every single class to play similar or the same.To pile onto all of this, members of the dev team actively treat the people who sink hundreds to thousands of hours into raiding like we know nothing, like we haven't been doing the content daily for multiple years now. They make drastic changes, receive negative feedback from raiders, and push them through anyways. The latest changes in particular that they are trying to make are so mind-bogglingly awful and tone-deaf that it's causing tons of raiders, myself included, to cancel their subscriptions and leave the game for good. They refuse to listen to what the community wants and actively alienate us in the process. It's very clear that their only priority is to sell their egregiously-priced crown store items and sell their abhorrent gambling crates, with raiders who actively loved this game being at the bottom of their concerns.TL;DRThe devs don't care about you as a raider. They only want to sell overpriced cash shop items."
Negative,"To be honest, i cannot wrap my mind around this game.From my personal perspective playing this game is a heartbreaking experience, because the developers did such an amazing job in creating Tamriel and the various races and quests, but simple things like instanced dungeons and similar zones and other things that ruin someone immersion are an absolute game breaker imo.Let me explain: This review comes not from a typical MMO player.I play Video games (especially Elder Scrolls games) for immersion and relaxation. I am NOT interested in competing or playing with other people, epecially not the drama involved in this.Of course i know that ESO is first and foremost an MMO, but from all i have heard it was praised as one of the most solo friendly Online games out there, which gave me a utterly wrong impression. Why was i looking for a MMO in the first place you ask? Because in contrast to most single player games, MMOs tend to have a huge amount of content, they tend to run very stable on PCs (especially when they are released several years ago) and new content is being produced on top of it. Also i just Love the Elder Scrolls universe and i have Played Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim to exhaustion over the years.The three things the broke the game for me:First: One of the first things i noticed was something so mindboggeling i wasted three hours googeling if i did some stupid mistake. The problem is that you cannot save your Keybinds to be used account wide. Something so simple like that requires a player made Addon (which is usually outdated and doesn't work).The fact that in the year 2020 game developers did not fix this... is insainity!Second: Character Classes and visuals. Altough the game promises to have a very flexible class building system, ultimately all classes become some sort of Mages or battle mages. No matter how you turn it, you end up seing everyone spamming lightining bolts, flames and bombarding everything in their vicinity. There is no way (i cound find) to create a Knight, Barbarian or simple fighter that is viable in endgame. There is no restraint from the dev side regarding this, which makes the whole game world appear cheap and feel like some stupid smartphone game.Third: This is the most important one, EVERY TENSION AND IMMERSION is INSTANTLY GONE once other players steamroll through the same dungeon where you are just about to sneak through or fight the endboss.This didn't just happen once or twice, but EVERYTIME i did a quest, no matter the daytime (i played around 3:00 -5:00 AM). This is extremely frustrating and a the biggest game breaker to me.Having areas like this run in an instance would instantly solve this problem. Lots of other game developers decided that this is a good sollution for their game, why not here?(even better, if you could set the number of players allowed in your instance.)As i said, this whole matter is really heartbreaking to me, because these ""little"" things completely ruin that wonderfully made game to me. Even worse, it costs me 20 Euros and 17 hours of trying to ignore the flaws of this game.So no. I cannot recommend this game, as much as i would like to.EDIT: Typos"
Negative,"I love The Elder Scrolls and I have to recommend you don't buy this game.  Buying the most expensive version of this game only gives you a fraction of the content.  The highest level is level 50.  Beyond that are what's called CP points.  You will be weak until you reach at least CP 2000.  If you join a guild and play a long time every day, you may be able to progress 4 CP points per day, maybe 8 if you get potion and scroll bonus hookups.  Do the math.  You will need to shell out extra money to get the DLC that guilds use for experience runs (mostly called trials).  Once you finally reach that point, they will push a patch that hoses the game on your computer and it won't run.  This has happened to me twice.  Their tech support is horrible.  I thought they were just inexperienced, now I'm finally starting to realize it's probably AI spitting out canned responses that have nothing to do with your problem.  After a month of going back and forth with tech support, if you haven't given up, they send you a message saying they are glad the issue is resolved, but it's not resolved.  I got the game running the first time this happened by following a work-around posted by another gamer.  This last patch did not finish and the launcher prompted me to install the game.  Clicking install returns a message saying I do not have enough disk space.  I have 155 GB of free space and the required space is listed as 128 GB.  Oddly enough, I can install the steam version with no problem, but I need the standalone version for this particular account, so the problem isn't my disk space, it's this last patch.  So here's what will happen next.  Say you go through all of this and get the game running again.  Then they release a new chapter, and the new character class has a spell that can paralyze everyone around them, then another spell that can one hit everybody.  That means you need to buy the new version and start over with a new character from level 1 again, or just get killed immediately every battle.  Then you realize that the players with 3000 CP points can add those CP point bonuses to new characters, which explains why some level 5 character is doing 25,000 points of damage and one hitting you.  Don't take my word for it.  Look at every forum about this game.  If you do play, find a way to buy it during one of their sales for $5.99.  That's all it's worth.  The new patches are so aggravating that I'm wondering if they want everyone to quit so they can end support.  Also keep in mind that to purchase this game, you need to sign a EULA saying you can never take legal action regarding the game.  That means they could pull the plug the next day and you would have no recourse.  This is mostly likely because they lost a class action lawsuit for Fallout 4 for selling a special subscription that promised all DLC, then made those people pay for new DLC.  This is no longer an immersive game you can play any way you want and get lost in a beautiful world.  This is a game where you need to do daily tasks to get an endorphin rush like some casino zombie pulling a lever or some Pavlovian dog, so you don't feel like you are being left behind.  The time and money I spent on this game are only worth it in the sense that at least I wasn't buying opioids.  I think it's time to phase back into literature and music as pass times.  My wife bought me a sweet Django Reinhardt book for Christmas that even has the solo transcriptions from the recordings.  She also got, ""Demon Copperhead,"" which is such a good book I've almost read it in two days.  Heck, I've enjoyed writing this reveiw more than I enjoyed getting my event tickets today."
Negative,Don't like the idea of paying for a class after buying the game
Negative,It doesnt feel like an elder scrolls game rather like WOW.Pay2Win game
Negative,"Game sells itself as a buy-to-own with an optional subscription to access DLC content. It's a lie. Not having a subscription running cuts your account bank space in half (making it impossible to transfer items between characters among other things) and makes you unable to store crafting materials in an account-wide bag. After 2 months of playing my crafting bag already has over 450 different types of items and normal gameplay will result in 100 different crafting materials appearing in your inventory every single day. Bag space is already a major point of annoyance without this nonsense (your character will have between 120 and 180-ish inventory slots with 50-ish already occupied by shit you have to carry around with you) so not having this ""convenience"" makes the game basically unplayable. If you don't pay the quite expensive and predatory bulk-priced subscription you won't be able to play the content you actually bought. I suggest to stay away until they stop those practices."
Negative,"Ok, let me start my saying that I have played this game for over 1,600 hours. I have also payed for the subscription for months. I consider myself a casual player. I do NOT play PvP much if any. Seeing as the Update 35 will be destroying everyone's damage, without also nerfing the PvE content....i can NOT personally recommend playing this game anymore. Also the entire reason for buying the new update for myself (Oakensoul) is getting destroyed for PvE, and i feel cheated out of my money. There is also TOO MUCH Rng in trying to get cosmetics. The gameplay as a whole is also getting slowed down and nerfed.....Moving to FF14 after the patch 35 hits....It's been fun"
Negative,The Game is not in a great place i have played 1700 hours. I have been playing eso for years now and it seems like its time to move on. The dev don't care about the players and the last few updates have been so bad filled with bug and just not much to do. The game just does not feel good anymore.
Negative,"So, this is going to be a bit long but I'll try to break things up in to categories for those that even care to read. 1) I paid $8 for the game on sale a while back. I've played almost 300 hours.2) Said $8 buys you a fair number of zones to explore, all of which scale to your character level - go anywhere, do anything, right from the start.3) The community is usually friendly and helpful. You meet the occasional troll, they become more common as you explore further from starting areas, but more or less people are willing to provide helpful information if you ask in zone chat which is more than can be said about several other MMO's I've played. 1)  Crafting:    I've played almost 300 hours but have accomplished almost nothing in game. I can't even craft a suit of what is considered ENTRY level armor having reached max level. With research speed maxed out it still takes around 12 real world days to research one piece of gear enough to craft a set item, you can research three items at once (with max research) and there are nine slots to fill for an ""entry"" level build to start powering up towards ""end game"" content. This means roughly 36 real life days of time must pass (likely more, as research may finish while you sleep, etc) to make your own stuff.You also can't craft, research, or disassemble jewelry unless you buy the Summerset Chapter, or pay for ESO+ which leads me to my next topic.Oh, and if you instead want to try and buy gear (which is insanely expensive to those starting out) there is no centralized market or Auction House. Instead you have individual Guild Traders that will let you browse items posted by the members of that Guild. This can be anything in game that isn't Bound to your character or account. With hundreds of Traders, that can have pretty much any item under the sun, spread out across all the zones in the game you have to rely on third party websites and addons to search for items that may or may not still be present by the time you travel to whichever zone and town that Guild Trader is in. It turns what should be a three minute shopping trip in to a three hour struggle.2)  Monetization:     I'm all for folks getting paid for their work, however publishers tend to push that to the extremes for the sake of their share holders. Monetization in this game feels scummy, bordering on predatory. You want to increase the speed of your mount, how much your mount can help you carry, or how long it can run? Great! Wait 3,600 real life hours (150 days, if you don't miss a single minute of upgrade time, but more realistically 180 days) to reach max attributes or pay real world currency (RWC) for instant upgrades. You want to hold all those crafting ingredients so you can (attempt to) make things? Great! Pay for ESO+ so you have access to a crafting storage bag, or constantly be throwing things away as character bag space is limited to 60 slots to start, upgraded with a non-inconsequential amount of gold or (you guessed it!) RWC to 140 slots which sounds like a lot, but for Provisioning (making foods and drinks) alone there are 50 different ingredients. Say you buy the first six bag upgrades to save 2/3rd the gold cost, you'd still spend 2,000 Crowns (~$20 USD) PER CHARACTER to upgrade your bags the last two ranks.The list goes on but the worst of all (in my opinion) Crown Crates - loot boxes which provide random items upon opening. To make it even more enjoyable those Crown Crate items can be scrapped in to an alternate currency, only obtainable (to my knowledge) by opening Crates, which are used for purchasing other items from the in-game store. Granted, I haven't delved too deeply in to that aspect of things as I do not have any desire to waste money on in-game gambling for pixels but to lock things behind a currency that requires you to gamble seems rapacious.3)  Repetative:    Yes, it's an MMO so it's mostly what you make of it however each of your characters has to go through the same Public Dungeons, Delves, Quests, and Zones. Delves, Dungeons and Zone exploration are essentially required to collect Sky Shards which award extra Skill Points (used to learn combat or crafting skills) outside of the Skill points you receive while leveling. You get 64 Skill Points in total by the time you reach level 50 (max character level) however crafting skills alone can require well over 100 Points (ignoring some of the traits I find less useful) meaning you will spend hours and hours grinding. But hey, once you collect all the Sky Shards from a zone you can use RWC to buy those same shard unlocks on an alt to save time. It'll only cost you $5 per zone you've already cleared and with a dozen or so major zones only $60 per character. Yay?All in all, for $8 it's not a bad game though it does feel like any old generic MMO with an Elder Scrolls skin stretched over top of it. I personally refuse to spend a single penny more on anything else related to this game even though ESO+ feels almost mandatory (+10% gold, XP gains, crafting progression and research, double bank storage space, the ability to actually customize your armor appearance, and more) if you want to actually play without dipping in to your bag every 5 minutes to make space. I am however going to leave this as a negative review as their monetization offends me to such a degree that an otherwise okay game can not be something I recommend to others wholeheartedly but you can't go wrong for $8.Edited: Typos, I wrote this late at night so forgive me."
Negative,"The game has become a trash heap. Morrowind and Skyrim will forever be Elder scrolls games of an era however the devs of Elder Scrolls Online are content to take a beloved world and let it die a painful death in this game. The devs only listen 1, very small, part of their community and it has created a toxic atmosphere within this game that at this point is not worth going to. I would heavily avoid this game at this point if you are just NOW looking into it. The devs have no idea what they are doing with the leveling system has it nearly constantly changes and they are removing all pvp arena game modes except for death match which just does not make sense. All those other game modes were the only ones where I actually had alot of fun and could play around with the build of my character. The developing team continues to declare that ESO allows you to build your character and skills to the way you want to play but that is a lie. They may not have intended that but the meta culture they have bred and fed when it comes to the endgame is extremely toxic and the community team learned this firsthand at one point when they were insulted so bad during a raid stream they had to quit. This does not mean the entire community is toxic trash as there is genuinely good people in this game. However if you want to do any of the hardcore endgame stuff you will have to run the latest meta build and join a raiding guild which require you to parse a certain dps or you cant join. Many of the raids require it since it does have a enraged timer which doesn't play into the ""Build the way you want to"" vision that was suppose to be ESO and in most cases the raiding community is unwilling to teach you the mechanics of fights so you will just crash and burn if you try to get in now. There are a few good raiding groups out there that are willing to help teach the mechanics and train you but finding them is becoming more and more difficult. In addition the ingame store has become a madhouse of 'pay for convenience' items. There are many things that were built into the game that made it grindy if you decided to make a new character. Now the store is covered in these convenience items that you can pay for so you dont have to deal with the grind. This isnt normally an issue but the sheer volume of them makes it clear its about money not actually convenience. In my opinion this is the marketing team trying to squeeze as much money as they can from this game as it bleeds to death. ESO will be killed by its meta community and development team. It may not be today, it may not be tomorrow but it will happen once they are not making enough money on it to be worth it.(Update 11/12/21) As can be seen a developer has responded to this review. If you come back to look at this Rionstrom, you address very little that is in this review and give the typical basic vague responses without getting down to the meat and potatoes of this review. I understand you cant respond in detail on everything but this, in my opinion, only adds that you guys see what you want to see. Hopefully this is not the case and some of what I am saying resonates with you guys (especially since your own community team cant stream new content without being insulted on builds). Don't have confidence in this game anymore."
Negative,"Can no longer buy the expansions separate. So if you're like me and just bought the base game and have decided you wanted to get the others later down the line the only way to get them to my knowledge is to either buy the 60$ bundle which WILL charge you again for the Base Game no discount for already owning it , Buy ESO+ or buy each expansion in-game with crowns. No Thanks."
Negative,"I am a veteran player in Guild Wars 2 and I have played GW2 for 10 years; however, I have taken a break from that game because their warrior class is a joke. I wanted to try a new MMORPG game and ESO was the game I chose, but I don't think I will be playing ESO for too long. I became overwhelmed by this INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SIMULATOR game!This game is good, but lacks many features who are locked behind a paid subscription. For example the crafting bag, this feature is not in the base game! You will be playing an INVENTORY SIMULATION game. You will spend countless hours trying to sort your inventory instead of actually playing the game. Furthermore, a paid ESO PLUS subscription of $14.99 per month for such feature is a blatant exploitation of their game enthusiasts and subscribers!The ESO PLUS year subscription costs $139.99. With this much money I can buy 2 BRAND NEW games on their release date each worth $60 AND STILL have left $19.99 to spend on a game such as GTA V.So, with $139.99 you get the equivalent of 3 games. That being said, ESO PLUS should be maximum $5 per month and the year subscription should be $60 which is the equivalent of a brand new game being released each year!With all this being said, I am still enjoying the INVENTORY GAME SIMULATOR or whatever this game is called. Nevertheless, It is a good game and I recommend it for all those who love MMORPG games. However, if we compare this game to other MMORPG games such as Guild Wars 2 who has a crafting bag in the base game, then ESO falls short!I am a veteran player in Guild Wars 2 and I have played GW2 for 10 years;  I have taken a break from GW2 game because their warrior class is a joke. I wanted to try a new MMORPG game and ESO was the game I chose, but I don't think I will be playing ESO for too long. I became overwhelmed by this INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SIMULATOR game!Advice for developers: Make your games fun to play! Don't force the players to play inventory simulation games! If you do, then at least don't exploit them with a game feature that is worth twice the value of a brand new game!"
Negative,"Negatives:- Predatory monetization. They make the game worse inventory-wise to force you to buy the subscription. Time is money, and they know this fact. It is possible to play without a subscription, you just have to waste hours every week managing your inventory, or you can pay up and have the problem they put into the game go away. Bethesda did the same with fallout 76.- There are almost no earnable in-game rewards and they put anything that looks nice into lootboxes (crown crates). This is a huge reason I will quit playing because there really is nothing worthwhile to earn by playing the game. Final fantasy 14 for example had over 40 earnable in-game mounts for the most recent expansion alone. That's 40 mounts you can earn in only a couple years. ESO purposely limits the content you can earn in-game to sell lootboxes.- I was frequently annoyed by the community and I would see someone scamming in zone chat almost every day. This is partially because there is no auction house or market board just a bunch of individual guild traders and community-run sites to make them even usable and turn them into sort of a marketboard. However, the site is not always up to date and you can spend 5 minutes traveling to a guild trader only for the item you want to be sold out. This time adds up a lot.- The game encourages selfish behavior and there aren't many things to do together with friends. It feels like almost everyone in the game is just worried about themselves and completing their personal collections. The nature of the game makes it feel like less of an MMORPG and just a single player RPG with other players walking around.- Dungeons feel like a free to play game and the game is incredibly unbalanced, but this is somewhat a pro because you can become very powerful, but a con because levels 1-159 you feel worthless. One of the main daily things to do is a random dungeon with other players, and this is basically you and 3 other people sprinting full speed through a dungeon while one of them carries you until you are the person carrying other people. This is not really enjoyable for anyone involved, they are only doing it cause it's one of the better ways to level characters. -PVP has been abandoned according to the communityPositives:- Housing system is the only reason I will play the game. It is wonderful to be able to own dozens of houses and there are thousands of decor items.- Sandbox design is refreshing compared to most mmorpgs being theme park mmos- The environments and zone designs are well-done and it's nice to be able to fully explore Tamriel as someone who played the series a long time- The card game is genuinely good and balanced- Public dungeons are probably the most fun you can have in the game with other people in my opinionOverall I cannot see a reason to keep playing a mmorpg where the devs purposely make the game worse to manipulate their fanbase into spending more money. If you want to play this as a single player game, you might have more enjoyment than I did, but even playing the game as a housing sim I could not get past all the issues listed above. I won't be buying the next expansion and I'll be getting the last enjoyment I can from housing before I quit completely like I did with Fallout 76 for similar reasons"
Negative,"DONT BUY THROUGH STEAM, go here https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/joinus and DONT LINK the game to steam, steam launcher has weekly spasms and wont let you log into the game. (pls dont give the advice that one can bypass the problem by starting the game via eso64.exe, this tip works only for old accounts from around 2016ish, it wont work for new players and it certainly doesnt work for me https://image.prntscr.com/image/N_m85QYXTh6DR3Exmpg76g.png )that beeing said ESO is the best mmo i have ever played, it has flaws but is so damn addicting that i accept them, i tried ff 14 and guild wars 2 and a few others but ESO is the best for me, nice music/graphic/voice acting and story. some site quests are generic but others make me giggle.the cash shop? ignore it, dont open it and your good to go, ZOS implemented a few money grabber in there like lootboxes and noob traps, they sell soulstones and other consumables for real life money, DONT  BUY THEM, you get drowned in consumable if you play the game, you get a free mount at lvl 10, there is really no point to open the crown shop, nothing in it can be considered pay to win but many of the offers are morally questionable, for example you can train your horse to make it faster or stronger but only once a day (takes 6 months to max out this way...) UNLESS you pay real life money to buy riding lessons in the crown store, the crown store also has houses that you can buy for like 80€ :D i mean wtf?! obviously thats subjective and you can spend your money as you see fit but i think it is shady to trick new players into buying soulgems or potions or crafting mats with real life money also the cash shop is very ""in your face"" it spams you every log in etc, another problem is eso + subscription, i do understand ZOS needs to make money but if you dont have eso + your inventory gets flooded by a myriade of worthles materials and you spend half you time ingame with sorting you inventory out... it is very ""in your face"" again, my tip if you dont have eso + dont bother with crafting, dont bother with mats just dont pick em up, dont go to crafting nodes and try to enjoy the game instead :)"
Negative,paywall after paywall after paywall. they dont care about players they care about making you pay as many times as possible
Negative,"still downloading .... and now I can't even get a refund because I apparently passed 2 hours playtime   -_-EDIT : If you bought the game from Steam , don't download it from Steam ... Instead get the CD Key (Right Click on Game -> View CD Key), create an account at https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/ , redeem the CD Key to your account and then download the game. It'll only be 35 GB of update ... If you download from Steam , it'll be 48 GB download from Steam and then 35 GB of patch from game launcher and also sometimes it'll have strange crashes .... My game was crashing on start up.. So I contacted ESO Support and they suggested me to download the installer from their page ... I did that , downloaded approx 40 GB (instead of 48+35 GB) and now it is working perfectly ....TLDR : Redeem the CD KEY in your ESO account page and download the actual ESO Launcher instead of downloading this crappy Steam version ... it'll save you both your time and your bandwidth !!!EDIT : This game is really fun !! But my review will still be set to ""Not Recommended"" because of the shitty Steam Launcher ... Buy it from the official ESO Website ... not from Steam .."
Negative,"No, I don't recommend this game.  It's pretty and fun to explore and seven years after release the developers still don't know how they want combat and items to work. Every few weeks they drop another upheaval on you, haha learn it again we changed our minds. The game itself runs like ass in big fights, to the point your character may be unable to do anything but stand there and die while you futilely click buttons. It's also monetized to the eyeballs (although not yet pay to win, they sell everything but power).  Want to change your character's hair color? Ten bucks. Want to play the Warden class? Ten bucks please. Necromancer? Ten bucks. Imperial race as an option in character creation? That'll be twenty bucks.By the time you realize how unstable and rotten with greed Elder Scrolls Online is you're invested in the community or don't want all the progress you've made to mean nothing. I was warned and didn't listen because it was cool, at first.  But no, I really don't recommend this game."
Negative,"I know thousands of people do not like the collecting and selling of their data to be MANDATORY in order to play all of these new video games. But like all stealthy business methods, I think they have been doing it longer than they legally have been required to include more obvious descriptions of it in a disclaimer... Still I would like to request for the sake of everyone who loves gaming, that we demand that all companies doing this, stop being allowed to collect and sell our data as a requirement to play their games online or offline. I was enjoying this game for a moment while it was free, but I will not pay to have my data collected folks, I just cant. I believe that they should have to at least offer all of us something worth equal or higher value for the data and make it completely optional and not in any way necessary to enjoy the full game in all of its glory."
Negative,"Do not buy this game on Steam, I learned the hard way.  You'll receive a plethora of errors when attempting to log in and Bethesda's main website will not be able to recognize your credentials.  I'm currently trying to figure out how to get a refund.""An unexpected internal error has occured"" ""Incorrect user ID or password""ESO customer service told me it's a Steam issue and to request help from Steam.   Steam later told me is was an ESO internal issue and to contact ESO.Literally a fucking joke."
Negative,"This could be a great MMO, but due to heavy focus on monetization (loot boxes and overprized items in the crown store) and little focus on fixing bugs and performance issues, it actually isn't.This game is plagued by extremely long loading screens, poor server infrastructure, login issues (especially with steam), long and frequent maintenance, a horrible UI (if it wasn't for Addons), a not existing global Auction House/Trading Post, a totally defunct Guild Bank system (among other things it's ""eating"" items on a regular basis), and loads of other bugs.Pretty much every patch/update introduces new bugs or brings back old ones (even when they have been reported during beta tests) while long outstanding issues are not addressed. Updates and holiday events/anniversaries are almost guaranteed to cause massive lag, infrastructure outage and login failures. Update 18 even introduced spyware (Red Shell) and then - after users noticed and complained - ZOS stated that it went in by accident. Feel free to believe this or not. https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/comment/5188725/#Comment_5188725An optional subscription (called ESO+) is more or less forced upon players by limiting storage space for non-subscribers and inflating crafting material requirements. An unlimited crafting storage is only available to subscribers and using (private) guild banks (one time investment into multiple accounts) as an alternative is not viable due to above mentioned bugs and limitations.When ESO became B2P (buy to play) with an ""optional"" subscription, subscribers were promised access to all (including future) DLC (downloadable content), but this has been changed by simply declaring some downloadable content  (Morrowind, Summerset) a ""chapter"" which is not covered by the subscription.The most recent crown sale does no longer offer an increased discount for larger crown packs (we could buy 21K packs for 50% at xmas 2017/2018 and before) but a flat 20% regardless of size. This and the fact that customer support is blaming Addons for disappearing items in my guild banks (they acknowledged some missing items, were unable to restore the correct type and offered a gold compensation instead) pushes it over the line.This is the first MMO I quit playing not due to lacking content but due to lacking quality paired with an (at least for me) unbearable amount of greed. Hence I do not recommend to  ""Join over 10 million players in the award-winning online multiplayer RPG"". I have never seen the steam page showing more than 10-13K online anyway. Given, it's only steam, but this is off by 3 orders of magnitude from what Zenimax/Bethesda wants us to believe."
Negative,"Listen, the game itself is fantastic as an MMO. My hours played should be case enough. However, at this point, I think I am done with the STEAM version of the game. Constant server issues/failed logins that get ""fixed"" only to happen again a month later for the same or similar reasons. As many other recent reviews have pointed out, the Steam client issues are out of hand and plain ridiculous with little to no compensation or explanation for the issues, and these are issues coming from Steam's side, not Zenimax's. Don't punish a good developer because they took a deal with a platform that performs terribly for distributing their amazing game.I won't pretend that I haven't enjoyed my time with the game. I definitely have. However, do NOT purchase it from the Steam store. Instead, purchase it directly from elderscrollsonline.com. 100% of your purchase will go towards supporting Zenimax, instead of Steam taking a cut of the sale, and you will still get the same amazing game, but with a much more stable client. Personally, I will be attempting to refund my recently renewed ESO+ Subscription managed thru Steam and completely migrating to the standalone client and re-purchasing the base game and ESO+ Subscription through Zenimax to continue playing with my current account."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THROUGH STEAM!!!The game itself is fantastic, however due to recurring Steam issues, logging in is nigh impossible during peak times such as weekends or evenings.I regret buying this game through Steam and wish I bought it anywhere else!!!"
Negative,"They permanantly banned me because of a year old character name with no chance to appeal as well as no warning or notification whatsoever. After I tried to appeal I was basically told to not further contact them. Just kinda a bummer as I really am a big fan of the elder scrolls franchise and ive dumped thousands of hours into skyrim over the past decade... Just was enjoying the new lore. I also made it extremely clear to the bethesda team that I would have no issue deleting anything they didnt approve of butjust got the cold shoulder in return. My negative review is not towards this wonderful game, just the team who is running the behind the scenes of it."
Negative,"I'm sure ESO's gameplay is quite stellar nowadays compared to release, but as an Australian, ESO is marred by a single, glaringly bad flaw. It's severe lack of any servers outside Europe and NA. Until Zenimax decides to implement Oceanic servers, stay far, far away from this game unless you enjoy playing with 350+ pings that, quite frankly, makes it near impossible to play on even the same tier as NPC enemies whose attacks will often hit you before they even appear. Due to this, combat is a straight up slog to endure, the supposedly fluid nature of ESO's combat absolutely destroyed by network delays that make it impossible to maintain any rotations or fluidity.If you don't live in Europe or NA, you will have a hard time justifying spending any serious time investment in this over any other MMO that actually cares about players outside these regions."
Negative,"The most predatory in game store I have seen in a play to play rpg. A whole class locked behind a paywall after purchasing the plus membership, what a joke."
Negative,Has some fun elements.Monetized really badly.
Negative,"UPDATED REVIEW 2020 PVP PART: I was very hyped to play the game again after reading road map of 2020. And i couldn't be more dissapointed about what happened to battlegrounds. Yes, the queues are probably shorter, but if you want to have some fun competitive experience with your friends, forget it. Because for some reason, instead of making 2 queues for battlegrounds to separate solo players and groups, now there is just solo battlegrounds. And big PVP map is still laggy. The game is still the same garbage once you reach lvl 50. Nice updates, well done. After turning it on with my bf and finding out, we sadly ALT + F4 the game and uninstalled again. Aight. I think I have enough hours on this game to write this. I don't really want to recommend or not recommend. It's seriously question of your patience and playstyle. - PVE in generalIf you're a pure PVE player, this game has some really nice PVE content. A lot to explore, infinite amount of quests, rewards for exploring such as chests and materials or side quests etc. You can go dungeons in smaller group or trials in huge group and have fun grinding and farming. BUT...At some point, even a PVE player will encounter a huge annoying problem with SERVERS. Fact, that you need to wait 5 mins before you store something in a guild bank or putting to a guild market, is annoying. Fact, that you get stuck in a dungeon finder loop for 20 - 60 mins, is EXTREMELY bothering. Things like this that are just wasting your time make me tilted every day I play. Doing your daily dungeon around 7pm - 10pm is simply impossible. - PVP issues As for PVP players, eh, I seriously can't reccomend this unless you have patience like a mother of 5 kids. - Battlegrounds shits -- When you are under lvl 50, the battlegrounds work quite decent. You get to a queue and you get to play. You hit lvl 50, and like dungeons, you basically won't play, if you are trying at the wrong time. The finder gets to a loop and you basically can't do shit about that.- One more amazingly bad thing about battlegrounds - when you finally get to the bgs, you are redy to play with your friends or without, and you find out that you're just 3/4 in your team. Why? bcs one of your friends gets stuck in infinite loading screen for no reason. Now, 2 things can happen. 1. friend is patitent and waits 10-15 minutes to load while you're playing in 3. He gets to play, dies once, and for no fucking reason, he is back to infinite loading screen. 2. He ALT+F4 the game, gets a ban for 15 minutes for leaving battlegrounds and you get a replacement that you hope is going to join- Another issue - sometimes, you just get stuck on your starting position. Teams are almost ready, everything looks almost complete, but some team is not full. So you wait. And wait. And after 20 mins you get sick of waiting, everyone leaves and gets 15 mins ban for leaving.So yeah, ignoring the fact that battlegrounds are 4v4v4 which is extremely idiotic for all the game modes there, bgs are decent, if you're a very patient person who doesn't mind wasting time. - Cyrodil - - Cyrodil (the PVP open map) is first of all stupidly huge, but ok, and ridiculously laggy, when it's full. Which means, you are fighting someone, you're hitting him, he's hitting you, all the animations come minute later, all the dmg comes 3 minutes later and you suddenly die out of nowhere while you're blocking with full shield. Ignoring the fact that both of you keep teleporting due the servers issue. Welp, so much fun. - General Content- Hey, positives are still there. Classes in the game are quite interesting and each one of them has some broken build that can shred the other builds. You can do anything you want with your character, anytime you want. Changing skill points during playing and champion points aswell is no problem. Mages with badass swords or daggers, or assassins with saffs are nothing unusual. Amount of skills you get during gaming is also incredible. You have huge freedom in this field. - Graphics are good enough if you ask about that, cant really complain. I found it a bit clunky before i started playing and i got used to that in like 30 mins, so yeah, go figure.- Combat system: well, yeah, it's decent. Lets be honest here, if you think is all based on your skill, it's not. It's more like 50% build (maybe 70% when i think about it) and rest is skill. There is almost no way for you to outplay some of the broken builds with non-broken build. Some broken shits like magicka dragonknight, stamina warden, tank sorcerer, magicka nightblade and any templar are just seriously broken, and if you're dueling those, and you didn't put your CP on exact place and your build is not perfect, you wont ever scratch those.That should be all for now. Don't get me wrong, im complaining a lot but i still have shit tons of hours on this game and i keep playing. I consider this better than broken RNG simulators grind like BDO, or too oldschool WOW. But i know for sure that as soon as some mmorpg has better servers and similar gameplay, im leaving ESO behindP.S. yeah, you can try the game without ESO+ membership, but at some point you just have to get it, or spent your time playing in a very limited way. And it's not about the worlds you will open with it and dungeons, but about your inventory and bank space. Craft bag, which you get with ESO+, will allow you to finally not spend your money on space expansions, but on sets and upgrades. If you don't give a fuck about crafiong, you don't really need it. But personally i find crafting usefull, fun, ez way to make money and simply good to do."
Negative,"As it currently stands, ESO is not worth anyone's time or money. When you pay full price entry fee only to be treated like a Free-to-Play freeloader! I DON'T WANT OR CARE for ESO Plus! stop shoving it to my face ESO!"
Negative,Fix your installer that requires another 80 Gb of free space after installing game through steam.
Negative,"The new player experience is awful. Apparantly the game used to start you off on the main quest, then decided to replace that with a joke of a tutorial after which they're just like 'lmao do whatever I guess'. Seriously, literally nothing is explained, and if you don't tackle content in release order then nothing will make sense.  Want to know how to craft? Uh, google it I guess. Mounts? Better google it. Guilds? Google it, the game ain't telling you shit. The main quest? Yeah, good luck even finding that as a new player without a guide.Game is fun enough, but until they sort this out it's difficult to recommend."
Negative,"The game has been fantastic. The game REMAINS fantastic.The support, however, is utter garbage in the last month or two (OF WHICH I AM AWARE; it may have been longer but I didn't need support until now), with in-game communications via player and system mail--a system intrinsic to progress whether you're crafting or engaging in trade with other players--having become locked for a substantial number of players.https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/569321/phantom-mail-bug/p5https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/572659/mailbox-full-but-empty#latestTwo threads have been posted, the first citing on the literal 100th reply that ""this will be fixed in the next patch"" only for that patch to roll out, the issue remains, and communication from the support team is nonexistent.I've asked them to nuke my inbox entirely so mail can start flowing again; they cannot do this. Forum posts are vigilantly censored to remove criticism over the handling of this issue.I used to LOVE this game.Update: Allegedly they fixed this issue. Over 45 days after it was first reported. And anyone who had in-game mail that expired during this period, which includes items purchased from guild traders, seems to be just gone with no compensation to players affected by this well-known bug. I uninstalled a couplefew weeks ago, and don't think I'm tripping over myself to re-install.NEW UPDATE. As of today, June 2nd, they e-mailed me on my last incident, filed 2021-05-10, stating that this issue, known since April 10th, has been resolved. ""Customer Support is unable to recover any items received via in-game mail that has expired.""I personally lost nothing but hireling mail, but this boiled my blood to read. It's worse than nothing. It's openly insulting to every player who put forth any effort in the last two months and got cheated out of it by a bug they were too busy to fix and too cowardly to admit they weren't making it priority.If ZOS/Bethesda Support gave half a toss, they'd go back through the history for the several dozen affected players and give them everything they have lost. But they clearly don't.I said before that I didn't want to encourage people to tell their friends to quit, just to inform them of what was happening. I'm reversing that course now.Tell your friends to quit. Do not give these people money. I'd double my non-recommendation of this game if I could legitimately post two negative reviews."
Negative,"Great game... however it only seems to care about US and European players... Oceanic players such as Australian's, and most of South east Asia have no servers, which makes latencey insanley difficult to deal with. This means that PVP is pretty much a no go zone, and is also a reason why the playerbase isn't far larger down south. I would love to recommend this game, however it has become unplayable for me as major features of an MMO such as PVP are closed to players such as myself."
Negative,why is it so hard to let ppl login after patch?patch comes 14h later cant login try again later.(not every patch)So i dont recommend buying this game via steam!
Negative,Do you live in the NA or the EU region? if so go ahead it's a great game.You live in the rest of the world? hope you enjoy 200 latency.
Negative,"This review covers various aspects of the Elder Scrolls Online but mainly focuses on a single fun factor which is the difficulty. The difficulty problem of the game and how it affects most of the player base is dissected and reviewed. The topic is highly subjective, and the subjectivity of the topic is also discussed and addressed in its respective section. The same problem that the other MMORPGs face is also mentioned and their attempts to find their own solutions are compared. The review proposes the implementation of the solution that LOTRO came up with recently in the way the developers deem fit. Many aspects of the game are not discussed in here, including but not limited to; class balance, PvP issues, ESO+ and the cash shop that incentivizes gambling. They won’t be heavily mentioned because I don’t care. I believe I can have fun with the said issues. The Elder Scrolls Online is one of the biggest MMORPGs on the market and it’s been around for a decade now. That is an achievement that a game cannot get without doing something right.ESO takes place in Tamriel, a continent that many people love and are already familiar with. With its different climates, architecture, and cultures ESO successfully captures Tamriel and presents its glory to the players. It feels “nice” to be in the world.  It might be the game’s strongest side. One would not think housing to be that important but if it’s important for anyone at any point, they will end up in ESO. It’s just the best and it’s more important than you probably think. While I don’t think much importance is given to this in the majority of the player base, when it comes to story telling in this beautifully woven world, ESO delivers its stories and narratives perfectly. I still remember the first time I finished the epic arc of Deadric War storyline. To meet with Sotha Sil, feeling the opaque concept of divinity and celestial warfare at the mysterious Crystal Tower was a great experience for me.Also, everything is voice acted. They really care about that. This is also probably more important than you think.Dungeons are diverse, creative and provide the most accessible challenge to the player. Based on my experience, ESO has the best dungeoning experience across the market. ESO offers a great experience and great stories. But why could I not feel myself as a part of this world. I can roleplay and write my own stories in a single-player game that came out in 2011, but why can’t I do the same in this behemoth of great material? Why could I not enjoy my time?Because the gameplay is not engaging.  engaging (adjective):“Interesting or pleasant in a way that attracts your attention” -Oxford Dictionary To have fun with ESO, you must be one of the following.a. A hardcore player who pays his tax to their guild, commits a large chunk of their time to the game, after years of playing the game mastered the animation cancelling abomination (but too invested in it to accept that it’s a problem) , has the best gear in the best condition with the best enchants, have different sets for different encounters in a single dungeon and use addons that penetrate your interface in the worst way possible and a bank full of gold (optional). b. A casual player who can pull some vet dungeons and generally know what you are doing.c. A hyper-casual person who plays the game around 3 hours a week and/or has a mental/viscual/auditory impairment and/or ESO is the first video game that they’ve ever played.   Disclaimer: I believe everyone should be able to have fun, play the game and see or feel no judgement from their fellow players due to their condition/preferances. I feel nothing constructive and inclusive about critising either hardcore players or players with disabilities or hyper-casuals. The reason I have specifically included the impairments was that I saw many posts online about how such players would not want the difficulty of the game to be changed. I respect their opinions and their wishes.  ESO mostly caters for group “a” and group “c”. A player can move between these groups depending on the circumstances. But in order to get to group ""a"", one must first be a member of group ""b"". This situation makes the group ""b"" most populous group in the playerbase.One must note that this is not a problem that exists just in the Elder Scrolls Online. Similar MMORPGs also suffer from the same problem. The genre is on a decline, and I have accepted it. With the rise of MOBA’s this fall got accelerated dramatically.  I believe everyone needs to understand this:In MMORPGs, it is OK to die and it is OK to lose. It's OK to hit a wall. One's efforts to break that wall makes the whole journey meaningful.I do not want grouping to be a necessity to break down that wall. I just want the wall to option to be higher.The game can be solo friendly, but optionally harder at the same time. Modern MMOs became shells of themselves and devolved to MOBAs with side activities to pass the time. The prime example for this notion is retail World of Warcraft in which the whole point is to reach endgame and do these instances called dungeons and raids. Of course, ESO is a different game and has a more horizontal position compared to WoW. But if you are looking for the slightest challenge then one would need to do the same activities in both games. And that’s where the problem starts;If one thinks that MMORPGs are about end-game activities, they should play/design MOBAs.An MMORPG should emphasize the levelling process. The main difficulty should not be the end-game, it should be to get to the end-game.  the main time-sink should never, ever be focused around instances. Especially if you have designed a beautiful world with great narratives and stories. ESO has a great world and has great stories. With its horizontal progression, one can start with any other storyline in any zone they want. The feeling of freedom it gives to the player is massive. With the level-scaling, it would be pure joy. What ESO needs to achieve itself and become the most modern, sandboxy and story driven MMO on the market is to fix the difficulty issue. Because everything between veteran dungeons and raids is easy for a semi-casual player or someone who is familiar with the genre.  Like ESO, LOTRO is a huge game. It might be even bigger than ESO and it has the same problem. There is this vast map and world to play around, but little engagement to have. Even as a healer everyone gets one shot and unless you really like power-point presentations, the quests were meaningless as you also leveled up so fast and again, there is no engagement. Recently a new system was introduced to LOTRO; the Landscape Difficulty. I am not going to explain Landscape Difficulty here as I am way over the character limit. You can look it up.   I can't recommend the game to anyone sadly, even though you are a TES fan. The difficulty of the world itself is too easy and it will ruin your immersion and nothing you do will make your time feel meaningful.To know that theres a vast treasure of content and narrative lie under this problem is devastating for someone who loves the game. Don't believe anyone else, this is the biggest problem of the game."
Negative,"I am updating this review since it has been quite some time since I wrote it and I felt like I should clear some things up. I'm still keeping this negative to keep the ratings and probably have the comments make sense, but keep in mind the the game itself is getting a positive review from me. I just did this since I wasn't able to review the DLC itself.First of all: I don't know at this time if anything changed massively about the Imperial City DLC which was the reason for me giving a bad review originally (it's still down below if you care). So I won't speak about that as of now.However: I really like ESO. Don't get me wrong. I believe Imperial City was an absolute disaster of design choices when it first came out (and it might still be), but ESO is a great game.The ""One Tamriel"" update was also pretty great. It was in fact something I felt the game was kind of lacking before. And even though I'm not much of an MMO person I still really like ESO. It's fun. It's more fun with friends.That's pretty much all I have to say. It's a good game.(TheDLCIsAFckngRippoffAllrightSeeYaEveryone)¯\_(ツ)_/¯[This is a review for the Imperial City DLC:The way it was advertised I thought there would be a new district in which you get all your quests like in the normal game and a place where you could have PvP as well as PvE. What it was: Me trying to go to the place where I could do my first quest but constantly dying because a ~40 player squad was camping that exact spot so they could kill anything that comes near it.There is no option to turn PvP off or anything like that so the entire DLC area is technically rendered unplayable because even if you'd get your own giant squad the enemies can come in when you're fighting a boss (which will obviously leave you quite vulnerable to attacks since you are already taking damage from something else) and kill you to just take the boss for themselfes so they get the reward for killing it instead.Long story short: The Imperial City DLC is basically prostitution since I just paid money so I could get f*cked by 40 people at once.]"
Negative,"This is not Elder Scrolls and I don't like MMORPG, this game is a main reason TES VI is delayed, as long as TESO makes good money Bethesda won't care to release TES VI sooner"
Negative,"ZOS has just tightened the noose around their own neck by introducing controversial auto-moderating AI technology because they're too cheap and lazy to moderate the small playerbase on their own.It's going to shrink a lot more now, so it'll be even cheaper. Good job Zenimax."
Negative,"Do not purchase through Steam, (buy it through ESO directly). First off,  if you are able to login through Steam you'll be one of the lucky selected few. As your account will be locked out for large periods of time,  because of an issue Zenimax (or Valve) is unwilling to address. Way to treat your player base like garbage Zenimax(and/or Valve). If you make your purchase through Steam you will not get what you paid for. If you are subscribed to ESO+, you are getting doubly screwed. I would also say that anyone who owns the game through Steam make sure to also flag the game to Valve directly.--With that out of the way - I wanted to be as accurate and fair as possible with this review. I think this game is vast when it comes to content and world building - you certainly will not run out of things to do. It is graphically pleasing, and there are a lot of elements built in to keep you interested - so in those respects this game is really well done. Everything from the characters you encounter to the quest lines are interesting and varied. However as stated before, the game (via Valve store front) is not working as intended and with only fractional access at best (until the issue with logging in gets fully resolved) this will remain a 'do not recommed' here. I do recommend it highly if you buy it directly from ESO."
Negative,"An insidious game, designed like a digital drug. As someone who's played countless hours of Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim, I derived some enjoyment from the nostalgia factor. But ESO is not those games. Here's what made me quit:1. Combat is stiff and awkward. I don't feel like my character is agile or has freedom of movement.2. As you level up, the damage your weapons do goes down (it's not static). So you go through weapons more often than underwear. Annoying.3. It's utterly absurd that skeevers and other low-level critters are as hard to kill when you're level 50 (+however many champion levels) as they were at level 10. Seriously, at level 50 I should be able to one-shot a nix-hound. Those damn land mosquitoes.4. My character doesn't feel competent or powerful after 125 hours of play and several maxxed skills. I suspect this is by design but it puts me off. Somehow it feels... weaker now that I've reached champion tier. In comparison, a Diablo 3 Demon Hunter at paragon level 400 and a full set of gear made me feel like a force of nature. I know Diablo 3 isn't exactly an MMO... but I never thought I'd compare an Elder Scrolls game to D3 -- UNFAVORABLY.I'm not gonna keep grinding only to feel that I need to grind more. ESO is a hamster wheel with an Elder Scrolls paint job. I'm not a hamster. Enough."
Negative,"This is coming from a longtime player who has had to watch the slow decline over many years.Table of Contents cause its a long one.1. Recent Content Drops2. Bugs3. PVP4. Creating Problems to sell the solution (People who love crafting and foraging need to read this)5. Stressing and Pressuring Players into spending real money6. Real Currency Gambling7. ZOS's ""Fix"" for gambling8. Housing9. New PlayersThis game used to be amazing. However, the devs have given up on trying to create a game that the community will love, and have purely focused on creating a cash shop that will pressure and stress players into buying things now lest they never see them again.1. ZOS doesn't care about new players understanding anything or learning the game. Other MMO's will force you to start at the beginning, learn the game, and work up to the newest content; ZOS dumps new players into the newest DLC that they own, and abandons the players as soon as they're out of the tutorial (Which doesn't even fully cover the basics of the game like how gear or stats work). 2. The actual content that the devs have added recently has all been predictable boring storylines, which are full of so many bugs that many players can't even play the content which they purchased until days or weeks after the content comes out. 3. ZOS also perma ban players for ""abusing"" the bugs which they knowingly put into the game, even if the players didn't know that the bug existed. Like recently when a ton of Dragonknight players were perma banned because a bug made them do more damage  AGAINST COMPUTER ENEMIES NOT OTHER PLAYERS .4. ZOS gave up on the PVP so long ago that I was able to drop the game for an entire year, and when I came back and got up into high tier pvp, literally nothing had changed except my class was useless now. Do not expect to go into this game and have a pvp experience in which high tier pvp will be full of diverse playstyles and unique characters. Everyone uses the same 8 builds, nothing unique really happens, and in really high tier pvp you don't even really get to kill people nearly as much as low tier because everyone is so good at not dying, and there are mostly always healers to save everyone.5. ZOS gets players to spend money by making inventory management the biggest problem, and then selling the solution. If you like crafting and foraging you wont be able to hoard all of your materials without a monthly subscription, because there are so many hundreds if not thousands of materials that even with every single character you have storing as much as possible, you still likely wouldn't be able to hold all of your materials.6. ZOS spends more time creating new cosmetics which cost up to $25 per item, than they do creating fun and engaging events. Because of this, the Cash Shop cycles items through it which are only available for one week, and sometimes these items don't come back for multiple years. So the devs are trying to make their players feel like, ""If you don't spend $50 right now, then who knows if you'll EVER be able to get that awesome cosmetic you want"".7. Another feature of the Cash shop is the gambling system, or ""Crown Crates"" as they're so lovingly named. The mounts that are available in these lootboxes which are only available for a few months before they disappear for the foreseeable future, are so obscenely difficult to get that players can spend hundreds of dollars and not get a single one of the top tier mounts. It's so bad that some countries threatened to ban the game unless ZOS added some other way to get the content.8. Endeavors are the feature that they added to allow all players to get crown crate items for free. The problem is, with those top tier mounts, they cost so many endeavors that even if you did every endeavor quest every single week without fail, it would still take you over FIVE months to earn a single top tier item.9. I'll only discuss one more problem with the In Game Cash Shop, but know that there are countless more.Many years ago ZOS added housing to the game, and you used to be able to spend in game gold to get furnished houses. Now all of the new big houses are available only with real money, and all of the furnishings you might get in game cost so much in game gold, that it will take players months of hardcore grinding to fully furnish their huge houses. Oh yeah, and those big fancy houses that you want will cost up to $100 just for the empty house.Overall, I would never recommend the game to anyone new to the genre, and I would only recommend the game to an experienced player if they were prepared to spend way too much money for a single game."
Negative,"1. Gameplay   3/10It's your average Mmo, with a few improved aspects, but it upholds all the flaws and irritations your mmo-next-door keeps in stock for you. Stupid and uninspired AI (""oh enemy close, AI must fight!""). AI will die and respawn pretty much in plain sight, sometimes right next to you - destroying any attempt at immersion right at the start.While this is an mmo, and you will see plenty of other players running around in shiny armor riding flaming bulls or what-have-you, you will spend most of the time playing this game alone, even when you are in a guild. There will be daily instance runs at more populated guilds, and that's pretty much it.The most contact with other players you will experience is when you are in a public dungeon doing your questlines and they come running in, dragging all the aggro by acting like an idiot, dieing and then returning - which is funny the first 20 times, but starts to wear off rapidly and turns outright annoying when you try to stealth a dungeon and have droves of mobs dragged your way by those players.2. TES Lore 9/10From what i can tell the Lore is carried forward correctly, many books for example that one could find in previous TES Chapters can be found and read usually similarily to their latest rendition (either Oblivion or Skyrim). It seems as though the main development studio exerted a lot of pressure on the designers to maintain and under no circumstances falsify or mess up the established Lore (any further) and as such this game is mostly built on what was and brings very little to the table on its own.3. Game world 7/10Well, this would be your reason to play this game. Visiting places in Tamriel and beyond. Places that you saw in previous chapters maybe, or places that have thus for not been part in any TES game.Since Redguard was one of the first TES games i ever played and i have fond memories of it, one of the first things i did was visit Stros M'Kai - only to find that: Yes they sort of stuck true to the basic layout of the city, but modified and changed it to provide more room for ""patching"" (making more money in fact).Still if there is one thing you absolutely want to do in this game it's to travel around Tamriel and go sightseeing at all those famous places. And to be fair they all look awesome, so the game absolutely scores here.4. As a TES Game 2/10No.Just no.If Bethesda sold me this as TES VI i would absolutely demand my money back.No.There is nothing really unique about your character. Sure you can make some awesome clothes or spend a lot of money to make even more awesome clothes, but in a world where everybody is ""awesome"" what are you?In this game you would not be able to recognize someone by their character, because no matter how much they spent on it it ends up looking just as forgettable as the next one.This starts with character creation and drags on past clothes and costumes - there is nothing here to actually give your character a role, a... character, a what-are-you-in-this-world.Just think of the lengthy story you already lived through when creating a Daggerfall character - here you are just nothing, and that will never change.5. Finances 2/10This is probably the most infuriating part about this game and the reason why i will not extend my Plus-Membership into the next year.I payed 50€ when i got this game - imho that is a hefty sum but i was willing to pay it assuming that this meant i'd be able to play this game unhindered...and this was true for the most part, except i always ended up with an inventory full of trash and useless crap. I then had to find out that the ability to collect crafting materials is stuffed behind a paywall called ""Plus Membership"". An additional bonus to that membership was supposedly a hefty amount of coin for the ingame shop (which in my opinion should not even exist) as well as ""access to all DLC"" - well turns out this didn't include the latest DLC which just happens to cost the tiny puny sum of 39.99€! And no, i cannot even enter the map without spending that money despite the fact that i spent 120€ on the ESO Plus Membership already!It's quite clear to me at this point that a good name is used to milk the community with a game that has some bland appeal at best, cannot live up to the expectation that name carries, and is riddled with paywalls and cash-collectors around every third corner.Final verdict: 4/10 - You can do better."
Negative,"The administration of the game hates the fans of the ""Scrolls"".The game has a huge number of errors that have been known for a long time, but they do not want to fix them.The creators of this game are not trying to make the game user-friendly (interface/crafting/information). And if they do something, they make a lot of mistakes that confuse the players. On forums, in discussions, on other sites, there are a huge number of requests, complaints, suggestions for improvement, but people do not hear or do not want to hear.Instead of updating outdated locations / dungeons / quests, the Administration simply releases new chapters to cut money from the players...The game has killed the economy, a bunch of broken quests, the navigation system is barely breathing...And most importantly, you will always be in battle... even if you have just teleported, even if you are in the city, even if you saw the last opponent half an hour ago)))The game is slowly dying, it can be seen online... It's a pity that the administration doesn't care about this..."
Negative,"If you're just looking for a game to dump a few hours into every  week and run around talking to random people and killing mobs in repetitive fights, then ESO is the game for you. If you're someone looking for well-designed and balanced endgame PvE and PvP content, then look away. There was a time when ESO had everything you could possibly want from a grinding end game oriented game and they threw it all away to make some more money of new players. The current state of the game is lazy and unbalanced and has no interest in retaining their hardcore raiding and PvP community.The most recent character class announcement just shows how tone deaf they are given that when the game was at its peak during Covid, people were begging for a new class and they didn't care because they still got their ESO+ money. As soon as it starts to die down, they dropped a new class. Fortunately for ESO, there's really nothing else on the market that is competing within its genre, but as soon as there is one, I imagine the playerbase will disappear."
Negative,"The game could be nice, but the CRATE system is just indecent.You cannot pay for a skin or horse that you like; you have to buy it with crown gems. But you cannot buy crown gems, you have to buy crate and bet on your luck. Very few crown gems can be gained from some game activities. So if you want something specific you have to spend a lot of money buying useless crates and betting.THIS KIND OF GAMBIT GAME SHOULD BE BANNED FROM STORE.  I will write to EU parliament to gain their attention about this gambling like game and get a law for banning this type of game.This is just indecent. Hope to see this kind of game banned soon."
Negative,I do not recommend buying the steam version. Constant login errors that non-steam players do not experience. Game itself is good.
Negative,"Can´t recommend it if  can´t play.The solution seems simple, let us migrate our accounts from steam entirely, so that we don´t depend on steam anymore."
Negative,"There was an update and now the game crashes every five min. Prolly for the best- this game keeps you hooked with endless fetch-quests and crafting, but at the end of the day is just a thinly-veiled cash-grab. Cool that they got John Cleese to voice a pretty major character though."
Negative,"PRO: -Game is beautifull with expansive diversified zones-Guild are alive, friendly with active members.-Lots and lots of quests-Crown system doesn't seems to favor those who buy into it.-In some of the quests you receive frequent random positive feedback from npc afterward.-Dungeons and ""dolmen"" aplenty. Most public, some personal one.CON: -There's very little reward for playing this game. As you level up so does all your enemies. You do get bonus point to focus your charaters  but no matter what, it take the same amount of time to kill the same mobs from level one or level 30.- Plenty of abilities to develop but only 5 assigned hot keys to use them at one time.-Random loots is 99.9 (.999) merchant fodder and not very lucrative.-Quest tend to be very repetive. Not much ""collect 20 pelt by killing 50 wolf type"" but ""Go see buddy (kill mobs in between) who tell you to kill someone (kill mobs in between) go back to buddy (kill mobs in between) that tell you that your'e done or to see next guy to continue and (guess what, kill mobs in between) and so on"" -They put ""brakes"" on training your mount (min cost 10 000g). You can only train for one 250g mount point a day on either speed, stamina or carrying. Each has 60 levels. Which means that it take 180 days (6 months) to fully train it at  cost of 45000g. That, is if you log on every day.-Plenty of mob and enemies but they seems to fight all the same way. Some do have missile abitlities some don't, that's about it.IN CONCLUSION: after 86 hours of play I barely scratched the surface of all the contents BUT nothing appealled to me to go any further in this beautifull rewardless game either. Maybe if you give it a try you'll like it but I can't so far.I'm thinking of deleting it to gain back this huge amount of memory on my HD."
Negative,"Ths game is actually fucking garbage yet I still fucking play it.My god, I have never seen so many game breaking bugs after each patch.12/10 would buy ESO+ again.F**k me.Update: PvP still doo doo, because the lag, PvE still way too easy. ZoS still greedy.Whole Game still poopie. And I still play it >:("
Negative,"Well, where to start. Download 62GB. Hard Drive has 130GB free, no prob.Finally finish, launch, can't install, game has to install ""82GB"".Uhhh... What?Alright, let's free up space.... Finally install, ""Installs direct x, launcher, and uninstaller.""Wait, you needed 82GB for that?Whatever, time to patch... 4GB patch, whatever, download that.Start installing patch, errors out.""Please repair install"".So yeah, it's repairing at the moment, I have 30 minutes played just on cleaning space I didn't need to, plus repairing.Is this actually a thing? Maybe I'll update my review when I can actually play this game, but typical Bethesda fare to this point. Well played. Fix the installer, there is no reason a 72~GB game needs to eat 150GB just to install. Is this seriously a joke? Are the install manager programmers that incompetant? Just facepalm for days.Edit: It is now downloading 42+ GB. What a god damned joke."
Negative,"Parts of this game are fun, had some good times with other players but all in all this is a just a huge time sink, money pit that never ends. Off and on for almost 10 years, this is my second account. There are thousands of horrible players for every one good player you meet in the game who destroy any hope of having a consistently fun time. MMO's are not fun anymore.Buy a deck of cards and invite some people over or fire up the BBQ grill. You will have a much better time with less stress, plus you can borrow their lawn mower later."
Negative,"I want to like this game, I really do.  All the little parts of it are great individually, but add them all together and... it kind of falls apart. This would be amazing as a singleplayer game, but when they try and stretch it out enough to fit more people at once, it just becomes boring. Travel is slow, hunting crafting ingredients is slow, and I often see someone doing the exact same quest as me but with their quest objects invisible, which makes me feel like I'm watching somone else's game, which is alienating and immersion breaking.It reminds me a lot of DDO, only not as good. If you find yourself considering paying for this game, I strongly advise you give DDO a try first - it's pretty much the same thing, just all around better put together."
Negative,"It's like if someone created a whole other world with different monsters, then nerfed and padded everything so you can't hurt yourself.Good graphics, immersive world from a guild, craft, mine, skill, etc. standpoint but the actual combat and PVE feels pointless.  It's fun at first to explore wherever you want but when you can slay most things from the start what's the point in growing?  Just queue up for a dungeon raid and you will see what I mean.  You race through because there's no challenge to any monsters there, even the bosses.  It is laughable.  I stuck with it for a while to see if things were different anywhere but its all one big pretty but padded cell."
Negative,"im a big fan of MMORPG's, and i liked many games with this genre, but for now for me TESO is actually offline game, that gives only little amount of possibilities to cooperate with other players. No arenas or battlegrounds, which should be included in any game, where many people are involved. Also quest system is created mostly for solo game, there's no solid advantage or comfort to play with friend. I like TES, and i think that every game from this collection was pretty good. But for TESO, as a MMORPG, i dont see solid multiplayer part, so dont think that it can challenge any other classical MMORPGTL DR : Pick other MMORPG or play Morrowind ;)Буду рас видеть вас на моём  YouTube канале  - интересные обзоры и увлекательные прохождения ждут :)"
Negative,"Overview:This game is a dysfunctional marriage of the Elder Scrolls formula and MMO formula. The combat and progression is less exciting than its Elder Scrolls cousins, almost to the point of being watered down. Yet the multiplayer aspect of this game is not as convenient as other games: few dungeons, no auction house and difficult player interaction. This game was infamous for bugs at launch, not all of them have been resolved. Pros:This being said, this marriage can be justified by a few unique features. This game is well written, voice acted, and the setting is fully fleshed out, large and glorious. At times, it gives uncanny flashbacks to its Elder Scrolls cousins, while being able to be enjoyed with a friend or two. Over all, a worthwhile experience -- regardless of its flaws.Cons:Why do I not recommend it? The pay model is absolute garbage. All the endgame material (PvP and PvE) is blocked off by a series of pay walls: expansion packs. This DLC is released every quarter of the year, 20 bucks a pop : 80 bucks/year. Subbing unlocks content temporarily: 120 bucks/year. Keep in mind that you cannot buy the expansions directly, you have to buy Crowns -- which are only sold in 10$, 18$, 30$. This means that you will end up over-paying for your expansions by going through their stupid system. This is a paid game, you already paid full price (40~80$) for it -- and yet have content held hostage by an expensive and badly optimized system.Verdict:If you love the world of ES, you will enjoy ESO as a co-op watered-down game. If you are looking for an good MMO, this is not it."
Negative,"Let us all be perfectly honest and get this out of the way: anyone who has played ESO for more than fifteen minutes knows that this is one of the most blatant and aggressive cash-grabs in the history of video games second only to the invention of blind boxes and NFTs. Are we all in agreement? Fantastic; now I'm going to tear this title a new one.Allow me to get the niceties out of the way: ZeniMax and Bethesda are lucky that this game is pretty. The set dressing is really appealing. There's very little scenery I've found in this title that wasn't nice to look at. Alright, now I'm actually going to tear this game apart.We shall start this arson by setting afire the game play. Nothing about the actual combat is intuitive at all. It's like the developers looked at other MMOs, decided that talent trees are commonplace, and attempted to affix them on top of Skyrim's already broken combat system while sucking every ounce of entertainment from it. Yes, you can get through most of the solo content without actually knowing what you're doing. But to do most of the group content? Unless you've poured over multiple fan websites and have kissed the chocolate starfish of several people willing to have even the tiniest amount of patience with you, you're not likely to see what lurks in all of the pretty landscape's corners..And that reminds me of the players. Surprisingly, this game is alive. There are players everywhere. Most of them are as silent as the grave, but it does add to the overall ambiance. That being stated, the players that do speak up in chat tend to be one of two things: the toxic sort of thing I expect from World of Warcraft or the unfortunate players who have zero clue what they're doing, but are trying their damnedest to help each other out. While it is glorious that there are players out there who aren't abysmal, the fact that the community is so split makes me want to play this thing on an empty server of my own devising.With any title produced by Bethesda, this game is just a pile of buggy code with a shiny veneer. In the eight years of this game's run so far, I'm not aware of much fixed in the realm of backwards logic that is used to put their titles together. You'd think that more effort would be put into fixing this game given its intended longevity and absurd price tag, but you'd be wrong. And of course, unlike all of Bethesda's other titles, the use of mods is absolutely unacceptable within an online game environment.Now that all of that is covered, let's circle back to the elephant in the room: the audacity of the developers and publisher. ESO is one of the most predatory titles I have ever seen. Between the monthly subscription, the loot crates, the piecemeal expansions, and countless cosmetic purchases, the actual cost of this game is immeasurably absurd. I would be happy to go on record in saying that aggressive marketing in this game may be worse than any other title out there. I understand the desire for profit; that's why video games are made. But this? This should be criminal.This title is exactly the reason I do not play MMOs anymore. It isn't worth the hassle. I'm sure that this review is likely to be buried beneath the mountain of positive reviews made by what I can only assume are artificial intelligence and paid actors, but if this review reaches even a few people considering the purchase of this title and deters them from wasting their money, then my time was well wasted."
Negative,"""Unable to queue at this time.""""Queue invite declined...""""Failed to join group.""""Server not responding.""""Servers are down for maintenance."""
Negative,"Pay full price for the game and it's dlc only to find out it's monetized like a damn Free To Play game. Want to do crafting? Better pay us an extra $15 dollars a month. Want to run this dungeon? Ahh, that's $15 bucks a month! Inventory space is basically non-existent, yes you can upgrade it over many many months of daily vendor purchases, or just pay $15 a month. the game is geared in such a way to monetize just about everything you hope to do with in the game you already payed for. It's absolutely infuriating.Oh and if your expecting Skyrim Online, this is no where near that. Races/Classes/Skills have all been super dumbed down so gone are the days of one all powerful character and welcome the cookie cutter carbon copy builds.Maybe if I wasn't forced into going to town after every quests to try and make inventory space, or if crafting was actually fun and profitable like in Skyrim, not just used as a mechanic into forcing you to buy a monthly subscription thank this game might be worth the time. However that's not the case. If your a Whale that loves wasting money on frivolous things this games built for you, if your after a great triple A MMO, keep looking this is a Bethesda licensed cash grab and little else."
Negative,"If you don't want to waste your money, don't buy this game.My wife and I bought a standard game and eso+. An error occurred when buying eso+, and the crowns were not received. We started writing to the support service, they sorted out the problem in 20 days and their solution is banned! As a result, they did not like the choice of our region indicated on the official eso website. And they banned us by referring to Section 8, emphasizing in the text (i) that your information is untrue, inaccurate or incomplete; Section 8 is a great way to circumvent the license agreement and express their personal dislike for the user.My wife continued to communicate with the support service and provided more accurate data with live photos of the computer from which the payment was made. What's next, will they ask for my ID card?Does this mean that I can't use this game while traveling?The License Agreement does not prohibit the use of any region from the list. I could have chosen any of the options presented.Why is the support service trying to restrict my freedom of movement?Someone from the support service did not like the choice of my region, and he banned me. Then why is this region in the list of available when registering an account? It's like a trap to get money out of people. Have you chosen a region that the support service doesn't like? Get banned. It's like inciting hatred.The support service communicates lazily, without any desire to help. After the first contact, you get the feeling that you are hated.I really liked the game, but the support service is a separate art form. I think the support service is the worst thing that can happen to this game.Don't send me messages with the unlock request form, you won't unlock anyway. We all know how it works, the support service says one thing in front of the public, but quite another face to face.Better think about the employees you hire, or teach them to communicate with people adequately. P.S. This is the first time I was banned from the game, and even without an adequate indication of the reason.Question? How can I use the difference in price, ATTENTION, if it is not sold in the region indicated on the website. My opinion is that they just took the money, they didn't want to solve the problem out of personal dislike.Went on vacation, played a game. Thank you for this experience."
Negative,"Stepped away from this game for four years. It is still a bugged mess that has been monetized into the ground. Storywise, it is a bad elder scrolls game. MMOwise it is an amateurish console port. The first day I came back there was a community event. Guess what, if you want to participate you have to buy DLC. Neat. Six years of development and you still cannot stack bank inventory and have to manually withdraw and stack then deposit again. Neat.Entire economic professions locked off by DLC. Neat.Just another low quality cash grab from Bethesda."
Negative,The game itself seems fine from the little amount I played it. It doesn't have the feel of your usual TES games though.Decided to give it a try during free weekend event and immediately decided to cut it short as soon as I noticed a number of QoL features locked behind monthly payments. Not a fan of that sort of practice.
Negative,"TESO tries to bring the epic feeling of The Elder Scrolls singleplayer games to a massively multiplayer univerese.The result unfortunately is neither a good Elder Scrolls Singleplayer game, nor a good MMORPG.In trying to cater to both markets the game dilutes each genre to the point neither side of the game is particularly fun. From an Elder Scrolls point of view questing is linear, mundane and non organic. You get the typical MMO style of hubs, with packs of mobs standing around waiting for you to attack them. The story is not very engaging and the cliché repetitive nature of mmorpg shopping list questing comes into play.From an MMORPG point of view the game feels like a shell. No nameplates, poor communication options and a lack of social tools all make the game feel like it was designed from the ground up for consoles. The dungeons are boring, the PvP leave much to be desired and your actions feel like they have little impact.All in all the game is a solid 5/10 as buy2play. Quite frankly you should save your money."
Negative,"EDIT 2024: DOG ARMOR, Really? Oblivion Horse armor DLC flashbacks intensifies.Yeah the game is playable and it can be great fun with friends but...The devs are getting greedy now, let me explain.The fact that guilds, classes and some races are locked in an elder scrolls universe until you pay for them is sickening to me. Oh and we have cosmetic loot boxes to, it's not that big of an issue since they are cosmetics only but still the fact that we have gambling loot boxes shows how greedy they are. To unlock a cool skin you need to open it from a loot box and when your inventory fills up with trash since the drops rates are so low, you won't be able to store them anywhere unless you give them more money, it's a shame what has happened to this games monetization. So much content is locked behind a paywall. A lot of the DLC's need to be payed for when they should be free to the players that have already paid for the game. BIG F"
Negative,"Great game for solo experience. Anything that requires you to interact with other players is just a toxic hellscape. Make the slightest misstep, use the wrong ability, spend time dealing with real life instead of devoting every second of your life to a guild, not knowing every mechanic on your first time through a dungeon, and on and on and on... Someone will berate you, yell at you, mock you, let you know you are worthless for not spending every waking moment engrossed in this MMO. If you are looking for an MMO that has some chill and relaxed people, this isn't the game for you. This is the MMO for people who have cracked the game, squeezed all the joy and fun out of a game until all that is left is distilled efficiency."
Negative,New cp changes on top of limited sets for pvp is just dumb. Whats the point in testing my builds out when i can only use 12 sets in pvp. People put hours into grinding and golden out sets to not be able to use them.
Negative,"Can't log into the game. Great first experience.-Quick update for those of you still reading at home. Spent hours to re-download game, hours to download a patch and even more time to apply it. Only for the game to fail saying it can't get the patch manifest and to run repair or re-download the game again.... Funny I play a lot of games and I don't really have any issues with them... Must be a small indie company thing."
Negative,"I'm a big Elder Scrolls fan and really wanted to like this game. At first it seemed really cool, but that was just the enjoyment of playing something new. Reality is the game is very low quality cash grab. Everything is locked behind a pay wall. If you subscribe (which is more expensive than any other mmo game out there) there is still a bunch of stuff you need to spend money on. Housing is extra real life money, any piece of furniture for the house that is not crab requires cash, these items can't be just purchased either they have to be gotten in GOTCHAs they call crates. Every character you make needs to level up 3 different mount skills levels  (1-60)x3 and you can only gain one level every 20 hrs. I have a nice computer and net, but there is SERVER LAG. Every time you enter a town you have to wait a few minutes for things to load. All you see at first are black silhouettes if anything at all. MANY MANY skills you want to use are locked behind faction reputation that requires long grinds to receive. ELSWEYR was a huge let down, they called it an expansion, but it was the same as the DLCs they drop from time to time. The necro feels the same as all the other races. You build and play it exactly the same as all the other mage classes. NO AUCTION HOUSE, to sell anything to other players you MUST join a trading guild. Good trading guilds require high weekly dues, because they have to pay  millions and millions of coin to rent stalls in towns. Rent is monthly for the stalls and another guild can come up and outbid you at any time and you lose your spot. GUILDS, you can be in 5 different guilds at a time. You need every slot for trading, socializing, and raiding.  The big problem with this system is that every guild is full of lurkers, people who are in the guild and online but never participate in anything. You won't know half the people in your guild. You are lucky if you chat with 10%.Soon into your playing experience you will find yourself logging in just to grind to stay alive.  You will be spending hours a day spinning your wheels and accomplishing nothing.  You will need to log on EACH character to level mount skills, do writs, grind gold for dues, and many more like that. This takes away from the enjoyment of the game, because  it leaves no time to do dungeons or raids.  I have seen many many people log in to only mount skill, writ, and gold grind then log off for each toon. That is all they ever do.DO NOT BE FOOLED  this game is NOT FREE, everything is locked behind pay walls including inventory space. Game quality is very low and lags while at the same time subscription is the highest I have seen. This game is not taking any more of my money or time. I think I might go back to FF14. It was much higher quality for less."
Negative,"The nickel and diming of Elder Scrolls Online would put most free-to-play Korean MMOs to shame.  In the last few months, Elder Scrolls Online shifted focus from adding content to draw in new players and improve upon the experience, to adding content for the sake of purely monetizing it.There are many examples of how the focus on purely monetizing in this PAY-TO-PLAY MMO has gotten out of hand, but here are the top ones: The Homestead update which added player housing is designed so that acquiring a house and furniture is extremely inconvenient to entice players to spend $100+ on a furnished house for the convenience. The most recent house added to the game can ONLY be purchased with real money for $100 to $120 USD, depending on whether it’s purchased with or without furniture.Morrowind, the “expansion” that adds one zone goes for $40 for standard upgrade to $100 for a Collector’s Edition. It includes a new playable class, the Warden. However, there is no new character slot to accommodate the new class. Instead two character slots will be purchasable for $15 EACH. That’s right, ZOS is making players pay an additional $15 on top of the $40 or $100 spent in order to play the new class added in Morrowind. Having a new extra character slot when a new class is added in a paid expansion is standard practice in all the other MMOs.A mount added to the store for 3 days in December went for about $40 USD.The addition of Crown Crates, which are gamble boxes, when opened can give a costume, pet, or in almost all cases, just pure consumable junk. A pack of 15 such boxes goes for $40.00 USD, and recent player reports suggest that they are rigged to give worthless consumable experience scrolls over costumes/pets/mounts for the rarer reward tiers.A HAIRSTYLE added to the game for 3 days went for $20 USD.Meanwhile bots run rampant in the game, some camping in obvious areas called dolmens to the point that they are causing lag due to their sheer numbers. Others farm materials and mobs, crashing prices of crafting materials. Nothing has been done about them for months.A year ago, the game was at its best when new zones and content were added that subscribers ($15/month) could access. It was a time when it did not feel necessary to spend hundreds of dollars to fully experience the game like Homestead did. A year ago, the Crown Store had cosmetic purchases that could be made with real money without the astronomical prices like it does now, and it actually felt like a fun extra to the game. Now, the development of the game feels purely focused on adding the next $100 item to the Crown Store rather than on actual game content.Until ZOS (the developers) shift their focus back to the game itself and stop treating players like bags of meat with wallets, I cannot recommend this game. Don't get me wrong though, I had a lot of fun until the nickel and diming tactics were out of control. If you can get past these issues, you could get some enjoyment out of the game.  No, the ENTIRE game is not bad, it's just overshadowed by a lot of poor PR practices and the aforementioned issues.."
Negative,"I. LOVE. THIS. GAME! I purchased this game at release on Xbox One and even with friends it was terrible, I just re-purchased on Steam because I got soooo tired of playing World of Warcraft, Elder Scrolls Online has to be the best game I bought this year by far! I need to get the Expansion for it. A lot for this game has changed since released and believe me it was for the better. Switching over from WoW was the best choice I made because I was looking for a new RPG to play, this game is actually a challenge, the dungeons are fun, hard and waaaaay more rewarding compaired to other RPG's I've played in the past. The game starts off slow as most games do but boy when it picks up its a delightful experience for sure.EDIT 11/30/2022 I Have not played this game in about 2 years in my opinion it is no longer fun to play it is super dead and I cannot find groups for any content, Ive been playing classic wow since that dropped! If your looking for a solid MMO go play some of that"
Negative,"After returning to the game after a long hiatus, which was based on it not being worth paying a subsciption for, I have decided to write a review. I have not read any of the other reviews here so there may or may not be overlap, but I wanted to say how I feel about it. -The game in its current form has exceptionally good graphics, easily the best in any MMO I have played.  - The generic user interface is simple to the point of not displaying pertinent information until the game thinks you need    it. ie, your experience bar...-Targeting in combat is clunky and sometimes difficult, but get in a group for a dungeon and, for all of us not so not so autistically good at games, downright frustrating. -There is no gui to show buffs/debuffs/hots etc. This may be linked to a greater feeling of ""realism"" but they do in fact exist in the game, and there is know way to tell unless you enter the character screen and check. This of course does not apply to dots or debuffs on enemies, you just have to have faith they are there.-The quests are ok the first time around, but try them the second go through and they become so tedious you actually get frustrated. -The bank tabs require you to quit and re-enter multiple times in order to move items around. This may sound trivial, but it gets really annoying if you forget something or are emailing items from two bank tabs. And the cost to upgrade those tabs is the highest I have seen in games I have played.  -Money generation in the game is very very slow, so slow in fact that you are forced to join trading guilds in order to make any significant amount. This is all well and good I suppose except even that mechanic is based on your luck at finding or salvaging items other people will buy. At higher levels you make more gold, but by then it becomes about tweeking your character, instead of say, buying materials to build sets for leveling.-The versatility of the crafting system is really good. The major problem with it is that you can't really outfit another character that does not share your item types. For example you create a medium armour character and research all of the intrinsic traits (which could take months btw). If you then create a heavy armour class, by the time you could make them named sets (due to research times) you would level out of the zone and usefulness of the items.       - the majority of the armour sets are ugly or boring, and the modeling for many of the pieces is so bad they just          hang in mid air.              - ***Items purchased from the crown store only apply to the character that purchased it. Thats right, if you want daedric crafting styles for all eight of your characters be ready to shell out $120.... and there are four different crafting styles like this, or five I cant remember.         - It is probably no accident that they are the nicest looking sets in the game.- The endgame is ridiculous and designed to eliminate the need for zenimax to create more content. I wont say why due to spoilers, but you will get it if you make the mistake of buying this game.*BUT THE MAIN REASON TO NOT BUY THIS GAME IS THE TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE*Allow me to explain. When I first purchased this game it was still subscription based and I did not own a credit card. This was simple enough because it came with a free month of game time. After my purchase I discovered that in order to activate that free game time zenimax required me to link a credit card and they would attempt to bill it to make sure it was good. I sent out an email explaining my situation, and asking why I would need a credit card for free game time. The response took I believe two days to arrive and when it did instead of solving the problem tried to offer other billing solutions. It took quite awhile ( I believe four or five days total ) I finally got a representative to offer me a key that allowed me to play the game on just my free game time. I suppose I should be grateful they did anything at all, but I was now five days behind the friends who bought it with me. The next blow came quite recently and is the nail in the coffin for me. After reporting an instance where I was constatly falling through the world, I received and email informing me that I had violated the code of conduct in naming my account. There was no recognition of the bug report, no reply to the incident at all, just an emaill that looked very much like a punishment for doubting the zenimax gods. Again, all responses took days to arrive until the final day in which I was told in no uncertain terms that if they decide something that is the way it goes. Period.This is the short list, there are also inconsistencies in the lore, bad textures, long load times when entering zones and buildings etc etc. I would suggest you read all the reviews here in reference to this game, but keep in mind that depending where you are the price has not come down permanently since launch and the its pretty pricey for a two year old game."
Negative,"Everyone seems to be forgetting something in their reviews.PROGRESSION. Did you expect to level up and become a POWERFUL HERO ? For your gear to MEAN SOMETHING?!Move along then - you won't find it here unless you spend hundreds of hours. The level scaling in this game makes everything POINTLESS. This is a game where from level 1 to 50 you basically DO THE SAME DAMAGE. Where all gear is pointless (and the same) until level 50 and sometime beyond. Where every single level up will feel like torture because your level and gear MEAN NOTHING. It doesn't matter that you get CP levels or whatever after level 50 and you start feeling more powerful. It matters that until that point, you are USELESS.Sure, you can group up with people and quest in any areas. But it all feels so DAMN BLAND. No matter how good the story might be, it will still feel boring. That's why they even hide the damage numbers by default so that you won't realize your playing level 1 until level 50+.Other things to consider:- Bag space. You'll quickly run out of it due to all the trash you need to pick up (and that includes crafting materials). This forces you to buy a subscription in addition to the base game (ESO plus) to get the *crafting bag* because going to the bank all the time will piss the heck out of you.- You're not buying a full game with all content and expansions (and I mean the Elsweyr Digital Collector edition). SURPRISE! There is still plenty of content (and I don't mean cosmetics/mounts only, I mean story/dungeons as well)  in the shop for which you will need to pay or get an ESO plus subscription.- Ingame shop prices ? Kind of ridiculous. That's why you need a subscription, again. Granted the subscription will grant you 1600 something crowns currency per month.- Leveling mounts ? Takes months of logging every single day to max out. On EACH character. Yes, it's not even account bound - good luck with that.- Poor optimization regardless of your PC specs. But then again, most online games (except wow?) have this plagued trend. They did schedule some improvements for next year on their road map.- LOOTBOXES. What - the - heck. Gambling scrolls online!- Leveling XP scrolls - ever wondered if it's a bit grindy?And this is just scratching the surface. Most likely if you have a group of friends you could level together and somehow get to 50 and then start enjoying the game. Community seems nice, from my limited experience. But really, modded Skyrim is by far the best elder scrolls experience you can get right now."
Negative,"This is not an ""elder scrolls experience"", this is your run-of-the-mill MMORPG experience. That being said, it is better than your average MMORPG, though that is not saying much.- This game feels like a theme park, where the NPC are employees, catering to their ""player"" customers, where little timmy needs to wait his turn to save the princess, it does not feel like a land where the NPCs are its people.- All the regions feel the same, and are very un-impressive. E.g. you read about black marsh being incredible inhospitable, of unpassable terrain, subterrain worm trains etc. Nothing like that, it just has more trees and puddles. Alikir desert, it just has more sand and less trees. Altmer cities with insect wing like constructins etc, nope, just basic buildings and trees.- You are the (non-ironic) chosen one... among the thousands of chosen ones... who hold such ancient traditional names like: Loudsex, N00b-sl4y3r-9000, Apple-products-sux, Analhamster etc. in their royal neon pink bikinies, hopping around like bunnies spewing profanities. This totally increases immersion.- While supposedly being a multiplayer game, there are so many instances where the game will not let you play with your friends, nor can you complete the quests together (like in borderlands), instead, you must both complete them on your own. This becomes even greater issue when if you have completed a quest, and your friend has not, and many times, this prevents you from even helping them.Overall, like all MMORPGS, it relies on an addiction factor, like a more complex candy crush, incentivizing you to play it as a daily routine, via artificial timer constraints, that can only be done every 20-24h, in addition, with crafting timers from 1 up to 30 real life days.This game just leaves you wanting to play a proper TES game, or just a proper RPG."
Negative,Best not to play this game for people who live in Asia or Australia and have a bad network. Cuz you will not enjoy the pvp mode or group dungeon with people inside. Unless you have VPN or internet cable.
Negative,Played this originally back in 2013.It's still boring over 10 years later.
Negative,"selling private info no buenobuy 2 play,pay per month,dlc,sell ur infodisgusting"
Negative,Uses AI to monitor all private messages and distribute bans for unproblematic RP
Negative,"DON'T BUY FROM STEAM!The game is actually really good, but if you buy it from steam you'll have a lot of problems to access the servers.So, buy it, but not here."
Negative,"WTF man! I bought the game and put time into it and then when I tried to open it today, it took me to the Elder Scrolls Online page on Steam! Where there was a ""play"" button, there was later a ""purchase"" button! I tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it, but it disappeared from my library. I tried to re-download the game and even tried to REPURCHASE it, but it said I already have the game in my library when I do not. Either that or idk how to get to it! This SUCKS!"
Negative,"TL;DR: If you like other MMOs like GW, WoW etc, and you are looking for PvE quests like that, it's a NO. If you want to mess around brainlessly doing quests and easy monsters, it's a yes. If you are willing to pay the subscription monthly, it's a big yes probably.This game is a lot fun, the lore and quests are really well made (thanks, Elder Scrolls franchise), the community is awesome most of the time, the PvP is not bad BUT...Outside dungeons and raids, the PvE is boring as fuck unless it is one of the bosses of the world; bosses of the main quest are very weak and can be done by a single player that never played before.But the main reason that I'm giving this one a big NO is that the game is super pay-to-play.Some armor/weapons are restricted to the DLCs (which aren't cheap), the in-game gold is way less valuable than the in-game cash (Crowns), the ratio of Crown:Gold is 300:1 usually. That means if you want to buy something for 10 crowns, that's 3k gold. And things generally cost 1000 Crowns or so.I stopped playing when I realized I had to grind for days and weeks to make furniture for my house while other players could buy them for a small amount of crowns."
Negative,"Sadly I couldn't give a ""neutral"" review or something for this, but don't take this ""review"" as anything for the quality of the game.All I wanted to say is that you need about 160GBs to initially install the game, because of a bad installation system the game has, at least for Steam. Steam installs about 80GBs, then open the game and the launcher essentially reinstalls 80GBs more, and once it fully reinstalls it deletes the first 80GBs, so you ARE left with ~80GBs, but you have to have at least ~160GBs to install it in the first place. Which I did not have sadly. So, uh, beware and all that."
Negative,"I can no longer recommend this game. As time has gone on the servers are getting worse and worse, to the point you a booted from the game trying to go to a different zone, trying to load in Cyrodiil, while crafting, during Trials and Dungeons. Multiple times and with seemingly no explanation. ZOS know and don't care or seem to be doing anything about it, but hey ""Buy the latest DLC"" If you enjoy screaming at your monitor and questioning your life choices, by all means get this game."
Negative,"I Remember having a SUPER positive review about this game back when i had about 800 hours.Alas . . . those days are long gone.Seeing a game i loved playing for years degrade instead of improve was sad.I was about 4000 hours in that i realized soon i'll be leaving it , the only thing that kept me playing it for a couple of hundred more hours were my friends and the ""hope"" of improvements which it never happened.Seeing ZoS ruining the game just like what they did with Fallout 76 over the years was just painful.For the first 2 years i was just doing PvE stuff probably around 1500 hours , at the beginning it was flawless then weird loading screens started , dungeon queue bugs started and ZoS allowed toxic players to roam around.Then i was like , you know what ? lets try PvP maybe it's better and that is where i spent most of my hours.The first 1000 hours was just F***ing awesome i wholeheartedly enjoyed it , became emperor a couple of times and was always on top 5 for like 7 months straight and i'm not self-praising just trying to say that i played A LOT , whoever plays this game knows becoming emperor multiple times on a campaign that is not dead is no easy/fast task.To be honest i didn't have much problems with PvP until Necromancer class was announced besides some minor stuff that i tolerated , there were some things people complained about(like loading screens and desyncs a few crashes here and there) and they were right but i tried ignoring them and just preferred enjoying the game instead even though i was experiencing them myself.After a while , seeing past through their empty improvement promises i started to lose more hope day after day.It was at a point where they would say we're improving the performances and servers with this patch and once they release it your game would get even worse lol.There was this time i remember they said we're working on fixing the crashes with this patch , then the patch dropped and everyone was crashing every 30 minutes and it took them almost 2 weeks to fix that and by fixing i mean it just went back to how it was before.I almost forgot to add , playing during prime times both PvE and PvP was just pure frustration , you'd be in a trial and your skills wouldn't just simply go off immediately , had to press the button like 10 times for it to register same thing with PvP , you'd be fighting a group of enemies and it's not the battle of skills and numbers there , it's a battle of who got better luck/ping/performance in this lagfest.They changed the way how some sets/skills/classes work a couple of times mainly to balance it for PvE players , i mean it's good to nerf or change something that is not performing correctly or it's super OP but sometimes it would be some unnecessary changes which it would force you to change the way you're used to play and take off some skills/sets and create stupid metas for both PvP and PvE , and when there is a meta in a game it means you can't be creative with your playstyle anymore , you gotta follow a certain way which i extremely detest and if you don't follow it that way you can't simply perform good enough.I think that's it for now , might add more in future and if you're one of those Fan bois defending the game with all your power know that i was like that back in the beginning so you will get here eventually and realized you wasted so much time and money on this game. . ."
Negative,So i buy the game and play it then where the play button is its now a purchase button and i dont know what happened like the game so far though
Negative,"terrible event is what prompted me to write this, but while I'm at it...the game is INCREDIBLY inconvenient to play without spending money either on a sub (double bag/bank space, entirely separate inventory for crafting mats) or heavy cash shop usage (~$80 to buy a bank and decon companion, +$??? for the dlc you get with the sub). If you try to play without either or both of those you're probably going to be spending more time managing your inventory than actually playing.I can and have gotten past that. However currently the community is defending a limited-time event with several <1% drop rate collectibles. Lolno. Trolls are thriving so hard feeding on all the complaining about the event. It's SOOOOOOOO toxic in zone chat and I'm not touching the event style pages at all. <_>"
Negative,"The game is quite fun. If you enjoy Elder Scrolls games with deep quests you definetely won't be missing out with this iteration. There is just one nagging problem: the support for this game is horrendous. I purchased ESO+ for my account here and its not active within the game. I am struggling with the inventory issues ESO+ is intended on fixing. I have been waiting for a reply for 5 days only to get a canned response on how to enable ESO+ from their website. Its like they don't even read the tickets. When I saw the reply a wave of memories came over me...I remember why I left from playing back in the beta with over 300 hours logged...their support is absolute crap. They don't read tickets, they don't listen and worst of all they do NOT care if you wasted money. If you plan on playing this without any problems, great. The issues I've had time and time again with them make this an avoid for me."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM!If you want to get this game, buy it from Bethesda’s website, not through Steam. It’s so annoying how many times I’ve experience being kicked out of the game while inside a dungeon and having severe lag issues like today because of Steam. Players who purchased the game via Bethesda’s website are not having this issues. And this outage happens during an annual event of ESO where people get 100% xp bonus. It’s so frustrating that I cannot enjoy these perks right now.AGAIN, DO NOT BUT THIS GAME ON STEAM! You will regret it and will convince you to buy the game straight from Bethesda just like me."
Negative,"This game really isn't what you are thinking if you are looking for a one time payment and a lot of Elder Scrolls enjoyment. Yes the game itself looks very nice and feels very nice (outside of the very poor optimisation). Optimisation issues I encountered:In the tutorial, I ran the game at ultra high with 100fps. I have a GTX 970 and an 8-core AMD Vishera 4.0(4.2 turbo)ghz processer. After the tutorial, once I got back into Tamriel, I hit 30-40fps. I had to REALLY lower the settings and I still couldnt break 60fps.My other issue with this game is that Zenimax is incredibly greedy.You are already spending $40-$80 on the game alone, and then in order to get all the DLC you have to spend another $15 each, and in order to play any race in any pact, you have to spend another $15. You could spend hundreds of dollars to get all the content you want. Hell, Zenimax will sell you anything. You can BUY vampirism or lycanthropy. Thats just a terrible business model right there. I guess you'd think that a game in this genre (which has largely become free-to-play) would not have this many ridiculously priced microtransactions when you already spend a huge amount to buy the game to begin with. And you\'d also think that a game of this calibur would have better optimisation. I asked for a refund as well, which will hopefully go through even though I went over the limit of 2-hours because of the ridicuously long patch times the launcher puts you through as well. As a huge elder scrolls fan, I really wanted to love this game, and love playing it with friends, but I simply cannot when the payment model this game uses is so atrocious. If you are okay with this sort of microtransaction abuse, by all means get the game. If you love the Elder Scrolls games and dislike all of these things I have described - long wait times to download patches, expensive microtransactions, poor optimizaiton - I would wait for the next single player Elder Scrolls that is actually made by Bethesda Softworks."
Negative,1h 40min queue and im paying for eso+? no thank youuu
Negative,"It's a platform to sell you DLC and hollow macro-microtransactions. That's 90% of the negative review.It can be enjoyable, but don't expect an experience of a lifetime."
Negative,"I literally bought the game just to play as a Necromancer. This only after downloading the game and logging in, I found out that the necromancer has to be bought in the crown store.This is unaccaptabe. I thought the reviews of microstransactions were just whining, turns out it's completely accurate. Ruined.Just noNO"
Negative,"This is a difficult game to review because what is good is very good, but what is awful is as bad as it gets.Since I've come from the single player Elder Scrolls games I expected that the vast majority of the quests for my characters while leveling would be fairly relaxed, so I'd be able to fully understand what my skills did and what options I'd have to build my character. I was wrong. The Elder Scrolls games were always about freedom, while Elder Scrolls Online's freedom is an illusion, paid for and with severe consequences. The NPE is horrible, and even though I read and watched numerous tutorials I had a hard time and made many mistakes. Two hits and I'm dead regardless of class or armour I wear. It is better to stand about near these things called 'dolmens' (hopefully near to world boss spawns so you can run from one to the other) with other randoms spamming whatever skills you have that are AOE and buff others damage to level up. Questing is near pointless.Combat is as bad as it gets. Enemies are bullet sponges often with unblockable cheesy moves and they are just not interesting to fight. Most of the quests are incredibly tough to beat as a new player with sub-optimal gear and skills, as a result and it doesn't surprise me at all to see so many folk who have leveled up their character to maximum still being clueless how to play their class. This would be fine since ESO is online and ""get some friends"" to help, but that isn't what I want when I'm trying to learn and I certainly don't want the speed I quest at being dictated to me by other players. From what I've seen on youtube about endgame now since the Morrowind expansion, I'm not even sure I will bother doing any endgame content because learning optimal this and optimal that is boring AF - developing muscle memory spamming the same moves until they get nerfed in the next patch, switch skills, rinse and repeat. No thanks, I've done it all before.Crafting is a big part of ESO and it's good apart from the first thing that annoyed me with ESO was inventory size. To start with it is incredibly limited, and if you intend to craft items you need to subscribe to ESO plus otherwise the inventory management becomes intolerable really fast as you level. Given I'd forked out a hefty sum of money for the base game this really pissed me off, and since I play Eve Online where I have millions of items I view the severe limitations on inventory in ESO as a disgusting cash grab. Then there is potions which at low level are not really worth bothering with because the effects are so short lived and cooldown on potion use long. Armour breaks to as you play, so since I've died so frequently and get two shot even with my armour working I see no point wasting gold repairing it. Eating or drinking is very important to in keep stats as high as possible but finding the right ingredients is a nightmare unless you have ESO plus.Then there is keybindings - or lack thereof. Want to bind keys for different potions - tough you can't, you can have one potion equiped to a hotkey and have to jump through hoops to use a different one because 'console controller.' Press 'Q' move the mouse over the potion and press 'Q' again. You are allowed to two weapons equipped with five skills linked to each weapon, and those skills use the keys '1-5.' You have to assign a key to access your other weapon, assign another key to access your first weapon again and use keys '1-5' for skills, and you can't use keys '1-0' like would be more logical given the amount of real estate a keyboard has. I'm totally fine games having decent joypad support, but I am obviously not happy about the lack of mouse and keyboard support.I always play Imperial in Elder Scrolls games - it costs 2000 crowns for that no matter which version of the game you get for some reason. Probably because this game is just a big cash grab, which I could understand if the base game was free. I bought Tamriel Unlimited which is obvioulsy only unlimited apart from the 10quid it would cost to be an imperial, 5quid to access some dungeons, 9quid a month for a reasonable inventory plus whatever the morrowind expansion costs.What's good? It looks good and sometimes is amazingly good for an MMO. Sound is good with characters voiced by folk like John Cleese, and very atmospheric and rich music throughout. The quests I've done have been well written and really quite enjoyable.That said, Elder Scrolls Online is the most polished of turds I've ever played. Total Biscuit once said that Eve Online was the grindiest grind that ever grinded - well I disagree - ESO is. I've well over a hundred hours played and the vast majority of that was busywork or dicking about with other characters to manage my inventory. The main character I was leveling I've come to despise which for me is a cardinal sin when it comes to an MMO character, because if I hate a character I stop playing.I feel so sorry for the people I've been leaching levels from who are grinding away a fresh character because their old ones got nerfed (and I am sorry for leaching too.) It's tragic that some people have become so attached to this pile of garbage game that they would willingly grind for hours of tedious boring gameplay just to level up, so they can then spend a week or so grinding against a training dummy to develop the muscle memory for optimal play with their class so they can have some fun; they are like baby seals waiting to be clubbed - sad I find it, really sad.Edit:Reviewing an MMO of this scale isn't easy, and after a bit of a barny with one of my friends who loves this game I have put more time into this game to get to 'his level.' Now I'm almost there grinding further has just revealed more things I find either frustrating or downright annoying.I am currently at the gear maximum which means that it is worth grinding, buying or crafting gear that would make my character half decent - effectively end game. If I want to craft decent gear I'm going to have to wait about nine months before I can unless I open my wallet and spend a few hundred quid to speed up the process. I'll give any readers the credit to make their minds up whether this is a cynical cash grab or a justified pay to advance mechanic since the crafted gear isn't the best available in game.Buying gear: seriously I think amazon could deliver stuff faster than this game does. In the meantime I have bought the same thing twice while waiting bacause I had forgotton I'd already bought it. You see each guild has it's own trader - there is not a consolidated market and finding what I've wanted has taken hours hopping between towns so unless I write everything down it is really simple to screw up. Some filters reset when hopping from guild market to guild market too, so I've either remembered to properly sort things again, or ended up buying something for a lower level character.Other stuff:When doing a quest that I expect to follow on from another the game likes to troll and change quests to something else, usually from another area so I've ended up going backwards - often.Housing is totally useless and only for the vainest of elder scrolls geeks.Pretty much every system and mechanic in this game is trying to force folk to be social. This would be fine if all the elder scrolls games before this one forced progression in one specific way. Everything in this game feels forced with a vaneer of freedom and it tries so hard to get me to spend real money I am now really wary of Zenimax and Bathesda.Loading times are loooong.Once I bought and downloaded the game from steam, I had another patch to download which took over two hours to download. Given how cynical this game has made me feel, this over two hour download looks like a means to escape any players who don't like the game and want their money back.Angry Joe's three year old review is STILL relevant when the devs have had over three years to fix stuff."
Negative,You're not allowed to complain about microtransactions in any other game until you've played this.
Negative,kowtows to the chinese communist party. perma-bans any account that says the word tianemen.
Negative,"""Best permadeath ever encountered""Via account ban.So after 85 minutes of gameplay I had a single 2-level character in a starting zone with something like 20-26 coins and a bag full of loot, with no guild, no friends, no mail, no chat messages. Not a lot of progress, but hey -- I love to explore a game world, so I spent time crawling into every possible corner of a starting zone (and looting everything around, that's Elder Scrolls after all).I decided that I like the game, purchaced another copy as a gift for my sister (so we can loot twice more!) and happily turned off my PC and went asleep.Now, time for magic! I don't remember having a habit of sleepwalking (or sleepgaming). But according to the email I've received from TESO support next morning, they've caught me selling the gold during that night. I've requested them to provide any evidence (I am really into it, because I don't even know how to sell gold -- never thought of it), but received no response.So... If you are planning for any long-term play, I can not recommend this game."
Negative,"I like the features a lot and I am having a fun time my issues are not with the game. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE GAME FROM STEAM. Download it straight from the ESO website, dear god I have had so many issues with installation and launch and updates. I've looked on forums and literally the only people who have launching issues have downloaded it from Steam. Just save yourself the trouble and download it from the website. But yeah good game I like it a lot it just took years off my life with the issues I had with the launcher. And I know it is not my computer because I have several other games from Assassins creed to final Fantasy to Minecraft and they all work fine. Just take my advice save yourself the trouble."
Negative,"They should really get a server for SEA players. After invested so much into ESO, I guess I am almost done with the game.The server stability was Okay in 2019, and early 2020. Ping in SEA here was about 300ms. However, in 2021 especially, I am constantly getting ping spike from 300ms-999ms. The game is still playable if the ping maintain at 300ms and not spiking so frequently. This spike happens constantly and the game is unplayable for me. I have tried in different hours and the spike is always there.I have no such spike issue when playing other online games, such as CSgo, Dota 2, and your own Bethesda game, Fallout 76.Hence, I am giving this a negative review. If they are able to fix the server stability issue and make the game playable again, I will change my review back to Positive."
Negative,"( Not even close to what I have come to love and expect  from the elderscrolls series)So I have played most bethesda games, I am a huge fan I have always loved the game mechanics, the story line and the satisfying effects of the weapons. I could go on and on about the specifics that make bethesda games a joy to play. However ESO is missing virtually every single positive aspect that made the previous games in the series satisfying. Its only redeeming quality is that you can play with your friends. I have one friend who loves this game and I could play any game with my friends and have fun which is why I have put in so much time into ESO to spite my disappointment.For such a modern game the repetitive nature of every animation is just surprising. You can watch two skeletons perform the same attack at the exact same time in exact  same way much like the sprites in an old PS1 game. You can also die a hundred different ways but fall down always with the same animation.Also every tinny aspect of this game has been monetized to the point where you cant walk three feet without seeing locked content waved in your face or another over priced DLC zone that you cant enter. Even the joy of assassinating NPCs has been locked guards are invincible unless you buy the dark brotherhood DLC. Speaking of NPCs they are more like cardboard cutouts with tape recorders then actual villagers with lives and schedules like in previous games.There are million different skins you can buy for your character which is fine however most of the skins totally break the immersion and continuity of the game, picture entering a dark ominous dungeon only to find the koolaid man has already defeated the boss. There is so much more I could pick apart in this game but I will choice just one more thing to mention.The one part of this game that has any kind of depth ( the character creation) If you have spent hundreds of hours making a unique build that almost makes the game feel worth while, don't get to attached there will eventually be an update that changes how the main skill mechanics work ruining any synergy you were able to piece together after tirelessly grinding though repetitive and tedious dungeons where the plot is totally irrelevant."
Negative,"Just like any other MMO out there: simplified, repetitive and linear.You won't find the depth, alternate routes or branching choices found in previous games of the saga.You won't find life-like NPC with minds of their own. Player does not really matter in the world, just another soulless grunt doing what everyone else is doing.Go replay Skyrim or Oblivion instead, don't waste your money or time on this.Edit: Since there are many comments about this I'll revise review by adding description of what forms my opinion of ESO.Point is ESO is too much like any MMO: boring grinding, ""kill X amount of Y monsters"", ""go here, pickup item, return"" and so on. Not much variety in tasks, easily generated in a few scripts with the game engine. Battles are mostly hack&slash with very little tactical elements, even simpler than Skyrim and not even remotely close to what Dark Souls has achieved.That much is apparent from the very beginning of the game.It does not look like those gameplay elements would improve since they are the core mechanic which is given to you from the very start and explained in detail.So ESO does not have enough RPG elements to interest me and my opinion is formed based on what I've described here and thus in described in this review.Case closed.UPDATE: since this is no longer a subscription-based but purchase-once (like normal games) I've decided to look into this more. Unfortunately gameplay is same as before when subscription was in place: for example, you need mind-numbing amounts of grinding to collect crafting materials. These kinds of things would really need overhauling to keep things interesting, it is too shallow and repetitive as it is."
Negative,"Elder Scrolls Online is designed to tie players' hands with limited inventory and most places 'locked' in order to encourage players to subscribe to a ~$12-$15 monthly plan. Thing is, this game is boring, tedious, frustrating, and shallow without the monthly plan - completely unplayable. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wasn't also planning to subscribe to the monthly, as there's no substance and plenty of frustration without it."
Negative,"This game used to be great. Now its nothing but a cash grab meant to rob players. Gambling mechanics via crown crates with horrific drop chances, $150 in game houses that use psychology to trick players into buying them. Incredibly watered down content and a completely incompetent dev team. Play any other RPG or MMO. Not worth your time or money."
Negative,"I've played this game for two years and while I love many aspects of the game, recent and proposed changes have altered my view.  Unfortunately, for the majority of you who are thinking of buying the game, many of the achievements for the latest DLCs will be be out of reach due to dramatic changes to the combat system which will render the player characters to weak to reach damage requirements. The proposed changes (set to go live in August) also reduce character, gear and skill diversity (assuming the need to hit damage and healing thresholds) with actual combat gameplay that is less dynamic and, to be blunt, somewhat boring.  This is compounded by the scope of changes which will result in untold numbers of hours grinding for gear, skills, etc. to respec characters I have come to love to play into specs I have little interest in (I am looking at you melee stamina).I want to love the game as the world, music, and lore are all fantastic, but despite investing thousands of hours (and let's face it - dollars) I am finding it may be time to move on to something new."
Negative,"I didn't occur to me until 20 hours in that a significant portion of the content of this game is behind paid DLC and that it misinforms the hell out of players on what they actually get for certain purchases. The ESO subscription for example in the ingame help menu it states that 'all current and future dlc will be available for ESO subscribers' except Bethesda/Zenimax apparently redefined what is and is not DLC in the game, with whatever the newest crap is, is called a 'chapter' and thus 'not dlc'. I'm sick and tired of game corporations trying to nickle and dime us to all hell, if it weren't for that I could even say that the gameplay isn't bad and actually kinda fun, but the monetization and outright misleading help articles have soured any kind of enjoyment I would have gotten out of it.I fell for this bullshit with PSO2 already, I won't do it again with this game.edit: Wow, uhh, I guess for some feedback maybe don't make your message look like you copy/pasted from a template to begin with. This just looks like a disingenuous attempt at 'engagement' (or rather, that's what it really is)."
Negative,"I really like to play this game because it is a lot of fun and you can play together with your friends. I also like the quests and the diversity of the landscape and dungeon bosses.But I can't give this game a positive review because of some reasons: 1. It is extremly over commercialized.      (The crown shop pops up way too often, the DLC's are more expensive than the game, the Gold Edition only contains 4      DLC's, to get access to some helpful game mechanics like the crafting bag you have to be a eso plus membe, ...) 2. The support is not helpful, instead of actually reading your problems they give you what seems to be standard answers     and even try to make you buy more stuff in the crown shop."
Negative,Not paying $15 a month for a damn ingredients bag.
Negative,I wanted to play in Tamriel not Twitter.
Negative,"Hours in as a new player and I have nothing hooking me or drawing me in. The weapon and talent system seems interesting, but everything just dies in a couple whacks so there's no excitement about leveling up or unlocking new skills. The quests are basically just running around in circles and talking to people. There's no sense of danger or adventure, and no calling to some higher or more interesting story."
Negative,"Crown Currency for content and loot crates:Basically, pay more than you need to with real world money for content. Having left over Crown currency (make believe money) you don’t need, nor want.Remember Microsoft points? Its like that.It's like Casino chips...Fake money with no real value outside of the place of business. Allowing one to spend more while manipulating the person into feeling guilt free about their spendings.(To address some of the comments I'm receiving or going to receive):There are plenty of good things to be said about the game. But I wont say them due to the business model.There is no problem with having cosmetics or extra content and paying for it. Many MMO's do this like WoW or FFXIV and I have bought Expansions and Cosmetics from those 2 games with no issue.My issue with ESO is like this...Pay $5 for something that costs you $1. You have $4 remaining.New Item/DLC you want costs $6No $2 option available, Only $5, $10 $15 etc.You pay another $5, you now have $9You can now buy the $6 new item, so you do.You now have $3 remaining.And so on.DLC:While the expansions are reasonable. But, they are still kinda short for what they worth. So, get them on sale.The DLC's however, are way over priced $15 USD for 1500 crowns for 2 dungeons... Want a bit more content like the Dark Brotherhood or Thieves Guild? 2000 crowns each. Which doesn't exist. (You'll need to buy the 3000 option for 24.99USD or the 5500 Crown option for $39.99USD) to gain access and you'll have 1000+ left over crowns.Of course, you could opt into their ESO Plus Membership for $15USD a month for full DLC access.But, there isn't a lot DLC content and they aren't frequent enough. The big content only comes with the expansions. But you still have to buy them regardless of membership or not, and they're pretty short for an MMORPG too. Loot Boxes:Loot boxes on the other hand. Because you can get potions and poisons with buffs and debuffs that affect Stamina, Health and Magic all-in-one. Not to mention Mounts, Experience boosting scrolls and Skill Respecification scrolls.You can also just buy the Skyshards for skill points. And Werewolf/Vampire skill lines instead of doing the quests.It's not ""just cosmetic"".But even when it is just cosmetic items:  They still have value, people still want to buy them, own them, collect them. Putting it down to chance is like a slot machine.When it comes to Loot boxes in general: There are colour codes, numbers or indicators that make you think you're very close to getting something of value. So you pay more and still don't get what you want. What's worse still... They give you the occasional free loot box in an attempt to persuade/encourage/gain your favour into buying more loot boxes.""But it's not pay to win...""In my play through I was given 3 free loot boxes on my way to lvl50. They gave me 80 bottles of Poison to equip to my weapons, and 20 bottles of Health potion that healed Health, Stamina, Magic, and added protects, buffs and increased speed for a limited time.I also got a Psijic Senche Exemplar Mount (Magic lion) well before I could even afford my first mount. I can see how someone might be tempted to invest in more loot boxes with items like these and then be met with the Crown currency when purchasing.Gameplay:It's Casual.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It would be better to have only individual items. On the Market Place, available for purchase for its exact worth.$15 for $15. No loot boxes, No Crown Currency.Before someone comments ""It's just cosmetics, you don't have to buy them"" (again with different wording). Know that, that is not a convincing argument. Nor does it address the issue."
Negative,"The answer is NO - but don't get me wrong (few things):This is great game in terms of content, the world is huge, I mean really huge, the amount of things to do in this MMO is astonishing (Quests, Dungeons, group trials, PVP of all types, housing, crafting and much more)... The main problem with this game is the amount of bugs and absolutely irresponsible team, forget about any support (you simply wont get any), there're still bugs in the game that existed 2 years ago - ZOS doesn't care about any of that, all they care is how to make more money by maintaining new items in their crown store! The other big issue is that they continue nerfing / changing content like (items, skills, dungeons and etc...) which completely destroys class identity, so in the end there're no difference which character to play - they all the same... Games like that should have a strong separation of classes: from skills they use up to sets that provide bonus to specific passive skills of certain classes - looks like company lost their creativity. Designers also need to update - sets looks just soooo outdated, like it was done back in 1990 (please take a look at other games like: Lineage - 10 yrs ago they had much better looking textures than you have now - that's a shame).We tried to contact company via forum / in game bug reports - but none of it works, we keep seen same bug over-again and nothing is getting fixed... Well maybe this Steam review will get to their attention ?!?!"
Negative,"You are so limited without buying the membership on top of the game that it doesn't feel worth playing.  Either make it a $60 game with no subscription or free with subscription, but not both.  Why would anyone want to pay for a game so they can be milked later for microtransactions?"
Negative,"#elderscrollsofflineTons of problems with ping and servers. Can't even join a dungeon, everything is broken, all that you got is ""Unable to join dungeon at this time"". Ah yeah the rare situation when you don't get that mesage as a DPS you will have to wait more than 1 hour to join a dungeon, not even kidding. I don't understand why people say this game is amazing, is so good and all that s**t. No, it's not, it's just a broken game, with boring combat mechanics, you don't fell any progression in game whatsoever. I would recommend to spend your money on something else, this is just don't worth your money and time."
Negative,We are currently investigating issues some players are having regarding logging into the North American and European PC/Mac megaservers. We will update as new information becomes available.
Negative,"Didn't actually play the game. ZeniMax Private Policy agreement basically says they'll sell all your info and monetize you, and if you don't agree with that then too bad, you can't play the game. :/"
Negative,They are killing this game. The combat is super laggy almost to the point where it is unplayable. After a solid year and a half- I think I'm calling it quits on this game. Here's to hoping TES VI will be good.
Negative,"Eso Plus went from 0.3 to 5.5 dollars, that means 1833% change in price. This game is UNPLAYABLE without a CRAFTING BAG (only given by ESO PLUS)."
Negative,"** WARNING***DO NOT purchase this game unless you are 100% sure you will enjoy it,Steam have refused to refund me for this game due to the way it downloads, its around 85gb to download and while the launcher downloads part of that STEAM count it as game play so will not refund you if your download takes over 2 hours"
Negative,"I've played this game for years and have noticed that ZOS loses players & shoves more and more ads in your face. Maybe fine for free-to-play games but this is pathetic. You can pay hundreds and hundreds per year after buying expansion after expansion, DLC after DLC, and they still prioritize shoving crown store ads in your face while neglecting to add legit ways to earn cosmetics that add depth to the ROLEPLAY experience. As a massively multiplayer online ROLE PLAYING game, they neglect to allow any legit in game way to truly add to the roleplaying experience. It's getting very old and it, along with their CONSTANT combat and gameplay changes, is causing more and more people to leave. That adds up to 2 hour + dungeon que times, nobody running older trials as there is no incentive to do so for newer or older players. This game is beautiful, full of potention, and amazingly fun when things are going well. But the people running this show are siphoning as much money as possible and neglecting their players. Do not buy this game if you have any self respect.. This game has lost its soul."
Negative,"I played the game for few hours already and compared it to the experience of the other releases (Oblivion, Skyrim ) + The first impression was very good+ Graphics and physics very good, even that some body-movements looked stupid+ Gameplay good but the story not as good as the older releases that would pull you to continue-- Price very expensive compared to the other releases of elder scrolls, even if you compare it other MMORPG in the marketConclusion the game as a game it is very good as a MMORPG, but not as an Elder scrolls game it may have the look of  Elder scrolls but its missing the feel. I wouldn't recommend it"
Negative,"I have 371 hours playing outside steam, and dowloaded it again to see if the game had changed.ESO had potential, but after playing for some time it gets boring, the worst offender being the combat. Pros:- Big World- Crafting is kinda fun- Lots of fun or Interesting quests, fully voiced- Lots of stuff to do and explore around the world- Community mods to customize the interface- You can change the appearence of your armor to any skin (that you've unlocked) from any weight and dye them- Edit: The housing system, although kinda expensive (with in game gold or irl money), is fun and has some utility ingameCons:- Combat is boring, the skills don't feel unique or have any meaningful or situational uses, and you need to keep spamming and swaping between your weapons constantly, and using buff skills every few seconds otherwise you'll underperform- Animations are really bad, specially the animation cancelling bug that they refuse to fix, and now create content based on the DPS players can reach with it- Still has 300+ ping playing from South America (which makes it impossible to animation cancel for those who don't mind it)- Your character and monsters attacks range are too big and hit from, like, 7 meters away, you swing a dagger in the air and it will hit the monster far away, and vice versa- NPC AI is slow and dumb. If you go a bit far away from the spawn point from a monster, it will stop sudenly and run back to their original spot, totally ignoring you, fully self healing, and you attacks will not affect it until the monster is back to their original spawn point again- Level scalling makes everything too easy. Instead of just scalling down high level players when they go to early maps, the game scale UP everyone, making all maps have the same easy and boring fights, getting rid of any sense of progression- Cash shop is ridiculous expensive, specially the DLCs. And most of the cool skins are gated by the cash shop instead of using it as quests rewards, even from most of paid DLC quests- Even the jump of your characters is bad. And the game don't let you jump over a lot of stuff, making the exploration less fun just to prevent you from going up a random rooftop or rock- They could have played more with the maps verticality, to turn the exploration more rewarding when you reach some place that was hard to go. Currently most of the maps feel too flat"
Negative,"This is the first time that I write a review on Steam.I thought I have to do it for ESO, because I don't know if I expected too much from the game after spending so many hours playing Skyrim, but I am really unsatisfied with the game.I am 40 years old and this may be the first time I paid for an online game. I played some free games like Fortnite, CS:GO, LOTR Online or Neverwinter (for just feeling the taste of multiplayer games) and unfortunately ESO was not even close to a quality mmorpg game. I didn't feel anything about playing it online and it lacked immersion, all the things seemed like a mathematical formula to me. Hit points, or the quests were all shallow. I will not compare it with Skyrim (which I played hours and hours), or I will not compare it with another game like WoW or something similar to them. Because I know this game should have been something else. But this game has no character, no identity. I didn't know what to do, where to do or why to do anything. Go there, do that, run there, take that, go somewhere, kill it, if you can not, ask for help, as a low level player nobody helped me, this was weird, because elder scrolls fans are known to help others, but it was like ""you should run around and finish quests"" kind of game at last.I felt alone, and I mostly went ""fishing"" during my gaming sessions. Really, I enjoyed by the fishing, and nothing else. I couldn't craft, I couldn't cook, I couldn't fight, I could not find enough info or help about the game. I googled and yes, the answer was always there, but it wasn't close to a walkthrough, but it was like (again) mathematical formula to solve.(Maybe you know, in Mortal Kombat game, there are some actions like ""up+down+up+down+low kick+high kick"" makes a special move. I felt whole ESO is similar to that. When I started to write the review about this game, I thought I could write pages and pages of review. But I don't want to write now as I lost my will to play or write a review on it.Maybe I didn't find a cause to love it, so if anyone reads this review may help me finding a good source to make me ""feel connected to the game"", or else, as I stated at the beginning of my review, while I expected too much about this game, I found it less than mediocre.Now I am uninstalling it. Maybe 112 hours is not enough, but 112 hours of fishing seems adequate to me to comment on this game :)I hope I will find a good cause to play this game soon, so I can feel immersed and enjoy my time."
Negative,"Not pay to win, but pay to enjoy. Microtransactions don't really have a place in an MMO that also includes a monthly subscription. I haven't played this game in a long while and when I think about why it's 100% the microtransactions. Selling expansions is fine, selling a subscription is fine, doing both of those things in combination with microtransactions is not alright. I know that the monthly subscription gives you crowns to put towards microtransaction items, but that feeds back into the pay to enjoy theme of this game. I don't think I'll be returning to this game."
Negative,WHY IS PRIVACY AGREEMENT BAD? WHY DID THEY RUIN THIS? WHY SELL MY INFO?
Negative,"When you have so many ""old players"" commenting negatively about your absolutely dumb updates and DLCs, maybe, you should be listening to them.Bigger comment will come out later."
Negative,"After 8-years, still no Oceania / SE Asia servers..."
Negative,Unlimited craft bag should be included in the base game.
Negative,its an alright MMO with an elder scrolls skin please don't go into this game thinking it will be anything like the mainline TES games
Negative,"For an mmo the world is filled with well made quests, and rounded characters, however the combat is just so un-impactful and boring, which is a problem, because combat is the glue that holds your interests as you develop your character and explore the world, and it's just not interesting to fight things, i found myself actively avoiding combat, and explore the world in stealth or using the assassination skill."
Negative,This game is great. Combat is fun. Characters can be made in unique ways which gives the gamer some creativity. The holy trinity is present but is done so that any class can fill any role. BUT.... If you are going to buy this game don't do it through steam. Buy it directly from the ESO website so that you can actually play it. If you get it from steam There will be EXTENDED periods of time where you will get an error message and be unable to connect.. leaving it unplayable for no other reason than you bought the game off steam.I recommend this game but NOT that you purchase it here.
Negative,"Game play is alright. I like the Elder Scrolls games and lore. The game is annoyingly balanced. Zenimax will make you want to kill yourself. If something becomes too popular (Not just overpowered) it will get nerfed. So hope you dont pick the too popular equipment or style. Otherwise hours of grinding may go down the shitter. Crown crates are just a gambling temptation. Dont spend your money on them. The final straw that made me quit the game was that I had a membership and zenimax created a bug in the researching traits in the game that set my researching time back about a week. When I asked if they were going to make up for the lost time a lot of people suffered because of their mistake. They just said sorry, wait until next week. I decided not to give them any of my money after that."
Negative,I dont recomend this game.because eso have low content compare to other mmo rpgs low wow .after you beat veteran dongeons and trials there is not chalenging stuff in pve however still you can beat maelstorm arena which is good upposite of eso we had a lot of chalenging stuff in dongeons and raids in wow and pvp was fun in wow but it wasnt fun for me in esoI Write this review after 2030 hour time play In gereall eso is a good game but not enough content compare to world of warcraft. I played both of them for years.Hope developers of eso give us some content at least for pve dongeons
Negative,"I thought I would try this game out again in 2019 since I'd been hearing it was extremely improved since launch. Unfortunately I'm still very disappointed and I regret spending any money on it. I can't in good conscience recommend this game to any players like me who are essentially entering this game as ""new players"" even if we've tried it before. PROSCombat is okay, a bit repetitive but slightly more action-y than WoW.New zones seem to be extensive. Voice acting is nice quality and very extensive throughout the world.CONSDespite the label of ""Buy to Play"" you are constantly reminded of how getting a subscription and spending more money on the game will improve numerous basic quality of life areas (Inventory is EXTREMELY limited, material storage is only available to subs, you have to pay to unlock all the race/class combos, pay more to unlock entire guild dlcs, etc.). GAMBLING LOOT BOXES. If you are a ""gotta catch 'em all"" collector, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Especially joining this game in 2019, there are tons of collectibles (all the coolest mounts especially) that were available for real money for a short time in the past, and now the only way of acquiring them is through loot boxes. Collectors beware. Personally, I'm happy to spend money on a game when I know what I'm buying, but I absolutely refuse to buy gambling boxes in any game. Engine has not aged well. It looks *okay* if you have settings at max, but the fact that this game was released in 2014 combined with the chosen art style really starts to show as you play. The newer zones look *slightly* better. Quests are still pretty stock ""kill x monsters, collect x thingies"" most of the time. Some of the newer ones were a little better but nothing groundbreaking. PRO OR CON, YOU DECIDEIf you're going into this game solo, you will wonder why it's even an mmo. There isn't a lot of innate reason to interact with other people randomly. However there are a lot of benefits to joining guilds so if you can do that you might have a better time. However if you're looking for a strong solo experience, it isn't that. It's set in the Elder Scrolls world, but it doesn't feel like an Elder Scrolls game. If you wanted Skyrim online, you will be disappointed. My personal initial impression is that the community in game is not very welcoming. Maybe I've had a bad experience, but every time I asked questions I was not met with much good faith. Maybe a lot of people who are jaded with other games play this game, and kind of have a jaded attitude on life? I dunno. But I think it's something worth noting about my experience. My conclusion is that this game is not worth putting any money into if you are new to it in 2019. If you've been playing it all this time you don't need my review, anyway. But if you're looking for something to replace another MMO this is not a great choice."
Negative,"i wanted to refund because its not the experience I was looking for, but it turns out they made a separate application for the game after you already installed it on steam which took over an hour to complete which ironically counted as playing the game and was recorded on steam. So to my surprise when i hopped off after about an hour of actually playing it told me i had been playing for about 3 hours. Maybe i'm petty i don't know, but the principal of recording the time it took to install as play time seems like its just a money grab so your over the 2 hour limit and cant get a refund. I don't know just seems pathetic to me."
Negative,"com (7 horas de Game)👍🏻: Bathesda PLEASE TRANSLATE THE GAME FROM PORTUGUESE PT-BR and create servers sul american!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     com (690 horas de Game)👎🏻:após todos esses anos a Bethesda foi até adquerida pela Microsoft e não resolveram o problema de Servers sul americanos e Tradução para PT-BR (1 esta no top five das linguas mais faladas aq na Steam) maaaaaaaaaaaas eu até voltaria a jogar porém pra mim o que foi a gota dágua foi terem tirado o ESO do Geforce Now, simplesmente não faz sentido eles alegarem q não ganhariam nada la pelo jogo não precisar ser adquirido de novo, mas eles não levaram em conta q justamente isso seria motivo para muitos jogadores voltarem a jogar o game (ou comprarem) principalmente quem não tem um setup da NASA ou q simplesmente gosta de jogar no celular"
Negative,"Well Real play time is more than 2000hrs i played through ESO launcher a lot too. My first MMO experience was my worst MMO experience. I bought this game when Imperial edition came out about 7 months ago or so ""ah those golden days with few bugs and a bit of reasonable lag in pvp only"", then another dlc came ""Orsinium"" bought that one too few more bugs a bit of more lag but it was still playable then another dlc came ""Thieves Guild"" thats it huge lag spikes, Freezing, crashing even in PVE huge lag unplayable. And they are planning to sell another dlc which is coming in end of June ""DArk Brotherhood"" more bugs + more lag is expected. Then i realilzed i wasted my 7 months in making almost 8 veteran rank 16 Characters of all classes and almost all races (8 Characters is limit to have and veteran 16 is highest possible rank). MMO keeps on changing whether u like or not, its not your average game that gives a feeling that u own the game. If your mmo is going towards doom then u can't do anything. In worst case its server would be down forever [RIP]. Only memories would remain."
Negative,"- A PSA about the danger of drug use from a Khajiiti high priestess in the lands of Elsweyr, and how it was irresponsible of her to partake in her countries religious and economical iconography because drugs are never the answer.- A Khajiiti vampire, pushing for tolerance and peace for her tribe, in which she commands you to senselessly slaughter her entire tribe and it's leader, to force her ideals upon them, because she's too weak to do it herself. This is played completely straight.- A political, and allegorical quest in the beginning of Summerset that spends multiple set pieces and lines of over the top voice acting to decry the monstrous, inhuman behavior of keeping illegal immigrants in cages, followed by making jokes and dismissing the fact that afterwards, that those caged people are sacrificed to demons and have their souls irreparably destroyed.And SO much more!First and foremost, although I enjoy this game, it is by no means at any given time worth anywhere near the amount of money they want for it. This game is recommended, if gotten on a direct sale for the majority of the expansion bases. Last year they were selling it for around $15 on sale, and that's the price I would recommend.This games value to its parent company runs off of a low salary investment and predatory loot boxes with lower than average return rates to even the scummiest gacha mobile games. It's notoriety within communities in terms of its lore, and writing quality is so poor that it sparked outrage on release, and was only appeased after repeated PR backtracking to the point that they've settled on this  game being completely non-canonical to the events in any future or prior Bethesda games, giving them free range to paint with their brush in any way it suits them.This games main draw is the Elder Scrolls universe, and the backlog of lore and imagination from its crowd that it did not earn on its own with any of the content it created itself. The game prides itself in fully voice acted quests, and player choice, but as they continue to hire on writers via nepotism with college dropout credentials pushing narratives that fly in the face of the settings they use, the quality and player agency within the quests and world itself continue to decline.That being said, I continue to enjoy this game, often with friends, by completely ignoring as many elements created by the developers as possible, using it as my own sandbox larping session with characters made and disassociated with the quest choices they make and the dialogue they sit through. Don't take the game seriously, don't expect anything from the writing, and use it as you would runescape or other old sandbox mmo's you would with friends. Find your own fun, and you'll find it's worth the $10. I enjoy the Elder Scrolls series, and everything it's given me. I can enjoy this game set in the elder scrolls universe, despite the game itself. Take a look next time a free weekend is up, and make sure to avoid some of the particularly bad content, and you might find yourself surprised."
Negative,Impossible to play in SEA
Negative,Pretty Decent game... IF ONLY THE F*CKING SERVERS WOULDNT GO DOWN EVERY FUCKING 2 DAYS
Negative,"Re-writing this review as the last got blasted by fanboys. Here's the short bit, and will help determine if you should buy the game. If you like grind, gaming in groups/clans etc, warcraft style armour/weapon/mount customisation, and immersion isn't such an issue for you, this will float your boat. If you value immersion, and are bothered by things such as enemies spawning in front of your face, other players on large, sometimes weirdly coloured mounts, then it's not for you.For details, read on. This game has little to no immersion value compared to Skyrim. In Skyrim, you felt like the hero. You would vanquish enemies and they would stay dead (with the exception of some areas where they might regenerate after days/weeks whatever).ESO changes this, one of it's main plus points is actually a big downfall to players who value the immersion Skyrim could bring. Going into a dungeon with your friend at your side sounds great yeah? What you actually get is a horde of other heros, some in horrificaly garish colours running amok. Enemies spawn *CONSTANTLY* at the same places, every 10 or 30 seconds. Literally, in front of you. And it's the same for bosses. Yes, the bosses constantly respawn too. And while I didn't get far into the game, the scenery has nothing of the gravity that Skyrim does. Sadly, it's turned into one of those 'pay or grind' games. You're totally hamstrung in everything, storage space, getting craftable items (seriously, the list of different ones is a p1sstake). Took me about 12 hours to get materials for a single BASIC sword. They clearly made it so people who work full time will have to pay, pay pay.That wouldn't be so bad if the grind - you know, the gameplay - was fun, but all the immersion breaking stuff completely negates that.Yes, I know it's an MMO, and what it entails. But I love the atmosphere Skyrim had and really wanted that across different environments. Sadly, the design decisions they made, as well as the far heavier grind/pay for stuff ruined it too much. FWIW I would very happily pay the price for a different version, single player only with some tweaks. Such as the enemies respawn and less grind for materials. I really hope they think about this for this game/future ones or I can't see me buying any future ES games, which would be such a shame."
Negative,"The developers do not know their own game code.  Anything that requires them to introduce new code into their game breaks very basic parts of it.  This results in things like in-game events providing double XP, but the PUG generator not working, or the first month or a new expansion with very long load screens and being bug-riddled.  Worst part, this has been the modus operandi for years.  There is no reason to expect this to suddenly change."
Negative,6 hrs in and my character cannot even die in combat. i know mmos have streamlined combat but this is boring
Negative,"DO NOT buy this game via Steam. Just go to the official website and buy there. If you buy it through Steam you have the joy of not being able to log in every few weeks for unknown reasons. You also can't just easily sign into the official forums, or send a support ticket. You effectively don't HAVE an account with the main company so you're on the back burner. The game is a ton of fun, but I am so over the random issues that pop up solely because I purchased through Steam."
Negative,"With the release of Update 35. I have quite the game for good. The developers have been rude to the players in the forums have trashed changes around this patch PTS, and have lowered the engagement of content while destroying multiple classes identity. As I started feeling the game wasn't going in a good direction I started looking at other games, and started to realize how bad of value per dollar you get from ESO. A monthly subscription to just be able to pick up all items in the game and not be an inventory management game. A yearly expansion to just get the new raid. No new skills or combat mechanics in multiple updates. If you are interested in a buy one play forever game go play GW2. If you are curious how the community feels check out videos on youtube."
Negative,"I beta tested and played this game after release. I came back in 2022 and I'm currently playing game (limited play). Over the years the Devs have added a huge amount of crafting materials and things to craft. Thats good right? That depends on their motives. I believe they have done everything they could to force players to get the Plus membership. Things like bag space, withholding dungeon access, etc.I wanted to build a home. I got a real shock when I found out what it would cost to get an empty lot to build on. Ridiculous the greed of these people. I can build a home for free in Fallout 4, 76, and Skyrim for that matter. Speaking of 76. I paid $10 for that game. Haven't spend any more. And I'm enjoying it as much as this game.Don't go around telling players its free to play when it actually isn't.They made some poor choices in 2022 and I don't feel its worth $15 a month for Plus. Not for me anyway."
Negative,"i can describe the gaming experience for this 💩 with these words ""Money Please"""
Negative,Buy it from their website instead of steam.
Negative,Suitable for Skyrim audiences and five year olds.
Negative,"The game used to be great. But now just a buggy, cheat fill game. PvP filled with unkillable player, players TP through walls etc. They don't fix the bugs, just more rubbish in the crown store. Shame, as it was a good game."
Negative,"New terms of service states they're going to start selling playing information to third parties.. Like they don't get enough from people buying the game, subscriptions, expansions, crown store 'and' loot crates... Outright greedy and my final nail in the coffin for this game. I don't like this game enough to have my information sold to keep greedy pockets filled. I'm out"
Negative,"These contracts you must agree to before playing games get crazier by the day. This one allows them to remote access your computer lol Can't we just play a game without them >requiring> that you agree to >their> ""agreement""? Add another one to the list that I won't play for this reason. A little much for a 'game' imo."
Negative,"with the vast amount of time ive spent playing this game i feel that it has become empty,its essentially grinding until you get a good level for 15 dollars a month to then get your ass kicked in pvp because the build wasnt good enough,etc dont waste your money like i did       EDIT: as this game is now free to play i suggest trying the game but dont expect a skyrim,hopefully the PS4 console version will be good till then adventure on"
Negative,"Don't buy this game. It's a trap.Don't get me wrong, it is one of the best MMOs out there, but Zenimax (the company behind it) is trying really hard to push away its loyal players. They keep punishing us with wrongful decisions, the latest being the pause on crown store gifting  system, from which the end game player would use the most.Honestly, I feel like I have been losing time when playing this game, it is really frustrating that they don't care about us."
Negative,"Insanely frustrating and annoying game.You need to subscribe with a monthly fee if you want to do any crafting or be able to manage your inventory. To be fair, you don't NEED to; however, if you don't want to spend THOUSANDS of hours on inventory management, you should subscribe. I walked into a delve with over 80 inventory slots available. I opened every crate, barrel, sack, etc... and was completely full before I finished the area... I was destroying and dropping things just to pick up the better loot from the boss at the end of the delve. After going through this a few times, I just stopped opening anything and now only collect loot that drops (armor & weapons - everything else is trash or left alone).Too many story lines. Understandably, you want a game with depth and hours of play time. But the repetitive nature of the quests makes everything get stale quickly. It could just be a result of me playing too many of these games... But there is TONS of content and time-wasting activities to be had by all.Reading... be prepared to read. Tons of books, notes, and quests. And no, not just skim... READ, in detail, everything. There are even a good number of quests that are unable to be completed if you fail to read everything.Obviously, the stuff I have negative comments about are 100% my experience vs. my expectations. There are people that LOVE all the things I hate about this game. Just know that if you don't plan on spending hundreds of hours and dollars, it's just not worth the frustrations. I will probably keep playing, just because it's ""something to do"" and to kill time. Or, switch to any number of the free MMOs out there and get a similar experience. <shrug>"
Negative,"Online Paradise Lost: ESO's Self-Sabotage, Alienating Casuals EverywhereI used to like ESO. Sadly, I've seen it patched to appeal to the kind of people who play League of Legends and WoW (over competitive, toxic people, you know the sort) because that's where ZOS thinks they'll make their money. Good luck to them with that.Let me give you a rundown:CraftingCrafting used to make the best gear in the game, it was a level higher than anything that dropped. Since crafting isn't grindy enough though and the end-game PvE players complained no end, crafting has been nerfed into the ground and it's no longer a level higher, the stats are objectively worse, and there's just no point in it any more.This is after they swore up and down that crafted gear would always be better than what drops. The case now? You have to grind for your gear in dungeons, the best gear being in group dungeons of course. This spites their casual audience to appeal to a more WoW-minded crowd that they believe will bring in more money.ScalingThey changed dungeon scaling so that instead of it scaling to the level of the party leader, it scales up to CP160. The problem with this is that low level people won't have the skills and passives unlocked to do well, here. Group dungeon has been effectively locked away from casuals, it's meant for the PvE Master Race, now. By which I mean the people who love mindless, repetitive grind.Why do this? ZOS believes that they can make money from Skinner box models, similar to WoW. It's an unethical thing, but their management has been terrible of late. They don't realise that casuals tend to have altitits and they'll spend loads of time just roleplaying in a game. These casuals are also the ones who'll buy outfits from their cash shop. It's amusing that they think that an end-game PvE person or a PvP player will have any interest in housing or a chef costume... It's delusional.HousingThey're locking the upcoming housing system behind grinding. You have to have a massive amount of achievements unlocked and a huge amount of money ready to even have a house. So you either have to spend your life grinding away, or you have to buy it from the store for frankly ridiculous prices. This isn't going to work well for them.BalancingUp until Tamriel Unlimited, the balancing team had been pretty great. However, with Tamriel Unlimited, their creative director left and everything went downhill. Undocumented stealth nerfs to drops and skills, and balancing refocused away from keeping casual play viable to appealing to the toxic, competitive players (both PvP players and end-game PvE players alike). They've been alienating casuals no end.In fact, there was a recent thread about how the Radiant Destruction nerf will screw up the kind of fun concept builds that casuals use. The only people who've complained about the skill are toxic PvP players and elitist end-game PvE players. This escalated so quickly that their community team had to step in, reducing a thread from seven pages to three, leaving behind only smarmy L2P posts. Good going. Way to alienate your casual players.DuellingGoodbye roleplaying! Goodbye peaceful crafting/bank times! I know from third party forums that a lot of roleplayers left when they added duelling. That's right, ESO has duelling now. What do you think that toxic, crappy people are going to do with a tool like that? They're going to grief people. The same thing happened in Champions Online, and that lead to duel-free zones.ESO doesn't have duel free zones and the developers have told us in no uncertain terms that it never will. They don't care about roleplayers. They don't see them as a viable demographic. No money to be made off of roleplayers, right? Except... Who buys the fancy clothing from the crown store? Who do they think is going to buy the player housing? End-game PvE players or PvP players? Hahaha.Don't make me laugh.Forum FavouritismIf this evidence wasn't enough, as I mentioned above, there's been a lot of forum favouritism. The moderators have been deleting the posts of casuals who've complained about this, along with locking/deleting threads. I've been watching it happen and the whole thing is a train wreck. Essentially, the community team knows how the majority of their demographic feels about these changes, but they're just shutting them down because that's what management wants.ConclusionESO is going out of its way to alienate their casual players. They don't want us or our money. And to that I say: Fine. That's actually fine. If you don't want my money, I'm okay with that. The problem is? Champions Online and Battleborn made similar choices, appealing to the ""hardcore"" PvE crowd and toxic PvP players. What's happened to those games? They're dead. They have anywhere between 50 and 300 concurrent players on a good day.The management team at ZOS could look at these numbers to realise where those games went wrong with alienating their casual audience to see what they shouldn't be doing. Instead, they're just repeating the same old mistakes.So I'm afraid I have to say... ESO is a toxic wasteland filled with annoyances, frustration, disappointment, and crappy people. If you're a casual player and/or a roleplayer, just avoid it. You'll only end up feeling depressed. Just be thankful you won't have to feel as defeated and betrayed by the whole affair as I do. I liked ESO.ESO is quickly becoming as bad for casual players as any other MMO. When casuals aren't even allowed to have a voice on the forums, you know it's past the point of no return. I wonder if they'll delete my review, too?"
Negative,I loved the shit out of this game. I had another 1000 hours on console as well. They are destroying this game and the fact that so many people are leaving it proves that. What a shame.
Negative,I wrote a review earlier but did not mention that while the game is great do not buy through Steam. This is not Steam's fault but ZOS's problem.  ZOS appears to be treating Steam users as second class citizens with outages of many hours frequently (1-2x or more per week).  So far ZOS has only posted red banners on the forum saying we are investigating.  After many months of this non action people have gotten upset and ZOS now has a forum but it's just more of the we are working with Steam on it and no real action.  Instead of allowing us to run without Steam (at least until the issues are fixed) ZOS recommends buying a copy of the game from them so you can use the code - good for them but not us.  ZOS has also thrown us a Psjic crate but so far no word on what happens when we miss the dailies due to thier problems.  I do not recommend the game through Steam at this point unitl ZOS fixes things.
Negative,"It's a pretty solid game but the MTX (microtransaction) costs are absurd. If you want a house that is specifically crowns only (the ingame MTX currency) you're looking at 100 dollars. For a house, and an empty one at that. 2 hours of a dev's time simply placing recycled assets. You can clearly play without MTX, but so much aesthetically nice stuff (and even some functional stuff, such as xp boosters, race/name changes, potions and so on so forth) such as housing, mounts, skins etc are stuck being MTX. Hell, a single lootbox, which 99.9% of the time only gives absolute junk, is like 5 bucks. I'm not a big fan of MTX but I wouldn't care if they were only selling cosmetics... Except for the fact that you have to be IRL royalty to even consider being able to afford a peanut ingame. ZMO are some greedy assholes, that's for sure."
Negative,"SCREW ZENIMAX AND THEIR GREED! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! (small but important rant)Worst account support, worst login system, worst billing system, worst inventory space system. THIS GAME IS DESIGNED TO TAKE YOUR MONEY. Have fun paying $70.00 buying the full game and then realizing you are screwed because the subscription model has unlimited crafting inventory and that's really the only thing you need. Enjoy not being able to unlink your steam account if you want to change from the $70.00 pile of crap to the $15.00/month pile of crap. Oh and if you cancel you membership they might still charge you. Then have fun when you dispute it with your bank and they retaliate by BANNING YOU.My entire experience with greedy Zenimax and their STEAMING PILE OF CRAP has made me want to rip my hair out. You ruined a perfectly tried and true MMO system Zenimax and it is mind boggling to consider it was even posible... Do your self a favor and NEVER buy the game in it's entirety, in fact just dont play this junk."
Negative,"If you own just the base game, the only way you can get the Morrowind expansion is by spending $40 of in-game currency since there is no way to purchase the expansion via the Steam store. Yet newcomers can get the base game AND Morrowind for $10 on sale on the Steam store.Not a very nice way to treat early adopters."
Negative,"Thought I'd give this a go during the free trial offer in April 2023. 110GB or so download and install took about 5 hours. Registering an ESO account took about 30 mins. Not at all intuitive. And what is it with those pages and pages of T&Cs that you have to scroll to the bottom of? Ignored all the demands for cash on the web page (Give us money. Give us more money. Go on. You know you want to.) ESO didn't think I already had the game. Realized that I had to link my Steam account to my new ESO account - did so and eventually the ESO account recognized that I had a legit copy of the game installed on Steam. Why is this so hard? Started up the game. It was stuttering like hell. Messed about with the options. Then I switched on my Steam Link downstairs and tried to stream ESO to my TV so I could share the experience with my wife. The game appeared on the TV OK, but it wouldn't recognize the controller that was plugged into the Steam Link. Gave up trying to get it to work after going up and down the stairs a few times. Stopping and starting the game. Switching the Steam Link off and on. Life is too short. Rage quit and uninstalled. What a waste of time. OK, so I'm sure it would have worked fine if I'd wanted to play it alone upstairs with the controller plugged into the PC. But I didn't want to do that. Steam thinks I played this for 61 minutes. My character didn't take a single step in that 61 mins. It never left the prison cell. Those 61 mins were frustrating as hell. I won't be coming back to ESO."
Negative,"I don't believe this game would even be alive today if it weren't for the fact that ""Elder Scrolls"" is in the title. The combat doesn't feel good, it's very floaty and lacks impact. The majority of quests are boring, the game is absurdly easy to the point that you could set up a program to just play it for you and spam you through the 90% of the game with zero interaction from the player. It's basically a game that could have an auto-play function dropped right into it as far as difficulty goes. (High tier end game/PVP being the only exception, which doesn't erase the fact that a vast majority of the game is mind numbing easy)On top of this, the game is absurdly expensive and has zero respect for your time and money. The cash shop is filled with optional purchases that sells fixes for problems the developers created, or to just outright skip the grind. There's also gambling in the form of loot boxes with drop rates IRL Casinos wish they could get away with. There's a monthly sub on top of being required to purchase the latest expansion each release. Without the monthly sub the game will effectively attempt to annoy you and cheapen your experience just to entice you to purchase a sub.The grind to get anything particularly worthwhile will probably take you months, in the most extreme cases you'll be grinding for a year for a single mount.The only thing ESO has going for it is that it's set in the Elder Scrolls universe, and that's the only reason the game didn't die years ago as an over monetized, boring cash grab like the dumpster fire it is. If this game had been released by a studio that no one had every heard of and not Bethesda, no one would be praising it."
Negative,The game is clearly dying. Dont even bother buying it if you go for solo play. Dungeon finder is completely broken. MANY MANY dlc's to buy unless you are ready for a montly fee. When they release a new dlc they pump it with OP as hell items that last a few weeks until they release new dlc and nerf them to the gound so the new things can make people buy the next DLC. Developers who try to milk the last moments of this game with idiotic updates which no one has asked about. Not worth it anymore. Constantly seeing new people giving up the game after like 20-30 hours because most of the things dont work as intended. lets not mention the servers especially for PVP not registering 50% of your buttons nor attacks....
Negative,60$ for half a small ''extension'' and the other half sold as DLC  + base game price + sub + many DLC + commodity macrotransactions ... game is too expensive and not worth the investment.
Negative,"If not for the constantly triple dipping (pay for the game, then attempts for micro transactions and subscriptions) this might be a great game, but those walls and money-grubbing ruin any chance of this being a great game, and this comes from someone who really wanted to love this game as I am an avid elder scrolls fan. It's painfully obvious they locked away parts of this game just to try and tempt people to pay them money to unlock it."
Negative,"cant enjoy then game with that 999+ ping every times, always disconnect when you go on trials...and dont mention about pvp you know the rest. Is it so hard to make one new server for us SEA Players? would be great if this game have normal ping so we SEA players can enjoy the full immersion."
Negative,"Don't be fooled by my hours played. This game is incomplete. Bethesda is one of the greatest gaming companies out there and have come out with some serious hits. Furthermore, The Elder Scrolls is one of my favorite franchises of all time. That's why I had to give this game a fair chance. Since this is a negative review, I'll start with the positive. The lore is fantastic. Every quest you do is unique and fun, and it doesn't ever really start to feel grindy. The game's story is fully immersive, and lives up to the expectations that players would have of the title. I credit a large part of this to the five-star voice acting. Next, the action combat system is above average. It's fun enough that a mere four classes is more than enough to have lots of different specs and fulfill any role in the typical rpg trinity (tank, healer, dps). Rolling around like a ninja on your nightblade, or standing in the fray and blasting your enemies with fire as a Dragonknight, the game exceeds in entertaining the typical nerd's thirst for role play. And lastly, the pvp of the game is wonderful. Despite the quests being so good, pvp is where the real fun began. Building siege weapons and tearing down castles with hundreds of other players truly gave me the full sensation of a raid. Now here's where the game fails miserably: it is full, and I really do mean full, of bugs. Whoever they hired to do the programming must have gone to DeVry or something, because every little step you take in the game has a bug. Whether the game lags terribly, crashes suddenly, or leaves you in the dreaded perpetual loading screen, it happens all too frequently. Now, even the very best games have programming errors. But when it's this noticeable, you have to ask yourself whether the people who made the game even cared, or whether they just half-assed it in order to rake in our cash. Either way, it makes the game incredibly frustrating, and nearly unplayable. For a $50 game that is supposed to be the end of an era of arguably the best videogame series EVER, this is just unacceptable. And for that reason, I cannot in all good conscious recommend it.A very regrettable thumbs down. :("
Negative,"For those living in Asia, i highly would not recommend you to buy this game. There are no servers here, and the ping spikes up to 600ms. The lowest I could get is a 200 ping, which I need to play at 12am. The game is totally unplayable. Save yourself and find some other MMORPG to play."
Negative,"+ B2P, optional subscription including all DLCs (not Addons)+ Fully voiced characters+ Interesting character build system (level up skills)+ optional First-Person-View+ Huge world and long story- World feels empty and visuals make it really seem dull- Combat really is bland, hits don't connect properly and it feels like beating on plastic- Clunky animations makes overall feeling of interaction with world cheap- stupid DLC decisions, typical Elder Scrolls integrated content like Dark Brotherhood locked behind paywalls- Base game lacks the quality content (lack of endgame content, only big scale battlegrounds, no arena) you paid forOverall decent game for small bucks I personally can't get into. Biggest point the combat being so dull and animations just keep ruining the flow of it. Being B2P, but most of the great content blocked by paywalls leaves a bitter taste that doesn't encourage hooking a new player base."
Negative,"The Elder Scrolls Online Community is extremely nice and generous, one even gave me a entire horse, which costs like... alot . The Grinding fest really isn't up my alley, the side quests can be interesting but yet at the same time boring but the exploring the world really is amazing. Though don't expect things for example on Skyrim to be the exact world size as TESO. There is always a really nice variety of enemies which is refreshing but some enemies can be tedious to handle and give little reward. There are some choices from what I seen, nothing too crazy though.Though do not, I repeat  do NOT  buy this game at full price as I feel like this game isn't worth the $60, though I got it for $10. But even then you'd be kidding yourself, never buy this game if you have internet problems. Your rollcoaster constantly stop at the best parts and your entire ""boner"" will go off as soon as you see that disconnected error.Though my biggest con for this game is the DLC, it looks amazing and sounds amazing but the fact that you have to play so much just to grind so much later really is a giant slap in the face to someone who doesnt want to spend extra extra"
Negative,"The Elder Scrolls Online, a realm so grand,But beneath its surface, a scheme so bland.Promising a buy-to-own, with DLC on the side,Yet to truly enjoy, subscriptions you must abide.Cutting bank space in half, crippling your stride,Crafting materials scattered, nowhere to hide.One month in, inventory overflow,A nuisance, a bother, a relentless blow.A generic MMO, with Elder Scrolls' name,No handcrafted quests, no stories to acclaim.Just filler from the start, a mundane sight,No grandeur, no magic, no captivating plight.Combat clunky and dull, enemies respawn near,A keep-busy simulator, devoid of cheer.Challenges lacking, voices uninspired,TES DNA absent, player enthusiasm mired.Inconvenient, a cash pump, draining your purse,A game devoid of reward, an experience terse.Trolls thriving in toxicity, events with <1% drop rate,A community divided, frustrations great.Virtual worlds beckon, but this one's a scam,Stealing your money, slowing your program.No serious mechanisms for social play,A multiplayer facade, fading away.So heed this warning, before you fall prey,To Elder Scrolls Online's greedy display.For true adventure lies elsewhere, my friend,In worlds less greedy, where joy has no end."
Negative,The worst installer client ever created in humankind's history. Even shi*ttier Korean MMOs handle it way better. You're required 81 GB for Steam installation and LATER F*UCKING ON additional 87!!!!! GB for extracting the files. F*uck this piece of sh*it of a game
Negative,"DLCs are far too expensive. The price of some DLCs is equivalent to the price of one entire game + its DLCs. Most mounts can only be obtained through the Crown Store? Count me out please, I'm not keen on using real money for in-game cosmetics. Combat feels slow and unresponsive, Skyrim's combat felt more fluid. I have spent YEARS playing Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim. But after playing this game, I feel like I should stick to those 3 games after all. The cash grab in this game is ridiculously appalling."
Negative,"EU server is garbage. Cyrodiil is unplayable during primetime. Nothing being done about server stability for YEARS.Update: Still the case, and it has only gotten worse."
Negative,-repreturn the crown gifts!
Negative,"For anyone that purchased the base game pre-Summerset, don't be fooled into thinking that you have the Morrowind chapter or the Warden class included with the base game you own; no that's just for new players purchasing the game  post Summerset!  The rent-seeking Zenimax/Bethesda would like to milk their existing existing players to the extent they require us to purchase the Morrowind chapter as well as the warden class as two separate items again on top of the base game already owned!  You can get those two items for an amount equivalent to almost twice the base game purchase price (in your local currency) of a newcomer to the title!   Unbelievable! Not only that, they basically hid anything that gives QoL to players behind the Crown Store when they removed the original subscription and made the game ""free to play"".  Instead you can purchase ESO plus each month...or buy all the content they like to break up into tiny little packages and charge hefty prices for them in the Crown store cos they know someone will buy it, well not me!  This game is in no way special, aside from all the issues with installing and getting the game to actually play...it is clunky even after adding a myriad of mods to make it remotely playable, including a mini-map (ikr...) controls, everything is just awkward and inconvenient. Even on an SSD loading screens are long enough you can go make lunch or put a load of washing on each time you want to go to another area so there's a plus I guess? I've actually played more than the time recorded here but since I had to open the game by going into properties, finding the launcher files and running the .exe as admin it stopped recording my playtime on Steam.Don't get me wrong, I'm more than happy to pay developers for the content they produce, in-fact I'm an advocate of it when it's is deserved, but the way Zenimax go about it with TESO is beyond greedy.  You could really learn a thing or two from many other successful titles out there, you might find enticing people with honey is better than trying to make them drink.  Zenimax and Bethesda I won't be buying anything of yours again."
Negative,"Been playing since launch day on PS4, moved over to PC in 2018. As a big TES fan I wish I could recommend it, but it falls short due to several issues.Ever since the ""One Tamriel"" update, Zenimax has failed to address key flaws with gameplay loop and story consistency.Overworld content is excruciatingly boring due to level-scaling, ditching any sense of progression or challenge. Because of this, quests have to rely almost solely on narrative in order to keep the player entertained.Despite this focus on story, a lot of the storylines fall flat due to inconsistencies and occupational hazards of the MMO genre, whether that be their formulaic and predictable nature, well-known allies failing to recognize you, or the (very easily) dispelled illusion of choice. This unfortunate combination of messy storylines with boring overworld content ends up pushing players away from questing and immersion (which I still believe is where the game is at its best) and into group content as soon as possible. However, there isn't a lot going on there either. The dungeons themselves have neat contained storylines (which everyone skips) but the experience isn't the greatest, mostly because of janky combat and lag. Pair that with the fact that you only really get vendor trash and no unique, thought-out rewards, and normal group content can quickly become disheartening.All in all, I feel like ESO still just misses the mark. The story is decent (especially Orsinium, Summerset and Clock City) but lacks agency, impact and emotion, falling short of something like SWToR in my opinion. As far as typical MMORPG elements, the rewards and collectibles are bland and lackluster, e.g. mounts, as only a handful out of almost a hundred are obtainable through in-game currency and achievements, everything else is in the crown store. Combat is very janky and classes lack identity nowadays, which can get in the way of immersion."
Negative,"There are elements of this game that are great, but unfortunately the developers keep ramming home the fact, time and again, that they don't play their own game, don't understand the desires of the playerbase, cannot properly stabilise their servers, and have frankly exhausted whatever goodwill I had left.It's abundantly clear that the majority of the Zenimax team have been shifted to other projects, naught but a skeleton crew remains, and that ESO is in ""managed decline"" mode; i.e. they're dragging as much profit out of loyal players and new suckers as possible, while spending as little time & resources on new content & fixing endemic issues as they can get away with.We are not treated as discerning customers by this developer, merely cash cows who will ""take whatever crud we deign to give them, and keep stumping up the cash"". Thus my time & money - and that of anyone reading this review when considering ESO - is better spent elsewhere on games with developers who know what they're doing and actually listen to the desires & concerns of their community."
Negative,"Game feels dated even tho its pretty new. It plays ""Like"" a action combat game like tera. But is often really clunky and unresponsive. The class system lets you wear any items any class anyway you want. But realistically, If you want to be a dps caster... use a staff. and use cloth armor.. it just works better.. So it ""Feels"" like you can do whatever you want. But realistically to be any good you should play the cookie cutter way.Population-This game is dieing, and with the release of the new Wow expansion. It might as well have a fork in it. Game is fairly empty. Battleground is HUUGGEEE which would be awesome if thousands of people where playing. But theres only maybe 200 people n the BG area at a time. So its to spread out and never ending. This game could be amazing with ALOT of more work to it. But in its current state its a failure. And the majority of players know it. With the ever decreasing amount of players I cant see this one lasting. Fans of Elder Scrolls avoid this gameFans of MMORPG looking for something new. Avoid this game"
Negative,"After trying ESO on free play event i decided not to buy it. ESO is basically Elder Scrolls theme park rather then actual game, there is no feeling of exploration, no interesting quests, no immersion thanks to people sprinting around, mmo version of Elder Scrolls is merely set of decorations with signs ""Do not touch"" on the every corner. In fact i was so bored i downloaded Oblivion and had much more fun playing that 16 years old game."
Negative,"Two billion in revenue over 10 years and Zenimax is still unable and unwilling fix Cyrodiil (pvp) server stability despite lying through their teeth about attempting to fix it for 8 years and counting. If someone is given 2 billion dollars and 8 years to fix a hardware and software problem without accomplishing tangible results, you stop giving them money or you are an idiot."
Negative,"I haven't been very far through the game as for what I could see after 59 long hours was : - too much boring quests- I don't really like the fact that everybody is the main character and, even though I really like the dragon break theory, it's a hard to swallow pill- constant inconcistencies- first quest log entry for the main quest spoiling the conclusion of that said quest and that is a major bad point I think as it shows some huge negligeance- horrifying low difficulty when questing- repetitive combat system that really drives you to alienation- towns filled up with other players ""pets""- esthetically over the top mounts- immersion breaking silly cosmetic rewards worn by so many other playersI found it really hard to play, and as I said, not because of difficulty, but because it is painful, to the eyes as well as to the mind. I know that it's supposed to become more interessant when you reach a high enough level to do high difficulty group dungeons or pvp, but seriously, if you have to go through all of that, as far as I'm concerned, it's not worth the effort. The other issues in the game are shared with many other games because it's a structural issue in the game industry : - you have to pay for everything. You have bought Elseyr chapter but you want to visit both areas of Elseyr ? Well, you have to buy the DLC for that other half of said region- excessive fan service conflicting with clumsy attempts to expand the audienceFinally, let's speak about the good aspects of the game because there are some : - high enough level of character personalization- nice setting (main quest plot, era, general context)- very nice natural sceneries- well designed towns- some fun NPC's- some quests are not boring and let you discover some aspects of the lore- I don't like crafting but those who do may find it quite diversed and rewarding- nice ideas underlying the class combat system (but is it well executed ? I think not)- fun bestiaryIn conclusion, I would qualify the game as being a gauche chimera forcefully bending and twisting the Elder Scrolls universe to fit in a not so well designed mmorpg."
Negative,"It's time of Interregnum. The time, when dragonfires went out and deadric cults raised across all Tamriels provinces.The time of new heroes & yolos, who's going to spoil your time & ruin all progress.Developers bravely f**king up PvE balance, by improving PvP disbalance. And who cares about balance feedbacks, when you can add lootboxes every season?!?The time of ping-dependent action-rpg system, when server decide where you were second before.The time of amulet of kings dissaperance & lame group finder mechanic.There are many dangers on your way, traveller: Khajiits, daedras, russian speaking retards over zone-chat, scamming traders, stupid default UI, lagging addons to fix stupid UI, addons to fix addons & ofcourse memory clearing addon for all your addons.But there are more: Unbalanced system where every class & every race can be equaly effective in any activity, but most likely some of theme fairly more effective...so don't worry about your bad decision... just make another char & grind once more!Stupid loot system, when every item can drop with 8 random traits & only 3 of those probably worth something for someone maybe... best of luck! Newly added transmutation system can fix it slightly, but once again you need to grind.Amazing loot managment system, when you can clean you bags from loot & trash as long, as you running some dungeons. Maybe a bit shorter... who cares, you can get 10EU subscription for unlimited crafting bag, so you will have to clean your bag 10 times less often + some addons for period of active sub (yeah, not everything is cripled yet).Somehow possible RP elements, where you can speak in /local & make some /gestures, but nobody gives a crap.Random arrogant kids, who's only care about DPS, so they drag their DPS out of pants & checking it with yours & praise Dibella your DPS is somehow visible, cos they will vote-kick you! You must grow your DPS dude, i mean it! Grab your weapons & go start exercising with your DPS so you'll be able to put your mega-large DPS out of pants and show them whats DPS about!Addons: You need addons, bcos the reason of bethesdas existence are addons!You can make addons, you can add addons & ofcourse you can use addons, but sometimes your addons may loose actuality... b'cos Bethesda like to update things recently & don't give a hack about making complete games. So ADDON ZOS perfect game up to even more perfect & atleast playable.But of course there are good sides:Cute & sexy chars of dunmers 1st time ever, if you pretend its 2002 & you are playing morrowind... crap look at skyrim char mods & forget what i just said.Some funny mechanics. such as vampire, werewolf, khajiit hobo-thief... oh wait.Thousands of quest with epic rewards as generic low price item and some story quest with Skill points, so you will have to farm those someday, maybe... whatever.Amazing allience war skills (massPvP), for PvE activity... MOSTLY FOR PVE ACTIVITY! So grap you pants, dps & go to war, if you wanna be gud in pve, so that guy with DPS wont blame you next time.Crazillion of achievments nobody cares about, untill day they start care about it... just to gain that perfect red colour they ever wanted for their hat or socks...Best crafting system, i mean it. Never seen better, but downside is: You have to reaserch crap items to craft those items & to gain access to best craftable sets. So it takes time & money, but you will be able to make money one day with your crafting talent, like in half of year or a bit shorter.And ofcourse style motifs for craftable gear, next patch you'll be able to change apearance with those styles, so its gud. But you need thousands of hours to farm those or coins, billions of coins. Literaly.So this game is good, but its not TES.ITS ESO.It's MMO with:MMO grindMMO playerbaseMMO issues (such as ping, maintnance & bugs after update)MMO developers who don't give a hack what they are doing with their project."
Negative,"this game makes morrowind's combat feel cutting edge, mobile games have more satisfying combat."
Negative,Game Makes me want to rip my balls off
Negative,"Pay 2 WinThis game is not enjoyable and practically unplayable without paying for the Plus subscription.  So it is a subscription game pretending to not be a subscription game.  Let me start by saying, I love the Elder Scrolls franchise and I will always be a fan and supporter, so it pains me to submit this review that suggests that ESO has Pay to Win (P2W) elements.At first, I argued that ESO was ""not"" P2W.  I pointed out that it was only Pay for Privilege (P4P) which eventually evolved into Pay to Play (P2P), however, any game that charges for the base license cannot also be P2Play.  The patrons did that by purchasing the license, so the concepts of base licence and P2P are mutually contradictory, at least in this day and age of MMOs.  For ESO to NOT be P2W, everything offered by their PAY advantage cannot fall into P2W norms and they would have to offer the base licence freely.Core Paywalls = P2WI have been party to many debates of “what” constitutes a viable content profit-wall and a P2W core content pay-wall. Even the most novice Elder Scroll fans are aware that the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves guilds have been part of nearly every Elder Scrolls titles. Features like these are part of the ""core"" of what makes up an Elder Scrolls experience. Locking them behind a pay wall is effectively the same locking all magic skills behind a play wall.  You could be a mage in every other Elder Scroll title, but you cannot join the thieves guild unless you pay extra in ESO?  Effectively you are not getting what you paid for when you purchased the game.Paid Performance Items = P2WThere is merit behind calling the crafting bag a performance item.  ESO is loaded with crafting materials and the Devs intentionally made storage a problematic issue just to push ESO Plus.  As such, the play style between a base license player and a Plus player is radically different.  Plus players can “Auto” loot everything and usually maintain space in their undeveloped back pack.  Meanwhile, base license players spends massive amounts of time performing inventory management, regardless of how many times they expand their bag.  Amazingly enough, our personal time trials had us organizing bag space more than actually playing the game.  P2W Performance advantages are not limited to just DPS exploits.  P2W advantages also applies to challenge, time, and effort invested in the game.  What is being debated is what constitutes a ""Reasonable"" level of challenge, time, and effort before a paid advantage, becomes a P2W unreasonable difference.Determining P2WMy friends and I wanted to end this debate, so we figured the best way was to get as many people involved as possible, from several age groups, and incomes. As it turns out, it is not that difficult to get a bunch of gamers to play video games.  We started evaluating games that offered a ""Paid Advantage."" We focused on comparing the ones that we would ""not"" play without the Advantage and Why. We found that a paid advantage became unreasonable when the amount of time, effort, or challenge to progress was reduced 4x that of a base license player. This proved consistent regardless of the mechanics of the MMO, and as it turns out, a bulk of gaming communities considers 3x fair line in the sand.  Exceeding this ""reasonable effort"" effectively turns a base license into PAY 2 DEMO which is not what the players paid for.When we did time trials between ESO Base License players and Plus players the findings were shocking. Basically we noted what the Plus account earned, killed, looted, made, etc... in a given amount of time.  Then we had the same players log into a base licence account and play until they filled all the check boxes. When we compared the time trials our most conservative estimates suggest that a base license player has to provide 13x the effort of a Plus player.So, Do the P2W Elements Reflect the Best Possible Profit Margins?The largest problem for a MMO is that the quality of the game depend on who sticks around to play.  For obvious reason, intellagent developers strive to keep the largest player base possible because it results in the most income. Logistically when a game becomes undesirable to play without the ""paid advantage"" than the only players stick around are those who pay for that advantage.  This alienates anyone who would buy form the cash shop, but refuses to maintain a Plus membership. If a majority of the remaining player base is paying for the privilege of playing, then it is no longer an ""advantage,"" which further alienates the most profitable portion of the player base. Eventually what you are left with are extremist fans and Trolls who pay just to dump on other players.  Over the years I watch dedicated fans leave ESO just because they could not keep their friends interested in being Troll fodder, and who could blame them?  The game is not enjoyable without Plus. Also who does that leave the Trolls to dump on?In fairness, there are worse P2W MMOs, but there are also many better ones.  The dumbest part of all of this is that, the Devs focused player base don't represent the largest ""investing"" dynamic for any quality MMO.  It represents the most toxic player base.Personal ExperiencePersonally, I felt punished for playing on a base license account.  I could not believe how much of a difference that Crafting Bag made in the quality of gameplay.  Playing on the Base account turned ESO into a full-time job rather than a source of entertainment.  Every small mission I found myself stuck doing painstaking inventory management, just to meet the numbers of the Plus Account.  I ended up with ""Alt storage characters"" just to hold my Alchemy, Cook, Enchanter, Geology, Map Holder, and Random Storage needs.  Loading in and out of the game constantly to access these mules characters is absolutely as tedious as you might imagine, and I would venture to bet the activity of doing so is part of the reason we see server performance issues.  The Devs have established an unintentional DOS attack into every Base Licence Player's game experience.SummeryI believe firmly that ESO can offer a P4P advantage that is not equivalent to a P2W taboo.  By itself Plus is worth the value just for the Crown allowance and non-core D.L.C. access, so the Devs do not need to price gouge their players just to make their annual bonus checks.  The base licence player should never find themselves behind paywalls to access Races, Skills, Class, Gear, Crafting bag, NPC Guilds, or Alliances common to previous titles.Between the burden of inventory management crated by not having access to the Crafting Bag and paywalls that block Core Elder Scrolls content, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that very few players would play ESO without a Plus P2W membership.   At least not for long.  I personally do not care for any P2W mechanic, and I prefer games my friends can enjoy with me, so I now support the opinions of players who express these issues.  I will continue to affirm that Plus & Core Content Pay Walls are ""Pay 2 Win, because they are.""   This realization has seriously tarnished my perspective of Elder Scrolls, and ESO will remain the black sheep of the Elder Scrolls franchise until they fix it.  Should they fix it, then I would be happy to pay for Plus on all of my accounts, but the following would have to be true.  Tamriel for AllThe base licence player should never find themselves behind paywalls to access Races, Skills, Class, Performance Gear, NPC Guilds / Alliance and yes the Crafting Bag.  If the Devs want to add something we have not seen yet then by all means a profit pay-wall is warranted, but not for the stuff already released by other Elder Scroll titles.  Until they make this change, the game is more then un-enjoyable, it is unplayable."
Negative,"Got into elder scrolls after playing esc IV Oblivion. I generally don't favour MMO gameplay, but I played this game for the world building to explore Tamriel and beyond. Unfortunately, the game does not deliver. The world feels empty, with large swaths for terrain you just spend time walking across, using the auto walk button whilst you do something else until your character reaches the next fetch quest going back and forth endlessly. New characters they’ve made for this game is forgettable, only carried by the writing from previous games they have added as fan service. Not to mention the scenery which at max settings looks terrible up close, but I can look past graphics if the writing is good. Everything is monetised, you thought you bought the game? No, you have to pay real world money (and lots of it) to just join a guild like the Dark Brotherhood or the Thieves Guild. Instead of being able to learn all skills like in normal esc, you are forced to choose a class at the beginning of the game where many are paywalled again like if you want to be a necromancer summoner. What I liked about normal Elder Scrolls games was that I could mix and match skillsets, being a bow fighter who also uses a specific magic, but here you are locked into a class system where you can only use those. After you’ve bought your DLC, then the mechanics make the game quite irritating to play with continuous nuisance unless you pay the subscription fee every month. Then you play a bit, get some monies, saving up to buy a house, walking up to all the different houses they present you to buy, only to read “not for sale”, as you need to be at the right time of the year to then be able to buy them with real world money, as if the bank of your character does not matter at all. There might be a house you can buy with in-game currency, but all the first 5 houses I’ve encountered so far was like how I just explained. I only play this game to take a stroll around the areas of Tamriel that have not been made into a normal elder scrolls game yet, as the continent is quite vast. But you can ride around the areas quite quickly with a horse, so the world here feels shrunken compared to the vastness I imagine. The NPCs you meet does not have dialogue, unless they have a quest, which then they give you a few lines. It’s not a world to immerse you self within to live with the characters. Game also lacks complexity. They had to make a game using few buttons to work on console, which means you can only use 5 spells in combat, where half of them might be a summon spell you only use once, but can't switch as you need the summon spell to be equiped, if not the monster companion will despawn if you want to use another spell. This means that as a caster where only spam 1-2 spells whilst your 3 other spell slots sits idle. I would hope a wizard could use a vast array of spells in combat, thinking tacticaly, not spam 1-2 spells like you are a gunslinger. It also feels a bit unsatisfying to get good lot, as it is locked to your level. Thus if you finish a quest early, your ancient sword found in a tomb is only level ""15"", thus when you level up quite quickly, then it will lack damage. Meaning you wasted it. As if the lich you just killed saved up a wood toy sword just for you, but saved the real gear for someone higher level that showed up later, instead of taking what he had. I'm quite critical as I expected better from Elder Scrolls. My high playtime is just the launcher sitting idle as it want's to be on for some reason."
Negative,"I-N-V-E-N-T-O-R-Y I really like the game, played hundreds of hours on PS4 too, but you cannot play this seriously without spending real money on the monthly fee, basic inventory is totally unusable.I totally understand selling DLC , expansions etc. but such a basic feature like fking inventory, i truly cannot understand it."
Negative,"Fun at first, but gets rather boring fast. I do agree with other post about paying for classes when you've already bought the game, just plain silly. Also, very few classes to choose from and rather limited RPG core because of that. Overall a miss. Play Skyrim till the next installment comes out, you will thank me later."
Negative,"I used to truly love this game, and I wouldn't have all the online friends I have now without ESO. However, just recently ESO update 35 came around, and it just does not feel fun, and even worse, it has made some content and achievements effectively impossible. And to top it off, it's not just the enormous nerfs that have made me lose faith in the team, and the game as a whole, but it's the behavior of the team when the concerns of the experienced playerbase were brought forth, they effectively told us that they don't care at all about their players."
Negative,"Bought the game and within 1 week I tried playing through seven zone/expansion/main quest lines. Four of them had a quest NPC glitch out and prevent you from talking to them to progress the quest. So I've wasted a lot of my time on stories that will never be completed.Additionally, while a subscription is ""not required"", it is totally required. They have an infinite storage bag for crafting materials pay walled behind the ESO subscription. Without it all the materials will stay in your character's very limited storage bag which is going to be completely full of weapons and armor that you have to keep around so you can ""research"" the enchantments on it in order to re-create the enchantment on other gear. Researching is a time gate system. You select gear with an enchantment that you're interested in then you wait a few hours for it to research in the background while you play the game. Once the research completes it destroys the item, but unlocks the ability to recreate the enchantment on other weapons of the same type. So if you learn a flame damage enchantment on a dagger, you can apply it to other daggers, but not on swords or great swords. In order to do it on a sword or great sword, you'd need to find one with that enchantment already on it then research it. Which means even more waiting on stuff to ""research"" in the background. Who is even doing the research? Me? It can't be, I'm busy raiding the 100th cave with the occasional useless support NPC. So researching is just there to slow you down, but don't worry that's a limitation only for the poors. If you want to dump several hundreds of dollars into the game, you can buy crowns which can get you not only cosmetics, but also more storage, 1-time instant research scrolls, books to increase your mount's stats(also a time gate mechanic), potions, instant vampire/werewolf transformations(usually a very random & time consuming process to achieve), and much much more. Nothing on the store is cheap.All-in-all a very buggy, very greedy game. I would not recommend."
Negative,I have 58 hours in this game an I honestly don't remember a single second except when my friend Jacob showed me the werewolf stuff. That was pretty fun but everything else was really boring I guess.
Negative,"You buy a game thinking if you bought it you will have a full experience. Than you realize everything is just real life money oriented. They should make their mind if they are selling a game, or giving a free2play game with microtransactions. You can't do both in a single product!"
Negative,"Level scaling and easy mode combat killed this for me. The world looks beautiful, the UI, animations, sounds, and gameplay is polished, but the combat is so unfathomably easy it's impossible to find a challenge because everything scales. At no point in 9 hours of gameplay did I feel danger. 2 ability clicks kills everything. I could pull an entire dungeon of mobs and walk around ignoring them.I do not mean in any way to disparage the artists, sound designers, and writers who made this beautiful game world. But if you've ever played an RPG before it's simply not fun since there is no progression and levels, gear, and abilities are meaningless. Yes I am aware there is end-game content. I don't care. What I hoped to get for my money was to explore a fantasy world and feel a sense of danger."
Negative,"Pure rip-off. Now first let me say this: it is a fun game. BUT it is being completely ruined by greedy publishers yet again. You pay for the base game, then you have an optional subscription (which the crafting bag is locked behind, making it feel not so optional if you really wanna enjoy the game) and THEN on top of that, you have an in-game store that is so overpriced, it's not even funny. Basic MMO features like a barber (!) are locked behind the store, making you pay 10 bucks to change your character's hairstyle. I don't think even most F2P games lock that behind a store. Having played WOW, this feels so utterly greedy and pathetic. I have no problem paying a monthly fee for a good MMO, but then I expect to get all the content, not have basic features locked behind another paywall. And certainly not fucking lootboxes! Yes, the game also has lootboxes, on top of a base price and subscription fee. Absolute fucking joke, I regret spending any money on this game at all! And it's a real shame, because the game itself is actually pretty good, but again, it feels like it's only designed around taking your money over and over.Also, the shop prices are ludicrous. Over 10 bucks (iirc) for an outfit slot, that only works for a single character, not even account-wide!"
Negative,"I have played this game since its beta release on pc. I will say this about the game. It is hands down the best Online MMO at this time. For many reasons it is the best, better the WOW, FF , BD and NW. Pros:- Adventure anywhere anytime. Quest as you see fit ( not main quest drivin) - Combat system is one of the best in MMO's - Crafting system- House's and furniture crafting- Pvp War (that is actually like a war) Castles, siege weapons, very realistic- Graphics are very realistic and not cartoonish- Unique armor sets and set bonus animations- Best character customisation in MMOCons:-Game is hardly similar to SKYRIM or OBLIVION (Blame Zenimax)- Took 5 years for them to adjust the game to what should have been around since day one- They make you pay a monthly fee basically for inventory space ( without it your basically fucked!)- They now charge for every expansion. In the past they included with ESO plus membership but now all expansions are 59.99- Combat system is good but not what it should be. This takes away from that Bethesda experience that we know and love. Combat system should be more like NW's- Traders and silent bids for traders is the dumbest fucking idea in MMO's ever!! ( One person silent bids 10k for a trader the other bids 500k thinking this is the range. Guild blows whole cache and that gold just disappears...- Devs do not give a shit about PvP world. They cater more to the PVE side. This leads to bugs and issues in Cyrodiil.- For new players there is lots of things to do but for us loyal day one players we are burning out on useless content. Fixing consistent issues that have been plaguing the game usually never see attention.  Ultimately, I feel this game is losing it's edge. Most players are keeping their eye out for something new and better. When new world released everyone started to leave this game. That shows where we are at. This game should have been different from day one. More that Bethesda style we love. But given all these condemning issues it is still the best MMO at this time. Anyone who disagrees isnt looking at the facts. ESO had huge potential but I believe it is dying out."
Negative,"I love this game a lot, it is one of my favorite MMO's of all time. If you are a casual player and don't care for PvP/Endgame PvE, this is a great MMORPG for you, especially if you like the Elder Scrolls universe. Although the ESO Plus membership is not required to experience the full game, if you plan on playing ESO as your main MMO you are definitely going to want to get it as it allows for you to carry unlimited crafting materials, and unlock all the DLCs for the game for however long you have ESO plus, and much more. The Pros: The solo story is awesome and engaging. The world is huge and consists of almost every part of Tamriel (Yes, you can visit Skyrim). Dungeons are so fun and the raids are even better. There are also solo/group arenas that can prove to be quite challenging. The different bosses and mechanics that come with them can be very challenging and rewarding, getting you different gear sets, armor/weapon motifs, titles, etc. Classes are pretty standard MMO classes. You have your tanks, DPS, and healer classes. You can also choose your race but it doesn't mean to much unless you are trying to maximize stats. The leveling system, gear system, and character customization is perfect in my opinion. It is simplistic yet diverse and allows for multiple different builds and looks for your character. Mounts in the game look awesome but could definitely be better. From what I have experienced, the community of this game is amazing. I have met nothing but generous and wholesome people on this game, whether it be from trading, dungeon running, raids, guilds etc (PvP community is horrible). Expansions and DLCs are unique and are honestly required to experience the full beauty of ESO. They add lots of new zones to explore, gear to achieve and storylines/bosses to complete. The graphics are also better than any MMO on the market that is actually fun to play, however that doesn't matter much to me when looking at games but it is a plus. Performance is also pretty decent, I have never crashed or had any crazy frame drops but I do have a super PC so take that with a grain of salt. The game also allows addons which can be very useful depending on what you use. The PvP in this game is some of the most fun I have had in an MMO by far. The Cons: ZeniMax Online Studios are one of the biggest clowns in the gaming industry. The development team behind this game, primarily the leads who make the big decisions have no business being at the positions they are in. All they care about is money. This game is so predatory to new players in terms of how the in-game shop works, not to mention the loot crates. For example, almost all of the mounts within this game have to be bought using either real money, using gems which you earn from salvaging items from loot crates, or currency from daily/weekly missions which can take months, maybe even years to achieve for ONE mount. There are only a few mounts which can be earned through actually playing the game, which are extremely difficult to attain even as an endgame player and don't even look that appealing. The monetization is just blatantly obvious that they do not care about player satisfaction. Not to mention that they have also banned users on their forums who raise concern about said issues. The servers are absolutely terrible. They attempted to fix them but somehow made it worse. This results in PvP/PvE being a laggy mess. Not being able to cast a skill or use a potion in certain scenarios is the difference between life and death. They could easily fix the server with the amount of money they make, but they don't care. Not to mention the hundreds of bugs that have still not been fixed for years, some even game breaking, but don't worry they added a new house that costs $200 USD. The toxic and unprofessional nature of the development team of ZOS is why I am giving this a bad review. They do not care about the players, they only care about the casuals money. I could go on and on but I don't think steam will allow me to write that much.Conclusion: The core game has the potential to be one of the best MMORPGs on the market, but the lack of a professional and passionate development team is why this games player base has dropped tremendously over the years. If you don't care about endgame content, you will love ESO and by all means, you should play it because you will enjoy it if you are an Elder Scrolls fan. However, if you are a hardcore gamer and want to go for the crazy endgame PvE titles, gear, achievements, and climb the PvP ladder, avoid at all costs because the developers could care less about you and just want your wallet."
Negative,"Buyer beware! The system requirements for this game are fraudulent. To install this game more than twice the storage space stated in the system requirements is required as Steam only downloads the install files. The Elder Scrolls Online installer requires 87gb on top of the 62.8gb downloaded by Steam.Once installed the original files downloaded by steam may be removed, but the initial requirement may prove a MASSIVE inconvenience on modern storage devices like smaller SSDs. The problem seems to have persisted for many months without concern from the developer or Steam."
Negative,"I've been playing eso for a long time, but now, there's no way I don't want to keep playingIt's not about the game, the DLC, eso+, the graphics, the gameplay, the story, I can live with that because I have friends to play with.It's not even my problem, but now no one is playing with me.The problem is zos poor anti-cheat and support.My account is perfectly fine, no social bans, no bansIt's not because of what cheaters did to me either, I honestly haven't encountered a single cheater, I don't play pvp content, they're too laggy.I've encountered a bunch of identical people in line, people with fixed movement tracks, people who follow you around in dungeons all the time and only use light attacks, people who don't reply to private chats, these obvious bots, for whom I get support emails when I click report.Where does this anti-cheat system and support system suck?A month ago I saw some community talk about a recent wave of bans and the possibility of false bansNow I see it.My college friends and I used to build a guild to play Trials. Then we graduated and still play the game as well, most of us have 2000-3000 hours of play time.A few days ago, 8 of my friends' accounts were suddenly banned, which is ridiculous. A group of people who logged into the game and used oak soul ring and held the left button and didn't let go to finish the daily game, then looked at the appearance of dressing up, building houses, and going to relax would be banned?We rarely play eso in the last 1 month, some people have not logged into eso in a month, I don't know what the reason is, customer service work orders reply for different reasons for everyone, there is a guy whose entire property is not more than 2m who received a banning email for selling gold, Lmao, and someone else showed the email title is eso content is fo76 banning notice from the eso team.It's crazy, and there are bad bot support replies where they just change a few of the sentences and keep sending them to you, forcing you to accept the result.I suspect it's because they all use the ip provided by the internet acceleration provider, and there are other people in the same ip that violated the regulations.Not all places are that good, no network acceleration service to connect na server will have 300+ pingAFAIK, this has been happening every June for the past few years, and false bans due to network acceleration services are common in other games as well.One of them was lucky enough to meet human support and unblocked.But the others are still in the same bad situation, emails from support will only repeat the last words or not reply to the email at allThey are still waiting for the result of the process, which is a painfully long process, and this emotion spreads to me.I don't know if eso's anti-cheat system is as reliable and efficient as eac and battleye's. The people in charge of anti-cheat bans are so lazy that they could always, continuously check if the players are normal and violate the rules, they could check the players' data, they could track and eventually ban the real violators and protect the normal players.However they choose to block a large number of people with suspicions in a concentrated period of time, one of the multiple users from the same ip has a problem, then it is quite possible that other users also have problems, and then slowly rank them? I don't know what they will do.Making a mass error ban in a long-running, role-playing game that requires a lot of time and effort to be put into it would only shatter the player's illusion of the game, realizing that his dedication is meaningless and that everything precious to him could suddenly fade awayWhy don't we make an announcement in advance that playing eso between April and June and logging into the game has a lottery with a chance of getting bannedWouldn't think that players who have gone through this kind of thing would come back to play the game after their accounts are eventually unblocked, right?There are so many good games out there, who will continue to play your sh*t game?Put these normal players into the June banning of a large number of illegal players news bulletinGood job zos"
Negative,"Despite having a janky but interesting combat and character system under the hood, having voice acting in every quest, something unheard of in other MMOs; and having an enjoyable gameplay loop, I cannot recommend this game for the reason that it's designed to inconvenience the player, through mechanics like putting time-gates on stable mount upgrades and researching weapon traits, and then offering the use of their own payed currency to skip those time-gates, something the devs called ""paying for convenience"". There's very limited inventory and bank space, it took me 40 hours of gameplay to grind the gold for 90/90 inventory/bank slots, the maximum possible is 1,300. It would take around a thousand hours of waiting to upgrade your mount, because the game prevents you from buying more than one upgrade every 20 hours using gold alone.I suppose the positive side in these kinds of design choices is that it prevents gold-sellers from spamming the game, as players can buy power directly from the dev, but I believe in-game currencies and microtransactions (Not sure I'd call it micro, because converted to USD each item in the store costs roughly $8) do more harm than good.The blackwood edition doesn't include a lot of the content, I assumed I would be getting access to the whole game if I bought the more expensive edition on steam, but there are a lot of chapters that I need to pay for, chapters which have more player skills locked behind them. I found a lot of thieves guild chests around the world, and I cannot open them unless I purchase the thieves guild chapter. I therefore missed opportunities to level skills and gain more items, thus I am enticed to purchase more chapters for fear of missing out on rewards. I found pieces of a clockwork robot, I cannot make use of them unless I purchase the clockwork city chapter.These little things damaged my experience, they remind me that I don't have access to the full game unless I pay for. MMO's used to have a model where a subscription and an expansion was enough, now I feel that large game companies milk the player financially at the expense of having an enjoyable product. This game is just fun enough for me to spend 40 hours on it, but after that the illusion broke and I saw the game for what it is.I can see the fun, but the intentionally designing the game to let those with deeper wallets attain power much faster, is too large of a flaw for me."
Negative,"It´s awesome game with great story, fun characters and all, but man, EU Megaserver and general technical state of this game are absolutely ABYSMALEdit: After 2 years of playing this game (only through steam, i dont change servers, i dont mess with files etc) on average pc, im on 3hrs/month of troubleshooting the game to even play it officially.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE UNLESS YOU HATE THEM"
Negative,"I very much enjoyed Skyrim and was hoping this game would scratch that itch. At its best the game can be fun, but the fun is gated off by so many artificial hoops and stumbling blocks you eventually only see the hoops and stumbling blocks.Let's start with the download servers - they are pitifully set up, intentionally, and supply an installer that is unable to scan files and directories to figure out what is and isn't needed, so each and every download is a full install,  from the initial game install, to patches and updates, which take days instead of 1 or 2 hours. My actual time ingame is much more having run  multiple characters and completed the main quest line the mandatory 3 times so I was able to see the game areas from inside all 4 factions.None of this shows here because the playtime shown by steam is actually time spent by the launcher downloading the steam version, which I gave up on ever getting finished as I'd already downloaded the game separately and rather than having to wait another (literal) week for the steam version, I continued playing that. Every time there was an update I'd be forced back through the same days to week long dld cycle where it was clear the developer was the one doing the bandwidth throttling for the sake of costs.Gameplay then would have to be stellar to compensate for the lack of planning and foresight dedicated to getting the game out there, right?In Skyrim the game showers you with the things you need to progress, because it wants you to progress. If you want structured storytelling you have quests. If you just want to chill you can wander about aimlessly. Either way you'll find you have an inventory full and levelled a few skills without making a conscious effort to do so.Not so in Tamriel Unlimited. To give them their due the devs tried to carry the essence of Skyrim over but they primarily want you to spend time online so things like crafting ingredients, XP and soul crystals become a means to encourage you do that. This commodifying affects the interactions online, other players simply become another tool to get the skills/xp/items/mounts you think you want. So you have a huge open world, populated for the most part with ai and quest hooks, while the majority of players blob into tiny areas because that's where the highest return for time spent online in terms of loot or XP is. Player groups or guilds exist, but only because they facilitate co-ordinated blobbing for better loot/powerlevelling, something the devs have tacitly acknowledged by trying to encourage players to blob more evenly on a couple of occasions.The blobbing of course causes queues for certain high-yield bosses. These queues are handled much more intelligently (well usuually - one particularly memorable festive themed one had a single quest giver for the entire server which made for some interesting lag) than the download ones but they're still there, tugging at your immersion. Don't get me wrong - I came up through MUDs and MOOs. I am able to separate events in course and the mechanical and digital means used to produce them and still feel there is a story. However each storyline quest is presented as being of earth shattering importance. But quests are gated by XP. Meaning you need to grind (another face of encouraging time spent online) to be able to follow the main storyline. Or to put it another way the cataclysmic events don't actually give you or the game world anything you didn't already have aside from mostly useless inventory clutter that you'll probably ditch as soon as you can because the quests are repeatable and you probably didn't get a rare drop first try. Or to put it another way - you'll grind the quest and you got there in the first place through doing mindless, unfun, busywork. You and everyone else you can see hanging around the towns will have the ""Saviour of [NPC| ORGANISATION | TOWN | GEOGRAPHICAL AREA]"" title as you. NPCs won't react to you because everyone in earshot will be ""Thane of [CITY NAME]"", leaving the towns stragely lifeless, filled with players being  ""got places to go, things to do,"" and taciturn NPCs, somehow dead, except for the repeated allcapsing text chat spam by players selling materials.And, once you take away the sense of  progression afforded by the story, each encounter becomes simply ""Yeah, yeah - stop chewing the scenery and drop my loot - got places to go things to do."" Add that to scripted encounters that rely on the ingame posemoji animations available to any player and you've got some really painful dialogues. Finally, like many other online games you have in-game currency and real currency transactions to obtain in-game abilities or items. You won't need any of these to actually play the game, but the familiar freemium timers start popping up just to remind you that you could wait a month to learn how to make a single item in Argonian style, or ...Talking of counters - certain skills like blacksmithing have been subdivided to slow you down.  The time it takes to learn increases exponentially so higher level weapons and armour will take real physical months to learn, though the game will helpfully remind you there are there are research boosters available in the store...If you'd like enchanted armour or weapons you'll need to find an example of that item with that material and that enchant to learn it from. Rinse and repeat for each level linked material.Oh and if you want to have a specific look you'll need to hunt down style books, some of which have been torn up into individual pages for each item you may want to craft.And each update brings more finely granulated busywork."
Negative,From EULA:We may collect personal data including web browsing URLS visited ect....why does a game need this? SPYWARE thumbs down
Negative,"make this game a normal one time purchase + DLCs, no shady purchases and unfair advantages and it will be a masterpiece."
Negative,"This game is amazing!!!-fun combat design-really nice quests-huge pvp-challenging pve endgameBUT!!!!!!!!!!The game is really really laggy.Up to the point where it is UNPLAYABLE.Your skills don't work or have a 3-4s delay in pvp!You load in buggy pve instances just to reset again and again and again.It is really frustrating and I hope they will fix it eventually.Could easily be the best game I have ever played, but not like this!!!"
Negative,"No. This is not for me. I tried a couple of times, but I just don't get it. For a few points: - Leveling doesn't do anything, you don't progress as a character, and you don't become stronger, because enemies always will be at the same level as you.- Fighting is boring. Enemies don't react to your damage, they just run into you and attack you. I don't feel the impact of my spells and attacks. It's like fighting against sponges. And it's easy, and therefore boring. You can just stay in one place and spam 1 ability almost without a cooldown and win.- There is a decent story and quests (for an MMO). But since you can go anywhere you want, it gets messy, especially for a new player, you can go to a new zone and lose all the context. You lose the consistency of storytelling and don't understand what the hell is going in this world. As the result, you don't know where to start and what to do, or in what order."
Negative,"Elder Scrolls at it's core is a questing game. If you play Elder Scrolls or Fallout, you play for the story. Elder Scrolls Online deviates from this. Everyone cheeses the grind by power leveling. The game is designed to be an everlasting grind that continues to force you to pay for ESO Plus for the rest of eternity. Meanwhile being forced to pay for the latest ""DLC"". I hate this type of subscription gameplay because I am a casual gamer that will lose interest if I play the same game for weeks upon weeks. So subscribing to a monthly subscription to only play for 2 or 3 days is a bit of a rip-off. Then Zenimax/Bethesda are double dipping by forcing you to also pay for each and every major update as if it was a new game. As someone with fiber internet, laggy servers make PvP an absolute bore. I see no reason to play this game. If I didn't get it from Humble Bundle Monthly, I probably would never have tried it - and I wish that was the case. This is probably one of the most overrated games I have ever played and I regret spending extra on the DLC and ESO Plus because I just feel scammed."
Negative,"I cannot for the life of me get this game to run. I've attempted to install in 2019. I've been attempting to troubleshoot the following issue for the last week to no avail (easily 12 hours worth of attempting technical wizardry with nothing to show for it).""UNABLE TO EXECUTE THE DESIRED PROGRAM. PLEASE GET ANOTHER COPY OF THE INSTALLER AND TRY AGAIN""I've attempted to install the game on both my C Drive and external hard drives. I've tried the fixes shown here:https://help.elderscrollsonline.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/34087/~/why-am-i-getting-the-error-unable-to-execute-the-desired-program.-please-getI've tried finding an alternate copy of the downloader online to no avail (steam version is different).I've tried to get the steam repair utility to run; however, it has been greyed out every time and will not run.I had played this game for a couple hundred hours and launch and wanted to give it a second chance in 2019... unfortunately I can't even try the game out.I've called ZOS and they told me this is an issue on Steam's end. They wouldn't even placate me by putting me through to one of their tech support guys.I've called Steam and have been told this is an issue on ZOS's end. I was told there is nothing they can do, and of course I can't be refunded my money because its been years since I bought the game.Wonderful customer service guys... just top notch.0/10"
Negative,"I ""only"" have 1.075 hours on Steam but let me tell you i used to have a second Account way before Steam released this Version and i can tell you that this Game is just not fun anymore. I spend a lot of Money in this Game and also in Elder Scrolls Legends (The other cashgrab title)This Game is so incredibly easy. There are possibilities to make the game harder for yourself, BUT is that really they way we play games nowadays ? Try to make games more difficult in stupid ways like solo run vet dungeons, solo killing world bosses and stuff.Also developer will tell you that they care about ur opinion and that you should send in feedback. I did it, tons and tons of times and you know what they hit me with a new Card Game and 2 new female Companions i couldn't care less about. (talking about the Adventure ""High Isle"")Also they have a pre-purchase for a pre-purchase because if you pre-purchase NOW before the April 4th YOU GET SOMETHING FOR FREE !!! (and everyone starts shouting ""Take my Money"" !!!)Like ... i don't even ... anymore ... Even if they tell you that they care about Feedback, they just don't and obviously the main reason is to only pretend so new customers (like u - who might read this review) will think ""hey, if they take time to read reviews and give answers - they really care"" -> Spoiler:  NO, they don'tWhich i'm not even mad about because obviosuly they can't satisfy everyone. Nowadays everyone accept mediocre as good - but i don't ... not anymore. The Main issue i have is that they PRETEND TO CARE. I just can't take the Gaming Industry anymore at this point.Devs will tell you that you can earn ingame Cosmetics by playing and not paying ... which is true to a certain extent, BUT it will not change the Fact that they will permanently push their shop into ur Face. They will try to squeeze every single penny out of you and they are REALLY good at it. On Top of that they are also very good at pretending not to. The Prices are abnormal. Way to high. And even IF there is a possibility to not spend money all the time, this whole thing creates a shitty cashgrab atmosphere.The Card Game which is a new addition to the Game is actually just a new addition to the Ingame Shop. It's very hard to accept that this is what the whole game is all about. And it becomes even more difficult to accept it after playing and throwing money at it for a very long time, because no one likes to admit stupid mistakes.Also playing the Game without a ""Plus Membership"" is like running against a Wall. It hurts! At this point u don't play the game anymore to enjoy it. You play the game to tell urself that it's possible to play it without a Membership, so you can feel like a superior smartass. A superior smartass who pretends, that the Game is awesome even without a Membership. In the long Run even this superior smartass spends money for ""BRAND NEW ELDER SCROLLS ADVENTURES"" but only during ""Sales"" because he is soooo incredibly goddamn smart !!!Again pretending is the Keyword. This Game is a Cashgrab and they got my Money. If u are looking for a good Game -> this is the wrong place, move onIf you want that the Management can buy another expensive Car -> i can recommend this GameIf you like the modern Gaming Industry with mediocre Games from Big Franchises like Battlefield, Call of Duty, Far Cry and Star Wars -> i can also recommend the Game because the Elder Scrolls Franchise became exactly that - ""a successful Cashgrab Game with a political Agenda to please the Social Justice Mob and tons of easy game mechanics for stupid ppl like you and me =)""Elder Scrolls Online - Let's be poor and stupid but TOGETHER !!!"
Negative,"1h 13min login queue? I have never waited for that long even for Knight Online servers in 2008.We, as Steam users (who purchased this game) deserve at least login without queue. Anyway, if that is, let that be it is. Good luck."
Negative,"Came in with an open mind, ESO is a popular long standing MMORPG, I was bored and because of the sale it was half price for £7.50, its a game I have thought about before so I gave it a go. So far everything has been pretty disappointing. The AI is absolute dogshit, that was literally the first thing that came to my mind in the first 15 minutes of the game, enemies including humanoids of various classes (fighters, mages, archers, rogues ect) and different monster/animal creatures feel incredibly dull and provide no challenge whatsoever, often you can engage an npc and start fighting meanwhile his buddies are standing just a few metres away doing nothing and being completely oblivious to the fact that we are fighting even if looking directly at us. The hostile NPC ""engagement zone"" is way to small and ends up just annoying you and wasting your time. What I mean by this is from where the npc stands/roams there is a certain distance that if you go that far the npc goes back to full health, disengages and walks back were he was, this is of course done in many game for good reasons however it happens way to often and without even trying that hard to avoid the monster, I can literally just be walking backwards while fighting for a matter of seconds and the npc disengages. You can avoid the above problem by just standing still and fighting, as most standard encounters are so NOT challenging that you actually don't even need to try at all, you don't have to concentrate or dodge enemy attacks, you can just stand still let them beat on you while you are taking them out one by one because again there is no challenge whatsoever. I have met a few creatures that are meant to pose a challenge but that isn't because of any attempt to make it feel like a good fight but because the HP of that particular one is inflated into the millions (yes literally 1 or 2 or more million health) Looting is pretty boring, in some locations you are just opening containers one by one getting junk, one dungeon had about 20 little jars on each side of the room so you are there just going one by one, many pieces of equipment that you find laying around and can pick up are literally worth 0 gold however you cannot see this until you actually pick it up, considering you start with 60 inventory slots and you are often outside of a city or a place with merchants as you are doing quests, your bag quite easily fills up, you have to buy additional inventory space for in game gold. Also a bug I noticed with looting (first came across it within the first moments of the game) is that when you try to loot something you just killed you get an error saying that you are too far away, even though you standing right on top of the dead body, you then have to start crouching and doing circles until the game decides to give you the loot window, the VERY FIRST animal that I killed that dropped its loot body (not all kills will be lootable) I couldn't even loot it because of said issue, I tried until the body disappeared. Quests are also really boring, there are just so many of them, you are always picking up new quests while performing current ones and just travelling from location to location, they are not engaging at all and end up feeling more like a chore than anything, yes in an mmo you need a grind to keep the game alive with players by consuming their time but this is paid game for starters and I really felt no enjoyment out of most of the quests, in better made games I love reading the dialogs and trying to understand what is going in, here there is no point of doing that as you are getting so many tiny quests you just have to go to where it tells you on the map and that's pretty much job done, you follow some simple instructions for a moment and you carry on elsewhere.On a positive note loading screens are really fast, if there is one it never takes more than a few seconds and I have an older pc too. The only reason I am going to carry on playing this game is so that I can try out the PVP, but if you are someone who knows that PVP is a part of the game they are least interested in then i would say to avoid this game. Yes it could very well be a good time killer but I cannot honestly say that I feel this is a well made game, it just feels way to cheap, extremely bland. I am still low lvl so I havn't experienced much of what the game has to offer, some people might declare that even if what I say is true that the end game content is more interesting, but if just so bad early on then how can one be expected to stick with it to the end? Also the game advertisement says ""join over 13 million players"", Steam currently has 17k online with a 32k all time peak, so I am guessing that steam accounts for very little of the population however when a company has to use these kind of tactics to make the game sound great/big its never a good sign, there is a huge difference between 13 million individual purchases across 5 years and actually having a good amount of people in game, I know they haven't said anything they shouldn't have much its still a thought out marketing ploy. I will stick it out for a bit more just to try out the pvp and will update the review after that, however based on incredibly boring and unengaging enemy AI I just don't see how the games PVE content can be considered enjoyable. UPDATE : So I couldn't even bare to stick it out to try out the PVP, out of my playtime the only thing I enjoyed was one mini puzzle (about 30 seconds worth of content) and being an MMO the puzzles can't be made that difficult either. If you are obsessed with all things Elder Scrolls and want to have a laugh with friends then maybe this game could work for you, if you want interesting and challenging gameplay then look for it elsewhere."
Negative,"I have pretty much quit this game. I've got a lot more playtime than it says because it only counts how long the launcher is open, not the game itself. I have played since beta on and off, and for the majority of my playtime I was ill prepared to play an MMO, as this was my first one I'd played seriously. The world and story telling is all there, great atmosphere, but after genuinely getting into the endgame stuff I ran into a bit of a roadblockI'd put enough hours into this game to understand fully what stats meant for your build, what to allocate champion points to, and by thinking outside the box I'd even theory crafted builds I felt surpassed some of the ready-made builds you can find online. I've completed every dungeon, basegame and dlc, as well as solo arena up to the markarth expansion on veteran difficulty, (Hardest difficulty) and some of them gave me quite a bit of trouble, but I pressed on and a lot of the progress I made felt very good. But trials (12 man raids) definitely soured the experience.At the point I was at, most sane people would have grown bored with the game or moved on to something new, but I was determined. Peers who I'd played with fell into a monotonous cycle of doing the same 3 base game veteran trials every day, and no progress was made in dlc veteran trials. Maybe it was just the guilds and people I'd found myself with but organizing 12 people across timezones for a videogame is doing too much.A major complaint I have with the handling of balancing in this game is animation canceling, or as the community calls it ""weaving"". This is essentially using a skill on your hotbar and at just the right moment, leftclicking to light attack and cancel the remaining animation of your previous attack to maximize dps. This is not fun to learn, nor to do, but it is almost required in order to progress in endgame content. I have had struggles with genuine mechanics sure, but this is a very lame exploit that the developers have leaned into as the ""meta"" and it feels bad to play with, especially in an elder scrolls game.This is not oblivion or morrowind, nor is it skyrim, and it should not be compared to those games, because it is not the same kind of experience. But I will do it anyway. If I boot up a traditional elder scrolls game, I do not feel like my only option is to exploit the game in order to complete the challenging content, people certainly do, but the elder scrolls series is generally a grounded and balanced experience as long as you build your character reasonably and don't power level. I would recommend this game for the mmo crowd who is used to this sort of game play format, and maybe for the casual to a degree, but the endgame content is simply unbalanced and unfun.Tl;dr, endgame is unfair, but the several hundred hours before that can make you some memories, just take it easy on the lootboxes."
Negative,"I find it difficult to recommend the game to friends, it's a good game and it's fun, but the craft bag being locked behind a subscription means I'm either spending the majority of my playtime organising my bag space, or I'm paying for a subscription.I am a casual gamer and current student with many hobbies and other games to play with friends so paying for a sub for one game doesn't make sense for me. I keep finding myself abandoning this game for long periods because I'm just not enjoying my time with it. Having to organise bag space after every dungeon or every half hour of questing gets old fast, and when I think of what game I feel like playing and look at this, I just feel like it'd be a chore. It's very clear they're trying to pressure you into a subscription with the prevailing inconvenience of limited bag space and it just leaves me with an icky feeling. I like to pay for things I enjoy, but I don't like the way this game handles inventory management, and find it difficult to enjoy because of it, and I'm not about to invest more money into a game I'm not enjoying to try and squeeze some fun out of it for a month.I will come back to it every now and then when I have the time and patience for inventory management.Note I have reached champion level 75 in-game and bag space has never stopped being an issue. The number of hours logged on steam doesn't reflect times where I've left it open to patch/update."
Negative,"Any wonder, fun, or sense of adventure that Skyrim, or any other elder scrolls game for that matter, had is removed. The combat is even more sluggish and boring that it had always been, stealth isn't worth shit unless you grind like an idiot, nothing is honestly, this game is a huge boring ass grind. also, it uses up like 100gbs, and it's simply trash, don't waste your time. Everything is pre-baked boring quests, everything is slow as fuck, there is no discovery, no true exploration and no rewards for trying to explore, all the enemies are marked red, you can't kill NPCs, you can't play with their physics, you see a bunch of shit thrown around you can't pick up. If you liked anything in any elder scrolls games that wasn't the grinding, don't even consider getting this hot piece of garbage, it's the worst downgrade."
Negative,"Even after 6 years the game is still a mess when it comes to performance and the servers are getting worse and worse. PvP is often completely unplayable (unable to use any abilities for 10+ seconds) and there is still noticeable lag at its best. Additionally, endgame PvE content like trials sometimes don't work at all.Whats probably even worse than that is the behavior of the developers. For starters they have promised great performance improvements over the last couple of months but it just got worse. Furthermore, they started to actively remove all comments with even just a hint of critique in them. Latest example was their twitch stream about the new expansion, where every single comment mentioning lag was removed within 1 second.Overall, I would strongly recommend against buying this game until there are some serious and well tested server performance upgrades in the future."
Negative,"This game is bigger disappointment than Calculus III grade reports. The quest are annoying, the players are annoying, the enemies are annoying and the fact I can't refund it is even more annoying. It's a maintenance and update simulator.Pros*looks good*Runs smooth*mapCons*everything else.."
Negative,"82GB to download on steam, then on top of that in ESO's Launcher I have to download 88 MORE GB?!?!? You're kidding right? There is no way even an MMO like this should require 170 GB in 2017. You're asking for almost 1/5th of my hard drive. This game is not worth 1/5th of a 1TB hard drive, businesses are supposed to adapt to consumer needs not the other way around."
Negative,"In their last piracy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) they said  they will ""sell"" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). Great, you put a million things for me to buy all up in my face THEN YOU SELL MY INFO?  If you wanna play, you got to pay, am I right?Fallout 76 fans:"
Negative,"Before you consider buying this game let me just explain how it works.First off there's a ton more items and ingredients and recipes and schematics to do basically the same we could do in SkyrimSecond, there is nothing your character can do without a recipe, not even a damn steakThird, the ingredients are worthless if you try to sell them to merchants, most are 0, but you’ll pay well for them if you need to buy themSo basically you have to keep accumulating stuff until you can find the right recipe or schematic or all the required parts and ingredients because you will need them if you want to do anything, be it a dagger or a damn steak...But here's the thing, there's not even the concept of storing stuff in the game world, there are no crates in game you can use to store stuff, even if you work your butt to buy a house you won’t be able to store anything in thereBetter yet, as you character progresses you can enhance all characteristics like magica, health or stamina but not inventory space.....And how does it work them you may askWell simple, you need to buy storage space...Yep you can buy storage space in banks in game or bags in game merchants that increase inventory space by 10 each but both, bank space or bag prices grow exponentially to the point you have to pay real money to have a real good inventoryAnd here's the corollary of it all, if you buy the subscription ""ESO Plus"" you get a portable bag that has unlimited inventory.....Yep for 12€ a month you manage to carry all your stuff with you wherever you go in game all the time, the same stuff you couldn't store in a house you manage to build in game....Pretty neat hey?...."
Negative,"Well, I update the review in the direction of deterioration.The Zenimax gentlemen are probably completely out of their minds.Disgusting tech works and manage to break the game without even updating.About the compensation to the players who are silent don't think properly.The question is what will fuck it up a base of characters of the players?I sympathize with the owners of ESO+ and it is sad that the company does not respect those who actually feed them.And what's the problem with hiring more competent programmers?"
Negative,"-Should be called ""Tamriel Limited"" because 80% of Tamriel is locked by dlc's. -Besides that, it feels like you're thrown into the game, and not completely finish.-Feels like playing a small-time indie game, not one of the Elder Scrolls.-Some levels feel like they were made by some amateur on Unreal Engine.-No specific class boundries, which can be a bad thing. Every player is a mix of mage, melee,  and/or bow.In conclusion:Worth 10$ on sale? Maybe.Worth anything higher? No."
Negative,"I bought TESO in early 2016 for the amount of 30€ and as a long time TES fan i thought, wow, this MMO must be full on content, and i can explore Tamriel to its full potential, and in 2023 i found that Zenimax is a greedy company and that is the reason why i stopped playing it multiple times, and eventually came back again.By the time i started playing in 2016 i realized half of the open world was blocked by a pay wall, and i could not understand how an MMO worth 60€ (by that time) but have so much blocked content, i mean, 95% of MMOS are free, and then yes, you have an optional subscription.Now the year is 2023.. in 2022 i decided i should give it a try to ESO+, and let me tell you, it is biggest robbery and the one the worst subscriptions out there in an MMO. Let me start telling you about games like final fantasy online. That game has a subscription that gives you full acess to the game, it means you can also win everything within the game, mounts, weapons, armor, regions, everything that an MMO has to offer, in ESO? Oh lord... but before i talk about ESO+, let me first talk about the overall experience.I think games like TESO survive to this day because of players like me, that enjoy the game as it was a single player experience... you go around, appreciate the amazing quests (all with voice acting) you kill mobs, appreciate the visuals and landscape, and simply have fun with the lore and story. All that sounds very nice, but once you're so deep in the game, and your build is complete you start thinking... exploring and doing that stuff that i love, starts to become lame and boring... and you ask me why. Well, ESO world, has no levels, every enemy is level 1, and it neves changes from zone to zone, that sounds great because you can play with friends, but after a while it gets very annoying. You can leave your character being attacked by MOBS, and go to lunch.. and once you come back, you are still alive. I love enjoying quests in MMOS, but there is little challenge in ESO, if you want a real challenge you are forced to go for group content, mostly blocked again, by a pay wall, since most players move on everytime a DLC comes out, and since new sets come out every expansion, you will rarely find people playing the free dungeons of trials (Raids).Fun fact about eso, is that also, you cant craft without the subscription. If you try to craft in this game without ESO+ you are limited by the amount of space your inventory has. ESO+ gives you an infinite crafting bad, if you're a F2P player in eso and you want to craft, you will constantly have to throw away stuff because you wont ever have enough space to keep your materials, so you can see exactly how Zenimax is greedy and want to force you to pay them a subscription, and that was the main reason i tried the subscription, because it was impossible for me to have enough space for literally anything! I call that pay 2 win!Other fun fact about their greedy service is that, you have multiple stuff you can do daily, for example upgrading your horse stats. As a normal player you can only do that once a day, but guess what! they have multiple items on their crown store (IRL money) that able players to upgrade their horses multiple times a day, you can fully upgrade it in a day even if you want! But anyways... if you want to have a mount in this game or have a great house, everything is locked by their crown store, that has unthinkable prices, a decent house will cost you around 30 to 40€ real life money, not to mention hat the In_Game economy is destroyed by the players who sell crowns for gold, that should be something to get someone banned. The same happens for the most cool style pages / outfits, 80% of them are locked by the store.Another crazy stuff about the subscription is the fact that they put (leads) which are pages that allow you to excavate the best items in game, across every zone, so if you want for example (the ring of the pale order) the best ring for solo content in the game, they will put all the leads across multiple DLC zones, so they're forcing you to either use the subscription or buy any of the DLCs that are super expensive, in order for you to become stronger.I wont even mention the broken PVP...But i will mention the amount of Bugs this game has... it is actual insane, game was released in 2014 and i have the same bugs from back then! UI disappearing force me to restart the game! Doors in dungeons that dont open!Abilities while in a fight stop working multiple times! List goes on and on.Great thing about ESO is that you can appreciate it as a single player game and also their 2 huge mega servers, everyone from europe play in the same server and everyone from america plays in the same server, but when it comes to the subscription, other than giving you acess to all areas, it gives you very little, as everything else is still locked to you.I appreciate their mega monthly events but i also have to say again, that many times events are set in DLC regions, making a lot of players not being able to participate in them. Overall ESO could be an amazing MMO, but the current state of the game is not worth it, you can still play in the free areas, but everyone moved one from these, and you wont ever be able to be as strong as the others as the best stuff is in the DLC zones, and like i said, game offers very little challenge apart from group content. You could appreciate PVP in late game but it is broken and very laggy. I have fibra, 500MB internet, i lag in no other games, and even lately, i feel a lot of delay in eso.ESO is a fantastic game for TES Fans, best visuals in an MMO, great combat and very responsive, i might the say even the best combat in a MMO perhaps.. but as an overall MMO, you have better options out there."
Negative,"So many realms, so many different ways to explore, so many quests. So why does it play so plainly? HookNow you can play Skyrim with many many others.MechanicA flourishing and varied world, populated with many quests, exciting bossfights, some over-arcing story, ability to customise your player, join a pvp warzone, buy power-ups to make yourself look great, indulge in gambling-mechanics to win rare items... it really is a mixed-bag of ideas, some better delivered than others.Explore a big old world- find quest-givers and go on quests, making otehr quests appear- fast-travel across teh worlds via discovered shrines- buy safehouses to allow you to instantly teleport to safety- grind monsters to level-up, earn more stuff to sell or enchant- use real-world cash to buy exclusive outfits, mounts, pets and frippery- open loot-crates to unlock rare items- fight alongside others at 'warp-hole' boss battles where demons are summoned- delve into many dungeons- play in a big warzone in the middle of the map- pay money to unlock parts of the world, guilds and other game bonusesAccessibility- not very gory, no nudity or profanity- some typical monster demons and big scary bugsDeliveryYou explore, you mash buttons to kill, you level-up. And repeat.It does get tired quickly, which is a real shame.The second-to-second gameplay is really boring: from running across beautiful vistas to button-mashing combat.On top of this, it is very easy to succumb to pay-to-play mechanics to help liven things up - except they don't. Yes, you look pretty and have a pretty horse, but it is still a boring game to play. No you do not have to pay-to-play to enjoy this game, but with so much locked or hampered with the vanilla game, the enticement is there.But you can join guilds, play with friends and bash your way through dungeons aplenty. It almost seems like a kid's game with all the sophistication of the original Gauntlet coin-op.Pros:- there is a full and realise world here- the world is beautiful to behold- the NPCs are fleshed out and there is tons to do- you can play the game your way and have lots of funCons:- combat is very basic and very boring- quests can become flooded with other players- the quests lack mechanical variety and it is boring to play through these oterhwise well-written quests- the gameloop has no depth or real variety, other than superficial.I've never liked Skyrim. I hate the premise of any campaign centered around 'the chosen one' and this dumb-as-Hawk-the-Slayer mythology is dumbed down further for an online spend-em-up. I mean grind-em up. And when your intricate quest is interrupted by half a dozen fellow questors, all chasing your goal - it really diminishes the experience: you are just on a conveyor belt in a fantasy factory.My Score: 6/10 It is a slick machine: what Fallout 76 aspires to be I suspect. However it lacks sophistication and the combat, which is compulsory, is so damned dull."
Negative,"Okay, so for me, so far, the game has been relatively fun. Classes are decent, skills are fun and the world is pretty large. Those are the pros that I can think of. On the flip side, the cons are much more numerous...First - Zenimax is a VERY greedy company. The free to play model just sucks. They bomb you with useless items and crafting materials that fill your inventory quickly, and it sucks to have to constantly go back to clear inventory - BUT there is a crafting mats inventory separate of your normal inventory that if you sub, you can use. As a free player, I would love the option to buy this, but can't have it unless you sub. Also, that big world I mentioned? Yeah, F2P only get a small amount of it, unless you buy expansions (normal fare, and I am not complaining about it) but the WORST thing is on top of expansions you have DLC, which add a decent amount of content, but you MUST buy them or again, sub. It's annoying. I am not here to complain about a company trying to make some money, but this company WILL nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING. I only wish they made the F2P model a little less restrictive. You have to buy the game, and expansions, AND sub if you want to do anything of merit in this game. A bit of a letdown, but still a fun game."
Negative,"If you're someone who constantly has to manage disk space and would have to clear up 85 GB of it just to download this behemoth of a game , don't bother. After downloading, the installer will ask for a  further  87 GB of memory even though only the initial 85 GB is taken, as listed in the specifications.Oh sure, 85 GB as stated in the beginning is fine, you say? No, the installer will not install and patch the game if you don't clear up the extra, pointless 87 GB of storage. In other words: the game requires you to have over 160 GB of space just to get started, otherwise it gives you a huge f*ck you. Fastest refund I have requested."
Negative,"The limited item capacity basically makes it unplayable without a subscription, so any discount is nothing compared to the £9 per month / £82 per year you'd be paying, and every expansion that comes with FOMO preorder items. Just get Skyrim tbh.Forgot to say that the daily rewards (as well as having to play regularly to justify ESO plus) made playing the game feel like a chore, even though a few of the quests were interesting. But too many of them were just “go to a place, quest done”, why bother building such a huge world if you’re not going to put anything interesting in it. Maybe it’s just me, but when a game makes me feel I have to play it, I lose pretty much all interest in playing it."
Negative,"The game is very well optimized and runs and looks great. You will have fun leveling up, doing quests, dungeons, even PvP. That is until you hit lvl cap. After that you will spend most of your time shuffling thru inventory and bank space. Unless ofc you subscribe to ESO+ then you'll have unlimited mats bag, double bank space etc. In PvP you will start to get one shoted by whales who bought all the DLCs with all the locked skill lines that boost stats. Basically the game creates problems so it can sell you the solution. You know the drill."
Negative,"Too grindy for a quick run, and too expensive for the long haul. ESO really doesn't have a sweet spot, as far as I'm concerned. I kept picking it up again and again, hoping to get to enjoy the game eventually, but found myself going back to Skyrim. The MMO elements weren't worth the effort, and the single player elements were much better executed in a 9 year old game by the same publishers."
Negative,"Endless loading screens, server disconnects, unplayable lag, and 'unforeseen' downtime following almost every patch or server maintenance. PC-EU is an absolute joke and has been for months. We were promised a boost within 'a couple of weeks' (that quote swiftly deleted from their own forums) around 2 months ago and there's no sign. We've even had a login queue just to enter the game we're paying a subscription for!The ESO forums are now being zealously managed to remove performance complaints.ZOS continue to roll-out new content despite game-breaking bugs in the existing content, and are rapidly monetising elements of the game on a short road to paytowin. I can only imagine that's to attempt to fund the server upgrades required months ago. The most effective character classes are only available if you buy the latest chapter - that's in addition to buying the game, and the ESO+ subscription to give you enough inventory to hold any equipment worth having. Forget any time you've spent on existing characters, a whole slew of which aren't effective at all now.In addition, we're regularly having equipment and skills 'rebalanced', and by that I mean universal nerfs for kit that takes a significant time to grind... now worthless. Where will you find the better non-nerfed kit? That's right, same paywall as the best class.Of course, the subscription (paid in advance) isn't for accessing the game, it's just for the 'craft bag' and 'crowns' - considered consumable content and therefore isn't refundable. A significant part of the visual content is only available via Crown Crates, a gambling minigame funded by your subscription crowns, introducing a new audience to gambling addiction for virtual content. What a lovely company to pay your money to. I've invested a ridiculous amount of my time into this ever-changing crashfest of a game, and I wish more than anything I could have that refunded. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY, IT'S A MESS!"
Negative,I liked it at first but it got boring pretty fast. Questing is decent. Crafting is underwhelming and combat is ho-hum. The way the class building works - it becomes a very min/max game.There are some interesting quests but not enough to save it from being a snore-fest.
Negative,"Sh1t Fest PvPIf you consider playing this game for PvP here is how P2W ESO PvP works:PvP is pay to win you need the latest chapter to have fun because in each chapter Zenimax creates a ridiculous meta where everyone is abusing that (including me bcs otherwise PvP is unplayable). You can ask that if there is an unevenness in PvP why they are not fixing it in the updates. Basically, they dont. The only fix is that when Zenimax launches the new chapter. So that new Chapter brings new items and meta that outperforms the previous one. That is just how it goes, you find yourself in a loop where you need to buy latest chapters in order to have fun in PvP."
Negative,>84gb download>has to install launcher>launcher proceeds to spend an hour downloading and 'applying' files that could have easily been included on steam insteadfuсκ off
Negative,If you like PvP don't touch this game. It lags so badly you can't cast your abilities half the time.  Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
Negative,"I've spent so many hours in this game, I have lots to say about it.. Many good, but mostly bad. The game itself is pretty decent, story content etc. But the way the company (Zenimax Online) treats it's player base is absolutely shocking.The customer service is terrible, no matter how many tickets you open regarding an issue you're having. This has completely put me off from playing this game. To anyone considering play this, I highly recommend you find something else instead."
Negative,"**EDIT:** DO NOT BUY THIS GAME OR PREORDER GREYMOOR. Performance is in the worst state it has ever been in, and it's virtually impossible to progress through vet trials or do PvP. Your skills don't go off when pressed and everything is desync'd. ON TOP OF THAT, ZOS recently took away the ability to queue with friends in battlegrounds (instanced PvP mode) and just announced that they are keeping it as solo queue only for the foreseeable future. They don't care about the multiplayer aspect of this game at all and are ONLY catering to the solo quester types.Performance is horrendous, the devs have no idea where they want the game to go and just make sweeping balance changes patch after patch, there is no direction and planned content for PvP and the endgame PvP community is gradually all leaving. PvE is getting stale and old and we aren't getting a new raid or arena for at least another year, plus the last 3 raids that were added were pretty much all mini ones. ZOS just caters to the casuals and doesn't care at all about the people who sink tons of time and effort into the game."
Negative,"Let's make expansions (Actually its just overpriced zone DLC with a few extra tid bits) for the sake of making more expansions and lets ruin the lore cause dragons are cool. Sigh... its WoW all over again.House customisation is cool but if you must continue to play ESO cause of friends or FOMO effect/money already sunk in then just play PvP in Cyrodill as everything else in this game is going towards a bottomless money pit rigged so that you continue to fork up real money over and over and over again (inventory even with eso+ is horribly limited, seasonal pass crap through the event merchant, over priced DLC... sorry I meant 'expansions', dragons when dragons shouldn't be showing up, horrible performance (even on high end machines game is a slug), crappy servers on a product advertised world wide but should only be limited to regions the servers are located in, most if not all new medium houses now being made premium currency only, restrictive and illogical furnishing limit on houses even when it doesn't make sense (a manor of relatively small size (Tel Galen) in Morrowind has the same exact furnishing limit as the massive mini Daedric realm sized Coldharbor manor house).I cannot recommend this game for new people and I must insist existing players avoid the lore breaking Elsweyr expansion which couldn't even get the capitol city of the region correct XD"
Negative,"This game was already technologically outdated at its launch in 2014, and today, it remains UNBEARABLY bad. Everyone points out the monetization and the content but game is worse beyond those:-Movement is slow and clunky.-Game has no verticality. Map design is horrible. You get stuck on everything. Invisible walls everywhere.-Not a real open-world. Instances inside instances. Every door you see = loading screen.-Game world, graphics and lack of player interaction makes the game feel dead.-You are GLUED to the TERRAIN. You cannot ESCAPE the TERRAIN. Jumping is USELESS. You can't hold/climb on edges, you don't have any tools/mechanic/skills to get over even tiny rocks, edges, hills on the map.-Physics do not exist in the game. There is no ragdoll physics either. Clothes/hair and everything else are stuck to your body. Corpses that you kill on edges just don't drop on the ground, they just stay on the air.-Interaction mechanic is designed to waste your time. Most of the time, interactions are linked to sheathing/unsheathing your weapon and your combat status. And most of the time if you want to interact with something, you gotta wait to be out of combat and to sheath your weapon. Everywhere you go is full of mobs so you are always in combat. You can't open a door in combat, since the game is not truly open-world, you are stuck in the instance until you kill that useless mob that doesn't give you anything. This wastes so much time it's unreal.-Another time waster is mounting/dismounting. Yeah mounting/dismounting animation is slow but the real problem is that mounting sheaths your weapon automatically. So you mount. You go to your quest or near a mob you want to kill. Naturally you dismount but now your character needs to unsheath again.. And sheath/unsheath animation is also slow. Plus if you are in combat you can't mount until you are out of combat. All these things on top of each other just waste huge amount of time an kills the flow and rhythm of the game.-UI and inventory ALONE can make you quit easily. You can't find anything in your inventory. It's an endless scroll to the bottom. In other games you can easily see all your items with an inventory that doesn't take your whole screen. In this game, when you press the inventory key, time freezes, an overlay takes over your WHOLE screen, your character starts looking at you. And even tho it takes all your screen to open your inventory, you still need to scroll down ENDLESSLY to see all of your items. You can't even fight/move and open/view your inventory at the same time. You can open it while you are moving but if you stop pressing the forward button, you can't move again without closing the inventory. And rest of the UI is pretty much the same. Group finder, quest log and EVERYTHING else opens an overlay that takes all your screen, you can't do anything else besides interacting with the menu that you opened.-If you wanna play ""Elder Scrolls Online"" and not ""Inventory Management Online"". You have to buy ESO+ for more bag/inventory space. If you don't have ESO+ you'll just have to destroy items from your inventory to pick up the new ones in the middle of the content. You'll also be constantly visiting a merchant to clear out your inventory.-Combat looks and feels weird. It is clunky, it relies on bar swapping and animation cancelling. Hitting has no weight behind it. It doesn't feel impactful to hit anything. Rotations are lame and boring. No matter what class/weapon you are using, your rotation looks the same with everyone else. There is no class identity. One class is spamming green spells, other is spamming yellow ones.-There is no feeling of progression because of the scaling.-There are 3 factions, 9 races. These factions and races supposed to hate eachother in lore. And they are at WAR. But that war doesn't exist in the game because there is no open world pvp and you can go to ""enemy"" faction zones do whatever the f you want.There are tons of negatives that I didn't cover but this must be enough for a steam review.TLDR: Playing this game feels like using a computer with a slow HDD and a slow internet. Everything is slow, clunky, boring, time wasting, OLD. Playing it makes me angry and gives me hypertension. So I made this review to cope with it."
Negative,"Before the review: I have played this game, on and off, since launch, but only purchased this again on Steam roughly 2 years ago--in that time I got the Explorer's Edition at Launch (for $60), bought the Premium version of HIgh Isle, the standard version of Necrom, and the game at a discount a third time.However, recently Zenimax has switched to an automod system in game that automatically issues warnings, reports, and even bans for foul language and dark themes in all channels, include private messages/whispers, group and party chat, and guild chat. If you curse periodically and/or engage in any form of Dark/violent RolePlay, I CANNOT recommend the game with this new feature, and considering that a big part of an MMO is the multiplayer, social, and community aspects, as well as a loyal minority who engage in roleplay, this is a big downside. I also cannot recommend the PvP in its current state, as by and large, the PvP community has frequently reported decreases in PvP battle size and quality, and there hasn't been any new PvP features since Arena--launched with Morrowind--or faction PvP since Imperial City.If you can get past this however--and for many this won't be an issue, who use out of game communication methods such as discord, steam chat, teamspeak (do people still use teamspeak?) etc.--then I can still recommend this in a few scenarios. Namely, you can get it for dirt cheap on sale, its gameplay is less stereotypically-MMOish, and has robust PvE support. If you want to play a semi-casual, easy to engage with, familiar, PvE MMO experience with small dungeon (4 player) and raid (16 player) groups, and with companions you can talk to, it's still worth it. But for my personal interests, I cannot recommend the game at this moment to any but the most casual players."
Negative,"So Ijust found out that even though I bought the game at full price now coming back to play the game again after taking a break it would be cheaper to make a new steam account and rebuy the game because morrowind still costs 30 dollars worth of in game currency... I bought the game at $60, in game currency morrowind is $30 dollars, if i buy the game right now its $10 bucks for the whole game and morrowind... Why am I wasting time and money on this."
Negative,"Huge shame that most of the DLC should already be included in the game, this is meant to be the whole of Tamriel but you need to buy the DLCs to get access to extra regions and you still don't have access to all regions, also why is dark brotherhood and thieves guild dlcs? Also the fighters guild and mages guild are much worse than even Skyrim.I once had an issue with the FPS and performance going down but an update fixed it, if you ever get issues, select the repair install option and update your if that still doesn't work.Another issue about the game is the PVP, it is pathetic. They said ""you can start at level 10"" and yes that is true, at level 10 you can join a battlegrounds or cyrodil but will you have a good time? probably not, why? because they will keep pairing you up with people who spend hundreds of hours grinding for the best gear so they can wipe you. In short, PVP is only good if you love grinding.05/11/2021 Ok Zenimax this is the last straw. Just downloaded their new end of year update and it is so buggy I can not even open my own inventory, and please stop resetting our champion points! Just give us a free token instead.Do not buy this game until Zenimax fixes their shit.15/02/2022New expansion does not look promising at all. The main highlight is a fkn card game (the last card game they made flopped, look on steam charts Elder Scrolls Legends).12/04/2022Just got 1000 hours on the game and i admit i do enjoy it and will keep playing it but this year is going to be a bad year for ESO, this new expac is subpar at best.03/07/2022New expansion is really nothing special. Big flop and noone is playing the card game.05/07/2022Somehow the game is getting LESS stable. Crashes used to be a once a year thing and now i get a crash each session. Good job ZOS.21/07/2022Pvp event is on and I had to update the game, now it's stuck on load screen :)08/09/2024Game is getting bit better now, the arcanist class is OP but really fun to play and actually feels different from other classes.Unfortunately ZOS is still missing so many opportunities. It was 10 years anniversary and all we got was a small event and another expansion that is mediocre at best. I wish they instead made bold decisions, maybe an expansion set in a zone that is out of Tamriel? Atmora even? Unfortunately this will never happen. This game will always be mediocre and its so sad because there is so much potential."
Negative,"The game itself is not bad, one of the best PVE i have ever played, and decent PVP (it can be a problem if you live outside NA or EU, they have no SA, African or Oceanic servers).The biggest let down is that this game can be insane costly. They have every type of monetization that exists out there; P2P, Subscription, Microtransactions, LootBoxes, EVERYTHING. Also the DLC are quite expensive in my opinion (or maybe i am just poor haha)If this does not hold you back from playing, give it a try, just don't expect it to be a Skyrim Online because it is not."
Negative,"Buys gold edition, doesnt get any new dlc's"
Negative,Launcher never updates properly causeing you to not be able to launch the game after they do an update every other week. Solution cancel ESO premium acct. and uninstall the game. Such a waste of money.
Negative,"The game requires over 160 Gb of Free Space to install. It first downloads 66Gb through steam and then requires additional 87Gb of free space to install itself through Bethesda's Launcher. Awesome! Biggest game ever in terms of space requirements!It is worth noting however that it doesn't actually need all that space, it actually downloads only 1-2 gb through the launcher but you need to have 87 GB OF FREE SPACE IN ORDER TO PROCEED WITH THE INSTALLATION ON TOP OF 66 GB ALREADY INSTALLED THROUGH STEAM. I don't know who worked on compatibility between Steam and their Launcher but they obviously don't notice the problem or just don't care. 80 Gb for a game is already huge, but to require twice that for the game to install (which it doesn't even use) is hilarious."
Negative,"I like the concept of the game. I love Skyrim and I love playing with friends, so this was a way to immerse ourselves in Tamriel and enjoy. However, the game has a problem with immersion, and it's caused by intrusive promotions and marketing.The game, the menus... They are all full of promotions, the latest event, daily rewards... I don't want any of that, I just want to dive into Tamriel and escape the world for a while. I get bombarded enough with information, advertisement and engagement tactics in my daily life, I don't need that in my free time.Also the base game (without DLCs) barely has any content, and the world is not really open-world, rather just a set of defined areas with  connections between each other."
Negative,"I am not the kind of person that would actually take the time to negatively and openly criticize a game, but this one got me thinking. It is pure evil. I have been into MMOs since i was a 13y-o back in 2007 (with many years put into being a hardcore wow player) and I have never seen a game like this before. I was in search of a nice (non-sub required) MMO to play since the gender is just going through a really bad phase nowadays and then I saw ESO was on sale and I bought it, I totally regret it and the reason is that I feel like I was fooled. I cant see why there is no way for me to buy all the freaking dlcs and be done with it, and I have to get a sub to be able to play the full game I already paid for. Anyway I paid just 21 euros for this one so I might just stay around for a while for the laughs but I would never recommend anyone to buy it. It is just sad."
Negative,Inventory Full. Inventory Full. Inventory Full. Inventory Full. Inventory Full. Inventory Full.
Negative,"I loved the character customization, but I think i went into this game thinking it would be as good as Skyrim and it was just, not. Perhaps higher levels are enjoyable, but getting through the lower levels didn't feel worth it to me. If you do decide to buy this game, I hope you go into it with an open mind and without expectations. That was my mistake."
Negative,"I played this game only for the campaign story. It is nicely delivered and very long (hence my high number of hours on record). Everything else is ""meh"".Every system this game has can be found better in other games. This is because the game creates problems for players only to sell the solutions for real money.Unless you like stories like me, i suggest you avoid this game."
Negative,"Are there things in ESO that make me play it? Sure.Are those things enjoyable? Not really! ESO often feels annoying and frustrating, not an experience I would recommend to anyone. I log in (almost) every day to claim ""rewards"". Usually those are crappy elixirs/poisons that I don't use. They cannot be sold. They cannot be converted to crown gems. Some can't even be placed in storage! I have thousands of those poisons accumulating in my characters' inventories. However, I must claim them to get one or two rewards at the end of the month that are actually worth getting. I also log in to fill in stores to not be kicked from my guilds. Are those enjoyable experiences? I don't think so. Inventory in this game has been BROKEN ON PURPOSE to force people to pay for subscription, which provides an infinite automatic bag for materials. If you don't have subscription... there are more materials than can possibly fit in any inventory. Only runes on their own (material for enchanting, which is only one of many crafting branches like woodworking or cooking) are so numerous that they cannot fit entirely in the inventory of any of my characters. Meanwhile, inventories are limited and there is no storage system like chests that you could place at your home (unless you pay for them with REAL MONEY). You can spend months grinding to get a storage chest for crafting writs, but then you won't be able to place it at your houses due to the annoying ""collectibles cap"", It would be great to actually be able to place stuff in the houses we have paid for!!! (you can double your cap if you pay for ridiculously expensive subscription with REAL MONEY, but even double is not enough for my liking. I hate those caps...)PVP in this game is completely broken. Don't even bother playing it. Dungeons are broken. They crash all the time. Character development makes no sense. My lvl 320 champion character DEALS LESS DAMAGE than a freshly created lvl 6 character... They belong to different classes, and character development DOES NOT increase the damage dealt by your character (at least not in an important, meaningful manner that would make anyone notice the difference between characters' levels). Leveling your char for months and being as weak as when you started feels very frustrating.There are no barber shops in the game. You cannot change your hairstyle! I'm used to being able to customize my characters much more in games. I'm used to the option of being able to change hairstyles by going to a hairdresser and paying with in-game money. In ESO, however, when you make a character, their make-up and hairstyle will be PERMANENT! (unless you pay for some ridiculous tokens with REAL MONEY, as if combing your hair was equal to changing your race and gender...)Quests are repetitive. Some quests are good, but most of the time the questing mechanics are annoying for me. There is a loooot of content in the game and this should be a positive thing, right? But instead, it is overwhelming, as quest givers will literally STALK you and FOLLOW YOU AROUND, initiating unwanted dialogue and forcing you to accept quests! BUT your quest journal has a CAP of 25 quests! While only the daily crafting writs will occupy 6 of those slots! So when you start playing, you will receive more quests than you can play or fit in your journal and thus get completely lost among the stories, not knowing what is going on. It would be great if I could choose the quests I want to do when I want to do them. I hate the annoying, pushy quest givers!!! I hate the quest cap in my quest log!!!The music is good. The music is really good. And the locations are beautiful. But, I can't marry my favourite NPC. Please, introduce an option for marrying NPCs.This game could be really entertaining and nice if developers listened to players and cared about ANYTHING ELSE APART FROM GRABBING OUR MONEY.the crafting bag should be free for everyone (or more storage chests allowed at houses), caps should be increased or removed. Bugs should be apologised for and fixed. Features players ask for should be introduced into the game. Then we would spend money on this game more eagerly (there are plenty other things to buy or subscribe to than the crafting bag) and we would feel happy about it."
Negative,"Update: Half of my hours was spent trying to reconnect.Going to get a Lot of hate for this but(Note: I will judge this game for what it is and not as a ""Skyrim MMO"")I tried to like it, I really did but... it's the most average mmo I have ever played so far.The Good:+Combat is Unique:It's basically ""Hidden"" tap targeting you point your crosshairs at someone and once at a certain range as long as your cursor is/was still pointing at your last target your attacks will auto hit it. It's decent but still there are no ""real"" projectiles in the game you shoot an arrow and ask someone you didn't target to pass by it or have an npc pass by it and nothing will happen. Anything will auto hit as long as your crosshairs are on it and it didn't dodge. (No planning out shots in advance +Wonderfull Graphics+Explore almost all of tamriel, Oh how I love the bretons and their knightly orders, morrowind and their nostalgic swamps, or the high elves and their beautiful architechture.+Classes do not limit you to a specific weapon, or armor typeThe Bad:-Leveling is Slow and Unrewarding:It would be fine if it was slow, problem is nothing is motivating me to progress any further than where I am now. It feels Like I've seen all the game has to offer halfway through leveling.-PvP Imbalanced: at level 20 with a Templar and I managed to take down 2 level 40's and a 30 on my own with just the Jab skill. I doubt that's intentional game balance.-Low RVR variety:Only way to experience RVR is the Imperial city, which means you will get outnumbered, and matched up with people higher and lower than you. (the scaling barely does anything against v16s)-Only way to RvR is through the Imperial City:This got stale real fast, I wanted to invade the Lands of the Pact, the Covenant, or the Dominion I can see NPCs do It, but we the players can't. (If your reasoning to this is ganking, add PvP flags or create more in world PvP zones.) -Limited number of weapons:I expected we would get, crossbows, spears, and throwing weapons, instead we got them as spells.-Any class , any weapon and armor type is an illusion:Expect to get rekt with the wrong weapon, armor, and class combination.-Boring story:This is just me, but I never really got close to the characters we played with. Plus I hate coming back to Coldharbour it's just so dull.-Biased Alliance quests:EP quests revolve around fighting AD, and DCDC quests revolve around, zombies, werewolves, and talking to ghostsAD quests revolve around cults.EP has the best quest so far that revolve around what ESO advertised on, the faction wars. Can't the other factions have those too? also if you want DC to kill merchants and farmers, let the players have quests that revolve around invading EP, missed a big opportunity there, to solve the lackluster RvR zones.-Limited exploration:you can't go to the other alliance lands unless you faction switch on a veteran rank.(Changed with latest Update, now it doesn't matter what Alliance you are you can walk anywhere you want)Overall it was fun in the beginning but it quickly got boring.UPDATE: Zenimax just announced that they will be releasing dlc's in small bits rather than in expansions ""This is all part of TESO's new focus on releasing smaller, more frequent bits of DLC, rather than waiting to unleash it in a massive DLC blob.""Cause they released a dlc called ""Shadows of the hist"" that contains only 2 dungeons for 1500 crowns (about 16$), Make of that what you will.(Another Note:Will edit this review per Major patch if anything changes.)"
Negative,THE LAG & GREED IN THIS PIECE OF BlTCHSHlT IS SOMETHING ELSE
Negative,There is no SEA servers so we gotta make do with 300 ping European servers. But its a pretty solid game with good storylines and quests. Will give a thumbs down for my bois in SEA.
Negative,"Through a paid subsciption crafting bag, Zenimax Game Studios is able to literally hold your dopamine points hostage by gutting any and all semblance of quality of life in this game to 0. They invisibly bait you through free DLC and crown points into a tight rope of either continuing to pay the subscription to stay upright and not fall, or not, and fall victim to their horrendous item management system as you spend more time fighting space limits than Molag Bal and his lackeys. Good luck trying to craft literally anything in this game with no crafting bag ya pleb. Those dreams of yours to become a master crafter? ""Tough luck kid you should have done this crafting shit years ago"", a phrase you'll be hearing in your head while you wait for those damned items to finish being researched.And even then it's just not worth the hassle with no crafting bag.With crafting bag the games a solid 7/10 dopamine points No crafting bag 0/10 dopamine points"
Negative,"I have been a subscriber for the nigh-entirety of my playtime on this game. With this high of a playtime, one could say I like to took a real liking to it.Yet, I have recently seen a series of extremely questionable customer care experiences, both first-hand and second-hand, and it is not going in the right direction since Microsoft took over. The spark is gone, and the bond of trust is shattered. All response to tickets are obviously handled by bots, and appeals to flags on the account are also handled by bots. It feels as whimsical as Facebook, and it is with great discontent that I leave this game, once a beacon of good times amongst friends, now become a steaming pile of kagouti droppings.It was worth it a while back. I discourage investment in the game from here."
Negative,"Really tried to get into this game. I was a huge fan of Skyrim and I love MMO's as well. But this game is simply made for the veteran players who first bought it when it was released. I spent endless hours grinding and leveling up my character I was above CP 400's when I quit entirely. My character was a DPS, I did so much research they were set up EXACTLY how it should be, yet my damage output was still a little low(I honestly didn't think it was too bad I just had room for improvement). The community sucks, its the reason I left the game tbh. When I was trying to run a new DLC and people in my group calling me out and insulting me because I was not doing enough damage and they all left the group. Like how do I spend so much time and energy trying to build a good character and still get treated like crap/get people who leave my group because I don't do enough? I dont want to play Fungal Grotto 1 for 500+ hours only to get beaten down when I try Fungal Grotto Vet AT CP 400!! I get that certain bosses have their mechanics but again its the damage I deal/take not with how im running the dungeons... There's much more I can say about availability of items/materials/outfits/locations but I'm sure its already been said. Just don't buy this game if you would be a new player, save your mental health and get a different game, trust me."
Negative,It took me over a thousand hours to realize this game is never going to make me happy.
Negative,without dlc its waste of time
Negative,"1,148 hours and many mixed feelings..General problems of the game have already been mentioned by @demiurgo.My comments are mostly on its combat system, as I have played the game generally in PVP without an ESO+ subscription.Firstly, I should say that the best part of the game is its almost complete freedom to customize your character's role and skill/set combinations in combat.However, these ""problems"" made the game unsustainable for me: 1- Top-down camera angle2- Weaving3- Combat speed which is almost impossible to react4- Restrictions on item sets1-) It might sound ""unorthodox"", but the camera angle of the MMORPGs from a godly perspective kills all the joy you could find in an ""RPG"" game. It depersonalizes your view and turns the game into a strategy game. And without fixing the camera angle to a more personal and close perspective for all players, setting your angle to such perspective only puts you at a great disadvantage.2-) The possibility and necessity to weave for optimal DPS turns the player into an automated spamming machine. Just focusing on weaving takes your all attention away from other more joyful and important aspects of the game and combat. I believe some could do all these simultaneously, but I doubt that they enjoy the process.3-) Though there is a great variety of character skills and combinations, they are by no means ""unique"" and impossible to ""react"" in the same way. Almost all of the skills take effect instantly. This makes any attempt to counter or block skills impossible. All of the evasive or defensive reactions are done mostly by guessing or as automatic and artificial reactions.4-) ESO also allows character customization through unique item sets. However, most of these ""unique"" sets are accessible only through either purchasing DLCs or an ESO+ subscription. Without either, you are left alone with narrow classic item sets, which creates quite an inequality between players.To illustrate the opposite of these aspects, I would use the examples of Skyrim, For Honor and Elden Ring. Integrating the strong aspects of these games into the ESO would make it an unforgettable epic game.Thanks."
Negative,"Dont buy it in steam, it only causes issues later so u cannot play it at some days (only if bought in steam).... it seems like they aint gonna fix it and that makes me kinda dissapointet. Got like 1300 h + in this game, its really good but steam is definitly the wrong platform for this. Bad Service and no response at all to this issue with steam platform, also nothing to compensete the loss of money i wasted on days i could not play compared to other people."
Negative,"Everytime I want to start the game it downloads Updates like 10 Minutes... I don't have a Problem if games like WoW do it but this is Steam, your playtime gets counted. Most time I ""played"" the game I just waited untill the updates finished. 0/10 would not update again..Just delete that dumb launcher and Update the game via Steam. Always a bad idea having a seperate launcher for a MMO title or Service game like Warframe or Path of Exile."
Negative,"This mmorpg plays about the same as every other mmorpg, only it tales about 5 times the disk space. does it have the feel of  say Skyrim or Morrowind? no. it gives little hints and tastes and easter eggs but don't let that fool you. these changes are basically skin deep only. As for crafting-the alchemy is pretty much the only one that seems to stay on point to the elder scrolls games. eat an ingredient to learn its first trait. nice touch. however, its got the feel of a cheap mmorpg where the focus is burn through everything as quick as you can with no real depth or stories. One other thing that did remain was the books. read enough of the right books and you can get minor bonuses.  way points, traveling, etc-just not as clean as the true elder scrolls game series. graphics are okay, but definitely not good enough to rank the CPU and graphics requirements it has. Honestly from the map, play style, and general feel, You may as well play any of the free mmorpgs that take a quarter of the space. i tried this with the hope i'd love it as much as the true series-with the full realization it is an mmorpg and would play like one, and wouldn't be entirely the same of course-and yet,  it still managed to disappoint. I had expected better of Bethesda, but then I saw who they partnered with for this one and my hopes  started to sink right then and there. then i tried it and yep-hopes dashed.  Summary: By all means, give it a try when its free to try out. You may end up quite enjoying it-each to their own of course. To my taste though which is that true open world experience where you don't feel confined to a particular quest line, where you can feel like taking your time if you like and making the experience truly your own  which is why so many of us fell in love with this series to begin with-then you may not enjoy it. If you have limited disc space and/or cpu/graphic constraints, you may also want to try another one. EQ2, Rift, LOTR online all have the exact (and I do mean, EXACT) same feel to this one and wont take nearly the space or requirements (in fact LOTR online crafting is actually the same and possibly slightly more in depth than this one is). EQ2 crafting is a built in mini-game style that I like, but many despise so try that one with a grain of salt."
Negative,"Currently it feels like the developers/higher ups are not worried about the state of the game. Balance issues have been building up and becoming worse each patch. removing mechanics that have been in the game for years makes it difficult to keep playing with random unneeded changes happening each patch. Constant grind every 2-3 months because they nerf hammered an items that was slightly better than other items. Higher ups  make fun of or belittle players and their criticisms of the companies changes to the game. I do not know if the have a plan for the game besides milk out as much as they can from the game before it The Elder Scrolls 6 drops. I have over 3000 hours on console and thought the recent servers changes were a bright light to the game but nothing really changed about balance philosophy and how they treat the players. Overall, I do not think it is currently worth what they ask if you want to spend decent time on the game. If you hop on once every blue moon them you might enjoy the game. MMO wise 0/10, casual rpg wise (repetitive stories) 2/10"
Negative,"even with ESO+ (subscription), there are often a 25 minute queue to join the game...."
Negative,"Never had a problem like this on a game. Once I had a buggy start in Black Desert Online, but the game worked. Ehm... ESO doesn't even connect to a server. After several times of restarting and trying, I was still unable to join a lobby. Was pretty hyped about the game, but it took a fast end..."
Negative,"Loved the ending! Reading other reviews some folks complain about the monthly pass price though, largely senior citizens it seems. I stand with them, the pricing model is unfair. For that I have to leave a harsh but fair thumbs down."
Negative,"I bought this to try, and the actual game installer counts as play time... and the game takes an hour to install. I'm apparently not the only person with this issue, and steam refuses to refund because its refund system is run by robots. Go fuck yourself steam."
Negative,"This is a fantastic game and I have spent over 2000 hours playing it and will play it for many more.But for the love of all that is holy do not buy it through Steam.Buy this direct from elderscrollsonline.com instead, at least you'll be able to play it when the Steam login fails again."
Negative,"Just got overwhelmed by the monetisation.Fired up the launcher - SALE, UPGRADE, BUY BUY BUYFinally get in game and not even on character selection - UPGRADE THIS, BUY THIS, GET THIS ADDONLet me play a little, decide if I like the game THEN I'll purchase something. But don't swamp me with that trash when I'm at 0 seconds played."
Negative,Clicking play on launcher and nothing happens. They can't fix it for 10 years. Also: b2p game with blackmail by forced subscription payment (playing without a craft bag makes no sense) + Item Shop with thousands of items.Stay away from this trash game.
Negative,"Game needs 66.6 GB to install, then when it's installed it suprises you by asking for an aditional almost 90gb of space. GJ, a 85GB game that actually needs around 150GB LOL."
Negative,"The game is great, so you should buy it, just not on steam EU cause of login issues for STEAM/EU. Get it directly from game developer instead. I can not recomend purchase on steam."
Negative,I would refund if i could
Negative,You hate micro-transaction? How about.... Macro-transaction!!
Negative,"This game is great but DON'T buy it on steam! Trust me, I'm doing you a favor. Get it from The Elder Scrolls Online website, you'll have much less hassle logging in and acually playing."
Negative,A micro-transaction front now with woke content on subscription. Enjoy!
Negative,"This game had some godly potential for pvp. And it was great for a while, but zenimax now focus on releasing dlcs and cosmetic items, both costing money go figure, and not fixing some huge server sided problems. What is the fun of having the best looking character if you cant really play and enjoy it?"
Negative,"To put it mildly - I was very surprised by the ZeniMax pricing policy. The price is 1399UAH (58 dollars) per GREYMOOR chapter, while in the American region it costs $ 39.99. It is commendable that the developers estimate the solvency of an ordinary Ukrainian as 50% higher than in the USA, but I certainly won’t buy it at such a price."
Negative,pretty boring game unlike skyrim or elder scrolls oblivionboring story line and literally no choices on how to do the quests(quests are linear)class system and weapon system is awfully limitedliterally no music or ambient sound in gamegame is locked behind a pay to win wall you need to buy banker cat or crow and stuff like that would cost like 40 euros(more than the price of game itself xD) but it gets even worse you also have to buy 'PLUS MEMBERSHIP' if you don't you have to pay extra for pay to win stuff xD like a costume would cost 500 crowns and with PLUS MEMBERSHIP its 250 crowns xDoh and on top of that your data is gathered up and sold to various 3rd party companies so xD
Negative,"The game is just full of microtransactions, 4 horses that you can purchase in the game with hard earned gold. To get a good mount pay like $15. If you want more characters pay for it."
Negative,"This game needs a OCE/Asia server, otherwise it would be good. Really disappointing"
Negative,"Don't buy this game form steam, servers are always down and zenimax don't give a flying fuck"
Negative,"The scaling system feels awful, I would have thought the developers would have got the memo from Oblivion it was a bad idea, but so far the game offers no feeling of progression, got incredibly bored getting into fights incredibly early. I'm defeating enemies and world bosses wherever I want in the world with absolutely no difficulty, I don't feel like I need any of my abilities.It doesn't help quests and delves aren't instanced. For instance, trying to play through a quest where I have to escort a tree spirit, which just amounts to me walking slowly alongside it because another player is running around killing all of the threats, and another quest I have to save villagers from a burning village, except other players have already saved them, so I'm waiting for them to respawn. The lack of instancing also leads to the frustration of finding a treasure chest, trying to figure out how the lock picking system works, only for somebody else to come over and take it from you.If nothing else, the game made me greatly appreciate how FFXIV handles simultaneous solo and group content in the form of it's FATE quests, where you can join quests in progress with other players in the world. Where they make me excited to naturally play alongside other players, in this game, it feels like other players are just getting in the way."
Negative,"Don't get me wrong, this is a great game that I enjoy immensely, as can be seen by my hours sunk into it. It has tons of content, lore, achievements, challenges both individually and as groups. It offers diverse choices to how you want to play, and even if there are some cookie cutter builds, you can manage fine without em. Everything feels open and free to chose how you wish to play it.  Unfortunately, such a great game is being ruined by poor hardware, lack of interaction with customers and severely questionable decision making. Weekly maintenance is initiated in the morning (for EU at least), is almost always extended, sometimes running for the full duration of the day. The PvP zone is a massive lagfest in anything but small skirmishes, loading between zones and instances can take a good minute for an average computer (and there's a ton of zone swapping). Major events are being launched on an already unstable server, fully ignoring pleas from customers that seems to understand the consequences of what they're planning better than the company. I've been playing this game since late 2016, and since I started playing, I've seen a lot of promises, but little results, so face the reality that this will most likely be how to game will be for you. If you're ok with the game being repeatedly unavailable/unplayable without any explanation or compensation, then yes, I absolutely recommend this game.TLDR: Great game, but shitty servers and a lack of customer interaction"
Negative,"Absolute pass. I thought I wanted a MMO version of the Elder Scrolls universe. This takes away everything that make the Elder Scroll great,"
Negative,"Dont get me wrong here, i love the game but for the love of god *DONT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM*"
Negative,"I tried on a free play event April 13-26. I can't run the game through steam. Tried repair from Steam, from ESO launcher but it doesn't work. Keeping having the error Unexpected Internal Error. So, then I went on research on forums to try other ideas and I was baffle with the amount of bad takes from ZOS. Eventually the way to run it involves not using Steam. So I figure it's not worth my effort even to play for free for a few days. If you buy, try to have it running as soon as you buy, so you can get your refund if it doesn't works for you."
Negative,"When I first got this game, I paid $60 to play it on my laptop that could run Skyrim perfectly fine. However this was not the case with this game. I could get to the login screen, and sometimes to the character selection menu, but after that it would never ever load into the game. This is the only game I've had problems with. After many hours of sitting around and finally getting in once, only to have it crash I gave up.Later on I decided to give the game a second chance. This time again after several hours, I finally managed to log in. The game seemed to run ok, despite the random frame drops. So in turn I put the graphics settings on minimum. This did not fix the issue. I looked around and the game didn't seem too bad. Eventually I give up on the slow game, who's controller scheme was absolutely horrid. Again I return to it another year later. I have a new PC with a new gen I7 and a 1080ti. Load the game onto my SSD, ready to try again on gigabit internet. Yes, finally, after spending an hour trying to figure out why the password reset page returned a 404 error, I managed to reset my password. I logged in. After several minutes I finally got to the character selection scene. So far so well, or is it? I see something, the corner of my eyes. ""Crowns"". This wasnt there before... I know for a fact when I got into the game near release there was nothing of the sorts. I'd need to pay to change my name. Pay to add a character slot. Pay to travel to a new area in the game. Guys, I paid full premium for what I was told would be a full game. I get into the game, still having the same lag spike issues. And to be quite frank the game does not look like its worth the 80 odd gb it takes up on my computer. I'd honestly have more luck from that much in malware. I tried to explore, but the game required more of a learning curve then any game should need. I just wanted to sit back in the couch and enjoy the game, but couldnt.The slowness, horrible controlls, introduction of a terrible pay to win/play system. It all contributes to me being seriously upset. All the previous games in the series were awesome. What's happened since then guys? Have you become so hungry for peoples money that you'd rather rip them off then make something quality? I dunno, I give up with this game and will be trying to find something thats a better use of my time and money for that fact. Goodbye poor old skyrim lovers..."
Negative,"#1 This is probably still a very good game if you are interested in just running around and exploring and doing the nicely voice acted quests and leveling a character or two to max level.  However if you have any desire to play an MMO ""seriously"", whether PvP or PvE Raiding, this is no longer a game I can recommend.The ZoS Combat Team treats this game like it is still in Beta, making huge game changing changes every 3 months.  This is a game that has been out for 8 years and the Combat Team is still making 40+% changes to base class skills that have been in the game since launch.  They use a Public Test Server to introduce changes then proceed to ignore everyone's feedback from the time they spend testing the game, again, for free.  The Combat Team and senior creative leadership are not only out of touch with the game and their customers, but are very openly and publicly antagonistic towards them.#2 The game's monetization is pretty heavy handed.  You have to buy the game, it is pretty hard to play without the monthly subscription, $40-50 chapters every years, a gross cash shop.#3 If you somehow still want to play this game PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT ON STEAM!!!!!!!!!  The ESO and Steam log-in servers have conflicts way too often, it feels like monthly.  Steam users can't play the game but anyone who goes through the normal ZoS log-in server is able to log in fine.I have al least another 1000 hours in the game since I figured out how to bypass the Steam launcher for the game."
Negative,"Well I was enjoying this game untill about a month ago. Suddenly trying to update the game leads to the launcher freezing and crashing. Each and every time. Have tried numerous fixes. Reaching out to the customer service folks only gets canned responses. I am not the only one suffering from this issue.Edit:The problem has sense been resolved. However, it did require me basically wiping and reinstalling windows to fix the issue."
Negative,How to waste your life.
Negative,I am glad I only wasted $6.00 on this game.
Negative,The lack of storage space basically forces you to subscribe and the prices in the crownstore are absurd with most things costing at least 15euro
Negative,"Please visit help.elderscrollsonline.com because you can not sign in. Sorry you just downloaded 300gbs but our servers are actually trash. Also, you can't sign into the help desk.Edit: To sign into the help desk I had to turn off my adblock. Still can not sign into the game."
Negative,"It was my favorite game because I made so many nice friends and had lots of fun on it however the game has been on a decline for years. The pvp servers are always laggy to the point you can't cast skills. They have a predatory ""crown store"" designed to drain your pockets empty. Its not p2w but they do everything to make your f2p experience feel trash. Every new patch they nerf all the old sets and when you finally farmed the new ones and adjusted to all the changes another patch comes around and your gear you just farmed is not meta anymore. On top of that they have a really aggressive ToS that will get you banned for the most silly things. The game can be fun to play, especially with friends. I had a lot of fun but I can't recommend sinking in thousands of hours in 2022. Its just a moneymaker for Zenimax and they don't care about the players one bit."
Negative,"Used to play this game a lot, enjoyed it a fair deal...but I'm tired of the developers having half-baked excuses such as 'accessibility' for some of their badly implemented changes to classes and game mechanics, more-so when it has no beneficial impact therein. More recently, blatantly ignoring most player feedback under the framing of ""it is anecdotal"" when many of the players providing feedback are spreadsheet enthusiasts that math everything out. They eventually did a tiny backpedal due to the economic whiplash from their PTR changes for the upcoming update, but it just isn't enough.I stopped playing months ago, was tired of change for the sake of change. Tired of the developers not addressing clear problems. Tired of them not listening enough to player feedback.Can't recommend. Instead, try playing games where people who actually play them have an impact on development in some fashion.Much later addition: came back to see if things changed...nothing changing to the above, but an additional failure: the game reducing the game's resolution every time it is started...cumulatively. Then throw in the game replacing the settings file if it's set read only for an extra slap in the face. I had to go so far as to deny anyone and everyone modify access to the settings file in the operating system, to fix this issue...rather disappointing."
Negative,"I keep losing my connection from the servers. If that wasn't bad enough, the launcher frequently becomes convinced that all the game's files have disappeared and need to be downloaded all over again, which can take hours. I'd estimate that a third of the time I've spent playing the Elder Scrolls Online has been downloading it over and over again. While the game is fun when it works properly, it's not worth putting up with all that."
Negative,"Elder Scrolls (ES) is a series that is very well-known, foremost because of Skyrim, which has sold 20 million copies. I was hesitant to get Elder Scrolls Online (ESO), primarily because I'm not a fan of MMOs. However, some of my friends already owned the game, so I caved to peer pressure. In retrospect, my initial reservations were well-founded, because this title certainly won't change anyone's opinion on MMOs. Despite the different genre, this release still uses ES as a basis, so there's familiar aspects for those who have played any of those games. For instance, harvesting plants, traversing large areas, and earning experience even outside of combat, by doing things like crafting. It folds in MMO mechanics with things like dungeons made for groups of people, instead of being something you can take on alone. There's also guilds, trades, gifting systems, and enemies respawn very quickly. I don't find it that satisfying to kill foes that pop back up within minutes, like I'm trapped in an annoying NES game.Even though you can find hidden objects, and they have a purpose, I didn't find them very interesting. If you discover three skyshards, you unlock a skill point, but what the heck are they? By contrast, I preferred finding things in Skyrim, as I'd have several quick travel spots to explore on my map. Unless you already know what the area has in store for you, a map marker could catch you off guard, and unravel into an hours long expedition. With ESO, these don't tend to take very long. Go to the dolmen, and fight a short wave of enemies. Find the skull, and fight the area boss. Despite having different markers on the map, they don't really feel distinct from one another. As an analogy, it's sort of like killing random dragons in Skyrim, but you don't even get to learn a new shout for your effort.With many attacks and abilities being locked behind cooldown effects, instead of something you can use freely if you have the magic and stamina for it, the game is geared for keyboard controls. However, I'm pleased to say the controls work just as well on a controller. Something to keep in mind is that what equipment you have on can lead to different effects, if you unlock the skill sets from a few different trees. It takes time to get used to, and you have to choose only a few skills at a time, but I think it works fine.Much like other ES releases, the storyline falls out of existence pretty quickly, unless you go out of your way to focus on it. All I remember about the for this title is something to do with an incorporeal aspect to reality because of some big bad capturing an important NPC? It was only shown in the opening area, and despite putting a few dozen hours into this MMO, I hadn't seen anything else that even acknowledges this is happening. I'd guess ESO maintains the lore as already established in the ES series, but it's so cumbersome, I wouldn't know enough to tell either way.The visuals are tolerable, but considering the memory required for ESO, and the game's large budget, I'd expect it to look much better. Also, this game was released three years after Skyrim, yet nothing would suggest it has the advantage of coming out later. I compared images of both games side by side, and don't see significant differences in backgrounds, objects, character models, attack animations, or spell effects. It's true that they look different, but I wouldn't say they've improved. Also, you have to keep up with mandatory updates to play the MMO, and it still looks like this.There's several songs in the game, and I'd admit that they're well composed. I am a sucker for orchestral music though. Considering how many hours you'd expect to spend in an MMO, it's nice that they put in so many tracks, which would help the tunes from getting stale. That's something I look for in longer games. Regarding the sound effects, I have little to say about them, as they serve the job well enough. 🌟 Playing the game doesn't require a powerful internet connection. A big downside though, is that downloading and updating ESO sure does, or at the very least, takes a long time.🌟 Consistent playing is rewarded. There are progressive rewards for playing every day in a row, and you can buy horse upgrades once a day.🌟 I didn't encounter toxicity, until I posted my review. :)🌟 There's plenty to do, even in the base game. ❌ Playing with friends feels stilted. Though I've played with them a few times, we don't maintain a consistent group, and have to re-invite each other to play together. Each of us has to do all the actions of completing a quest, instead of working towards the same goal. It's a single-player experience that takes place at a crowded theme park.❌ There is a bank, and you can upgrade your inventory space, which takes a lot of money. However, with all the possible crafting to do, it's very constraining. Between enchanting, cooking, potion-making, fishing, etc., you'll run out of room fast, meaning you'll have to ignore some of these activities until later.❌ Enemies are spaced apart superficially, so you'll engage them in small groups of two to. I found them to be tanky, because even when you knock them over, taking several free hits, it takes a long time to get the kill.🔍 Before even starting the game, you should figure out what kind of character you want to play, and refer to a guide. Otherwise, your build will be subpar.🔍 You'll get more by playing for a short time every day, than once a week for several hours.I know some people don't like that I'm comparing ESO to other games in the series. However, when using the same IP, you invite that comparison and criticism, right or wrong, for better or worse. Also, despite not playing for the obscene amount of time other people have, I still experienced enough to provide a review of my experience. Why would I stick with a game for 100+ hours if I don't like it? Because it might actually become a fun game, if I dedicate another 50 hours first? Why stop there, when I could invest 500 hours, just to be sure I actually hate it.ESO is very popular, but I wouldn't recommend getting it, at least if you're like me, and don't find MMOs compelling. From my perspective, this game has a lot of volume, yet lacks any depth. It doesn't have the fun factor, or sense of adventure, I'd want from a fantasy game. The developers have made changes, trying to address some of the criticism it's received, but their focus is to appeal to those who already enjoy what's here, not those who aren't convinced it's a great release. If you're one of the 20 million people that already has Skyrim, just play that game instead. Your gaming device will appreciate saving all that data."
Negative,"Massive LAG, Grindy, money grabber with those must buy DLC and subscription, unbalance, boring. I felt scammed buying this game after realizing that i've pass the 2 hour threshold because downloading the game in the game launcher is counted as playtime."
Negative,"The Elder Scrolls: Every 90 days we are going to absolutely crush any fun you’ve been having by nerfing existing gear so you’re forced to pay for the newest content and run along the gear treadmill Online.EDIT 1/2/2023: It appears that now they are aiming for every 180 days, rather than 90. How generous of them."
Negative,"Environments and story is good. But level scaling makes all fights dull and it doesn't make you feel stronger when you level up. This is really disappointing, I have no wish to continue."
Negative,great potential ruined by horrible company and unbearable combat style
Negative,"Good game, but don't buy it on steam. 5 out of 7 days of the week you will probably have login issues at some point."
Negative,"I tried to play it during a free weekend, but after Steam installed it it only started another installer, not the game.I looked it up and apparently it's an old bug they never bothered to fix and there are files missing. You can download the missing files from helpful people that posted them on the internet to download, but come on...Why even bother with a promotion if you don't care enough to get your product to even a minimal useable state out of the box?"
Negative,"So I own the basic version of this game and found out very quickly the most basic guilds such as Dark Brotherhood and Thieves guild are extra DLC to be purchased by Crowns or by their subscription fee membership. This is unacceptable and I can't play this game due to how much of a money grab this game is. Those guilds I have mentioned have been in every single ES Game to date. Why would I pay extra cash for something that should be included in the base game. When I saw the sale for all the dlc's it was only for the major DLC packs. Not the other DLC's that they charge ridiculous amount of money for. I refuse to pay for Plus Membership when those kind of DLC's should be in base game. Maybe for the extra Dungeons but that is a joke.  Bethesda_Rionstrom  [developer] Posted: Mar 12 @ 11:38amHello,Thank you for taking the time to review The Elder Scrolls Online. We are glad that you have enjoyed the game's systems and mechanics and have had fun playing so far. We understand your concerns about the cost of additional content within the game and would like to provide you a few ways to make the most of your money.One of the most affordable ways to get access to the DLC content is with an ESO Plus Membership. For the price of 1500 crowns, you will get access to all DLC game packs for the duration of your membership. In addition, you will gain many benefits including unlimited storage for crafting materials, double bank space, and 1650 crowns to spend in the Crown Store each month.If you do find that you can not afford the price of the membership each month, you can use the crowns from previous months to unlock DLC permanently so you will always have access to the content you enjoy. You can get the first four ESO DLC packs for one bargain price with the Guilds & Glory DLC Mega-Pack. This DLC bundle that includes the Imperial City, Orsinium, Thieves Guild, and Dark Brotherhood DLC game packs.The best way to gain access to all the Chapters in ESO is by pre-purchasing the newest Chapter: Greymoor. This purchase includes The Elder Scrolls Online base game, Greymoor, Elsweyr, Summerset and Morrowind Chapters. This will give you access to all of the existing main story content and major zones today and the Greymoor chapter when it releases.We hope this information helps you find a way to gain access to the content you are most interested in so you can continue to enjoy the game. Again, thank you for providing your review of the game.Warm Regards,The Elder Scrolls Online TeamI saw this as a response from Bethesda Dev and this is what I am talking about. They think that those prices for those basic DLC that is in the core of every single Elder Scrolls game to date should be charged extra. Sorry no. Not Acceptable answer and one that will once again keep me away from playing this game. This is the kind of conduct that is downright horrible for a company to do.I wish I had refunded this game but I can't. I tell everyone this with the prices they are charging for all those extra DLC's and the fact that some core elements of every Elder Scroll game is missing unless you pay subscription fee or insane amount of money of crowns is not justifiable excuse. I tell everyone to stay away from this title.Recently I just seen Bethesda as a whole become more and more greedy and its sad to see a once well known and good company fall so low. Between the release of Fallout MMO and more recent releases of other games and so forth, I lost faith in this company.Update: April 17th, 2020Sadly for those who telling me to play WoW I already tried that and it got boring fast. And how is it entitlement when the most basic stuff that has been in every title in previous games. And don't give me that excuse its an MMO and has tons of stuff already. The core parts of the game I play are those two factions. Being an MMO it better have the most basic factions in the game that have been in every past title. No excuse to not have it. More excuse to ensure it has it.For someone who works quite a bit and doesn't have time to play a game like this all the time its not worth paying for. So I avoid it now at all costs. Games like GW series I played but oh man, got boring really fast. I mean super fast.This game definitely has very good content and I will repeat its amazing they did similar to SWOTR by putting audio for every npc and dialogue. I know there is insane amount of content but in order to get best experience it seems like you have to dish out a ton of money for simple things like Thieves Guild or Dark Brotherhood. The costs for those expansions yes, that is definitely 100% reasonable. And I hear from many ppl that in order to play this game with decent amount of fun is to pay subscription. I have decided no online game is worth paying subscription for. And the way this game is handled it pretty much charges a hella lot of money that I seen ppl claim there isn't that much content."
Negative,"There's an insanely annoying bug that prevented me from trying this game during the free weekend that you should know about before attempting to install:After Steam downloaded 80 gigabytes of game files, the installer required me to free up another 87 gigabytes of space for a total of 167 gigabytes of free space. The installer doesn't even need this space because the final install uses slightly less than 80 gigabytesIf you have limited bandwidth or a low amount of space in your HDD, I wouldn't reccommend attempting to install this game until this MASSIVE oversight is looked into (this probably won't happen though because the bug has existed for almost a year now)."
Negative,"Now THIS is a true scam of extraordinary proportions. I paid for most DLC as they came out, thinking that I would have access to that content and play it, if I did not care about the extra perks the monthly subscription gave me. How wrong was I. Soon Bethesda figured out the trick with the ingredients bag. Basically when they took away the ability to use the ingredients bag without an ESO+ subscription, they made all DLC unplayable. Without the ingredients bag, the game becomes an inventory management nightmare. People have alts just to use as a chest to try to get around this problem. All the money I spent on DLC is now money thrown out the window, because I can not play any of the content I paid for without ESO+, but with ESO+ I have access to that content anyway. Needless to say, this was the last straw for me. I am done with Bethesda. This is the last dime they saw from me. I have thousands of other games to play."
Negative,"This is more of a review of my associate than the game.Do NOT buy a game that Joey Macaroni recommends to you under the guise that he will play said game with you. He has the attention span of a chipmunk and only knows how to play Smite. Sadly, I was the victim of such circumstance with this game."
Negative,"I played this when it came out on xbox, played for 5 years then re-bought it on pc when it was on sale. Its changed a whole lot mostly for good but when it comes to the pvp its pay to win. paywalls for the best antiquities, the dungeon sets also paywalled. Theres still some decent sets out there but no contest when it comes to the new stuff. Impossible builds with no sacrifices will beat you. On top of that the macros people are using are insane. I also dont care for the add ons. Dont get me wrong I loved this game but in its current state and what its become I wouldnt recommend it for anyone interested in pvp mmos."
Negative,"Installer have been so bad designed. You need 167 GB (79,3+ 87) on the same filesystem, just to be able to extract install files?Without an option to extract it to other location? What a mess. @Zenimax, fire that guy!"
Negative,this should be a free game
Negative,Bethesda be like: let our players get game time from playing < let our players get game time from waiting in the launcher for the game to download and update
Negative,"This is an extremely consumerist and time consuming game.To begin with, many people would choose to buy this game because they've played either TES: Morrowind, Oblivion and/or Skyrim (such as myself). So you might google a bit of information about the game's basic story, in which era its located, etc. and decide to go for it and simply purchase the game.The amount of quests is simply staggering. Every single one of them is COMPLETELY voice acted. It's insane. There's a reason as to why the game weighs 100GB; there is actually so much content, so many quests, different armors, areas, sheer amount of voice lines. A quick google search shows that the game has over 150,000 different voice lines. That's an incredibly big number. However, do keep in mind that a lof of quests are random farmers that need help clearing a mine of enemies, priests that want you to recover certain holy objects, etc. There are 'main' quests such as the actual main quest of the overall game that you unlock as you level up, along with several secondary yet 'main' quests. For example, the main quest of the base game is about your character and how Molag Bal wants to basically do the same thing that happened during the Oblivion Crisis, merge an oblivion plane with Tamriel, but the main quest of the Morrowind DLC is about how you help Vivec discover why he is losing his divine power. The game is absolutely worth it if you want to play it exclusively for the storytelling.If you want to play this because you like MMORPGS, well, then go ahead. The game scales you up so a player level 1 is as strong as a player level 160 (soft cap). You can take any bosses, go to any dungeons and complete the same quests as everyone else with absolutely any players you want to. The game is not excessively grindy either.However, what makes me give this a negative review is how consumerist and time-consuming this game is. You'll spend hours and hours doing quests just so you can get skill points to upgrade your character. This game has an alliance war which is pretty awesome, it's like a full on war between 3 different sides, it's incredible to see 30 players setting up trebuchets while the other side defends from the top of their castle. Did I mention the war is 10 minutes of doing absolutely nothing while you travel from side to side because your horse is so slow, and 2 minutes of actual gameplay if you're with a lot of players? Oh, but you can pay with a small amount of gold in-game to upgrade your speed! But you can only upgrade its speed, stamina or carry capacity by 1% per DAY each. Ah, but you can pay with real life money to upgrade it instantly!This is what makes me give this game a negative review. Let's view at what the subscription of the game , ESO Plus, unlocks ($150 dollars per year, 1/3th or MORE of the average monthly salary where I live, in Mexico. It's ridiculously expensive):-Full access to DLC areas and quests: This one is not that bad and the money might actually be worth it because this alone is worth thousands of hours of gameplay, but why does it have to be a subscription? Unless you can play, and are willing to, play this game for 10 hours a day for an entire year, you'll have to be subscribed for several years to fully explore all the quests and dungeons.-Double inventory space: This one is straight up stupid. There will eventually be hundreds of crafting materials, armor, potions, etc. in your inventory at once. You can slowly make your storage capacity bigger but for a really big amount of gold per upgrade. Doubling the inventory space for 'free' just by having the subscription is a privilege you should already have by simply purchasing the game. Be ready to spend 3 hours looking at your inventory and analizying what you should throw away and what you should keep.-Craft bag: Crafting materials are by far what take the most inventory space out of your character. This bag has a literally unlimited amount of storage where every single one of your crafting materials will go as long as you have the subscription active. Same as above. This one should NOT be locked behind a paywall.-1650 crowns per month: the game has a crown store when you can purchase cosmetics, pets, different 'horses', etc.. but 1650 per month is crumbs compared to the prices of everything the store. 1650 crowns is nothing.-Bonus EXP, gold, etc.: this one is stupid, you're paying to make the game easier.Those are the main things that ESO Plus unlocks. Limiting what the player can carry so they buy the subscription is straight up stupid. The base game is fine for the story telling but that's it. There are so many basic things locked behind a paywall such as the ""crown store"" in which you pay with extremely expensive ""crowns"" (just go look at the prices on the steam page), additional inventory space, and many others. Do not buy this game if you don't know how to manage your time. This game will consume it all. The only ""elder scrolls"" thing about this game is the story."
Negative,"This is essentially a standardized World of Warcraft style 'theme park' MMO with an Elder Scrolls skin.  That's worth 5 or 6 points on a 10 point scale, and if that were the end of it I'd simply refrain from reviewing this at all, because I love Skyrim, Fallout, and the rest of Bethesda's open world games, and I could chalk this up as an experience that simply isn't intended for me.However, I've been playing MMORPGs since Everquest and never have I had such an odious experience with a customer service department.  My Steam account got linked to the wrong ESO account.  I contacted ESO customer service through their web form - there is no other way to contact them, in or out of game, no phone number, no email address, just a web form that won't get you a reply until several days later.  Long story short, after 2 months and 6 outright dismissals of my CS ticket ESO CS has still been unable to fix this issue.  They refused to so much as pretend to try until I escalated the issue repeatedly, then blew smoke up my ass for another 2 months until I gave up and quit playing their game entirely.So that's the main issue here - in a game where you may invest months or years of your life building up a character or a guild, that complete lack of customer service is simply unacceptable.  However, that's not the only issue.ESO lacks major convenience features that make the MMORPG genre work.  For example, despite an extensive crafting system - not a deep or nuanced crafting system, mind - the game does not have anything resembling a central marketplace.  Instead individual guilds rent out merchants, and in order to access the things those particular guilds have put up for sale you have to physically travel within the game world to speak with the merchant they've rented.  If you want to put something you've found or purchased up for sale, the game dictates that you have to seek out and pucker up to the right asses on your particular server in order to join the proper merchant guild.This is coupled with a combat system that lacks interactivity to such a degree that the fight is either completely over in the blink of an eye or devolves into 'hold block while your allies shoot, then shoot while one of your allies blocks'.  Progression is boring because combat is boring - getting new skills does little to aleviate the repetitive nature of combat in an MMO where you only have 8 skills to use at once and most of them are limited by cooldowns or charge mechanics.If all you have is an XBOX then perhaps ESO is the game for you.  If you're on a PC, however, there are a hundred better options - Final Fantasy XIV, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Guild Wars 2, World of Warcraft and Neverwinter are all tangibly, measurably better products than ESO."
Negative,"According to the complaints on the user forums, the game maker ended support for modern Macs in August. https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/615494/game-wont-launch-on-mac-since-update - my new Macbook Pro with an M2 processor is not supported. The game tries to launch and then crashes. It appears that you need to own an old, Intel-based Mac to run this game. Steam should remove this game from the store as it is no longer supported on new machines."
Negative,"Installed it 4 times now, will not load to play because the host window times out.  Contacted Steam Support 5 days ago asking for their help - surprise surprise, they haven't replied.  Reading the forums, many others are experiencing this same problem with no resolution. My advice is stay clear and check the forums until a solution is offered."
Negative,"If you're going to buy ESO, do not, DO NOT buy it through Steam. Steam's login servers for ESO go down A LOT. ZOS's response has always been 'we're looking into it lol' and that's more than Steam has ever done.No compensation, no fixes, no apologies. Just don't bother. Buy a physical copy or one through Bethesda or ESO net. Or buy another MMO. Just please don't fund this broken disgrace of a port."
Negative,"imagine buying this game, downloading the 135gb then you got to download a fucking launcher that is 20gb when you press play, then you have to download 96gb more of shit when the previous download is finished, only to play the game and it says internal error, over quarter of a terabyte for this shitewhilst at the same time fucking steam is counting this bullshit as actual playing time so after all this, you can't refund this fucking bullshit because you've gone over 2 hours"
Negative,"Before you start hating on me just yet, please do note that im just trashing the steam version of ESO. For what reason you ask? Well allow me to explain. I was looking forward to try that weekend trial that some times steam ESO does, just to be sure if it was worth purchasing the game itself before i wasted any money on it. I still am very convinced that this is a very good game, specially for the MMO genre, not to mention unique. However, im giving this shitty rate due to the fact that on this weekends trial, steam tried to force me into downloading over 160 gb of folders for ESO, when the official website download version of it only requires, and asks, for 60 gb of space on your computer (something that i have checked with other people and friends that have the game). I can't possibly figure how on earth and what on earth am i/have i downloaded into my computer, but as a long time player and active member of many MMO communities, no game, has ever asked nor required 160 gb. Even if i was having access to its expansions, it could've reach 100 gb, but no more, and i myself think that its already an exageration. Please get that fixed, explain me the reason or simply compress the folders into something way, but WAY, smaller.EDIT: It has been pointed out to me that this insane amount of space that the steam version of ESO takes, is fairly knowned by the community and recognized by the very same as in matter of fact a bug. I have been suggested 2 different ways of fixing this in order to keep the actual amount of space that the game requires, yet, even though the launcher problem has been fixed (wich i really am appreciated about) now it asks me to patch the game. This as being an MMO made perfect sense to me, as it's a normal thing for most MMOs and other games out there and i am conscious i would have to abdicate a few more gb in order to play, YET, i have exactly 53 gb free and the launcher still insists on me not having enough space on the computer to patch the game.I am quite disappointed on saying so but, long story short, the uninstall button worked perfectly!"
Negative,"After about 5 years on Steam, this is my first review which tells alot about how fucking bad this game is. I have been an Elder Scrolls fan for about 3 years. I played Skyrim on the PS3 and on Steam. I found that Skyrim was probably the best game that existed at the time, until I heard of the Elder Scrolls Online. I got so  hyped for the game. I didn't by any extra packages though. In my mind, the thought of having an Elder Scolls game in a MMO made me so excited. As soon as it arrived on Steam, I bought the game. The fact the the game came with 30 Free Days and that it was half off was an irresistable deal. I downloaded it and began to play. What I found made my eyes bleed.From the start, the game seemed good. It was beautiful. Then I went to recieve my first quest. The new UI was very unlikeable. The new format was terrible, and the fact that there is always a Goodbye text as an option at every discussion gets a bit annoying. Then as soon as I level up, I want to increase my character's atribute points. The new skill system is very unlikeable. I just doesn't have a Elder Scrolls feeling.Next thing to talk about is the quests. This quests are so quick and the payout is terrible. Monsters drop 1 coin and Bosses drop two. The payouts for a quest is usually 170 coins. The costs of a Low Grade Bow is about 450. Not worth it.I could go on for hours listing what is wrong with this game. In general, the main reason why nobody likes this game is because it doesn't feel like an Elder Scrolls game. It's as if someone beat the shit out of Skyrim, ripped it apart, and tryed to reassemble it with 5 of the inital 1000 pieces, improvising for the lost 950 pieces.It's dissapointing."
Negative,"Do I like this game?Yes, it can be quite fun.Would I recommend buying this game?No.Most of the quests are copy pasted stories with meaningless and menial tasks. The enemies are, frankly, too difficult if you don't have the exact specific builds that are overpowered in the game. The most meaningless mob can take more than a minute to complete even past max level. Oh, and you have to pay the full price of the game each time a new DLC comes out. Don't forget the 140 you'll have to pay for the rest of the DLC.Edit and Correction: I don't mean that combat is difficult and I keep dying, I mean it in the sense that it just takes too long when you don't use a particular build to kill basic mobs. I tend to avoid fights due to that fact. Requiring group play, however, is not my favorite part of the game.The worst part?The unfixed connection issues.Their servers are TERRIBLE. You will frequently disconnect, and when you contact the ESO help? They'll keep giving you things YOU can change. The fault can't be theirs, contrary to the fact that you know your internet is perfectly fine. It's sad, frankly.Edit: Recently, the connections have been getting a lot better, so kudos to the developers for that."
Negative,"A little dull and uninteresting for a single-player experience and too disconnected from other players' experiences to feel like a multiplayer experience. That said, I own it, and I have a few friends who play it who enjoy it mildly... so I'll reluctantly play it from time to time.If you don't have a MMORPG to play and want a good one, look at Guild Wars 2 instead. Guild Wars 2 is a lot more fun combat-wise and has a more fine-tuned questing system than ESO. ESO doesn't have as social of an experience and feels very slow-paced, but it has a more Elder Scrolls feel, obviously, so if you just want to pretend to live in Morrowind, it's still somewhat worth picking up... just play Morrowind first tho, if you haven't already."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THROUGH STEAMI bought this a week ago (and spent an entire day downloading/installing).  I enjoyed the game itself but haven't been able to log in all day and there has been zero communication about the issue other than a standard ""We see there's a problem and are looking into it.""I've played MMO's off and on for quite awhile and I've never seen an outage go on this long with this little communication.I'm advising against buying on Steam because non-Steam players don't seem to experience this what seems like a weekly issue.The game itself is fun though, a little grindy for crafting materials but, what mmo isn't?"
Negative,"Doesn't seem particularly friendly to players who just want to go it alone without the social features. Some key story quests aren't possible for soloists. WANT to like it, the housing design is awesome, but it just doesn't feel as player-friendly as other MMORPGs"
Negative,"So after 405 hours in this game on pc.. plus the 1000 hours i spent on console.. This game feels like a chore more than a fun game, logging in every day to collect daily rewards and doing daily crafting writs.. and on top of that the devs center the game around armor sets, on set might be really good for a few months then they nerf it into oblivion and the journey to find another good set starts again.. crafting in the game is garbage and require way too much time investment to level it up. and its extremely difficult to make gold in this game.. overall not a FUN experience.. if the devs would listen to their playerbase this game would be a million times better!!!"
Negative,"The thing that really annoys me about eso is the fact that they set up the stories to be ""you are the chosen one! Only you can save us!"". I wish they'd cut all that because it really takes away from the immersive-ness since we all know that everyone else on the game are getting the same quest and are also the ""chosen one"". I'd be perfectly happy to be just a regular citizen that has to rise up in ranks through skills and given quest that would make sense in an mmo setting. This makes it hard for me to get into any of the story lines of this game, I just end up skipping through dialogue which is something I never or rarely do in elder scrolls games, because it just feels like I’m going through a haunted house in the carnival, it’s all “fake”. Half the time I have no idea what is going on in a quest, I just know I gotta kill the boss at the end, or retrieve some stuff, or burn some stuff, and I just end up grinding through quest to level up, rather than being fully immersed in the story line. It’s just… so boring. I think the reason why is because as someone who does only pve it’s just feels like I am doing the same thing over and over again, and with no story line to be invested in, it gets old quick. It’s not for me."
Negative,"The gameplay is not fun. You can't drop items and the game launcher needs to download an extra 30GB of data that is counted as gameplay. So, if you don't like the game, but you spend 12 hours downloading an extra 30GB patch through the launcher, you are unable to request a refund even though you never played the game. This is, by far, the worst steam experience I've ever had.Oh, since I couldn't return it, I poked around in the crown store. The ESO bundle has about 100 different DLCs, so if you want to pay it all, ahem, PLAY it all, it's going to cost you LOST of moneys. I bought Graymoor, which I thought would include a bunch of DLC content, but it only includes ONE DLC... there are still hundreds left. Finally, I play as a ranger, you can't hold your bow. What the heck is up with that. When you pull your bow, it just fires, you can't draw and sneak like in Skyrim. That's the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back. A ranger who can't sneak with a drawn bow is the deal breaker. I'd probably like the game if that one mechanic were included correctly. Guess it's back ot Skyrim. I'll do a trophy run of the Special Edition on my Youtube channel all the while griping about how horrible ESO is."
Negative,"I don't know what it is about this game, it has everything I want from a good MMO but it feels like it has no progression. It's so weird, the combat feels all the same and that there's no challenge. If you like MMOs you should definitely give this game a try at the very least"
Negative,"Beware. Troubleshooting the launcher, updating or repairing the game at launch, could take you up to 2 hours, that's 2 hours of playtime, so you won't be able to refund the game later if you want. I've spent so much time just trying to get the game to start while my playtime increases."
Negative,"The game seems great. Some of the story stuff is really well written and the voice acting is surprisingly good. The combat is fun, though much jankier than some similar games. All in all, I'm having a good time playing it, but I simply can't reccomend it because:The servers are garbage. Booted atleast once ever other time I play.There are a lot of pay for convienience microtransations. It isn't strictly pay-to-win, but it isn't extra content you buy either. Lots of things that absolutely should come standard are locked behind a pay wall. Unless you pay extra, inventory management will be a nightmare, you can't dye outfits, and there are pointless restrictions on what race you can play with what faction. It's all a shameless ploy to get your money. In some games with microtransactions I feel like I'm supporting the developer and I'm happy to spend $20 every now and then. In this game I feel like I'm being fleeced. Not to mention even the old dlc's are undiscounted, so to buy the entire game outright would cost you well over $100. Simply absurd."
Negative,"inventory management sux... tryed to upgrade enchanting and clothing. gues what, not enought space for materials (going to traders ewery 10 mins, to get some free space). at the end of the day sold all inventory"
Negative,"The game itself is good but having a limited inventory of 60 (upgradable by 10 slots for a shitton of gold each) and bank inventory of another 60 completly ruines this game. There are so many material types (herbs,foods,drinks,wood types, ores etc) that Bethesda is trying to exploit the fact of their shit inventory mechanic to force you to buy into their subscription model. EVEN IF you own the game you are still dont get access to their material bag (basically a bottomless pit bag for materials) you need to be an active subscriber. This model singlehandedly ruins the game because of how fast your inventory gets filled and 30-40% of your time ingame is spent sorting out what you have to toss out now vs what you should keep because you might craft something soon. This also forces players into the 1-X leveling at once when leveling crafting because you wont have to collect any of the materials except you craft one item (liek in Skyrim iron dagger) up to your desired level. COMPLETLY ruining the roleplaying and immersion of the well designed world. Do not recommend."
Negative,"- Decided to give this another whirl since the previous free weekend because why not- had to free up ~85 gigs so i can install it which is fine, games get bigger overtime especially mmos- finished downloading, started up the launcher, says I need an additional ~85gb to install it- ""that can't be right""- check online, find a handful of threads and forum posts about this saying it's a bug (or a feature, we're talking bethesda)- BUT WAIT THERE'S A FIX!- post goes on about copying and/or deleting files left and right just to fix the installation of a full pricex3 MMO by a AAA company- the post was made last summer and the issue still stands without an official fix for it- uninstall.exeBethesmax needs to get their collective s**t together and should start to actually care about the liquid diarrhea they oh so eagerly shower us with instead of releasing skyrim for another 20 gaming platforms with Creation Club™ support.In the end all I got out of this game was the freed up HDD space at the expense of 85gb quality porn. Thanks Todd"
Negative,"DONT BUY!well, you pay for this game not less.after you purchased this game, you can jump right in to it what is great.sadly the developer giving you a lot of crafting loot from the start on.but without purchasing the extra monthly ESO plus membership your bags will be full in an blink of an eye.without ESO plus you also wont be able to get access ( except for buying it for a high price all DLCs )i purchased the newest version with the upcoming DLC pre purchase for over 80 USD ! now i should pay an extra ESO plus every month for around 15 USD?mate this game is nothing for poor people!no eso plus also means, pay for every little extra DLC and there is at least like 20 DLC, without them you purchased you will have a bad time playing this game!the game but itself is a well made online roll played game. however to be forced paying an extra 15 USD a month after purchasing the game for a lot of money, sucks and make me to NOT recommend this game for anyone!"
Negative,On the first look it looks like a candy. But after a few days of gameplay you understand that you are obligated to spend time questing and finding partners. You can play solo but the cool stuff is only for groups while the trading system is extremly illogical making set items worthless while loot drops are tottaly random. After you manage to find nessesary equipment through guild traders or by hours of questing the quick level up system nullifies your efforts. While pvp may seem engaging after you play for a while you may find it extremly unbalaced. You will encounter players who use scripts and maybe even bots so your supper cool abilities are wasted and your PvE combos not even doing an effect on enemy teams. The worst part is that bows are irrelevant in pvp - any mdd or mage can teleport to you in a second and ignoring your stuns kill you in 2-3 hits. The only good part is single player story line with good character voices and atmospheric enviroments. But than why do you need MMO for that?
Negative,I find combat boringquesting mandaneits nice that its voice acted but when they just talk at you with nothing interesting to say whats the pointthe game looks nice / encountered no bugsbut am bored since during my play I kept thinking why am I playing this when I can be playing a better game like Skyrim?for some reason this game does not let you try it before buying it. also at this time there is no way to buy a complete package all at once or at least I didnt find it. mostly complete package is incrdibly overpriced
Negative,"Combines the worst aspects of a typical MMO (dull and repetetive combat, dead/non-dynamic world, forgettable NPCs, boring story and dull quests, predefined character classes) with the worst aspects of TES games (linear dungeons, a lack of interesting landmarks, bad UI and clunky inventory, dumb crafting system).Back when I played Morrowind in 2002, I thought it'd be great to live in that world with other players. But, as they say, be careful what you wish for. It's clear now that the magic of TES series is in the fact that you're alone in that world and no other players (jumping or running around) could ruin the immersion for you.P.S. Skyrim and Morrowind are still great."
Negative,"Been sticking around for way too long already , though the quality of the game has slowly been going up , hence I am more inclined to endorse this game.Edit :They have added yet more grind , whilst the new trial is engaging , im not appreciative of yet more braindead chores.In addition, I find the crownstore to be downright predatory, whilst its  selection doesnt give players any edge on combat , it hosts many things that make life alot easier.It is also overpriced, and locks 80% of the ingame cosmetics behind a wretched casino."
Negative,"There's some very good Elder Scrolly stuff in here including some great stories. Sadly, the MMO format hinders rather than helps the game. It's still worth playing if you are a fan of The Elder Scrolls but know that this is a meeting that could have been an email.'I am dying. Let me give you the sword of my people that has been in my hands for longer than you have been alive.' - An important NPC.*Your inventory is full*'Hang on, let me manage my inventory a second... Hmm don't want to destroy any of this. Wait here while I teleport to town, sell, deconstruct, then come back. Uhhh, don't die while I'm gone.' - Me.This is in a nutshell how a lot of the game feels. Arbitrary limitations because it's an online only game instead of a single player game. Players deck to the nines zooming at mach 3 with their Wild Hunt Rings of Sanic murder hobo'ing the entire dungeon while I, a novice adventure of a hundred and something hours feebly crawl, winded, on the first bend of a dungeon. Boss fights that are supposed to be the end cap on an otherwise interesting story ends in an anemic clink and clank before the boss falls down in two shots from the nearest rando.There is good music in this game. I just have no idea where to point you to in order to find it. It is underused in key moments and a majority of it is background and atmospheric. That is not a complaint, rather an observation of the design choices made here. Do not expect Final Fantasy or hell even other games in The Elder Scrolls series where dramatic moments are marked by a rousing score. Here, silence echoes the clinky clanks of swords and axes and weak splishy splashes of magical shiny bits as the big bad boss fight ends leaving you go... wait, where's my fanfare?Sound effects lack oomph and don't give enough feedback for any situation. A two-handed sword sounds like a fork and knife.Graphically, the models look great. There's a lot of detail in the armor as most the body models are the same leaving to more focus on the art usable for all races. The faces look distinct and the helmets are the MvP with many racially unique looking hats and head-a-ma-bobs. Spell effects range from weak to alright (lightning looks cool, fire not so much).Animations are terribad. It looks as if there's two frames and they just sped it up over and over. Except the mounts, they look pretty good.Voice acting is mostly good with some questionable quality differences between some key characters. In the same scene the quality could range from 'wow, this is like SWTOR' to 'oh wait, that's totally Elder Scrolls Skyrim-in-the-knee levels delivery'.Writing is hit or miss. There are some great stories in there but much like WoW, there's a lot of poop to scoop through. It's just poop of a different flavor.Level design is pretty much every dungeon being squigglies of forking paths that lead to the same place until you get to the last room with a boss, kill it, then there's a one way door/drop back to entrance. Overworld design is 'let's place a distraction everyone 5-10 seconds' and copy pasta that through a map. It's really, REALLY effective carrot-on-stick design. My hundreds of hours were mostly spent chasing these pantsing squirrels. This is not to say the maps are not well designed, they are atmospheric as all bananas, it's just a shame the gameplay loop encourages me to run as fast as I can through these places. The smoke and mirrors are mere jangly keys and aren't well done enough to keep a player exploring the lovingly created character that is the map itself. The focus is on getting through to the story and the map acts much like the music, as a background noise rather than main attraction.Enemies and difficulty balance is pants. There's a reason for this (I'll get into in a second), but it could've still been done better. Outside of dungeons and -some- world bosses, enemies are an annoyance rather than a challenge. They're so easy, fighting them is boring, but they all have annoying knee cap moves that slow the player down for a few seconds and can knock a new player off their horse so fighting them becomes a chore. The game encourages running from point A to B to see the story as the fighting is not the best and the difficulty is trivial through most the story stuff.Quick side rant. Leveling up your riding skill is on a timer, researching crafting, timer, dailies, weeklies, log in rewards, all of these things drag down the game in order to fit the 'MMO' genre. It. Feels. Bad. The great parts of an MMO? Playing with other people. But the story stuff is so easy, it's boring in a group. Oh but the dungeons would be the place to group! And there -is- story to experience there, but only if you are in a guild or with ALL friends because some coconut-on-a-stick is going to zoom their way through the dungeon while you're still trying to read/listen to the story. *pause ranting*Back to the point on balance, ESO has changed a lot since launch. It's now restructured in a way that any content can be experienced in any order (well, you can START any quest chain in any order, not jump in the middle of one). As such, the content is scaled to the player's level. This means if you do things bass ackwards, lore-wise more powerful enemies can feel weaker than a skeever. The great part about this is, it feels like an open world adventure where players can choose to take a bite out of whatever content interests them the most. The bad parts, a player can be confused why something they very obviously stabbed moments ago is now talking to them as if they're meeting for the first time because the player decide to bass that ackward. Also the difficulty thing. Oh and that you could have 99 NPCs surrounding you screaming 'I've been looking for you adventurer!' because each one is trying to lead you into a different story thread. Oh but you can only have 25 active quests in your log. SIDE RANT!Management in this game, because it's an MMO AGAIN is pants on a panda. Inventory is constantly overfilling due to the system being created heavily to encourage purchasing certain things and money sinking. Hey, here's a daily reward, it's a crown scroll of poop on your inventory because it's a new item that you have a limited quantity of and rarely get so more than likely you either pop it and waste it or save it for that one time you're totally gonna use it on a boss fight so now it sits in your inventory staring at you taking up precious space for poopy loot. Let's have you swarmed by NPCs and side quests, and mini quests, BUT only allow a space of 25 rather than just letting the player pick up all the quests and ACTIVELY tracking a small list. BECAUSE MMO! *flips chair*In short, there's good stuff in here. I'll still play the crap out of my remaining time of the subscription (which grants access to all the DLC's outside of the Expansions) but won't be going any further most likely. I really, REALLY wish this was a single player game OR an MMO. Not a single player game in an MMO trenchcoat piloted by the most undecisive racoon ever."
Negative,"Buyer Beware. A Terrible experience with ESO customer support and 3 days of going back and forth trying to resolve missing digital content and receiving poorly written copy/pasted responses, has prompted me to uninstall the game and request a refund, which of course resulted in no refund from steam customer support, citing I had played the game for too long on a free to play week(try wrapping your head around that one). It's a shame, the game looked liked it might have been fun, but the lack of a functioning customer support element at ESO has ruined the experience. On the bright side, I get to save 100's of dollars on subscription fees since I won't be buying any more subscription based games on steam for the forseeable future >:)"
Negative,This game gives you no reason to play it beyond Tamriel looking great.
Negative,insane monetization practices
Negative,Play the single player ES games instead.
Negative,"Do not to get it on steam, but do get it. There's a double install issue that requires a workaround (steam only) and occasional server login issues that affect the steam community."
Negative,"Doesn't really feel like either an Elder Scrolls game or a proper MMORPG. The community is nice though. But seriously, if you want to play an Elder Scrolls game, play one of the actual Elder Scrolls games, especially try Morrowind or Oblivion if you've only played Skyrim. If you want to play an MMORPG, try one of the tried and tested successful MMORPGs. Just, whatever you do, don't give Zenimax money for a sub-par game. You'll end up regretting each hour you played."
Negative,As far as MMOs go this one is pretty accessible but there isnt really an end game and the crafting is very much underwhelming. Mostly this is just a vehicle to keep people interested in paying for and hyped for the Elder Scrolls setting until ES 6 comes out.
Negative,"It's a boring, repetitive painful, soul-crushing, life-draining piece of overpriced garbage. It's just an absolute dumpster fire. Out of all the MMOs I've played, this one is by far the worst. It's so absurdly horrible, it makes Fallout 76 look like the f*cking Mona Lisa by comparison. There's literally nothing to make your story seem different to that of any other play. Your dialogue options are just: YES, NO, GIVE ME LORE, and YES BUT QUESTIONS. Truly, nothing you do in this game matters.  If you desperately need to play an MMO, play Star Trek Online or Star Wars The Old Republic. And if you specifically need to play a medieval fantasy MMO, just play literally any MMO other than ESO that isn't a Sci-Fi MMO.(Quick and delayed sidenote: I've got nothing against the developers, it's just clear that aside from this game's visuals and background lore, nothing in this game was done with passion.)"
Negative,"Downloaded (instaled 68GB) then need to instal it again with another 87GB, are you serious?! I dont have space for this s*it!EDIT: I got game via their site, playing it without steam. You dont need to instal it twice, like with steam; just download launcher and instal it directly from it."
Negative,"This game is nice, the content is good and extensive. However, if you want to buy it, buy it directly from Zenimax on their store, DO NOT BUY IT THROUGH STEAM, it has been more than 8 hours since we can't log in (only affecting steam users) and there has only been on offical thread saying they are ""working on it""...Don't waste your money on here, and go buy it on the official store, save yourself a lot of headeach.Oh, did I mention it's not the first time it happened ? It's been happening a lot recently (since the new big chapter launch, Summerset)"
Negative,Just discovered there's no centralized auction house in an mmo in 2023. I could care less about guilds as a casual solo player. What a tedious system for any new player trying to make some gold for extra inventory slots or even just a mount.
Negative,Last year I would have reccomended it. A series of bad updates and poor decisions for the game has changed my mind. It's not terrible. It's just I believe the state of the game was more balanced and fun 1-2 years ago than currently. PVE is a joke. Burn through all trash mobs in a dungeon then spend 10 mins killing a boss that with recent updates have like 10x more hp than they used to have. Still the same difficulty(easy) but the time it takes now is a joke. Its boring. DLCS offer nothing new. Same old generic quests with a new backdrop.PVP.....unbalanced mess due to class unbalances and certain sets.Find an exploit? Use it. Worst that happens 2 week ban with no rollback.Can't sell half of the drops from dungeons as they bind to your account so the economy is pretty stale. Oh yeah...RNG. You will learn to despise this.Not the worst. But far from the best.
Negative,"I quit halfway through my year of ESO+ subscription and left all my guilds because I can't deal with the devs' lack of quality control combined with their lack of accountability. The game is unreliable at best. Every update breaks something and fixes take too long to implement. After half the endgame community quit last year it's even more frustrating to play because new players have to learn how to play from veteran players, the game doesn't teach anyone how the multiplayer mechanics work like roles. So much unpaid labour by the players, whether in guilds or otherwise, and if we ask the devs questions on the forums like ""do you have an update on this bug fix?"" they may or may not respond. When I quit it was because blocking damage was bugged for months, and at the moment Crown crate gifting has been broken for months. Guilds use these as prizes and incentives, to raise funds for bidding on ridiculously expensive guild traders. After this much dev hostility towards the player base for this long, I'm out. I probably won't be back and that sucks because this was my favourite game and I met some really good people playing it. I'd bet a lot of money the Necrom release is going to be the worst game-breaking update yet. Spend your money elsewhere, somewhere it's put back into maintaining the game."
Negative,"I love the game but hate the devs. The game could be so great if Zenimax wasn't greedy, hell it could generate profits because it's good and people want to support it. Instead it has predatory micro transactions and an over valued premium currency. New chapters are always good, but only during the paid period, everything get destroyed after it goes free to eso+ members(which is still another pay wall actually)it's a shame actually, i want to love this game so much but Zenimax makes it so hard"
Negative,"It has a good product behind the curtain but that's it just hidden potential and it will never be realized because the greed of the developer and publisher, combine that with abusive monetization and F.O.M.O driven design of the game mechanics and you will get a fan who loves the world of the game but will be taken advantage of.So many things could be improved for example, the housing system you know why you can't visit random people houses easily and you need to get add ons etc? you know why everyone can own the same thing and it becomes meaningless? because that way more people can pay 50$ for a virtual house. You know why you can't play the game as you like and test and try things in trials? because everyone just wants to look at numbers and the community is bad managed taking advantage of many addons that tells them what to do instead of trying to play or learn the mechanics so most fight and trials feels boring you just have to spam click numbers that won't get you kicked, someone could know every mechanic and play the game but no one would play with you because you made 60K DAMAGE instead of 63K. The game could be fun at time, bu it would wait for any chance to prey on your wallet, from unearnable mounts, houses and many things that you can't earn from game-play and it affects how they design the game, not to you to have fun but to you to spend more money. FFS they took basic things like crafting bags being unlimited and said fuck you if you want that pay for a sub now, they didn't even need to do that the sub offer was good enough for getting the crazy amount of dlcs etc but no they had to ruin something somehow to force your hand.Then thing about making an alt char again if you want to play another class they will make you earn mostly everything over again even thing unlockable in the map, oh you unlocked it before? then pay for it if you don't want to play all over again, see what I mean by bad design so that you pay them instead of you playing?I forgot to mention the quests which are all the same and repetitive with the same boring fight mechanics, this may be caused because of how scaling works but anyways you'll feel that your character didn't evolve and everything is just easy and spammaple."
Negative,"Elder Scrolls Online is an MMORPG that promises a vast and expansive world for players to explore. The game's map is indeed large, but this very aspect is also one of its biggest drawbacks. The emptiness of the world makes it feel lifeless and uninviting, and the numerous delivery quests only serve to make the journey longer and more tedious. The repetitive nature of these quests quickly becomes boring, and the player is left with a feeling of unfulfillment.Another issue with the game is the lack of excitement in its quest design. The quests are often banal and uninteresting, lacking the depth and creativity that players expect from a game in the Elder Scrolls franchise. This can make the game feel repetitive and dull, leading to a sense of boredom and a lack of motivation to continue playing.The graphics in Elder Scrolls Online are also underwhelming. The game's visual style is unimpressive and fails to captivate the player. The character models are unappealing, and the environments are bland and forgettable. The music in the game is average at best, lacking the memorable tunes and atmospheric soundscapes that players have come to expect from the franchise.In conclusion, Elder Scrolls Online is a game that falls short of expectations. Despite its large map, the emptiness of the world and the repetitive and banal quests make the game unenjoyable. The graphics are underwhelming, and the music fails to leave a lasting impression. If you're looking for an engaging MMORPG experience, there are many other options available that offer better gameplay and more satisfying content."
Negative,7 years of trying. still failed. i want my money back. THIS GAME DOES NOT WORKbugfests in PVP and also PVE24 h per week server maintain wich could result in weeks of problems patching a patch every timethis game is a jokedont buy it
Negative,"Lots of improvements since release and turning into a not pay to play, but still a massive cash grab with draconic limitations on things for no reason like being capped on stuff you can fence, 50 per day, really? As long as you're super casual about everything it's okish to play without 'premium member' status, but when you pay 30-60$ for a game and expansions and half of the content is still DLC locked, you might as well stick with EA products."
Negative,"I am going to be honest here. I played the game for hours and I enjoyed the game a lot but right now, the current situation of ESO is very bad and I have decided to leave this game for an extended periods of time.-First of all, ZOS keeps doing very questionable changes that usually ends up badly. Just look at the Vampire skill line reVamp.(ha) Before Greymoor vampires used to benefit from many great passives with a drawback of fire and fighter's guild skill weakness (notably, dawnbreaker) and it still had many people use it. These days? Vampires are really bad and unfit for serious content such as trials. (will be downright awful when the Blood for Blood gets nerfed to ground next patch) If you want a more notable change, just look at instability of set changes. A set that you farmed for so long can and will get nerfed to ground later on. (Tooth of Lokkestiiz for example) This change also causes end-game meta to be thrown side to side because of the inconsistency.Also I am really salty about Rapid Manevour place changing next patch. It was completely unnecessary and will only cause suffering to those with alt characters that are magicka and PvE based.-Second, you've all heard of this one before, I am sure of it: PvP.I am going to keep this short. You can't really except to do anything if your skills have a cast time of 2-5 seconds because of the server lag. Also in the next patch, they are also nerfing multiple class spammables just because they have AOE in them for some reason. Lag is horrible and makes PVP in Cyrodiil unplayable 0/10 not recommended.-Third, this will be a bit subjective but, achievements do not matter. Achievements only give some useless points and some of them give dyes and even fewer give titles. Yes I am aware of dungeon and trial related ones giving skins and all but what about the others that require greater patience and time spent? Please, just look at Dominion/Pact/Covenant/Tamriel Hero titles that require you to complete hundreds of shitty base game quests. all they give is a fancy title and a dye that you would probably not use. Also, I have great respect to those that achieved Master Angler title. That's patience right there.Conclusion / TL;DR:- It is only really worth it if you are after the storyline quests, other than that I do not recommend this game unless ZOS stops being so fucking inconsistent and upgrades their servers instead of nerfing skills to reduce their shitty server's stress."
Negative,"I played Elder Scroll 4 and 5 both 500+ h. But ESO does not give me the same feeling. When I met skeletons in skyrim, I could hear the clicking sound from the bones but in ESO it's more like a dummy target for hitting. And the quest is much different too. In skyrim you could walk into others' life, like witnessing the quarrel between the siblings at Riverwood store. In ESO it's more like someone just waiting for you there to give away quest. It's maybe a good MOMRPG but not a good Elder Scrolls for me."
Negative,"Do NOT buy this at Steam, the log-in problems are insane. Read the community discussions, there are so many people out there who can't log in or get disconnected frequently. And while you are  looking at a loading screen, the gameplay timer keeps ticking until you've surpassed the refund-limit of 2 hours."
Negative,"free weekend, logged in game to check out, already blasted by things i should buy. fock off scumbags"
Negative,"No AU servers, goodluck with the ping.I picked a bow as a weapon, but you can't draw and hold, it just auto-fires the bow. You also have unlimited arrows. No skill is required, you just hold the mouse down and aim and dodge. This isn't ES, this is an average MMO set in the ES universe."
Negative,"So much potential wasted by ZOS. Prime time server lags only get worse and worse, they promise a fix every update hype ppl only to fail to fix the lag. Every major update/event the game becomes unplayable for few days due to intense lag. They are just milking the TES fans dry. Sad :(edit: Thanks for the developer response.The developers have sent me a this link ""https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/539136/update-on-cyrodiil-performance-upcoming-aoe-tests/p1"" To show how they are trying to fix the server lag in pvp. This article is 4 months old at this point and now i will copy paste a random comment from this forum article.""Ralamil✭✭✭✭@ZOS_GinaBruno @ZOS_BrianWheeler @ZOS_RichLambertSo, where the *** are the actual updates on performance you promised? Because right now, it looks like your team continues to make one ***-poor decision after another, for reasons other than the stated reason of this post (you said performance, then made changes for ""behavioral reasons,"" because apparently we're all children?).You subjected us to several months worth of ***, annoying tests. *** up the way most of us play the game. Somehow managed to make it difficult to play whether one has friends or not.And now it's *** radio silence in the face of a large change that we're all grappling to deal with... meanwhile factions continue to stack just as heavily as they always have (because who cares if your groups are 12 or 24 when you're used to having 90 players around you all the time anyway?).And also meanwhile, you guys somehow continue to let synergies be broken in different ways: I can't use orbs for stamina returns, yet other players seem to be able to synergize damage repeatedly in order to make their bursts even MORE powerful... all while I'm not being healed by half my *** group because of your inane group changes.So. Please. Tell me why the *** you want or expect money in the future. Because you're AGGRESSIVELY encouraging many of us to funnel that money into other games."" As I said they are hyping people so that they keep playing while hoping a fix but time passes and the only thing that changes is the money inside the buyers purse. I check their forums once in few months to just see comments like this..."
Negative,"I bought this game while it was on sale and I don't regret the buy as I had and still have fun with it but I can't give it a positive rating because it's a giant cashcow that paywalls features that should be standard in an mmo, especially in a b2p one.1. The crafting bag: Unless you have ESO plus at a monthly cost of around 12€ you won't be able to use this feature. That means a full bank chest and lots of shuffling crafting materials around, I seriously just damned the damn small inventory spaces until I got ESO plus and now it feels mandatory if you want to do any provisioner, alchemy or enchantment crafting. There are just so many materials that it's ridiclous that they didn't add a basic, toned down crafting bag for non subscribers but use it as an incentive, even for players who own all DLC's, to subscribe and hence making the buying of DLC's wasted money.2. PvP: With the One Tamriel update they made players of any alliance able to play together, at least PVE.BUT for PvP you and you friends still need to be in one alliance, that means either you all agree on one alliance and only choose between 3 races OR you pay to be able to play with any race in any alliance by buying the explorers pack.The explorers pack uses a scarcity created by ZeniMax to justify paying for something that adds no additional content, they want one to pay extra money in a game that you bought and maybe even pay monthly for the ability to play together with you friends with any race.In other words, they strip content out of the game (narrowing your selection of races) just so they can give you an option to buy yourself out of that situation. This is, in my opinion, one of the worst cases of ""micropayment"" use.Even though it's a good game, the mix of microtransactions and artificial scarcity to justify them takes out a lot of fun for me, I myself would rather have a pure subscribing OR b2p model instead of this cashcow system.That's why I will still give it a bad rating, even though it's not the game itself that earned it but the publisher behind it, I won't reward them with a good review."
Negative,"Dont buy The Elder Scrolls Offline on Steam, but buy it directly from Bethesda because:-Cant log into Servers-Cant collect Daily rewards, because you cant log into Servers-Cant waste my time in this Game, because you cant log into Servers-Bethesda gives a Shit about Steam UsersReason to buy it from Bethesda:+You can log into the Game+You can play the Game, because you can log into Servers+You can do Quests, because you can log into Servers+Bethesda cares about Users that buy directly from themConclusion: Bethesda/Zenimax doesnt give a fuck about Steam Users"
Negative,"A few years ago I had around 3,200 hours on my PS4 before it went out. Started on PC after that, and while the add-ons are great I just can’t continue from starting over. There is no cross-progression of any type, and the idea of leveling a crafting character for over a year and hunting down the hundreds upon hundreds of crafting blueprints is just abysmal.          And I see no reason to limit our crown store items like mounts to just one platform. If they are worried about the different economies then just make it where no gold or items other than those from the crown store or achievements (like dyes, mounts, or costumes) are usable on a cross account.       Hope they do something about it but not gonna hold my breath…Rip Vitrine Dwarven Wolf, maybe I’ll see you again one day."
Negative,DO NOT buy this game on steam. Purchase it from the eso website. Plenty of downtime affecting steam users only while regular accounts that play through the standalone launcher (Unavailable if you have purchased through steam) are unaffected and can play with no issue.
Negative,"Pro beginner tip: Don't play. Nah but seriously you are fucked if you dont pay for subscription or shell out the cash for crowns. the base game is designed purely to create problems subscribing or crown store pay to win shit to fix. The absolute biggest offender is th crafting materials bag because it cots so fucking much to expand your backpack or bank by just 10 slots after upgrading a few times. Another big issue is the crazy wait times for researching which can be multiple days which is why they sell ""time saving scrolls"" that take a day off the wait time and thats it and their expensive as hell. oh and if you by high isle and want to get into jewlrey crafting just turn the game off because it can take over an entire real year to research all the jewelry traits and theres only like 15 and 1 item can take up to a month depending. so yea dont recommend unless you get it on sale and just wanna fuck around with friends on the weekend or something but the actual BUYING THE FUCKING GAME that borderline requires subscribing to make an sort of progress and having bullshit from the crown store shoved in my face all the time has just turned me off of the game. This was written from a begginers view because i really fucking tried with this game but its just not happening. Like just what happened to being able to buy a game play the game have fun and buying actual fucking expansions not 15 dollars to join the dark brotherhood or theives guild or being a fucking vampire but actual huge expansions."
Negative,"Cautionary tale about bad game launchers:After downloading the 100 GB sized game , i didn't launch it for some time, because I didn't feel like playing back then (I know nothing about the game, never played it). So several weeks later, i try to start the game.Launcher downloads 6 GB patch.Then 2 GB patch,Then 5 or more additional patches, some several GBs.After a while of letting it run in the background, it tells me it is only ""12% Complete"" (wtf?). After some more patches it starts downloading a 66 GB patch (at this point, the patches together are probably already bigger then the entire game was in the first place).At this point i notice the launcher uses my entire download capacity (which is actually kinda nice, but i need bandwidth for other things), so i go into launcher settings to restrict it to like 50MBit/s (half of my bandwidth) , and i see the following options:> 1 / 5 / 10 or Unlimited MBit/s Lol. The game literally only gives me the option to take either ALL or only 10% (!!!) of my bandwidth?! Nothing in between. Ok, i switch it to 10 MBit/s, guess it can download for some weeks in the background. Guess what happens next?Exactly, nothing. The launcher seems to happily ignore my settings and continues to download at full speed. At this point i have like 30 GB of 66 GB downloaded. I restart the launcher so that the download restriction starts working, but it still doesn't.And then i notice that i am back to downloading 66 GB because apparently the launcher is too stupid to memorize that it has already downloaded over 30 GB before, or is not able to properly partition downloads like any other big game and has thrown away the 30 GB from the first attempt.At that point i uninstall the game, maybe getting a refund. This is beyond incompetent. I have seen games maintained by teams of size 1-3 have fully working downloaders / launchers, but a full blown AAA company is not able to implement the most basic stuff? No thanks, i can happily do without if that is the level of care I have to expect (im downloading Deep Rock Galactic instead right now, oh wait, its already finished, because the game is 3 GB total size)."
Negative,"I wanted to update my review to make it less event specific and because I played another couple of hours.  The problem with this is, I'm still not sure I'd recommend the game.  Which is of course weird, considering that I'm still playing it.My history with ESO is short (as mentioned previously) but in the last three years, I've sunk quite a lot of money into the game.  More than in any other game I've ever played (and I have played D4).  When I was new and didn't know anything, I bought the base game.  Then I decided that I didn't like not having access to all dlc, but even more importantly, the craft bag.  I'm an adult with limited time and I didn't want to spend half of my playing time managing inventory.  So, I got ESO+, which is super convenient, but pricey!  Stupidly, I proceeded to spend my crowns on dlc, but since I didn't know anything, I bought all the wrong ones.  Finally, when Necrom came out, I realised I would like to drop ESO+ (at least for a while), but I still wouldn't have access to all content.  So, I went ahead and bought the full game on sale.  Colour me surprised, when my ESO+ sub runs out and I still don't have access to every area of the game!Does this review read like an essay in stupidity? Sure it does.  Do I love ESO?  yes I do.  I love the open world, the crafting, the writing of the quests.  However, considering what a money pit it is and how greedy the developers come across, the only advice I can give is: Be smarter than me when buying it, or, better yet, don't get into it at all!"

Negative,"It is such a shame that there is no (and I mean zero) challenge to the game. This game is graphically beautiful, has pretty good voice acting for the quests, a good crafting system, a good selection of races and classes, a combat interface/method that could be quite fun to employ if one need it, and lots of places to explore. But, apparently a few years back they set all monsters, except for rare few ones like dragons, to be easy for one player of any class to kill while falling asleep at their keyboard. I know that technically that isn't what they did, but it is the effect of what they did. Thus leveling is an endless snooze-fest of killing easy to kill monsters or running around completing simple quests. The most engaging part of the game is the occasional locked chest that you have a limited amount of time to unlock. I don't know anything about what happens after level 50, but if that is where the accrual game starts, then start characters off at that level.I wish that I had not spent $60 on this boring of a game. If I want a zero challenge activity I will watch TV.Hmm, I think for something that requires more cunning, thought, and attention then this game, I will grab a deck of cards and play some solitaire."
Negative,"The only good MMORPG I've ever played. As a Destiny 2 player the quests are decently fun, but in the beginning you have to walk a lot until you find wayshrines and stuff like that. Looking forward to see what else the game will offer after 100 hours of gameplay! Awesome music too, absolutely stunning. PvP seems interesting too, with a lot of different builds to try out.Edit: I’m still playing itEdit 2: As of 31/08/21 I have become more invested in MMORPGs and naturally I had to check out FFXIV. I just reached Heavensward there but it doesn't click like ESO for now. ESO is definately still very solid, and pvp is actually mad good. Only needs server fixes. Dungeons in ESO are also excellent and really fun. Trials is okay I guess, however mostly play by myself and have only attempted a few veteran trials. I don't really have any reason to play them, except fun... which I can find many other places too. It's on the bucket list though. So yeah, solid game, check it out. Doesn't require a subscription either which is very nice.Edit 3: They ruined it. These greedy asshats can't get a single patch right, and all type of content is made with 0 effort now, unless it's in the crown store. Servers are still barebones, expect weekly downtime. Shame on you ZOS. So glad I picked up FFXIV instead, miles better."
Negative,"I just bought 9 ""Darshade Caverns Coffers"" to get my ""Engine Guardian"" shoulder piece...50/50 chance of getting the piece I want or getting the other monster set...I thought I would surely get the shoulder piece I need ONCE as heavy or middle armor piece...Instead I get 9 shoulder pieces of the other set (""Sentinel of Rkugamz"") and not a single piece of the Engine Guardian set...FROM 9 FUCKING CASES WITH A 50% CHANCE OF DROPPING!?if I knew I would have this (bad) luck I would had played csgo and opened some cases to get some knifes and would be 500$ richer...1/10 gambling simulator 9/10 getting fucked in the ass simulator"
Negative,"Played the game solid 4k+ hrs on ps4 and close to 1k on PC. Payed twice for this game, since I had that much hope and also they won't allow transfers.-Hidden P2W by DLCs in PvP-Balance nowhere to be seen-Elitists everywhere, they be with a magnifying glass on your dps meter-A game where they openly try to minimize the SKILL gap between players-Piece of crap netcode, a small vid. one of many many occurances: -Game is laggy? No problem they fix it with restricting ingame features like certain sets to be used within pvp-Prices beyond the moon for cosmetics, shameless microtransactions and lootboxes-At a certain point, the subscription system is kinda necessary for you to progress in the game because it is getting close to impossible to manage inventory space undless you rock 1 main only and 10 bank chars.Not to speak of the DLCs(Chapters and DLCs, two different things), which are also connected with skill lines and such you get within them.-Don't get me started about the devs, who don't know jack crap about their game:""I once reported a bug, where dark elves weren't immune to burning status effect. After getting redirected several times, i finally talked to a dev, where he just planly texted me the description of the skill back. ....Like I was asking for a clarification on it lmao....even tho I clearly stated the problem."" I'm pretty sure it still exists. Don't know, never got a reply on that.-The community that's 90% kiss-butts, or trolls being toxic or racist af.You can only like this game if you either have no clue at all or if you already made it your life.Well, GFX and the OST are well made, but thats about it.Just hell nah, lost 1k hours here and like 4k hours on playstation just to watch a game go to waste.If I could turn back time, I wouldn't give a flying damn about this game. Just the people I met along the way, but can't give this game the credit, could have happened in any other game, too.I could go on for hours, but I'll leave it at that now. The game was very enjoyable in the early stages, even tho it had its issues but then..."
Negative,"Im not happy to write this comment but it is impossible to play this game. the server stability is really bad to the point where skills are not firing, they kill you without you even realizing it. On top of the game problems, I joined this game to play with a friend PVP and the next thing I know they removed the option to play BGs in groups."
Negative,"This game was fun and used to work, i took a break from it and eventually bought membership for a month to enjoy more, but then i stopped being able to login, this stole my money I spent and now it is completely broken I've tried to reinstall and most thing on the internet with no avail, so if you want your money I'd suggest not spending it on this."
Negative,"To be honest.. i didn't expect much of this game, because it's an MMO and i usually don't like these big life-less worlds, full of annoying players (sorry guys) who run around and kill monsters in front of you.But since it's ""Elder Scrolls"", a universe i really like, I wanted to give it a chance after all.After 65h, I tested all features, that came with the ""standard-version"" of the game, except the late-game stuff and group dungeons.. but now i reached the point where its just boring to play and feels very grindy.Pro:- Very big and detailed world with a lot to discover- Lots and lots and lots of QUESTS (but also a con, because they are boring AF)- Elder Scrolls Lore is still interesting and very nice to read.. and thats about it.. nothing nice to say past here..Cons:- Gameplay: -> Movement is clumsy -> Fighting System is very boring, just like every MMO (aiming and doding feels useless) -> Scaling System for Items makes it useless to craft until you're max-level -> Fights feel the same, since i started the game, no progress through gear or skills, that make you feel ""more powerful"" and no difference between fighting-sytels / weapons.. you basically only fight with your skills and play ""button-smasher"" until your enemy drops dead and if you die by accident, you use a soul-gem and retry immediately -> Map is incredibly bad to handle -> Crafting/Loot-System is very annoying (too many materials that fulfil only one single purpose and no room to store them) -> Too many confusing sound- and light-effects everywhere with no explanation what they signal -> Questlimit is very annoying- World: -> Very bad design of walkways, stairs and borders (i got stuck while walking, because of small steps in the ground..) -> Too many enemies that respawn too quick are placed too dense in the world (almost impossible to explore without fighting all the time) -> Crates spawn in totally random spots, which destroy immersion -> Crafting-Items spawn only if you learned the perk for them (might be a pro for someone?) -> You can gather all you need in the same map.. no need for travel.. which makes it easy to loot random stuff, but also makes it very boring- Enemies and Quests: -> Human Enemies are the same, where ever you go.. different look, but same attack pattern and skills..  -> Bosses are so strong that you cannot kill them on your own, others are so weak, that you don't even have to use any skills.. but there seems to be nothing in between (maybe in the endgame..) -> Quests are super boring (walk there, talk to them, kill that, repeat) and often just end in a wild goose chase with an unsatisfying end -> Riddles feel like they have been created by children and are super easy to solve -> The game throws so many quests at you, that it's hard to get an overview -> many quests seem to be given by some ""divine power"" and there is no further explanation why they asked you... it always feels, like the devs, didn't want to spend any time on this..- Weapons and Armor: -> Due to scaling-system, you will always do ~1000 dmg with one handed weapons (+ enchantments) -> no real difference notable between weapons -> all items are the same, only quality and appearance change (basevalues, 1 perk, 1 enchantment, 1-5 set variables) -> to achieve better gear you have to grind a lot, but even then, it doesn't feel like you need that, because 5 levels later, you have to change it again, or it will lose power due to scaling system...while i am typing all of this, i just realised, that this list could go on forever and i will just stop here.Basically, the whole game feels very boring, even if the main-story-arcs (that i started) seem quite nice..The reason for that, is a very bad gameplay and the feeling that everything you do in this game is useless.So, if you like MMOs, because you don't have high expectations and just play ""casual"" to waste your time, this might be a game for you.. otherwise.. just play any other Elder Scrolls Title or something completely different.. ;)"
Negative,"Disclosure: I haven’t PvP’d much yet and played mostly solo, or done group finder dungeons. Highest level is 35 (taking it slowly), but I also have a 20 and some low levels. Don’t trust steam hours, it counts when the launcher is on, not your actual playtime. (I afk’d on the launcher/logged out a bit, in reality I have about 60 hours in total)I'm going to be in the minority on this game, but I believe there are things that need to be said. I’ve watched/read many reviews on the game before I bought it. I’ve also participated in the beta, way back then. And I can’t say many things have changed from what I remember. I still plan to play the game, but I’m a weird masochist, and the sidequest stories are fun. The rest, not so much.TL;DR:1. Quests - Nothing new – Kill/collect/talk. Stories are pretty damn good tho, but it’s repetitive as hell. (Also, puzzles kinda suck, just waste time and are too easy). Choices = 0 value.2. Variety – Monsters are reused often, even bosses are sometimes basic monsters. Quest objectives are always the same old. Monsters behave completely the same.3. Combat - Wonky animations, same as in Beta. Kind of slow feeling for an action system, spammy abilities kill variety.4. Races – Some offer serious bonuses to you build/class. Choose wisely, or regret later. (or pay crowns – real money - for a race change)5. Play the way you want – Lies. Hybrids don’t really work and most things are BiS. Play the way you want only if you don’t care about being weaker.6. The illusion of choice – Summarised above. Quest choices are meaningless. Race choices are too important.7. Tamriel unlimited – The lack of growth. Everything grows and levels with you, so while you’ll never be weak, you’ll never be strong. Everything takes pretty much the same time to die at level 10, as at level 30.So, down there is almost 650 words, explaining things in more detail. If you’ve only read the TL;DR, you might wonder for whom this game is?Story nerds, like myself. For all its faults, I want to keep playing and hear more stories from Tamriel. But I can only stomach 3 hours a day, otherwise the flaws make me want to eat my own eyes and piss out of my ears.The game feels unpolished, rough and repetitive.If you’ve read its faults and still want to play, go ahead, more power to you! I’d buy the base game and try it first, as you really need to feel it out a bit. I regret buying the Gold edition and probably won’t buy Morrowind tbh.A decent secondary game to play in short sessions for the story.1. Quests. Most people I’ve seen talking about ESO said the questing is a unique experience. Don’t get me wrong, I love the voice acting (90% is spot on, which is impressive, considering how much of it is there), the small stories in each and every one of them. BUT its always the same. Kill X amount, collect X amount, talk here and there. There are minor differences, where you aren’t killing 9 monsters, but defeating 3 waves of 3 monsters. You aren’t picking up items, you’re putting out fires. In essence, it’s the same damn thing that keeps going on and on and on and on…2. Variety. Probably my biggest gripe. Not only are the quests pretty damn similar in objectives (again, not in stories), but you keep fighting the same monsters/humanoids until you’re sick of them. They behave the same, use the same attacks, etc. You might get a colour/attack swap in a new zone, but that doesn’t do much. And once you meet a new monster, prepare to see it million times over.Worst of all, even some bosses are made with generic monsters. So for every new and interesting design, you will get tens of bland ones you’ve met a thousand time, but maybe in a blue colour, instead of red.3. Combat. My other big gripe tbh. It’s fairly slow (especially in PvE), the only hecting thing is rebuffing and keeping track of it. Animations are… wonky. Especially for light/heavy attacks in melee. PvE is also rather spam heavy, as you’ll likely have one BiS attack with highest damage, that you’ll spam until you break it’s hotkey on your board.Haven’t PvP’d much yet, as I want to do that at endgame.4. Races. Sure, there are plenty of them, but some have pretty big advantages for your class. Maybe you don’t care, but I certainly do and it’s my review, so buzz off. Because of this, you might not win that PvP match. Not have enough regen to keep healing well enough in a dungeon. Might not get accepted into a big guild.It’s not too big of a problem for some people I guess, but it’s worth knowing, if you want your character to be the best it can be.5. “Play the way you want to play”Hahahahaha… No, just no. Wanna play a hybrid? A magic user who’s good with weapon skills? Tough titties, you won’t be nearly as good as other builds. This game has the illusion of classlessness, but in reality, there are playstyles that crush anything else. Be it in DPS, Healing, or tanking survivability. Wanna use bows/melee weapons? Better be a stamina user, or you won’t do shit. Wanna use staves? Better be a magika user or you won’t do fuck. Wanna be a hybrid? Sure, if you don’t mind gimping yourself and sucking at both things you’re mixing together.6. The Illusion of choice.As mentioned above, your choices are limited. Not only in race and class, where some will be better for your build, but also in quests. Your choices don’t matter as soon as the quest is done. Rewards are mostly the same and not that important anyway.7. Tamriel united.This one is personal and you might not agree with it. That’s fine, I see it’s value. I just don’t like the level scaling. There is something satisfying about coming back to an old dungeon and crushing it with new gear and levels. Slowly progressing through a new zone and feeling it get easier. Makes you feel like you’ve grown.Here, I feel static. Enemies take the same amount of hits to kill at level 10, as they do at level 30.At least you can truly go to wherever you want and quest there. That’s why I’m saying this is not really an objective con, but it is for me."
Negative,Honestly not worth it.
Negative,"Dude, I never write reviews on games cuz i always think that games are too much of a personal experience to judge by someone else's view. BUT let me warn you all, as this is not a cheap game: IT IS TOO EASY. The game is well constructed, combat feels fluid and intuitive, the locations are detailed and NPCs are all voice acted and believable. I would spend years of my life playing this if it wasnt for this simple thing: The whole thing is boring! You can complete the game without any experience and with a full-on naked character just smashing your face on the keyboard and you'll hardly need a couple potions. I cant stress enough how easy and pointless this game feels. WHY WOULD YOU EVEN GO FOR ALL THE TROUBLE OF MAKING A GAME AND THEN MAKING IT NOT FUN AND CHALLENGING?!"
Negative,"I am frustrated with the poor customer service, lack of information, lack of response and general unresponsiveness from ZOS. I feel my complaints and not being heard or taken seriously, since they won't listen to me? Then you will feel me. Screwing up this bad with the Steam-logon issue is one thing. That can be forgiven, if you treat your customers with respect. Everyone knows that, the customers who with their cash on your overpriced microtransactions keep you in business. But making a mess of things, and then keeping largely silent while ignoring your customers, that will come back to bite you in the arse. If writing bad reviews is something that will get me even all of us noticed, so be it. So give me a refund for all my money I have wasted on this trash company or fix your moral code as well as your game. this will be the final straw as I will be leaving this game and let the dust collect on it.I have never wrote a review on games cause I have never seen the point to bother then to play, I had to give my first one to ESO for being a wasteful time of overpriced microtranction and lack of interest for their playerbase who feeds their families with our money.I would be happy to remove this when you fix your issues."
Negative,"Oceanic / Australia region alert : I got big-headed and purchased this knowing I had a 100mb fibre connection with Telstra, the IP with the least hops to the main server. I went ahead and did so because BDO was a grind-fest and I can't be bothered with it, despite the combat being better / game being too the power of 10x more beautiful than this. Anyway, I soon realised that this game is the same thing, only what you're grinding is 300-400 average ping with 900 ping spikes.  I’d rather grind mobs with half the ping and a chance against enemies in PvP than grind against latency and zero chance against anyone except for those AFK or because I’m with a zerg. I have not had the kind of latency issues experienced with Elder Scrolls Online since ADSL1 around a decade or so ago. Perhaps more.  There is no reason for that kind of junk ping  / spiking / infrastructure. What an Absolute farce. Uninstalling and thank god I have unlimited download, because this behemoth was 90gs.  A shame, because without the disgusting latency that game didn't seem terrible. So long ESO."
Negative,"This was my first mmorpg, I do prefer single player and the descriptions said I could ""strike out on my own"" in the game so I tried it.I was surprised how good it looked and it is big, the world feels a bit plastic though and lacks depth, I don't think it is a game for solo players.Things just happen again and again, fighting a big beast was just running around in a crowd in no danger, return after a while and another group is repeating. Monsters respawn quickly and dungeons feel repetitive.Not for me."
Negative,Finally decided to purchase this game on sale. Wasn't at all like I expected it to be. Starting out there is only the choice of 3 of the races. Other races you have to pay extra for. Right off the bat starting out this game wants you to buy extra DLC to even have an enjoyable experience. Not worth it even on sale.
Negative,"Developers only care about the stuff that they profit directly such as housing and this causes lag, bugs and any other BS you don't want in an MMO or a game in general. How long would it take to fix the gap closer bug if you'd care about the players? Making money while not fixing the stuff that has to be fixed is a big no no. Stay away from that game if you mainly care about PVE/PVP experience. It just doesn't worth it."
Negative,"I just uninstalled ESO.Why?  Tel Var Stones.If I wanted to play a game where people get to take my stuff when I die, I'd go play Darkfall or something like that.So thanks Zenimax for coming out with a game that seemed cool right up until you added this absolute BS.It is absolutely not fun to spend hours to collect a handful of things only to have some gank group come along and take them."
Negative,Playing without ESO+ is a real pain. Crafting is just not an option. And without the expansions and dlc you are also very limited. Buying the base game is equal to what every other MMORPG gives you for free.
Negative,"idk man i played it a while, i loved everything about it but after a while i just hated it, the combat, the questing, everything just bored me. i'd rather play black desert online."
Negative,"This is a really great game and I highly recommend it, however do NOT buy it through steam!Constant login issues that Non-steam players don't experience. Update: Entire game has gone bad. Constant server problems, long loading screens, and bad lag. Don't buy here or anywhere."
Negative,"I don't really understand how anyone can like MMOs. I love the elder scrolls series, from morrowind to skyrim. This is the second time that I bought ESO, and I really tried to like it, but I don't. I just don't get it : graphics are abysmal, animations are abysmal, gameplay is horribly repetitive... But I think the worst thing is that you have absolutely no impact or real interaction with the world : enemies literally reappear immediately after you kill them - you blink, you turn your back, and they are right back where they were. How can anyone get any immersion ? Plus of course you have a thousand players bouncing around you all the time. Good on the people who like that kind of game but.... wow. Horrible in my perspective."
Negative,"The game in a nutshell:Everything is super homogenized.  That is, the difference between classes is very small.The gear is homogenized through the use of ""Predefined"" buffs that do not stack meaning there's just the meta of the current patch.  Combat is bad.  Period.  The issue is light/heavy attacks and manual blocking.  These are holding the whole thing back. Plus, all the skills are homogenized.  Different names, slightly different graphic, same effect.  No reason to play multiple classes.Game is designed to extract money from casuals on RL money store.That's the entire game.  It's fun for a while until you see the illusion for what it is."
Negative,"Bought the game 2 weeks ago for the Mac client through Rosetta on Steam on a M1 Mac.  Game performed amazing on the Mac M1, so I upgraded to ESO+. Then all of the sudden they stop supporting the Mac M1 version through Rosetta after an update on 08/22/22, or for you non-Americans 22/8/22.  Game worked perfectly on my M1 Mac one day, and then the very next day there is zero support for it.  In all of the forums the customer support pretty much just says ""whelp you're screwed now,"" because they made a statement in early 2020 (over 2 years ago) that they would not be supporting anything other than intel-based macs.  That was 2 years ago!!! I literally got into ESO 2 weeks ago.  How am I supposed to know in late 2022 that they put this random disclaimer out in 2020 when every review/video I've seen says that you are able to play ESO on M1 Macs.  It has obviously been supported after early 2020.  Absolutely no info from the developers other than a link to that statement from 2020! I guess ZeniMax expects you to research every statement they have made in the past few years before you buy their game. I paid over $50 overall for 2 weeks of gameplay, and thanks to a busy work schedule that comes out to about $10/hour of actual gameplay.  I doubt anyone read this or made it this far, but I would not recommend lol"
Negative,"Bought it long time ago, had to download a lot of files through the launcher. It counted as ""playing"" so I couldn't refund even before starting the game. Great. Made my character (1h of customisation) and after another few hours stopped playing. Fast forward two/three years. During another playthrough of Skyrim I decided to go back to ESO because I was curious how it changed and after downloading the game again I just discovered my character was deleted. Awesome! I was mad, uninstalled the game and forgot about it for another year or two. Two months ago I started another Skyrim playthrough (pls send help), read lots of lore, watched many videos aboout TES and started thinking about playing ESO. Again. Kinda masochistic but they added province of Skyrim and some dwemer lore so here comes another downoad. This time I was not alone because I convinced my friend to join me. And of course the day when we both downloaded ESO and had an opportunity to play together was a day of maintenance. One of those longer than usual. Nonetheless another day we finally could log in, made our characters and start playing the game properly. Week passed, another maintenance. And another soon after. Even today when I am writing this they have another maintenance (which was the impulse to review ESO). And after last one I am constanty being kicked from servers because of connection issues. Tried everything from forums and official guides but ESO still keeps kicking me. Other games have no problems like this. So when I finally started to enjoy playing this game it kinda messes with me again. Reminds me of my bitter sweet 3000 hours in Destiny 2 and I am not sure if I want to get through this again. All those things mentioned, grindish crafting, subtle but visible P2W (subtle for me as a PVE player focused on story who curses them when he needs to go to the city and lacks bag and bank space but if you are advanced player and see many more cons I understand) and pricey DLCs makes ESO more meh than yay."
Negative,"(中文评论在下面）IF YOU ARE USER FROM CHINA, PLEASE RECONSIDER!!!I am a user from China and bought this game for at least one year (mac version). At first, I had really a great time connecting the game online to the server as well as on in-game experiences. To be honest, I loved it, and a bit addicted to this game too.Then beginning from then end of 2015, server is getting unstable, sometimes couldn't get connected or game crashed.Now, 2016.07, I would be holding a celebration party IF I could EVER connected online!!! An error 200 had been jumping out of my screen for thousands of times, and when finally luckily connected, game will be crashed in no more than 5 mins, situation remain the same regardless if I am connected to VPN or not (some might question if China's great firewall caused the problem).Several email sent to their help center, the only respond was - autoreplies and autoreplies.I am extremely frustrated by now, that's why, for those who are from China and want to play this game in China, better RECONSIDER!!!P.S. I am not sure if any other countries' users encounter the same situation如果您也是中国用户，您正在考虑是否要购买，请三思！我大概在一年前购买了这个游戏（苹果电脑版本）。最初的时候，无游戏网络连接或者游戏的玩乐性我都毫无意见。老实说，很爱玩，甚至有点上瘾的感觉。从20年年底开始，服务器就开始出现连接不顺畅，或者玩到一半掉网。现在, 2016.07, 如果我的游戏能够连接上服务器，我应该要开香槟庆祝一翻了！！！Error 200是最常出现的字幕，几乎等于永远连接不上，就算走狗屎运连上了，过5分钟游戏掉线，重连！就算打开VPN连接，情况与不用VPN一模一样！！！（所以是否中国的伟大防火墙问题还需进一步讨究，但至少本人所用的VPN连接网页是没有问题的）技术支援就更别提了，提供了个鬼屁邮箱，发几次邮件（英文）都是自动回复，邮件内容也应该没有人看（明明跟他说是Mac系统，就给你个自动回复告诉你Windows安装有问题），我也真是受够了！！！现在感觉，完全被欺骗，从可以说接近完美的游戏体验直接跌入绝望谷底。如果您也是中国用户，您正在考虑是否要购买，请三思！"
Negative,"Never actually played this, had ton's of server issues, nothing but ""Try again later"" messages, I've had it for two days and only got 75 minutes [Play time] without actually playing.I will be asking for a refund as I like to play my games.I cannot recommend this game, but millions of players enjoy it, so it is something you should try if you have played other TES games, I might even like it my self if I could play!"
Negative,"The steam reviews function based on if we can recommend this game on steam. Well I'm sorry but I just can't. In less than one month, I've been unable to log into the game on 6 separate occasions, and every time this happens the game is unable to be played for only steam users. And every time it takes on average about 10 hours to fix the problem. Non steam ESO players can play the game just fine. All MMO's have planned maintenance and emergency maintenance. But this is unforeseen down time. When you factor in planned maintenance also, and your own life, it levaes a minimal game experience! Until Bethesda aka (ZeniMax) or Steam themselves fix whatever the issue is that's causing Steam ESO users to be unable to play, I can not recommend The Elder Scrolls Online on steam. I wouldn't even score this game experience right now on Steam a 1/10, it's 0/10. At this point, I don't case whose fault the issue lies with, what I care is that Steam users can not play the game when this particular issue shows up once more. Good luck trying to be Emperor in Cyrodiil when non Steam ESO players have 10/15/20 hours extra a week to play than you. And that's just one example of why it's not fair, I could give you twenty if I thought long enough! How about the fact that ESO+ members have their subscriptions ticking away. By the way, Bethesda (aka ZeniMax) don't even compensate you for that. What's that? You can't log in to play? Well it's not our fault that WE caused you to be unable to, so you'll just have to deal with it because you're not getting squat in compensation!"
Negative,"PVE part is still good, but devs more and more focusing on marketing features, ignoring player needs and bug reports.  PVP part is getting worse due the bugs and cheaters, which have been long-time and multiple times reported,  and, alas, were completely ignored.Game population getting lower, so ZOS pay attention to marketing even more instead of dealing with bugs and exploits.I love TES but I do not recommend the game while this trend continues.P.S. Oh, and do not look at my Steam stats, I do not login to the game through Steam. Due another bug there're a problems with steam login every time the game gets new patch."
Negative,"This is nothing more than just another generic MMO with an Elder Scrolls label. You'd think they would at least hand-craft a few opening quests to draw people in, but nope, nothing but filler from the very beginning. There is no grand story unfolding in the background, no memorable characters or interesting dialogues anywhere in sight, and even locations and dungeons are just the most generic looking fodder. One of the first quests has you springing someone from this scary jail guarded by deadly traps. Spoiler alert - the jail is three rooms deep and the traps even a child could walk past. Then you take part in a grand heist to steal documents from a local warlord. And guess what, you just walk in and take the papers from a chest sitting in the middle of the living room. Hordes of other players trample through every location you visit and wipe out everything in sight before you can kill anything yourself, making sneaking mechanics irrelevant. Enemies respawn right on top of you before you even leave the room. Combat is  clunky and boring, with blocking mechanics that don't seem to work half the time. The end result is a keep busy simulator that just has you run from point A to point B, completing basic tasks, and awarding an avalanche of garbage loot that you constantly have to clean out from your inventory, one at a time, with two warning prompts for each deleted item."
Negative,"I really didn't want to believe all the reivews that it was just another generic MMO but the truth is that it is exactly a generic MMO. For crying out loud i've played better F2P MMO's, and I got this trash on sale. What makes it bad? The quests are uninteresting, the combat is grindy, the ui is terrible, customer service is unresponsive, optimization is an fps hitter even though I have specs way over minimum, the social aspect of it (chatting, guilds, etc) is garbage, everything about this game is just bad. Please don't be an idiot like me and make the same mistake of buying this. Also it's worth noting that they have a real jerk move in the game where once you download half the game on steam you have to download the other half in the launcher which took me over 2+ hours to download. What that means is before I even could tell if I liked the game or not I wasn't eligible for a refund because all my playtime was sunk into the download."
Negative,This is some of the worst melee combat I have ever played in my entire life
Negative,"Disgustingly bad account management through steam. Stuck at login and based on everything im reading about this, the situation with steam and this game isn't great. Very disappointed."
Negative,"been playing since 2014 across two accounts and lemme tell you this game was good but now its just ""give me your money"" type vibes"
Negative,"I love this game but I can't recommend it for anyone living in  the South East. There are no Aussie servers and I've gone about as far as I can with a huge ping. If you live in the US or EU and have mates to play with you'll be on ESO for many, many years."
Negative,"I keep trying it every year or so, but this game does its best to shoo players away with the amount of sh*t thrown at you right from the get-go, and how ludicrously ""biggest-MMO"" its trying to be. The lack of focus is totally killing any vibe you can have for it, and it's incredibly dull and unoriginal.Also, open your wallet before entering this place."
Negative,"I picked this up on a sale and even though my expectations were low, I was kind of hoping this would prove me wrong, as I've heard plenty of good things about this. This feels like a mobile game with an unusual amount of effort put into the quests and the writing. But everything else feels anemic, static, stiff and cheaply made. It's the size of an ocean, but the depth of a leaking inflatable pool."
Negative,"After hours of troubleshooting with a friend, we discovered just how obfuscated DLC purchases are in Elder Scrolls Online.There are four versions of Blackwood DLC; the Blackwood Collection, Blackwood Collector's Edition Collection, Blackwood Upgrade, and Blackwood Collector's Edition Upgrade. My friend intended to purchase all previous chapters and unlock the necromancer class, but mistook the Blackwood Collector's Edition Upgrade as the Collector's Edition Collection, thinking it was the same package minus the base game, which they already owned given the similar pricing at $69.99 versus $79.99. The Steam description for the Collectors Edition Upgrade is empty, and no clarification of how different the contents of the package are. So what they got instead of all chapters and extra classes was a single chapter and a smattering of cosmetics, for only $10 less than every chapter and class in the game. I've never seen bad-faith marketing to this extent before, and I don't think ""user error"" is an adequate patsy for blatant anti-consumer tactics like this."
Negative,"Honestly for me, it comes down to one simple fact:If you are assessing the game based on an ESO Plus subscription, it's very good.If you are not, then you're going to be severely gated and inconvenienced.  No craft bag leaves you never enough space to store and use crafting materials.  Subscription give you both this as well as every DLC save for the very newest one.I wish there was a third option for recommending a game. If you're willing to subscribe, I wholeheartedly recommend the game.  However I am voting no, because that can't be a reasonable assumption to make.  I find the game simply not worth the time to play for free.  In fact, paying for DLCs while not subscribing is a bad idea since you get them with the subscription.  For me, you either play the game as is for free, or just pay the subscription free - there's no logical in between.Gameplay wise - think Skyrim online with somewhat improved graphics. There's only so much Bethesda can get out of their decade old creation engine, though. Very similar to how Fallout 76 is basically Fallout 4 online.  The overall game has a development curve of your standard MMORPG from the past.Zenimax is not shy to monetize things to make you advance better. Is it pay to win? Technically, I guess not.  Can you pay to advance far quicker than others conventionally?  Absolutely.  As such, I'm not a big fan of it.  Catering to whales with in game enhancements is not something I look to support."
Negative,Ruined by greed and terrible business practices.
Negative,If you care about vanity/transmog don't bother unless you have a 250k limit on your credit card. Also endgame PVE sucks nuts.
Negative,too much dlc
Negative,"Was fun for a spell but I just got bored.  The simplicity of the quests should have allowed so much more in an area.  Vvardenfell just isn't the same without jump 500 or levitate, and things hidden in every nook and cranny.   Pretty and faithful recreation of the world just falls short when the simple few quests are all hidden behind a giant paywall.   This is as close as we can get to multiplayer skyrim, oblivion, or morrowind however the gameplay falls short when it comes to how engaging it is."
Negative,"8/8 if u love dissapointment.But i hate MMOs, but love Elder Scrolls. Nope still a terrible MMO. It's like playing a crappy Oblivion with boring quests and NPCs, and a bunch of randoms who never communicate run around killing everything on/for you."
Negative,"here is my review after 8k play time only on steam.hopefuly I can save you.Current state of the game: 1/10when I started playing eso before one tamriel patch it was a dream game for me. a game with high skill cap that rewarded you for getting better. decent challenges and even cool casual stuff to spend your time with. however these days with every patch they are making game worse and for every good change, they are making ten bad ones, as the new patch 8.1 is about to release and probably kill pvp and pve as we knew and loved.instead of making casual contents for casuals they are making everything casual by making the fundamental aspects and mechanics of game more casual.to a point that there is no reason to get better there is no reward for getting better and devs have no problem saying that we dont want you to be too good because that makes a gap even tho it took you years to master it.it is path that leads to demise of ESO soon. Devs of eso vs Criticism: 0/10I've seen many times with every patch when a obviously bad change is coming and everyone in forums are talking against it but devs push to live only to make an unhealthy meta that suks the fun out of the game or making something completely useless for months and they finally realise they were wrong and revert it back to where it was. by listening to players they could have saved time and resource and prevented this roller coaster changes many times, but they never do.devs rather go to social media cry about it rather than listening to us.thats not where it ends unfortunately, community managers actively censor your post and remove them if its not making them happy. I cannot emphasise how bad it is, its as if china is running this game... tho they might have done a better job.Monetization: -1/10this game has a unhealthier monetization than a Korean Moblie MMO.you have to buy base game, you have to pay for every patch, you have to buy DLCs... yea those are two diffrenet things.there is real money currency trading which makes game extremely pay to win and there is subscription which you will NEED because of a feature called craft bag otherwise you simply cant manage invetory, there is SH*T ton of useless and usefull materials and items in the game just to fill your bag and craft bag is an INFINITE inventory for those items. at least Korean games have the decency to make DLCs or base game free.as a new player if you buy the game and press M you will see more that half of the map is locked behind a paywall and that is not a good first impression.and the cherry on top... eso also has Loot boxes where every cool thing comes from. they are truely shameless.you might not believe me but this is just the tip of the iceburg.if you insisnt on buying and playing good luck to you, I hope you enjoy this game as I once did."
Negative,"The thing is, I would want to play this game. I would like to spend hours and hours just exploring and grinding, but there is one thing that always comes between me and the game. The endless amounts of errors!When I downloaded this game the 1st time, everything went exceptionally well until I decided to launch the game. Errors and errors which required manual tinkering with the files. In an hour or two, the errors finally vanished and I could play. Then on month later, the glorious patch manifest error (which killed the whole game for hundreds of players) came in. I was stupid and i tried to reinstall the whole game. First time the download went corrupt when the downloading process hit 90%. A day later, when the downloading finally finished, the patch manifest error wasn't even fixed. Couple of days later, the patch manifest error was finally fixed and I didn't have to do the reinstalling process for the 4th time.Now a month later, sh!t hit the fan again. Developers published a fantastic update, but guess what? The whole game went corrupt and even the repair function isn't working. Sending tickets 24/7 would be so fun, but the errors come so often that I could build a house out of them. I like this game so much, but I cannot even launch it. I am a heavy gamer and this is the first when I have been this disappointed. Seriously, how hard is it to design a game not to have this many errors? Maybe it's the steam version, but Zenimax is the one pulling the strings."
Negative,"The whole game is zenimax trying to grab your money, want a pet? money. Wanna play this race? money. Wanna play this class? Money. Wanna play these extra quests? Money. Otherwise, get a premium subscribtion, but at this point other games are more worth it, considering the money you will put into this game."
Negative,"The game is decent, plenty of interesting dungeons and the combat is better than a few other MMOs i've played.With that being said i just CAN'T reccomend this game from a collector's point of view. If you're expecting to collect plenty of mounts, weapons, minions ecc. you WILL be disappointed. 90% of the mounts are from the crown store, 90% of the pets are from the crown store. Of course, there are a few you can only get by playing, but simply put, they're all s**t compared to the paid ones, apart from a SINGLE mount that's decent looking, BUT, to get it you must do one of the hardest raids in the game! One. Decent. Mount.Talking about raids, there ARE rewards for doing the end-game content, yes; what could it be? Mounts? Armor? Weapons? No no, you get some cosmetic that changes your character's skin texture. So if your character is fully armored (Like me) you might as well go f*** yourself.The game has armor and styles, basically:Armor is the stuff that gives you statsStyles is what you use to make transmogs, basically consuming a style page unlocks that specific gear piece to be used for transmogs.There are a few cool styles you can get from PVP, specifically the Xivkyn style. It's basically the Daedric armor from Skyrim, to give you an idea. To get these pages you must grind a lot, with the danger of an enemy player coming in to steal all your progress (You can only get the pages in a specific mode, but i won't be explaining it since it'd be too long), BUT, guess what?! You can just spend a few bucks and you'll get em instantly! Ain't that cool?HELL, the only way to get a few good houses is to spend money! And i'm not talking about 20/30 bucks no, i'm talking about 90 f***ing dollars! For a digital house!Do i have to say anything else?Of course, you CAN get all of this for free if you have a Plus subscription, since you get a bit of crowns every month. Still, that doesn't change anything. Almost nothing in this game has any real value/rarity. I figured this after way too much time, so if you're a collector like me, don't make my mistake, play a better MMO."
Negative,"Wanted to love this Elder Scrolls Title, too monetized, completely crippled by the $15 a month craft bag."
Negative,I like the game but I seem to spend more time waiting on maintenance than playing the actual game.
Negative,"As you can tell, I've invested quite a few hours into this game within the course of the last five years and I really enjoyed most of these hours overall. I did lots of vet-trials, dungeons, overland content as well as some PvP. However, the recent changes really concerned me and made me quit the game, as the upcoming update 36 doesn't seem to provide any improvements.At this point it becomes clear, that Zos really doesn't care about their playerbase, the community or even the game itself at all anymore. It's not like they cared that much about the cummunity within the last 2-3 years, but it seemingly has never been that bad as it is now.They tend to gaslight their players as much as they can as of late, while monetizing community made add ons for their own greed in the crown store (e.g. armory station).Not to mention that they don't have any clue what to do with the game and its basic functions. The combat system gets shifted every three months, a huge majority of the most powerful gear is locked behind a paywall (Chapter-trials, DLC-dungeons or Eso+), the hybridisation system still isn't finished after almost three years of  “development“ making every class feel washed out, especially during endgame content and yet the upcoming update 36 seems to focus more on crown crates and crown store items, than on bug fixes and actual content.  Update 35 clearly wasn't about accessibility and completly missed the mark.The devs got tons of feedback during the PTS weeks and still decided to ignore most of it. Instead they pushed ahead with their “vision” of the game. It more feels like they nerfed dps and heal across the board not in terms of accessibility, but to be able to sell new powerfull sets within the upcoming DLCs.The update was a huge let down in so many ways and the current state of update 36 appears to be no different, which is just frustrating. Well, however. After all, this is just one man's opinion and probably only just another one of these “knee-jerk reactions” in the first place."
Negative,"The combat is badESO has the most basic and boring combat i have ever seen in an MMO. You can only have 5 skills equipped and none of the skills are really different from your basic attack. 99% of flights go like this: click click click click block click heal click click done… so engaging...The combat is pointlessIn eso you start the game at max level, and leveling up your character doesn’t increase your characters combat abilities at all. The only thing leveling up does is unlock new skills, which are often worse than your basic attack.  Every enemy in the game is also at max level, which means you can go right to the end game content at level 1 if you so desire and you will have no real issues. Since there is no advantage to leveling up, there is no reason to fight at all, I have started avoiding combat all together since there is no reason to ever fight unless its part of a quest.MMO not so muchSure it is an online massively multiplayer game, but really, for the most part you are in a single game experience. Most of the quests don’t lend themselves well to a multiplayer experience and are better done solo. There is no auction house where you can buy and sell goods with other players. There is no open world pvp... Other then dealing with other players are constantly stealing your gatherables and loot, you don’t really interact with anyone else in ESO. There are Groups and Guilds you can join to play with other players, but most of the time it just feels awkward to be in a group unless you are doing a “Group Dungeon”(and with the horrible combat mechanics and little point to leveling up there is no reason to ever do a dungeon). There ARE some PVP & PVE game modes in ESO where you can play (what i would call mini games) with other players, but its very removed from the main game, it feels like an afterthought thrown in after the game was made.The crafting is… typical MMOCrafting in ESO is actually more important than a typical MMO. since there is no easy way to trade with other players, if you want a high level crafted item, you are going to have to make it yourself. One of the most frustrating things about ESO is that there are a ridiculous amount of different crafting ingredients. Most MMOs have 1 type of ingredient for each profession per zone, not ESO, get ready to have your bags full of every crafting ingredient you can think of right at the start. But don’t worry, you can pay them to relieve you of this serious problem they created for you; just pay them $15 a month and you can hold unlimited ingredients!The Quests are amazingThe quests in ESO are not your typical MMO quests. No “go kill 100 monsters”, no “go gather 100 flowers”. Every quest in ESO is up to the standards of any Elders Scrolls game! Fully voice acted, well thought out quest lines that really bring you into the game. And quests are everywhere! You can hardly walk 5 minutes into the woods without some poor soul running up to you asking if you can help them find their lost sister in a nearby cave. The main quest line especially is on par with Skyrim and Oblivion with its engaging world building and believable characters voiced by hollywood actors.The world is captivatingThe world of ESO is beautiful and it is great being back in Tamriel. You get to visit locations you have been to be for in other Elders Scrolls games as well as explore locations you have only heard about. Its big its immersive, you can go anywhere at anytime and really do whatever you want. The NPCs of the world feel rich and everyone feels like they have their own life and store to share.Luckily all the bad things about this game can be completely ignored if you don’t care about combat! So if you don’t care about combat, or multiplayer content, and just want to experience the rich world of Tamriel then this game is for you!"
Negative,Was a great game until it started turning into pay-to-win. New game-breaking skills exclusive to those who get the latest DLC is effectively pay-to-win... Especially to those of us who bought the game before it turned free to play. Now we have to keep up with all the DLCs and spend more money to be competitive.
Negative,"i got the game thinking i could do some questing with my friends. you cant. you can add them as friends, join the same group, join the same guild, and you can do the same quest at the same time as your friends and watch each other doing the quest, but you arent actually questing with each other. if your friend does an objective in the quest like talk to someone, you still have to talk to that person. sure this keeps players from falling behind in the story but a lot of people just dont care what the npc has to say. same thing goes with killing enemies or completing objectives. i get that this would keep someone from carrying the team but it makes a huge disconnect when you want to be doing the same quest with your friends. it feels like skyrim with a bunch of people you cant really interact with."
Negative,The lack of inventory space without the ESO Plus subscription makes this game not enjoyable. I'm not playing this game the whole time so a subscription doesn't make sense. Go look how the guys from Guild Wars 2 do it and learn something about the wishes of gamers.
Negative,"Non-steam players are playing this game while we, steam players, can not do this! This happens 3rd time in a week! DO NOT BUY this game on steam if you want to play this game!Can't recomend game right now while they have such log in problems preventing you to play the game you bought"
Negative,I've installed this game about 4 different times. and not one time will it run. I bought it during the Steam winter Sale but did not receive any game code. I can\t play it. I've spend almost 3hrs trying to get it to work. this is a pain!!!
Negative,"30 Jan 2022 ============Apparently, I've already spent over 3 hours playing this game.Yet all I have done is try to install it.Re downloaded it three times. The first time was getting the InstallAnwyhere error: ""change your directory to extract the installer"", all my drives had plenty of space. Changing it just took me back to the same dialog asking to change it.Secondly, the game files were corrupt after the game and launcher were eventually installed, getting error 209.Thirdly, when the game finally launched, it crashed. Now repairing and downloading again.I also bought this game for my son and he also having installation issues on his PC.Our specifications are up to standard and can run games such as Red Dead Redemption 2 on high without issues.Also tried downloading the installer from the Elder Scrolls website, but couldn't get the game key on Steam to redeem it on the site.03 Feb 2022 ============To add insult to injury. Steam is unable to refund the game because I exceeded 2 hours.Yet I have not played a single minute of the game and having the launcher run in the background counts as game time.""We are unable to refund this purchase to your Steam Wallet at this time. Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum).""And no thank you @Bethesda_Dova Kit, after wasting so much time and energy trying to get it running, I have lost interest in attempting to get it working.This experience has left a very sour taste in my mouth not only with ESO but also Steam."
Negative,"Fun if you like MMO's, or want to get into them. Not fun if you like Elder Scrolls."
Negative,No SEA/Asia servers.
Negative,"I've been trying to install this game for three days, none of the customer support solutions have worked. Got in touch with customer support, like I actually contacted someone who works for Zenimax, their solutions didn't work. No luck trying solutions from community forums either. I can't say whether this game is actually good or not but just know if you buy it there is a very real chance you just straight-up will not be able to play it at all, whether or not you want to take that risk is up to you."
Negative,"This game doesn't make sense, and I have a lot of laughable problems with it, like invisible barriers where there's no navmesh or a blocking volume that doesnt make sense (or completely breaks physics when you collide) but there are also way bigger issues both with the people who run the game, and the model of the game as a pay-to-play (let's not pretend you can really play without eso+, you really can't.)The most recent series of patches having been dreadfully mishandled and causing massive chaos in PVP and PVE is bad example and dashing enough to our faith in them, but ZOS recently posted updated forum policies to ban ""gossip"" and I feel like if you have to make a rule its because you have a problem. They steadfastly refuse to even acknowledge, let alone deal with the actual problem: The game itself is poorly made and isnt worth the inflated purchase price, or monthly membership in its current state.They really need to fix the game they released instead of releasing more broken code in updates that dont amount to more than an hour or so of playtime before looping to repeat itself. It's genuinely shameful that they think this is a product they should be proud of releasing.Listening to your player community is a hugely important part of developing a game based in social interaction and they failed that HARD several times in a row. They've taken to blaming the playerbase for our disappointment with their subpar releases at inflated prices, saying that we're upset because of datamining creating unfair expectations for them.If you want to experience the lore of the game, you'd be better off participating in a twitch streamer's breakdown or playthrough of the game."
Negative,"Bought the game just a few days ago and really enjoyed every minute I played.HOWEVER, do NOT, under NO circumstances, buy the game on Steam.This is the 4th time this week that steam users couldn't log into the game.Every other way to purchase the game is fine. Playstation, XBox, buying the game on their official website, everything works fine. Only steam users experience these problems.So while I would give the game a solid 9/10 and would RECOMMEND it to everyone who loved skyrim, I definitely wouldn't recommend buying it on steam."
Negative,"I downloaded this enormous game through steam, which went perfectly well.  When I launched the game, it attempted to update itself and failed, downloading and failing to verify the same 2 GB of data over and over.  After about 15 hours of this, I gave up and requested a refund through steam.  Since I never played the game I figured this would be no problem, but steam considered the 15 hours I spent trying to update as playtime and denied the request."
Negative,"So I want to start by establishing that there's a lot to like here. There is a 'bigness' to the world that means if you decide you want to explore, there's usually something to find. The stories are well-written, with plenty of interesting and detailed characters to meet. The problem though is in gameplay. Combat is, for want of a better word, boring. If you're playing overland, you'll be fighting seventy to eighty samey enemies who do no damage whatsoever, and die in two or three hits. You can't walk ten metres without drawing aggro and having to fight off boredom. Some veteran players argue that this means it's time to ignore overland and farm trials. The problem with this is the majority of the game, and the majority of its monetisation comes from the overland expansions. Until Zenimax fixes this problem, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to new players. Certainly, there's a great game in here. Potentially, a masterpiece. But without good gameplay, the story feels pointless."
Negative,"Great MMO, would highly recommend but for the love of GOD don't buy it on Steam. Downloads on Steam and then updates through launcher; if the update process breaks it you have to redownload it through Steam again; if you manage to get it working through the launcher and it decides to update through Steam again some day you'll have to do the launcher update AGAIN, which can cause it to break meaning you have to reinstall through Steam again. I've downloaded the same 80 GB of this game about 6 times now in my life. Those are like 240 hours I'll never get back.*Quick edit; Refused refunds for non functioning copy of the game from both Steam and Zenimax.*"
Negative,Pros: Great combat and amazing potential         Beautiful zone and dungeon design         Helpful and friendly communityCons: Developers don't listen to the community          Encourages children to gamble via crown crates          Diminishing returns for end-game players          No reward structure (best rewards available in cash shop only)          Unstable performance
Negative,played for 15 min. looked great was loving it. Kicked out for maitance they said today it says perminantly banned didn't even get thru the tutoral. Couldn't have done anything wrong. Paid for it. Can't play it BANNED before I could even see the outside world. Made my caracter and was learning the controls.
Negative,It's like Skyrim but they try their best to monetize any aspect that affects gameplay/ the players quality of life in game:(
Negative,cant get a god damn refund cause of the 8 hours of update on the game launcher
Negative,"I'm surprised this game doesn't have a mandatory subscription fee just to play, because every aspect of this game is monetised. Not only do you have to pay for the game, the expansions, the countless amounts of DLC.You also have to pay for the most basic features, which most games allow you to do for free.Want to change your character name? $$$Want to change your character appearance? $$$Want to change your characters race? $$$Want to change your characters faction? $$$Want additional character customisation? $$$Want to buy a cool house that isn't generic? $$$Want a crafting bag which you realise is pretty much essential after using it once? Part of the subscription fee. $$$Oh, it also has loot boxes, so it automatically gets a negative review from me.You expect this stuff in a free-to-play mmo, not one you pay for.If you can ignore all of that, and can live with spending hundreds on obtaining all the DLC and expansions - it's pretty good as far as MMO's go."
Negative,"Pay to Winboth in pvp and pve the strongest sets are in the new chapter and dlc dungeons or activities without them you are ALWAYS a step behind of those who owns them.some of the best pve sets are in dlc trials... at this time the strongest pve sets for stam dps are currently ""Perfect Tooth of Lokkestiiz"" and ""Perfect Arms of Relequen""  and guess what you have to own ""Summerset"" and ""Elsweyr"" you either have to buy ESO+ or get those two with crowns.Yes i know ZOS has to make money somehow but not like this => first You have to buy the game then you will need to pay monthly fee for ESO+ to access the old content and chapters but also you have to buy the new chapter tooZos how about adding lootboxes instead of skyshards? so we have to buy levelup points... it seems fun.also remove the skill trees and make something new like skill gems that only drop from CROWN Crates"
Negative,"Monetization is very predatory, not standing out in the MMO space, but that's like defending Edmund Kemper since he's not the worst serial killer.They make inventory space VERY small and charge you $14 a month to fix the problem. I'm sure there are people in Zenimax that care about this game, but until they actually stand up to the executives and monetization branch, they're all guilty of stomping on the consumer. It is pretty fun though.Edit: In case the Dev actually looks at this, my problem is limiting gameplay elements, like the inventory, and then selling the solution. Not with charging for DLC or selling cosmetics, if ESO+ was a worthy investment then you wouldn't have to sell the solution to the problem you created."
Negative,These people will suspend your account for no good reason. I would recommend not wasting your time or money.
Negative,I've fallen out of love with MMORPGs.  They're too vast with too many things you can do that in no way actually impact the world as you do heroic tourism.
Negative,"Okay, well firstly I should probably mention that I'm not a big fan of MMO's in general.  I'm more of a Single player fan or playing with a small group of friends on a self hosted game, privately.  My past experiences with MMO's or similar are games like WoW, GW and Neverwinter Nights; persistent world servers.  Like I say these really are not my cup of tea except for Neverwinter Nights being played with decent modules privately, either by myself or with friends. As for the Elder Scrolls games, I am a massive fan of Oblivion and Skyrim.  I love playing these, however I do not love playing Elder Scrolls Online and I shall explain why.I'm sure that I was not the only one who had high expectations of Elder Scrolls online when it was first announced and expected it to be an Online Skyrim of sorts.  Both Skyrim and Especially Oblivion were fantastic games.  Not just because of the Fantasy World for which they were based, but mainly for the Game Play.  They have a great formula of Game play mechanics that made them fun, immersive and addictive.   This is where TES online falls short.  It's not the same game at all. It's an Elder Scrolls Game on the outside, but on the inside it's something completely different.  The only thing that makes TES online a TES game is the Fantasy setting and lore it borrows from the previous TES games.  Apart from that the entire game play, mechanics, combat, User Interface, character design/levelling... EVERYTHING is a completely different game and in my opinion does not feel fun.Here I shall have just a short rant about the gaming industry these days: I don't know what it is these days that makes the AAA game developers of today make such a mess of things.  Are they trying too hard to innovate that they simply forget to check if what they are making is actually fun?  It's like they are rolling a dice and guessing what people will like instead of actually maintaining what works and building on it.  What happened to the good old days, back in the 90's and 00's?  Every sequel to a game was an improved version of the previous game.  They would pay attention and learn what made that game great and then they would keep those awesome features and simply improve on them or add to them.  What happened to that?   These days it seems they throw away good solid game play mechanics and replace them with new ones that suck.I feel that TES Online is yet another product of this kind of random development mentality.  Skyrim and especially Oblivion were great games with awesome successful game play mechanics(Although they did nerf out some good mechanics a little with Skyrim making Oblivion still that little bit better).  Already good solid fun game play mechanics there.  Why ignore this fact?  Why not re-use and create a version of those mechanics that work in favour of Multiplayer?  Why create something completely different that old TES fans will not feel comfortable with?  Was TES Online aimed at a different audience?   Did Bethesda nefariously do this to get regular MMO players of other games onboard and expect that old TES fans would still pay for this simply because it's called ""The Elder Scrolls""?  So now I'll elaborate on the game play mechanics I wasn't pleased with. The character stats and levelling is pretty poor and uninteresting IMO. When you level up you get one point to place in either Magicka, Health or Stamina and a few points to place into skills.  From what I can remember the skills are simply special moves.  I'm not very entertained by this.  I prefer being able to put points into Attributes that give an overall improvement to various things that your character can already do, like in Oblivion.  And I miss the variety of the Feats you can choose in Skyrim.  It seems to be completely different system and to me very basic, bland and uninteresting as I have found in other MMO's.  Again I'm not a fan of MMO's, so bare that in mind when reading this review.  I'm sure many other experienced lovers of MMORPG's will also love this game for its features.  Quickslots are for the Skills/Special moves.  But wait where are the quickslots for weapons and potions?  Oh that's right, there aren't any!  And you are not allowed to switch weapons during combat!!!   WHAAAAAT???  This is a horrible mechanic and eliminates any chance of strategic combat.  The weapon you have been fighting with is the weapon you finish fighting with.  No choice in the matter!  So if you find yourself in a scrap with a fireball casting mage or an archer and you are holding a sword, don't expect to engage in a ranged fight by switching to a Bow or Magic Staff!   Mind you the ranged AI Mages like to stupidly teleport straight in front of you, so you can smash them to death easily.  What?  Yes really!  My other gripe is with the rapid firing pistol bow.  Yes the Bow fires like a Pistol!  No need to press and hold to pull back the string to enhance range and there is no arrow dip.  Just keep smashing the mouse button like as fast as you like and your character will shoot that thing like an automatic weapon!  And there is no need to get arrows!  It fires them infinitely out of thin air!   It's like a fricken hack!  Pathetic!  No skill required.   The magic staves are no better.  They run on infinite charge and can also be fired like a rapid fire laser gun.  They are like Unreal Tournament Weapons!After starting the game it seems to take a very long time to acquire any armour.  I was running around in rags for hours before I finally scraped enough loot together to sell it for a bit of armour from a large town I found.  And it seems like every time I bought a piece of Armour I would soon after get rewarded with that same type of armour after completing a quest!  e.g. just bought a cuirass and then I get rewarded with a cuirass... Just an unfortunate coincidence, I am sure.The other thing I found or didn't find were recipes for food.  They seemed to be extremely rare early in the game.  Such a simple form of crafting, you'd think cooking would be something your character could start jumping into straight away. On a plus I do have to say that this was still a lot more interesting and fun to me than playing WoW and GW.  The quests were not as lame as those games and I definitely appreciated them more.  I was soloing them too, which is great, but it did feel odd seeing other players that I wasn't teamed up with running around doing the same quests at the same time as me.  It didn't really make much sense and kind of broke the immersion for me, but I guess I am more of a Single player fan and feel that Oblivion and Skyrim work better for me.  Now just a quick Rant about the hype of MMO's: Just my opinion, but when people say they get immersed in these MMO's, I don't believe them.  I think they are getting Immersion confused with Social Interaction.  These big online games just feel like big public virtual playgrounds where people can meet and socialise and partake in mediocre game play on the side.  Which is fine, but it's not my cup of tea.  Social interaction to me involves other preferences and Video Game play is separate.  But I do enjoy a good social a face to face board game occasionally. The other big plus with TES Online is the first person perspective view that is classic to the other TES games.  This is something that is sorely missing from other MMO's or just not done right.There may be a lot more I could talk about on this Game, but I think I've covered all that I need to.  I'm really glad and thankful that Bethesda give me a chance to try TES Online out for free, so that I can make an informed decision about whether or not to buy it.  I had seen reviews and had heard it wasn't that great, although I do prefer to form my own opinion and now I have it.  My conclusion is that just because you may love Oblivion or Skyrim, does not mean you will like this game.  TES Online is not for me."
Negative,"This game is a nightmare for inventory management, unless you are prepared to subscribe and pay ~£100 a year, crafting is a joke, vast amounts of your time will be wasted trying to either decide what to store in your highly limited storage space or clearing your bags of stuff. The Interface is also clearly created around a console controller, not having a separate PC interface is ridiculous"
Negative,When you first download the game a launcher pops up and makes you download the game again so you cant refund the game if you dislike it. thanks todd.
Negative,"Amazing game, graphics still holding on. Verrrrry friendly community.  Awesome story, fun questing. There is solo and multiplayer content. Easy and hard modes. The game is super grindy though. But that's expected from an MMORPG. However the only thing I REALLY hate about this game, is the subscription system. Even if you buy the whole expansion with previous expansions you will still be missing A LOT of content called DLC which you need to pay for EVERY month as a subscription.That for me was a complete mood killer. I payed for everything and I still missed so many contents which I for sure will not buy. I'm tired of watching my guild  doing trials(PvE Raids) that I can't enter even after buying the whole freaking game. So I'm saying good bye to this game until they turn off the ESO PLUS, which is most likely never.."
Negative,"Over the years this game has gone up and down. It started horribly, it got better, then much better. If you're into PvE, you'll like this game. Unfortunately, however, if you're in PvP, this game has been pure trash for years.No updates in PvP. The map is dominated by groups of 30+ noobs. Your only other options are either playing with a competent group or getting run down from groups of 30 players who don't know how to play, but they'll chase you for 5 solid minutes until you get overrun. Your only way to fight them is the same usual line of sight shit which btw Zenimax has been nerfing time after time to favor bad players.You have the option of playing in battlegrounds (4v4v4). Who the hell had this smart idea of putting 3 teams? Every time it's two teams jumping on the weakest one or teams splitting up because they're attacking different groups. Just like in PvP, if you're solo, you'll most likely get fucked by 2 teams seeing you alone and teaming up to kill you.Not to mention the lag is absolutely horrible and I play with cable. The optimization is bad. With an 8700k and an rtx 2080ti you drop to 15 fps in PvP. In other words, no matter what PC you have, the game engine is not designed for it. You'll never get good fps (strictly PvP).Every once in a while I come back to it just to be reminded why I quit."
Negative,"I've played this game for a bit. I really enjoyed my first 1000 hours and I made a lot of friends. But the developer hasn't been willing to address the fundamental balance issues between classes - the game is like a big pendulum that keeps swinging between magicka meta and stamina meta. Last year magicka builds were stronger too strong, this year stamina builds are too strong. Looking at the changes on the most recent Public Test Server for the next patch, it appears that the direction for this game isn't towards a more balanced meta in the near future.Buy if you enjoy rerolling a flavour of the month character every six months.Avoid if you want to feel invested in one character for an extended period of time."
Negative,Game got boring after the first 30 hours i guess my neck beard aint long enough yet 4/10
Negative,"It collects dust in my Steam library and I can't be bothered to redownload it because it's really, really huge."
Negative,Combat has no impact. Game play lackluster. Some stories ok since narrated. Content is pretty boring and game gives you very limited space in order to sell their 15 a month membership for crafting storage bag. A lot of game play locked behind the membership as well. Games Inventory management is a nightmare would not recommend this game in the current state feels dated and lacks characters and builds despite being so old. Got banned for making a trump meme.
Negative,Spent a lot of time on this game and ignored in game bugs until I started not receiving certain rewards in game. Contacting CS was a utterly pointless and fruitless game of ring-around-the-rosey. If a game has poor CS they obviously don't care and neither do I. Subscription cancelled and game uninstalled!
Negative,"game looks good and plays well until you start getting 334 error unable to connect to lobby, Once this starts it does not stop you cannot play. you do all the fixes they either don;t work or may work for 5 minutes maybe even 2 hours and then 334 error returns. Check google and see how many players are having this problem .This is an ESO problem which as usual gets blamed on clients rather than resolved at source. until fixed if you buy expect minimal fun maximum frustration"
Negative,"The game itself is fun, however I would strongly advise against purchasing it on steam. You are forced to log in through the steam launcher which has broken each of the last two weeks for me after maintenance updates. The only way I found to fix it is reinstall the entire game (60+gb) only for it to break again on the next maintenance. Steam offered no support on my ticket other than a generic ""you played for over 2 hours"" message denying a refund for what amounts to a useless product."
Negative,"STAY AWAY!  Until the developers actually put some work into making the game function the way it is supposed to, I recommend staying away.  It is a beautiful game and a lot of fun to play when it works.  The last 2 patches have made the game unplayable, with frequent crashes, and times when you can't login at all."
Negative,"I want to like this game, but I just can't. It markets itself as a F2P game. Despite maximizing my inventory across my housing (including purchased chests), banking characters, bank boosting pets etc, there is simply no way to manage all the herbs, reagents and other loot you'll find throughout the world. The only way to solve this intentionally created problem is by purchasing ESO+. One of the subscription perks is an unlimited size craft bag. I would be happy to individually purchase expansions, storage chests, etc without having a subscription but its not fun to play musical chairs with my inventory. I am also not impressed how they haven't added an in-game auction house to their game. It's been requested from the get go. Instead, you're forced to deal with addons and 3rd party websites. I appreciate the communities efforts helping alleviate this issue, but it's another easily resolved problem that Bethesda has consistently refused."
Negative,"Okay, so, I paid for the game which was about $70 down the toilet already. Downloaded the game and everything. No surprises there, download time was on schedule. Was happy that it ran well enough on my mid-tier rig. Right as I'm about to finish installing, the client basically says, ""Hey... Uh, by the way... We need you to pay $14.99 a month so you can play your $70 game... Sorry, but your initial cost isn't enough. <3"" Yeah...I mean if you're able to afford that subscription, great! But, if you're a student like me who has little money and better places to spend your time NOT grinding quests just to level up once for about six hours of work, probably not the game for you. I'm sure there will be downvote galore on my review, but I'm only here to warn people who haven't done their homework on this game that until something changes as far as how much you sink into this game, I'm going to not play that much for a single level. (Took me ~5 1/2 hours to level up once doing the high reward quests)"
Negative,"It pains me to put down a negative review on an Elder Scrolls game as it has always been my beloved franchise ever.But please, don't buy it if you are from Asia or anywhere in the Oceanic region.They don't have servers for any of these regions and fails to inform you upfront.Your gameplay will be choppy and has a annoying delay that ruins the experience and immersion. In addition, you will not be able to play pve, endgame pvp due to you having 300++ ping making every attack delayed and other players around you teleporting.Its a real bummer because i really wanted to experience Elder Scrolls online. Maybe I  will someday just power through the whole content in the game with a subpar connection but not today."
Negative,"I was going to pick this back up, but the fact that they sell your information to third parties now means I'm gonna forgo that. I have other games I can spend my time and money on."
Negative,Game sux 👍
Negative,"incredible login times even if you are a subscriber, not good. have been with this game for a long time, never had this happen before. Current login time now is over an hour, outrageous."
Negative,"Boring, repetetive, toxic community, but they learned the ways of being toxic subtle, so not to get suspended. Skill variety per character is minimal. World is all in stitches. loading screen for 3 meter corridor to new loading screen and then dungeon. Every house is loading screen. Every zone is loading screen. No open world. Trash economy and frustrating trading, as there is no common auction. Spend 2 hours running to different locations, running different traders to look for items I need. Silly guards system, when ashlander guards beat the crap out of character for stealing apple from imperial house. Most of game mechanics are blocked behind paid DLC. Same with most of the dungeons, zones, quests,  some classes, skills, crating skills. If you purchase basic poduct, it is like you buy a butchered betatest version where you will not be able to participate in 90% of things other players enjoy. There is subscription option too, if you think that you did not purchase enough things after you spend 200-300 euro. Good housing though. And some quest lines. But they abuse same situations over and over and over again. Didn't play through whole the content, got 3 different main quests asking to decide, which of the persons will die. No option to skip or save all of them. Want to finish a quest to proceed with story line? Take responsibility for killing 1 or more persons. And again, and again. And some times you DO pull the trigger too. Wish I could get my money back and never played it. Better pay for TES 3 and spend my time in Vvardenfell singleplayer."
Negative,"EDIT: Since everyone's moaning about my connection --- I am an American living in Taiwan.  Taiwan is an Earthquake region, so they can't just lay fiber-optic cable to improve everyone's way of life.  I am working with what is standard here... and from that... you get this review.   Likewise --- I do realize my review has nothing to do with the GAME PLAY but rather the MEMORY HOG that the game is.   When I had written this, I hadn't played even one minute... all because of the stupid loops and fire-walking after the initial Download.   That said --- STEAM User Atlana said it best in the comments:   Why couldn't ESO / LeniMax simply have included all the patches in the original download?  And why do we have to have 8gigs of unnecessary voice rendering in French and German downloaded? __________I am 52, I've been gaming since 1984.   I've gone through a lot, but always within the Sci-Fi / Fantasy RPG or FPS genre.   I love Star Wars titles, especially those where you get to play out the storyline as a character.  My favorite game is a little known title for the Atari ST (The first 1 megabyte system... boy have we come a long way) called ""Captive""But after 30 years.... this.... FIASCO... of a game plan.Right now STEAM shows that I have played 6 hours of this game.  That is a lie.  A Bold faced lie.   What I have done is waited and waited and waited for the opportunity to play.... without the actual ability to do so.   I bought this game THREE FULL DAYS AGO  (capital letters for stress, not to shout)  and as of yet, I haven't played one minute.  STEP ONE:  purchase the game.   It's on sale.  I have the money.  I loved Oblivion and Skyrim (still play both) so why not grab Tamriel Online?  Start to finish it only takes less than 5 minutes for me to purchase the game.  I buy Portal 2 with it (for a slight discount) and set about downloading both.  STEP TWO: Download the game.I have a new computer.  I only bought it 2 weeks ago.  It has 8g of RAM, it has another 4g of RAM on the video card.  It has a 1T Hard Drive.  It's souped up and ready to rock.   It's running WIN10 which I don't care for.  (This system is too intrusive and invasive.  It steals infomration rather than asking for it..... such as how I found the passwords from my Father-in-laws network in the Wi-Fi connections.... and he lives 400 miles from here!!!!!  WIN10 grabbed the info from my cellphone without my permission.)Anyway --- rocking system, I'm running both Wi-Fi and dial-up on it.  I start Download and then learn that this game has 56GIGS of information to download.Turn off monitor, go to bed, wake up next morning.   12% done... needs another 22 hours.TWENTY TWO HOURS.... for downloading a game.  I could do it faster if I had DVDs to swap!!!!!!  STEP THREE: the waitingOK it wants 22 hours to download, I will give it that.  I leave my computer on for the next full day and get myself busy elsewhere.... occassionally checking in to see how progress is going.   All in all it takes nearly 34 hours start to finish to download the game.  I even tried switching my access port to North Korea figuring the Communists probably don't have many gamers downloading over-bloated game content.I spent 7 years playing the original Guild Wars.   Great game... wonderful game... I still have all the Content Discs and all the expansions.    Last time I loaded it up... it took only 3 hours start to finish.  That was something like 14 CD swaps to load. 34 hours...... and I haven't played the game yet.  STEP FOUR: The hidden traps.OK, OK, OK, I have finally gotten the game installed.  I anxiously click on PLAY --- the intro screen graphics are amazing!!!!   PLAY...... and..... start downloading patches and updates.WHAT!!!!!For the next SIX HOURS -----  SIX STRAIGHT HOURS  ------- I watch as my system continues to download this memory hog.  At one point, after hours of waiting, I am at 99% after a few hours of getting there... I am literally drooling to get into this game.... I watch as it clicks from 99%..... to the next patch.  It took 2 hours to download one patch / update.I'm now beginning to wonder if ANYONE has ever played this game.Anyway.... six hours of waiting.... all patches downloaded... I finally get to click on PLAY (and really hopefully get to play this time....) It's nearly midnight on the 2nd day after I bought this game.....I click play.....You have to set up an account with Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited.WHAT!?!?!?   You mean you couldn't have told  me this FIRST while I was waiting for the stupid patches to download?!?!?!?Ok, Ok, Ok, how long can this take?  STEP FIVE:  Insanity upon InsanityOK, so I am directed over to ESO's website.  I set up an account.  My name ""BethelAbba"" Isn't taken (rarely is... it's a Hebrew phrase) I set up a password.  Go to Email ---- Find new Verification Email --- click on Verify.   Account Verified... Go back to STEAM..... click PLAY....  Enter account name & password.Account not recognized.Give me a break!!!!!!   I assume that SOMEHOW I managed to screw my password up.   Not usual, but it does happen.  I go over to ESO website, click out of my account, click to sign back in... and tell it I forgot my password.   Go to Email ---- find Password Reset Email ---- Click on link....... reset password.  Go Back to STEAM (see a pattern here?)..... click PLAY....  Enter account name & password.Account not recognized.No kidding.  No fooling.  No FREAKIN' WAY!!!I go back to ESO.... I review my account page thoroughly.  That's when I find out that I have to ""Choose an account option"" --- do I want to pay through the nose monthly to play a game I already paid good money for?  (Thank you Blizzard for this STUPID method of extracting more money from gamers.  It's precisely why I will never buy another Blizzard game as long as I live.)   Ok. Ok. Ok.   I choose that I don't want their stupid   PAY-PER-PLAY    crap... let me have a free account, I don't care if it's just basic and I don't get extra ""goodies"".  I'm not paying another cent for something I already bought.Run BACK to STEAM..... click on PLAY again... for the .... 4th time?!?!?  5th time?!?!?  6th time?!?!?  i've lost count now....  ESO Does not recognize this computer as Valid.   An Email has been sent to your account... please find code and return with that code.  Youhavegottobefreakin'kiddingme.RUN BACK TO EMAIL..... Find Code.... enter Code.... access validated... but now it is after midnight....I need to go to sleep.  CONCLUSION: Write sh*tty review I still haven't played one minute of this game.  It's been 56 hours now since I bought the game.... and all I have done is watch the ZeniMax intro... about 3 or 4 times actually.  I haven't set up a character.   I haven't watched a cut-scene.  I haven't spent a single minute actually playing the game, although STEAM shows 6 hours of game-time.What I have learned is that this game is the absolute worst memory hog in the history of Gaming.  That they have hoops for you to jump through which they don't even tell you about.   That they con you with promises of it being free-play... but then offer you a monthly subscription if you   REALLY   want to play.   I honestly hope my review gets 10000 thumbs up so that ZeniMax reads this and sees that people are fed up with this sort of crap.   56 hours.... and not one minute of game time.  If this is the future of gaming.... I'm bowing out now while I still have my sanity."
Negative,"I love this game, but  i hate the servers, why they just add another server? The lag is getting worse until now :("
Negative,"Liked:-Big world with a ton of stuff to do-Ability to play an Elder Scrolls themed game with friends and meet new people-You don't have to buy a subscription to be able to play this game-Community members eventually helped me out with supplies and took me through some dungeons, which was cool-""Marry"" a friend or aquaintance to gain a boost in skill learning while you two are online (or something like that, as I had bought but did not get to use this feature yet)Disliked:-Combat system-General community unfriendliness toward new players (at least, at first!)-It's pointless to not have a horse with how large the world is-Sudden change on minimum system requirements with Theives Guild DLC that renders this game completely unplayable to meself and many others (but if you read and accept the TOS and EULA you can't be too surprised)Basically, I was running this game just fine on Windows 7 with a DirectX version of 10 and personally received no warning that the DX requirement was going to jump to DX11 overnight with the Theives Guild updates.  While I enjoyed this game at the time and had gathered interest from several friends and relatives to join me in this game, I now cannot use this game until I buy a newer GPU.  I made sure to let my interested friends and relatives know about this change since we run very similar computer systems.  Due to this sudden change, they are no longer interested in purchasing this game, either.   At least I bought it on a Steam Sale and didn't get a chance to become interested in DLC or monthly subscriptions, so I'm not out a lot of money on this.   So while I liked this game for the short time I had it, I would be cautious of the future buisness practices of Zenimax."
Negative,"I love the Elder Scrolls series, a lot. But with an MMO of it being out for 4 years, it doesn't really seem like an Elder Scrolls game. It's gorgeous, the DLCs improved it, but it's broken. I already got kicked out of the server in the beginning. Plus, micro-transactions for a game you already paid for? It gets boring fast, the community is typical for an MMO, and grinding to get where you want to be is a pain in the ass. The battle system is wonky and really not challenging at all. You basically run circles around your foes, and there's an AoE coming from them that you expect and can dodge from poorly. I'm honestly waiting for Elder Scrolls VI, where I can take it all in at my own pace, level up, get decent gear, mounts that you don't have to spend realy money on, or a bunch of gold on and feel more accomplished than having to play catch-up in or fork over $$ to get where I need to be in the game."
Negative,"All the elements of a winning MMO but Zenimax customer support is AWFUL. If you have an issue and get locked out of your account or cant log into the game or website, its easier to burn your money and count it as lost savings instead of sinking in hours and hours and hours of trying to work with a Zenimax customer service report. Headbutting the outer curve of a wall is a more fulfilling experience than getting one email a day from your help ticket that was written without any urgency in helping you solve your gaming issues. If you do play this game, pick up superstitious bheaviors to increase your IRL luck or you could find yourself locked out of the game, too."
Negative,"No matter what version of this game you buy, you pretty much need the monthly subscription. This is relatively common practice for mmorpgs, but it shouldn't be so i'm still giving this entire thing a negative review simply because of that. This game is really just a money farm with a game disguise, but it's fun enough that I'm going to be one of the clowns that has a monthly subscription anyway. It's not worth playing unless you're okay with dropping money into a digital fire. Bethesda is an alright company at best that makes really good single player experiences so I'm just going to tell myself that the money I throw away is going towards a good cause and hope my conscience doesn't eat away at me after every play session (it will)."
Negative,"Thumb down, well actually it deserves a 'meh'. Its an MMO, so all the standard MMO stuff is in there I suppose.Why? I like Tamriel and I bought the game to explore that world far and wide. Although the textures are nice enough, it failed to bring that special Tamriel atmosphere alive. Every other player is running around madly on crazy mounts and rediculous outfits. Too many voice acting for my taste, and they sound kind of annoying (exception for Aldmer Queen).Endless questing! Ever quest starts with ""hey your just in time I need your help!"". You dont want to help them, but you have to..."
Negative,"Honestly, it's by far not the worst game or MMO in the world. It's fun in many aspects, and I wouldn't have played for hundreds of hours if it wasn't. But ultimately, the truth creeps in and you take a step back, only to see that everything you do in this game is pointless.First is the level scaling. Basically, the difference between a level 1 player and a maxed out one is skills (which you must buy with points gained through leveling), and a few points into health, stamina or magic. At end game, you can pump some points into overall damage output/resistance and an assortment of other boosts, but at your core, everybody is the same. This makes for some very anticlimactic progression, as you never really feel weak or strong, youre always in the middle. Did I mention that as soon as you level, your equipment scales down? So all of a sudden, unless you find some updated gear, you're in fact WEAKER.What?!Enemies are all the same. Skeletons, bandits, thunderbugs, who cares? They are all the exact same difficulty no matter where in the world you're located or what level you are, save for a few mini bosses and ridiculous super bosses. There's no strategy to PvE mobs outside of dungeons, and no matter how interesting a questline could be, it always boils down to ""Help there's ""insert enemy here"" attacking! Please drive them off with no difficulty whatsoever."" Seriously PvE is so easy and mindless, besides the story there's no point to it. Equipment! There's a ****ton of it. And you'll be sweapping gear out every 5 minutes. Remember in Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim, when you'd stumble across an AWESOME new sword that was way better than the iron garbage you had before, and then you'd never go back? Well this is not like that. Found a new weapon? Whoop-dee-doo. Add it to the stack of 30 brandless weapons and break em all up into parts. There is no thrill to finding new, better gear, as not only will it all drop into your lap eventually, but there is just so, so much of it. Your inventory will fill up so quickly with worthless stuff you'll think you were playing Diablo III.I got this game on sale, and it was worth every penny for sure. It was fun for a while and kept me entertained. But I value a game at how it leaves me feeling after I'm finished, and although you can't really ""finish"" an MMO, it didn't hold my attention for long once I figured out the formula. If you're expecting an Elder Scrolls game, stay away. If you're expecting an action MMO with some cool combat mechanics but a myriad of other flaws (level scaling I'm lookin at you), then give it a go."
Negative,"Buy the stand alone if you want to get into this cash grab. Otherwise you'll end up spending more time with zos and steam customer service pointing the finger back and fourth while you wait to reinstall everytime there is an update. Its unavoidable, just check the Reddit's and offical forum threads. I've got almost 4k hours on PS4 decided to pick it up after my transition to PC. Game is ok for newer players, but you'll either lose interest during the grind to 50 or because ZOS has their hand out for money with very little content everytime you turn around. Most of the development team is tied up in the Crown Store leaving content lacking. The entire game could be down and by George the crown store would be up and running ready to take your hard earned cash. Player base has been steadly declining and growing more divided between orginal day 1 players and new players. CP is a joke to grind for after about 300CP it's just a symbol of whos nolife'ed the most. The PVP is god awful. Just level a templar or warden dps and then go healer. You'll never struggle for groups and you'll make crazy ap all while being half baked and spamming a few buttons. The game takes very little actual skill or knowledge making it easy for newer players but very frustrating for vetran players. Look on youtube or reddit for 5 minutes and you'll have a build and rotation in no time. Just takes a bit of practice everyday and you'll be top teir. No real IQ or skill involved. PVP is just pressing a button or two and wiping zergs. It's cool if you're into the whole RP thing too that community is most of what seems to be ESO now on PC."
Negative,"I love the game, but I will not recommend it to any working person in the EUThere's high chances that you'll not be able to play due to server maintenance and waste money you spent for ESO plus.Really, I like the game (look at my hours!), but the way the EU Servers are treated has always been unacceptable."
Negative,"this game is such a disapointment, the story line sucks big time, the game play is okay but its nothing special. The thing that annoys me most about this game most though is that it is so far from any other elder scrolls game, so many of the things that made the elder scrolls what it is are missing, there are no permenant followers, enchanting isnt the same, it involves runes and armour can be enchanted away from enchanting tables, magic is a special ability and not a primary weapon (unless using a staff), character animations seem, well more animated and less realistic and the spectacular vissuals of skyrim are totally absent. The ability to paint armour was nice but doesnt really add anything."
Negative,"I wanted this game to be amazing, put so many hours into it and bought many expansions just to see how things progressed. But overall it’s mediocre at best, it doesn’t do anything great.The dungeons are easy, the pvp has been broken for years (funnest part of the game) and the fact everything levels up alongside you means that there will never truly be a challenge.The storyline was ok, the expansions ok, fighting sub par…I’m sorry I don’t even want to write a decent review for the game because it’s just mediocre.Got my moneys worth in time played but definitely never got any satisfaction and don’t miss it."
Negative,"It's an amazing game, but the memory leak bug still exists, causing steadily degrading FPS. It complitely ruins the experience. Moving onto console."
Negative,"Game suck, i go to bed"
Negative,"This game used to be great. The story is awesome. combat is unique. crafting is a very in depth system. BUT, they recently killed the game for me and anyone else who enjoys PVP with friends. You can no longer queue for a battleground while in a group. So no pvp with your friends.. In an MMO. The middle M in MMO stands for something. MULTIPLAYER. I have unsubbed and uninstalled this game and do not intend to reinstall or ever recommend someone to play it again. 0/10 Game is pointless."
Negative,"Zenimax Online is disappointing more and more by the day. They have this precious gem that is The Elder Scrolls IP, with beautiful scenarios and interesting NPCs (with a ton of voice-overs!), a quick paced combat and the best player's house system I've ever seen in games. I can't deny that the whole housing thing has me attached to ESO in such a hold, no other game compares. But sadly, the crown store (very expensive premium currency bought with real life money) seems to be their focus instead of in-game content.The quite constant changes to skills and set items are bothersome; they try to achieve a miraculous balance between PvE and PvP instead of splitting. They nerf something cause it was overpowered on PvP, killing it for PvE, and vice-versa. It's a back and forth from hell and no one's getting happier.The in-game events hardly change for the better. The mechanics for in-game obtainable items (like pets, costumes, furniture) are being extrapolated every time more (for example, in Morrowind chapter you could farm 7 different pieces in a public dungeon and gather them to get a pet, and another 7 different pieces in the other public dungeon to get a costume; in High-Isle, last year chapter, you had to farm 50 pieces (!!!) to get a pet from the public dungeons (25 from one and 25 from another)). So they are making you spend more time to get the same kind of items you did before, instead of having more (new/different) things to be done.There are bugs with more anniversaries on their backs than a lot of children out there. And sometimes, when fixing a bug, they cause others.There is no effective gold sink. In contrast to other games, you cannot farm enough gold and use some of it to buy the plus membership, nor premium currency (not even limited times or amounts). After a while there's pretty much nothing meaningful to be done with gold. Even the huge houses (that could be a big gold sink) are hardly ever sold via gold, costing in the range of 10000 to 17000 crowns.Until yesterday, you could at least trade your gold for crown store items (as in buying crowns from other players, at your own risk, using the gifting system); today ZOS has disabled this kind of trade, with no warning whatsoever, with no estimates of ever re-enabling such feature ever again and with no alternatives of any kind.Me being such a house crazy, it killed like 70% of my will to play the game. All the things I was saving for and planned to buy from the crown store through other players are pretty much gone now (a lot of house items are only obtainable via crown store, not dropping in game nor being crafted)."
Negative,Update: The horrific experience of trying to update this game alone should keep most people away. I am on a 300mpbs connection and yet can't manage to sustain more than 900kbps on the patcher. I really wanted to give this game another try but the launcher is so poor I can't understand why anyone still plays this game honestly. Not sure if this game still shows me as only playing 5.5 hours but I played a lot more than that. This is a pretty well-made game. The bad news is that it has the same pointless grind-for-gear feel that so many MMOs suffer from. Levelling becomes excruciatingly slow and boring and after a while you wonder why you'd even bother. I don't play games that feel like a second job. If I wanted a second job I'd get one. I want fun. This game can be fun - but just getting to max level is a pain and besides looking for better loot it really feels like the game goes nowhere. The PvP warzone is kind of fun - but it's so chaotic and you spend most of your time just getting shot in the back. It doesn't feel very skillful and quickly burned out for me. Maybe if I had done more large scale raiding or something but ultimately I just didn't see what made me want to play this MMO over any others. The truth is - this is a solid game but it's just like all the other grind for gear MMOs out there with labour intensive quests that are repetitive and don't feel like fun. I personally prefer a game like ArcheAge simply for all the crazy stuff you can do - like get killed and robbed. Newbs may not like it - but at least there are other things to do than wander around collecting bug sacs. Don't get caught in the grind. If a game feels like a job - you're either playing it wrong or the game is the wrong game. Life's too short.
Negative,"Zenimax are incompetent, Rich Lambert especially is a brain-dead troglodyte. If you want to play this game expect to be disappointed every update, be ready for disgusting monetisation practice and the most sensitive playerbase of any MMO."
Negative,"Every patch, update, or new chapter they find new and exciting ways to make the game not work or completely change core fundamentals that have been in place for many years. Would not recommend to new players as they will never reach end game at this point."
Negative,"So despite paying so much for DLCs, they force you to pay SUBSCRIPTION just to be able to store the crafting materials? So the crafting as an integral part of any MMO, you hide behind a subscription? Why would you shit on us like that?"
Negative,"Base game on sale, very much worth it-as a long-term commitment, not as much. I'm mixed. You'll love it, and hate it.As the years have gone by, bugs have gotten worse with little to no fixing. There have been numerous DLC quests that will force you to abandon it and restart that whole thing again (High Isle and Necrom most notably which have been their latest entries) as well as unstable servers and countless other issues. Devs seems to care more about the cash shop than making sure the game is healthy and use FOMO for events and monthly goods. There's a lot to like which makes this painful, housing, outfits, world exploration, it's all well done when it works. Stories can be hit or miss depending on the zone. Another issue are the ever-so-mysterious social restrictions, which require very little interaction to get.  Randomly, it will not allow you to interact with other players via chat or trade and they block you off the auction house vendors. I takes about a week for support to fix it.Meanwhile, other players can spam hatred, bigotry, use bots and nothing happens to them. The game does have a test server which is nice, but rarely do they listen to any feedback and issues on the test server will often make it to the full release. I want to recommend the game, but the devs make it so hard to do so. It deserves better."
Negative,"So I started playing this game this year. At the time of writing I have 300+ hours. It is not friendly to new players despite outward appearances. Crafting takes months and a full year to utilize fully. It does not transfer to new characters. You will need to visit the stable master to max out your mount, which takes 180 days. This does not transfer to new characters, either. New characters requires you to grind out skyshards which takes hours upon hours, or shell out a hundred bucks depending on how many skill points your character needs. After max lvl there is champion points which go all the way up to 3600. This is the only thing that is across all characters. Weeks of farming has left me with just under 400, so if you just start playing be prepared to get newbie discrimination. You'll be playing with people with over 2k all the way to max. If you pick a class and role like I did which isn't 'meta' (I chose templar tank) well good luck getting into any end game content. Templar tank has been bottom tier since inception almost a decade ago, and dragon knight top tier (tanking wise, healing templar is top and dragon knight is bottom) there hasn't been any class balance in ten years. Like, really? If I want to make another character, well I gotta spend money to get those skyshards.  On another note, the game becomes unplayable without a subscription if you plan on crafting, you need the bottomless pit bag that comes with it.The PvE player base and community is a joke. If you've played other MMOs and thought dps players are always dumb as a bucket of rocks, this game takes that to a whole new level. 25% of the time you get DPS players that try and speedrun through dungeons and end up aggroing everything and wiping the group. 25% of the time you get dps that do no damage. It is mostly the game's fault. The game itself doesn't teach anybody anything about useful skills or rotations.The other half are decent, but make no mistake this is baby's first mmo. Lots of people in this game don't know how to spend 5 minutes to read a guide to know boss fight mechanics or how to make a build as to not do no damage. If as a new player you want to explore a dungeon or do a quest, you can forget about it. Other people will always ruin that experience.PvP is a broken unbalanced mess. Not far off from any other MMO, so no comment.Fashion and transmog are a joke as well. You need to spend millions of gold to buy the style pages and motifs from other players. Good luck with that as a new player. Spending real world money won't even get you anywhere.Player housing isn't my thing, but if you like it, be prepared to again spend lots of real world money.If you like questing and don't care for end game, there's an unfathomable amount to see. The quests are literally endless, there's thousands of them. Be warned, they offer little to no reward though. You could complete hundreds of quests and receive absolutely nothing gear or gold wise. They hardly give XP past max level. For champion points, quests are absolutely NOT the thing to do as they can be very time consuming and give hardly any XP. There's a few titles and such for completing story lines which is nice. The stories and the journeys are the reward, not my thing but if it's yours then you'll have a good time. One thing I do like about this game is that in the open world, it does 'feel' like an MMO. Even in a zone you'd think was dead, you're bound to run into someone doing something. The open world is easy, many will say too easy and I agree. you will never die unless you fall to your death trying to get a skyshard.There's trading guilds, socializing guilds, fashion guilds, and housing guilds. These are the people who don't do 'playable' content and live for the socializing. Once I was in a cave in a random place trying to find a skyshard, and I came across a bunch of people fishing and chatting. It piqued my curiosity and I stuck around for a bit. That was something I haven't seen in almost 17 years in something like World of Warcraft, which was nice. It's not my cup of tea so I can't say much about it, but it's there.PvE group content this game fails hard. It's the worst I've ever played. Grouping for a random dungeon via the dungeon finder is a coin toss between disaster and smooth run. The gatekeeping end game content because of specific class roles, because the developers haven't made class balance changes since launch in 2014 is abysmal. Questing and story is the possibly the best if you don't consider the no rewards ever given. So for group content, no I would never recommend this game. For questing and story, I'd say play for free. For socializing, maybe. Again, try for free."
Negative,"When you buy this game, you buy a little content with endless adverts to pay more, or else you must painfully grind riding speed, inventory space, crafting (which takes several MONTHS for all researches). This might be ok for some free-to-play game, but here, the ads for ""optional"" things that have no business being charged extra in a full priced MMO never stop. Even the ""optional"" Plus subscription does not save you from being coerced into spending more money regularly. You want to change your class? Tough luck, not supported - but you are ""welcome"" to grind a new character and its skill points, which turns a game that is supposed to be fun into a part-time job. Spend your money on something better like Final Fantasy XIV, GW2 or even (hear, hear!) WoW. Those games have cash shops, too, but at least they offer a fun experience mostly undisturbed from P2W ads.Quick reply to Bethesda's spokes drone: The statement that you are ""ensuring not to ... encourage players to make a purchase due to a disrupted experience"" is a plain lie. I've given more than enough examples above. You _are_ actively promoting and selling ""solutions"" to the artificial grinds you and nobody else created in the first place, a classic F2P trick."
Negative,Do NOT purchase through Steam. Constant exclusively Steam related server issues. Get it through the official store instead.
Negative,"Love the game but big issues right now with eso/steam servers. Get used to seeing ""Can't log in"". Downvote for now until this is fixed."
Negative,100 gb for this combat system? Uninstalled.
Negative,- bought the game- has been trained- got a lifetime ban 5.1/5.2- an unforgettable gaming experience
Negative,"Even if the content of the game is cool the monetization is atrocious enough to give the entire game a thumbs down from me. What are lootboxes doing in current year, in a game with paid expansions, a cosmetic cash shop, pay-for-utility, zone AND dungeon DLC, and a subscription fee? The only money-extraction method this game doesn't have is a battle pass."
Negative,"dont use any type of chat if you play this game, toxic players an even more toxic support,they dont care how long you played,or how much money youve spent,i do not recommend this game to anyone,not to mention its old an they sell broken DLC,they are all a bunch of leftist ( woke crowd ) gameplay is a joke, dont mind the playtime you can leave the launcher run,i own ten DLC all the most expencive, an i get game ban for sissy stuff, what a joke."
Negative,"A decent MMO, with acceptable if somewhat floaty/not very punchy combat, some well-written quests that respect the lore (it is nice that both ZoS and Bethesda work together on the lore), OK classes that allow some customization (there are builds for all types of armor and weapons), decent dungeons and a pretty interesting world to explore.My biggest problem with the game is the aggressive monetization, as the game tries to nickle and dime you at every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ opportunity (the monthly sub, although optional feels mandatory, the crafting bags is essential, otherwise you'll get flooded with crafting materials, and you'll run out of bag space easily, also you lose access to the bag and the materials stored in it as soon as the sub expires, even smaller DLC are pretty expensive, but at least you get them for free if you pay the monthly sub, still you lose access to them if not subbed or if you don't buy them separately with Crowns, you can pay for bag and bank space, you can pay to train your mount faster, you can pay to buy skill points, you gotta pay for better/bigger houses, for additional char slots, for name changes, for race changes, the game's chock-full of lootboxes, you gotta pay for more loadouts if you wanna try more skill/armor/weapon combinations, and you don't wanna respec every 5 minutes, you can speed up researching gear traits, as it can take up to 30 real days for a single trait, and you have limited slots for these researches, and the list goes on) and I don't feel like dumping a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of money for the sake 'convenience', when the game was designed in such a way that most of these optional purchases feel mandatory, for a better experience.Also, the PvP leaves much to be desired, as it feels like complete garbage most of the time, with randoms unwilling to complete the objectives (just going for most kills, running around getting themselves killed), classes feeling unbalanced and if you don't get at least second place in the leaderboards, you get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you feel like you've just wasted 10–15 mins (Zenimax could really do something to make the experience less ♥♥♥♥).Despite these drawbacks, I'll continue to casually play the game from time to time, as there's fun to be had, especially with friends, but I can't really wholeheartedly recommend this MMO."
Negative,"As someone who was quite enticed into getting it, and was really wanting to get into ESO, I just looked at it and was like, okay I'll try it, give it a shot.. Navigated the menus, looked through the store in game, I stared at it for about five minutes.. I am astonished by how much Zenimax is frothing at the mouth for your money, what Steam says here is a lie basically, The Collection isn't much, it's a fair few major areas yes, but in the grand scheme of things, for something which is ALMOST a decade old, it is simply not worth it. The ingame store has a DLC tab which lets you buy ""Chapters"", which are basically Pay 2 Win masked by adding in places like Markarth and so forth, to then even get a good place to stash all the shit the game will throw at you, cause remember, this is basically Skyrim on meth and a Bethesda Title, they will throw everything you could ever find at you, causing you to think that you need it for a quest or something, or grind for it to get said quest, to only then realise you have no inventory space cause there's a cap, but oh no, you gotta buy a MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION to then get a CRAFT BAG to stash all your items.. What's the point, just make it a subscription game if it's gonna be like that.. They removed the subscription when it first launched, then got it back and made it effectively pay 2 play, otherwise we'll send you a torrent of items you'll wanna keep but can't put it in an infinite pouch or chest like in their singleplayer titles.. I think you'd have a better chance with Fallout 76."
Negative,"The graphics, music, and controls are very nice and the story seems decent for an MMO.However, I really dislike the scaling system. Becoming weaker immediately after leveling up is horrible. Because of this, I have almost no desire to play this game."
Negative,Too much down time. Server not available. THey can't deliever what they are selling.
Negative,I regret buying this.
Negative,"The game itself, the universe it is set in, the content and the lore from Tamriel are amazing of course. That is where my positivity runs out. Go play single player Elder scrolls games if you want the same feel.Negatives include:- Bugs and exploits prevalent after every patch, no evidence of Quality Control or testing- Extremely unpopular or unnecessary changes made to the character classes every 3 months, with requests about prior bugs or over performing/ borderline unfair skills or sets of classes launched as if nothing was ever noted.- Inept Management of the game, if they want something in, it goes ahead despite player feedback, suggestions or any issues it causes when put into forum feedback threads-The best communication I ever had was an extremely friendly team who restored some deleted characters, kudos and thumbs up to those individuals! <3- Zero communication to the player based overall, the forum devs even acknowledged they need to do better in this regard and then explicitly did not do better and even ignored/ removed inquires about this from players.-  No listening when players (who product test on PTS for the game devs for free), note or make evidence of issues being actioned, sometimes given up to 2-3 months in advance from PTS and still put onto the live servers,- Utter garbage mishandling of a beautiful and lore-rich game universe.- Issues with the cash shop or crown store are fixed 'quicker than immediately' when noticed everytime, - Issues with general character, story, game QoL or anything that doesn't provide an instant cash grab is left alone for months at a time, or even, told its too hard and will be now a feature of the game- I've reported myself, inclusive of video evidence on more than one occasion using Cheat Engine in PVP and PVE environments, not even a temporary ban or response about the videos from the ticket report and support team(s).- Increasingly lacklustre 'Chapters' which are DLC that are renamed so Zo$ could go back on their statements for 'subscriptions allow you to access DLC for free' and then continue to charge yearly for another quarterly degenerate 'Chapter'. Review the chronology online of the chapter releases and look at the reduction in quality of inclusions and also increasing price.Just do not get into or continue, if you feel the need to play, at least do not pay subscriptions or buy in the Crown store. The game is rubbish and only currently getting along as there is not much better that has been released"
Negative,"Do you like random crashes, long loading screens, maintenance leading to not being able to connect to the servers for hours? Then look no further this is the game for you!"
Negative,everything is great but the gameplaythe gameplay is definitely one of the most repitive I've ever played
Negative,"This is going to be an honest review from my personal experience with ESO. (1) Your character is very dull and often stupid when it comes to quests. (2) Many of the plots aren't really that great as you can usually see where a quest will go (betrayal, who will get killed, etc.) To the flipside of that however, there are indeed good quests such as Imperial City, Clockwork City, and Vvardenfell of which I really enjoyed. (3) The PVP is just bad, no way around it, if you aren't meta you will be beaten 9/10 times. Also one man should not be able to take on an army of players, that just isn't realistic... and the fact that a LOT of people can do this just frustrates PVP. (4) Nerfs and buffs come in and out like used towels... seriously, I understand that there are problems every now and then with overpowered builds, but COMPLETELY changing a skill is not a good idea; it hurts players honestly, most people don't want to change their build every other patch. (5) I love the character creation, very in-depth, and the cost of cosmetics is usually pretty cheap if you're like me and love all those different outfits and armor skins. (6) As far as the community is concerned, I think there are more trolls and toxic people than well-to-do or helpful players. (7) There are so many options and skill lines to choose from that you can have a lot of fun with plenty of ESO and not get burned out quickly. I find a lot of the PVE content such as raids, exploration, and dungeons pretty enjoyable. (8) As an overall, I won't recommend this game, there are just far better games and MMOs out there... but this is Elder Scrolls, and I love the ES series; if you do too then I would tell you to at least give this game a shot, everyone's experience is different and I would say mine is half-and-half on this one. :)"
Negative,"Oh boy, do I have alot to say about this game.I've played this game on and off since late 2015, it's amazing. ESO has some of the best combat and gameplay for an MMO. You can spend thousands of hours in this game and still have loads of fun and still have surprises thrown at you.I love those aspects to death, however it's all overshadowed by the fact that the game is BEYOND unplayable at the moment. Server issues are constantly a problem, especially in dungeons & pvp  (two of the biggest aspects of the game, with the latter being what i do) and ancient bugs are still there. Attacks don't register half the time, meaning you have to hit your attack key 5 times to get a chance at using your attack, you're literally helpless against someone that can attack while you can't despite this happening to every player. The server will disconnect you very often (probably related to every other server issue this game has) and there's nothing you can do about it.Basic aspects like the mail system barely work, wait 5 minutes for your mail to arrive after you buy something, or log out and log back in while risking being locked out due to server issues. According to what many friends and other people have said to me, the LFG doesn't work for DPS characters. I can't confirm this since i play a tank, sorry if that's wrong.There's MUCH more I could add to this list of issues, but I think what's there should be a decent enough example."
Negative,Tried during free weekend. registering is annoying.iam reminded befor creating a character that iam a poor person and do not own the High Isle upgrade and will not experience or have a chance to experience the full game. im sure this would come up even if you buy the base game. expansions are fine but befor even trying or starting the game your waving this in your face is a quit moment alone....iam also guessing imperial is the best race cuz you need to buy that apparently.Old game yes thats fine. but why @ 1440p does the game look like its in 1080p and upscaled? ui looks blurry AF same with general graphics.also there are like 500 TOS pages that you need to agree to. WTF is this? i cant be arsed reading all this. i just clicked accept 4 or 5 times. Bethesda probably now own my future offspring and what little is left of my soul.i didnt get past the character creator. my in game play time is inflated due to having a 2nd game launcher open....if you like bad games and enjoy playing bad games and telling yourself its a good game.i have great new for you. this is a game for you/For the rest of you Sane people take a PASS.
Negative,"You want to have a good build?....Pay/Grind for it!You want skins? Grind/Pay for it!You want to travel to all part of the map? then you need to pay!You want to have access to all stuff in the game ? then pay for membershipPay , Pay , Pay , Grind , Grind , Grindinstead of playing this go get a life you will enjoy it more!"
Negative,"I purchased this product over two weeks ago. I have worked with their customer support almost daily, and tried many ""fixes"". they recommended. I believe that they are trying to help, but it appears to me that tgere is a flaw in their Launcher. I have not been able to launch under Steam, or through their desktop icon. There are no error messages; the Launcher counts up to 100% and then just goes away. I have tried every potential fix I can find online. Has anyonme recently found a solution to this problem under Steam?"
Negative,Do NOT buy on steam. So many steam server related issues
Negative,I wish I could get a refund but turns out you cant get a refund for 4 hours even though most of it was spent in the launcher.
Negative,"Zenimax does a great job at marketing and hyping the game, so much so that they pulled me back into playing it after forgetting why i lost interest to begin with. It took me too long to realize its just a PRETTY BUT EMPTY WORLD full of fetch quests, repetitive dungeons and bland dialog that just become an obstacle impeding your progress. The main reason i have come to hate this game is simple, its a HALLOW SHELL OF THE ELDER  SCROLLS world and its missing the magic of a good rpg. I haven't played many MMO's but this one has more than a few flaws. It takes away the feeling of accomplishment in a few ways. FIRSTLY progression is super slow i spent almost 100 hours and felt like i didn't have anything to show for it, all the armor i looted was bland and ugly.  SECONDLY monsters lvl along with you. which means you can play with anyone no matter what lvl they are, but the monsters just become an infuriating nuisance rather than an opportunity to see your progress based on how quickly they are defeated. FINALLY like many MMO's the premium subscription is almost required and there are several pay walls. Please don't buy it unless you like torturing yourself and want to spend 1,000-10,000 hours and realize none of it matters and you've wasted your money and time. You could have been learning a language or learned a real world skill but you decided to reach max lvl. The truth is you'll never be even close to the top there will always be better players than you. All the time you've spent sucking up to your annoying, crude, pre pubescent guild mates brought you nothing, your life sucks enough already, don't make it worse."
Negative,"TL;DR i played 60 hours of this game and its fun, but i reinstalled skyrimThinking about buying this game? Going to buy it anyways? Here's what I wish reviews had said:When you start, just grab all the gear in the armor room and equip it all to get the skills.You only gain skills by doing things. Speechcraft has been completely removed. Mage's guild gives persuade, Fighters guild gives intimidate.As opposed to other elder scrolls games, selecting your class locks your character into 3 trees of skills to unlock.Lots of items are worth 0 gold, just throw them out. If you need any of those items for crafting etc, you can buy full stacks from the vendor for cheap.This isn't an elder scrolls game, but it is an insanely good MMO for the pricetag even not on sale. Inventory management UI mods for selling the junk makes this playable. Inventory is unusable in 'free' subscription without them. This reason alone is why I dont recommend it. If i wasn't a 20+ year MMO veteran, the inventory system would have made me quit. There's no skimpy gear. But I've gone 20 levels without gear equipped and feel no challenge whatsoever as a Templar.The gear system is more akin to Diablo.The crown store is absolute cancer, but they do give you 500 free crowns when you buy the game.If you are going to play every day, you can get most of the p2w currencies with the login bonuses.It's like a poorly rigged and animated cross between guild wars and wow with lots of stuff you'd love from both haphazardly thrown into the elder scrolls universe with new lore unfriendly awkward mechanics."
Negative,fix your servers people are over it and you will lose huge customer base
Negative,"This game took everything I love about The Elder Scrolls series and threw it into the dragon fires (the same way I'm going to be after posting this review). It's really hard for me to build a character I feel special about, or even get involved in all the mysteries unfolding in Tamriel, when there are guys on bears running in circles and shouting at each other to trade items. I keep trying to get into this game, but between all the grinding and crown-addicts it's just hard for me to do. I suppose what I'm trying to say is - just loving The Elder Scrolls series is not enough. You have to be into online gaming at least a little bit, which apparently I'm not. So for myself, I cannot recommend this, but for people who love online games - go for it."
Negative,"Although the game does have some great features, I find the game play itself is very tedious. The quests are mostly running back and forth and/or up and down the map to only get sent on yet another run back to somewhere or other. Then, if you actually get to an end dungeon, there is the most feeble of rewards. Same result if its a loooooooooong story quest chain. Anything of use that I acquire seems to be only in locked chests scattered around the map. Crafting???? Yes, but it is extremely tiresome to even take seriously unless you enjoy constant scrounging and excessive time. Even the ""dungeons"" consist of the same tired enemies one after the other. There are far better games and I am sad to say this falls far short if you played Dungeon and Dragons Online, World of Warcraft, or some of the other MMORPG titles."
Negative,This is an amazing game and I would recommend anyone to pick it up and play it.BUTDO NOT buy this through steam. You will have countless nights of not being able to log in due to Steam Login Errors. Avoid getting this game through steam at all costs.
Negative,This is the worst experience I have ever had on Steam.I got the log in problem for two days in three days.If you cannot run this game properly. Please refund the money to everyone and remove this game from your list.Thank you very much.玩了三天 两天登陆不上 玩个蛋!
Negative,"Too much money, not enough depth.The first, second and maybe third playthrough is fun, if you try all three alliances. After that, expect to pay some serious cash.They've begun including older ""expansions"" for free players. But, as they have been doing ""year long adventures"" for a while now, you will not be able to access the ""dungeon dlc"" or zone dlc unless from that adventure unless you pay for them, or gain access through subscribing.I believe they started doing year long adventures AFTER the ""daedric war"" storyline, which was some of the last good content they made. Since then, all ""expansions"" and zone dlc have been fairly shallow. Both in terms of scope and story. There will always be some new evil faction every damn dlc or expansion that you're supposed to care about, even though they're all forgettable and generic. But don't worry, you'll be able to buy their crafting style eventually for 35-50$.Then there's housing. Any decent house costs a pretty penny. Some are available with gold, but you will need alot. You can either grind, or exploit the markets using TTC like every other grindset millionaire with a youtube and twitch channel. Or you can, of course, buy it with real money. Even if you buy one of the largest houses, youll only have 350 furnishing slots. You can double that up to 700 by subscribing. Of course.Ever since crown crates were introduced, they've been shilling them hard every time there's a new type. They make an unbelievable amount of money off of them. They did eventually introduce the endeavours system which allows you to get an in game currency that lets you purchase most of whats in the crown crates, but there's a couple problems. You have to save up for a few weeks to get anything decent. And, the simple stuff is way too overpriced. For example, a riding skill book for your mount to increase its speed and such, isn't worth getting. They want you to have to do that with gold every day so you keep coming back. Same with daily rewards. Sometimes it has good stuff, but the ultimate purpose is to keep people coming back, every day.The end game pve is unreachable unless you're staying on top of the meta, and can afford to. Upgrading gear to gold costs an exorbitant amount of gold. And the meta is changing constantly. The skills you have to use is changing. The class you have to use is changing. The champion point perk tree setup you have to use it changing. Keeping up with it all is not worth the effort. When it comes to pvp, it's in an acceptable stage right now. The main pvp zone, cyrodiil, had terrible lag for years. If there were any major battles, it was not uncommon for people to disconnect. And you could guarantee that you would experience audio problems with certain setups. Now the lag is mostly fixed, but the pvp hasn't fundamentally changed for a long while now. The last two major changes they made were to add volendrung, a hammer than randomly drops on the map and can destroy keep walls quickly, and destructible bridges/gates, which ended up being useless because they can be repaired far faster than they can be destroyed. Even by just one person. You have to constantly shoot it with siege engine to keep it flagged so nobody can repair it. Even if you did, it's still useless because all alliance areas still have at least one tunnel that allows them through, and I myself have found other paths around the gates. The battlegrounds are decent, but you dont get access to your champion points, which is basically like a point based perk system. And, you'll probably end up with a stupid team. I could go on and on. Bottom line is, this game has hostile design. Designed to keep you playing, for as long as possible. I keep coming back to it, and I really couldn't tell you why. I mostly only do PVP because it's fun, everything else has that elitist meta worshiping pve culture around it. PVP has a meta as well but theyre far less afraid of trying out experimental builds. Much easier people to talk to and hang out with as well. Pve people are always so damn busy waiting for their trials in belkarth or checking their sales. Like it's all a second job to them. And then they whine and grown when a pvp event comes around.Well, I posted this review when I had 3k hours. Make of that what you will."
Negative,"The Crown Store is by far the most ridiculously overpriced scam I have ever seen in any game ever. It's literally $50 for a crafting style. If you've played WoW, imagine having to pay $50 PER TRANSMOG SET. DLCs are the same. There's about a thousand of them, each the price of a standalone AAA game, and if you don't have the right one, you can't access certain sets that are BiS for your build. And you can't know this until you've already purchased the base game, so it's not until they've already got some of your money that you find out they require an even larger sum than you paid for the base game just to have access to sets required by your build. So you can either buy it or your character sucks. I have NEVER seen greed on this level before anywhere in the history of civilization. Seriously, the audacity required to charge the amounts they do is unbelievable. They might as well mug you in the street, you cooperate and give them your wallet, then they stab you anyway and then spit on you as you lay on the ground bleeding out. That's how much of an ""F-you"" their DLC and Crown Store pricing is. It's borderline-criminal behaviour."
Negative,"If you have 300 dollars at any given time to actually enjoy this game it will be the game for you but to anyone Free to play and dont plan on putting any money into this game do not get it. The game is a complete cash grab unfortunately, it would be great if i didnt have to buy the game then buy the DLC content and then buy the DLC content for my DLC content. No matter where you go once you hit level 50 and get your champion levels you wont find any builds that are f2p friendly so your best in slot gear is always out of reach, I highly suggest nobody spend their time and money on this game. I was a returning player from console when i could afford to buy all the content switched to pc and well of course there is no transfer system from platform to platform because they are money hungry. Makes sence when all of bethesda games are broken heaps of garbage."
Negative,Worst experience ever. Do not buy this game because you will more likely to stack in log in screen for hours.
Negative,"All the grind of an MMO, and none of the fun of TES."
Negative,"Pretty much what would happen if an MMO had a pricing system like Sims 4 where every tiny slice of content costs as much as an actual game.Technically you get all the DLC if you fork over the subscription fee every month, otherwise as a free user you have to buy the constant stream of new stuff just to stay up to date.These things aren't even expansion-sized yet they're priced like expansions.  They're basically what would be portions of expansions in other MMOs, except broken up and pieced out to be sold individually.It's a ridiculous pricing model."
Negative,"As an avid elder scrolls fan (playing absurdly large amounts of Morrowind when I was younger, same with Oblivion, and I clocked in probably hundreds of hours on Skyrim when combining console and computer hours), I found it hard to get very far. The biggest issue for me was the player models. They look like garbage. The whole game feels more like a crappy MMO with a elder scrolls eggshell over it. What I would like to see is a co-op elder scrolls, not an MMO. Elder Scrolls was never meant to be an MMO. But I'd be willing to dump $60 into a co-op elder scrolls game, which would probably be much better."
Negative,"ESO is not your typical MMORPG game. It's more like doing repetitive MMO-like quests in an Elder Scrolls universe. The game has its own charm, I cannot deny that. But if you are searching for a true MMO experience, I don't recommend this game. And I'm saying this as a PvE enthusiast which ESO is most likely a PvE game.+Exploring the map in an Elder Scrolls game is always fun, you can catch a lot of beautiful vistas in ESO's huge map.+Learning curve is easy.+Close combat with first person camera can be decent if you are into that stuff. (Besides why would someone wants first person lookout in an MMO except taking screenshots.)+Character customization is very satisfactory and do not expect character creation like a Korean MMO. :)+Quests are not grindy like other MMOs.-Quests become boring after you did all different type.-Quests include gathering are dull.-Inventory system is clunky.-Third person camera is not enjoyable like other MMOs.-Crafting is very boring which I like crafting in MMOs.-Skillset is easy to use but too limited for an MMO.-It says Elder Scrolls Online but somehow does not feel like Elder Scrolls game.There are more personal things about why I don't like this game as an MMO but there is no need to write them all here.If you're looking for a standard MMO experience, ESO is not your game. Still, comparing ESO with other MMOs is kinda meaningless but I can say ESO is not successful enough as an MMO game. In conclusion (for a standard MMO fans), if you like the art style you can go with Guild Wars 2. But for me, the best MMO out there is Final Fantasy XIV. It's a subscription-based game but totally worth it because it's the opposite of pay to win.."
Negative,"It's pay to win now.Besides what's available on steam which would be ESO + MW Chapter + Summerset; the game has a bunch of dlc, you can get some (but not nearly all) of that DLC if you buy the 'collection' listed under summerset. It's on discount now for $40 with the base game, so it's a fairly good entry-pack, however lets say you bought the base game first. You would need to buy summerset for $30 ($20 on sale now), you would need to buy morrowind for $30~, you would need to buy the 'guilds and glory' dlc pack for $40 to get access to the rest of the dlc available in the 'collection' and now you're up to $100 from the base game. But there's MORE! buying the rest of the DLC costs $65, so even if you buy that collection for $40, you're still 65$ away from the complete game!And why would expensive DLC be equivalent to pay to win? Why because of course, guilds for example which most of the dlc seem to include, provide players with skills/abilities (yes weird right? what's the point of classes anyways) some of these are very powerful and you can't have them if you don't have the dlc, but you will need to play against it in pvp.There's also a bunch of special items that give you an advantage for sale in that store for even more of those ludicrous prices including improved health potions and poisons and well, 'rez gems'. Now there is a monthly subscription option that gets you all the DLC, but come on, come the fuck on... who wants to pay a monthly subscription fee for DLC access in a game that was originally sold as a ""buy it and play without subscriptions"" kind of game, are you kidding me?Besides all this, it's just not a very good game, we have like 5 playable classes, very little variety in playstyles for an mmorpg. It mostly follows the generic mmorpg formula, run around and do fetch and kill quests, or worse, talk to different people at different corners of the map, for teh luls. The only thing that sets the game apart is the unique (for an mmo) combat system, impressive (for an mmo) graphics and the nostalgic setting of tamriel. It's an ok game maybe, but it feels incredibly shallow compared to what I've experienced in other recent MMORPGs (and yes, those are shallow too, just not this shallow), even if it's just free to play ones like Tera or Blade & Soul.The bottom line here is, the only reason this game exists is for zenimax to milk the elder scrolls title for money, it's more a 'micro' (more like giganto) transaction trap than a proper game."
Negative,"My gripe with ESO is the fact that most of the content of the game is behind paywalls. Why should you have to pay for a game, when you have to then pay for the vast majority of the extra content? At least make this free to play so it's more of an easier access point for players to get into the game.Besides that, however, it's a shame as this game is actually quite solid for an MMO."
Negative,"Don't buy this version unless you want constant login issues every week and little to no support. Non-Steam users rarely ever get the kind of trouble Steam users get, and unfortunately there isn't a way to bypass the Steam launcher version."
Negative,The game is really fantastic and it gets you hooked real fast but I think all the DLC and everything is way too expensive than it should be..:(
Negative,"Get your sh​it together, Toddler."
Negative,i fucking hate this game
Negative,"You buy the game and think to enjoy it, but a lot of essential features are behind a hefty paywall."
Negative,"i dont know if its just me ut everytime i try to play elderscrolls online it has to install all over agian inculding the upgrades and repairs on elder scrolls and it takes 4-6 hours to do that, if anyone knows how to fix this or whats causing this to happen. It  would be greatly apprecited if you could tell me"
Negative,"you know.. this would be a fun game if I didn't have so many issues launching the launcher, the game, updating the game, having to repair the game. I would say half of my hours or more, are from trying to launch and update the game. But once you get into the game, then it is fun. If you have the patience to make the game launch and sit through multiple launcher crashes, then go ahead and purchase it :)"
Negative,"Look at how many hours I've played and believe me - DO NOT BOTHER. Unless you only buy the base game and intend to quest alone occasionally.Don't put your life and heart in this game like I did, because ZOS will chew on it and spit it out. Everything they do is for the money - they don't care about the game or the players. It's a shame, a real shame."
Negative,"Boring as hell. Do not know what I am doing and why.But beautiful. Good Slashing.Worst game experience ever. Takes a lot of place on my drive, over 100 GB.I was just traveling, but some lame mosters killed me. I did not hurt them before, why they are doing this. Everyone give me requests, I had 20 request, I  don't want to do them, just travel, and see the world."
Negative,"Boring and I'd rather go to work than ""play"". HOWEVER: if you like MMO's I guess you might like this? I thought the real time conventional action combat and Elder Scrolls world would sway  me, but it didn't. Areas are lifeless with enemies and people just materializing everywhere, and your view when in towns will be cluttered with obnoxious mounts and pets (Standard MMO trimmings). The only things with depth are the conventional MMO things that I personally don't enjoy (Crafting, farming, guilds, PvP). Even playing with my friends didn't help.I did appreciate the voiced story dialogue, but being an MMO and the way they have to have things work just didn't hold me to keep playing. So if you're looking as this as a non MMO gamer and you like Elder Scrolls, wait for a sale Granted one could say I didn't play enough to where it ""gets good"", but I can trust my gut and my mind to know this stuff isn't for me and possibly for others in the same frame of mind."
Negative,"Class identity has been completely destroyed by hybridization. An update made stats irrelevant for damage, allowing everyone to use the most overpowered abilities regardless of type or flavor. Now, mages are running around cutting down enemies with two-handed swords and dual-wielding for damage buffs, and warriors are spamming magic skills for damage, while the distinction between stamina and magicka builds has disappeared. Everyone's playstyle has blended into the same generic pool, with identical skills. The game has been utterly ruined for me, and I won’t be coming back unless they reverse these changes—which seems unlikely. There's essentially 3 builds now, one for each role."
Negative,I was VERY hyped up for this game before it released and played it a lot while it was in beta. However I don't think it aged that well and the monetization is quite aggressive.
Negative,Wait for 1-2 hours of downloading and applying patches and then proceed to fail logging into the game for the next millenium. Not recommended for people looking to buy this game. Just go download and play skyrim
Negative,"No Aussie servers, not worth the horrendous ping. Have a few mates that were all keen but the ping ruins it."
Negative,"I had this game on my wishlist so i tried when it was free for limited time and to be honest, I don't want to hate this game because I have a few hours ingame, but I just didn't enjoy it.Also you're probably going to be spending more time managing your inventory than actually playing like me."
Negative,"Spent more time fiddling with settings creating my character, and starting the tutorial than the game itself. Controller not recognized, framerate not automatically 60, I had to set my graphics far too low but in the end I got the desired 60 FPS.I felt restless, motion sick, helpless the whole 3 hours I had to playtest.Slow paced, slow turning, zoomed in, too small hitboxes, accidentally walking inside enemies and then through them, requiring backpedal or 180° turn which is painful on the wrists.Do not recommend.Edit: ACCOUNT STATUS says ""Active"" yet can not play.Half a gigabyte wasted on SteamApps\common\Zenimax Online\The Elder Scrolls Online\depot\Video\Elsweyr_Opener.bikPlease clean up your unused files.

Negative,"I can't play this anymore. The combat is so bland I feel like i'm eating the same kind of food for hours. Enemies are leveled to you instead of being leveled areas or having enemies leveled around you so fighting enemies becomes boring because: there's no resistance to anything meaning you never have to switch up and adapt to an enemy, you will never have the satisfaction of killing an enemy in 1-2 hits, you can slap the mudcrab skin on every enemy in the game and witness how default the enemies are as they have the same exact health (because they level with you) with the same move set making them a copy paste and limiting the variety of enemies you encounter. Because of this you spend most of the time reading quests (because it's faster then listening) and trying to get to max level so you can enjoy higher level content that would pose a challenge.If the combat was better maybe it would be my favorite game.Crafting is shit now but hey you can apply any sort of armor skin to your outfit and overlay it over whatever armor you want.This makes style materials and even resources to an extent for armor and weapons practically useless because the changes that they made cosmetically in the past are used with the outfit customization system. But maybe I'm missing something and I haven't found that AH HA moment that everyone else seems to get so I guess I will go searching."
Negative,"I have 4.5k+ hours into the game. At this point, my feelings about the game are: it's still in beta, and it'll be a good game if they ever fix the bugs for release. But it's now been released for years and performance keeps declining and new bugs are added to the old."
Negative,"I can play the game using the launcher I got from the ESO Store, yet with a ""Link Steam Account"" (under the linked accounts section of the ESO Store) the moment I visit the Steam Store ESO page they don't register that I have a ""ESO Store account that's linked with my Steam Account"" and wishes to charge me extra to purchase the title on Steam despite all that.I can't recommend this title when Steam and the ESO Store can't communicate in ways they aught to."
Negative,"It may not matter to anyone, but I would like to tell you guys the problems of one of the most significant gamer communities in the world. I am from Iran. Iranian gamers are very interested in the Elder Scrolls series. Personally, I played Skyrim so much that I lost count! I really wanted to play ESO and have good memories, so I decided to buy it! , I finished downloading almost 100 GB of game data. but I can't jump in the servers After 2 hours of trying and searching on the internet, I found out that the IPs of my country are restricted from the base servers of the game! Why? Because of sanctions that we people had no role in... it is really unfair that our aspirations are limited because of something we had no role in!!! Hoping for a day when politics will be removed from the game world"
Negative,After downloading Golden Road again after Steam download Installation (because Steam is not up-to-date) you will have no way for refounds because it's hard to download the game in under 2 hours from Zenimax. I have been banned for things i dont know maybe I only because I was playing on Linux (didn't even finish the tutorials) and cannot reactivate it because Zenimax is Support-Hell. In the end i payed 65 € for nothing and no chance for refunds. Steam and Zenimax is a mad combination.
Negative,"I am going to give an honest review for any other players looking for alternatives to the other big titles.The good:The graphics are superb. Everything is crisp and the particles are awesome.The sound and music is again superb. Everything from zone music to the musicians in town is great.The story and questing is very nice. Plenty of depth and immersion.Class designs are interesting, versatile, and engaging.Group content feels more dynamic than other big titles.--------------------------------------------The not so good:The combat system is severly lacking in depth and intensity. (2 bars that you have to cycle through with 5 main abilities and one ultimate ability per bar) The limit of bar slots really makes for some dull combat. You are either changing your skills pre-fight or just winging it with the less than optimized abilities and this makes the fight boring. You ultimately end up buffing prefight, swap bar, hitting 1, 2, and then spamming your filler. 2 slots will go to waste as typically you need certain abilities slotted for stat gains even if the abilities themselves are less than optimal.This leaves the game feeling ripe with abilities but EXTREMELY limited in your choice. Changing abilities in the slots during a fight is a no-go. At any given time, you feel gimped in your simplicity. Some may say that this encourages planning but how about QUICK planning? QUICK counters? Nope, dull and limited play is the result.The NPC scaling:While it can keep things interesting at times, you end up feeling like you are running on a treadmill. Sometimes you'd like to just blow something up. Nearly every fight feels the same with the same rotation and combat time. Couple this with a boring and limited combat system and it's a turn-off.------------------------------------------------I gave the game a good chance. I entered into it willing to give it a chance and not demand too much similarities to other games. I did more than just dip my toes in. I leveled to 50, got around 90 CP and just lost interest due to the above. I changed specs for the class multiple times to search for a better feel. I then tried multiple other classes but it is just so bland after a couple of hundred hours that I can't bring myself to level them up. The game aims to be grindy and deep but the deeper you get, the more bored you become.If this game were to improve their combat system(remove such tight limitations), I would recommend this game. As it sits right now, I can't honestly tell someone that this would give them a good ""MMO fix."" This one is more like your side-chick. The one you temporarily run to when you want a break from your main game.If you like versatile gameplay on-the-fly, this probably isn't for you. The limitations of the combat are just that, extremely limiting. You can have the prettiest game with the most awesome music and customizations but if the character doesn't feel good, it's all a waste."
Negative,"game only meant for EU & NA players, if outside this region don't bother, doesn't work majority of the time as theres only 2 servers"
Negative,"okay, this game still keeps kicking me out, i tried every fix, tried everything, even played in my friend's internet connection""connection to server lost"" sad."
Negative,"I loath this games engine, the hero engine. Just like RIFT which uses the same engine, the movement of the characters and their animations never feel right. They are always clunky, awkward and stiff. That's a huge issue for me because my character and how I feel playing them is everything in an mmo. Guild Wars 2 has spoiled me with their amazing fluidity of combat and character animation, and you can actually change direction while jumping in that game, something that all games should have. In ESO something as simple as jumping is infuriating and clunky. That's how this game feels to me, clunky.The amount of classes is too low, the amount of build diversity is too low. The auction house is unnecessarily convoluted and restrictive. Why don't we have a sprint toggle on the PC version yet? Even Wildstar fixed their sprint to be a toggle and even Battlefield has the sense to have a sprint toggle, because no one wants to be forced to hold down an extra button when they're sprinting, which is what they'll be doing 99% of the time. The console version of this game has a sprint toggle, why can't the PC version have it!?Most of my play time was messing around with addons, because I am weird and can get carried away with customizing everything to my liking. At first this was great! But if you take a break for a month or two you'll come back to find half the addons you worked on customizing to be broken. I used minion to update my addons, but that doesn't matter if half are out of date and broken. These addons are usually created to add further functionality to the game because Zenimax doesn't add them in themselves, it's up to the players to do it. Sometimes these addons become crutial parts of how you play the game so it sucks even more when they end up being broken with a new patch.If you want to play a good MMO, play Guild Wars 2, where the combat and animations are superior, the auction house is convenient and always at your finger tips. Where you can CHANGE DIRECTION while jumping. Where each mount feels distinctive with each their own purpose for travel. Where the dungeons are better in the form of fractals, and the raids are challenging. Where the structured pvp is not gear based (although mesmers and necros are still a problem). WvW is still a zerg-fest, but there's going to be a major updating coming to the gamemode. Yes, it's an old game and the graphics may not look as good especially in the starting zones. But if you use reshade or GW2hook it looks fantastic if not better than ESO. Hell, you can even put on action camera and zoom into first person in GW2 and play it like an FPS action game. I play with action cam all the time, even in high level pvp, it's phenominal.But the Khajiit are cool, and there's a lot of QoL stuff for RPers which is really nice. So if you like RPing as a cute cat boy, than maybe this is the game for you."
Negative,"A potentially great game mismanaged by a shoddy developer. ESO is the source of many of my favorite gaming memories but it's been on a downwards trajectory for quite some time and I don't see things improving. I've pumped a few thousand hours into this game since launch and have done pretty much everything it has to offer but am primarily a hardcore PvPer. My take:PROS:-Excellent character customization. There are a ton of gear choices and though ZOS has definitely powercreeped various things to incentivize players to purchase the latest DLCs, you can make viable builds that work at very high skill levels in PvE and PvP without having to strictly follow the meta. This game rewards experimentation: You can be a heavy armor character who uses a lightning staff and sword and shield. You can mix fire magic with vampiric abilities while dual wielding daggers. If you put proper thought into your build you can make a huge variety of builds work that also feel fairly distinct from one another.-Outstanding combat system for an MMORPG, especially in PvP, which I believe is where this game shines. This isn't the tab targeting boredom of games like WoW or SWTOR. Blocking, dodge rolling and proper positioning are key and the combat is very fast paced. It might not be as in-depth as something like Tarkov or as cutthroat as something like CS:GO, but as far as MMORPGs go, this game's PvP offers an impressively high skill ceiling and complexity that makes the aforementioned build customization all the more fun to tinker with.-Great transmog system. Plenty of cosmetics are locked behind the scummy microtransaction shop (see below), but you can get a huge variety of outfit styles on the guild traders for reasonable amounts of in-game gold and dying your outfits isn't an issue. You don't need to pay real $$$ to get a cool and unique look.-The freedom to go anywhere and do pretty much anything. The level scaling and lack of faction locking outside a few specific PvP zones means that you can quest and wander around in any of the game's zones, even if you're completely new. There's plenty of zones and though the questing/NPCs are pretty lackluster, there's undeniably a large amount of stuff to do in the game, from fishing and harvesting to working the guild traders (AKA auction houses), grinding XP for your numerous skill trees, etc. If you find yourself enjoying the game, it's easy to become absorbed in the wide variety of things on offer.-Housing. Some of the bigger homes are stupidly expensive (around $100 for some) but there's plenty of homes that can be purchased with in-game gold. There is a ton of furniture and other stuff to decorate your home with, if you're into that sort of thing.-The community, though your mileage may significantly vary depending on what you like to do. Overall, ESO players are pretty kind and helpful. There's also a notable amount of guilds that cater to LGTBQIA+ players, if that's important to you. As a PvPer, my perception is more negative because there's no longer a serious community of dedicated PvPers - almost all of the people who would reliably show up for player-run PvP events have quit due to dissatisfaction with the game and many of the remaining PvP groups are more toxic than the rest of the community.CONS-Microtransactions (I know, it's crazy that a big-money publisher is greedy and exploitative!). There's loot boxes, because ZOS and new corporate daddy Phil Spencer need those extra yachts, and they contain pretty much all of the cool mounts and many other cosmetics. This isn't a F2P game and you basically need to buy the $15 ESO Plus monthly subscription if you're remotely serious, because your crafting bag is gated behind the subscription and without it, your inventory will fill up very quickly. If you decide to play, buy a month of ESO Plus so you unlock all but the most recent content. Crafting bag aside, there's no P2W, which is a plus.-The barrier to entry is high and the mechanics are poorly explained. Learning how everything works can be an overwhelming process and the game does very little to explain things that are relevant for anyone who wants to be even remotely serious about PvE or PvP. Though I don't think the grinding is as monotonous as some other MMOs, there's still a daunting amount of skills that require leveling. Every active and passive ability costs a skill point to unlock and you need to gather three Skyshards (non-renewable resources scattered throughout the world) for one skill point. There's more than enough Skyshards to level anything you need, but seeking them out plus dedicating time to XP grinding to make use of them is a very lengthy process, especially for new players.-Bugs. In the best of times, ESO is janky. In the worst of times, entire chunks of the game or even the entire game are unplayable for months on end. I took a two-year hiatus from this game in early 2020 because for around four months the PvP queue for Battlegrounds was broken - you'd sit in queue for an hour, get a queue pop and then just crash in the loading screen. Cyrodiil, the game's main open world PvP zone, was essentially unplayable for YEARS and you'd never get more than 20 FPS. Though a 2022 update fixed some of the biggest performance issues on PC NA (if you're not on PC NA your experience will probably be SIGNIFICANTLY worse than mine) overall, the game is still very buggy. Cyrodiil has been basically unplayable since the latest update and there's no ETA on a fix. Stuff like this is business as usual for ESO. Don't get into this game expecting a polished or consistently functional experience, regardless of what you like to do.-This game lacks the basic tools you'd expect for an MMO with endgame PvP and PvE (why is there a dungeon finder but no raid finder?!) and ZOS has gone out of their way to discourage people from PvPing. Cyrodiil can be amazing when everything clicks but between the horrible bugs, performance issues (again, it's been essentially unplayable for a week straight at the time of writing) and inconsistent player populations, the theoretical best way to PvP is usually via the 4v4v4 Battlegrounds. There's Deathmatch, which is the only good mode, and then a few objective based game modes like Capture the Relic (flag) and Domination. The non-Deathmatch modes encourage players to avoid one another and just sit on objectives - seriously, people don't PvP at all in these modes. ZOS has started doing weekend PvP ""events"" recently - AKA they just make every BG one of the bad modes and offer some worthless rewards for queuing up. That's the only PvP ""content"" they've added in years. Also, you can't queue for specific game modes, there's no custom game lobbies, and worst of all, you basically can't play with your friends. There's a solo queue and group queue, but you'll usually never get a queue pop if you try to play with friends. This is an MMO where you basically have to PvP solo. Yikes. -This game isn't even in maintenance mode - that implies that the game consistently works- it's just a minimum viable product at this point. For years now, the bulk of the content updates are just copy-pasted zones with mediocre quests. The NPCs are lifeless Disney animatronics and though the voice acting is a cut above the terrible dubbing of something like Lost Ark, it's rarely what you could call good. There are regular updates but old bugs are rarely addressed and new ones are constantly being added. The amount of endgame PvE content that is added is minuscule and PvP has been essentially abandoned.ESO has been a great game and could become one again (this game was awful at launch but improved significantly with the One Tamriel update), but the cons simply outweigh the pros, especially with regards to being unable to PvP with friends. This is how the game has been for a few years now and there's no indication that things are going to improve. The good times are over :("
Negative,"I wanted to like this game, but in the end it seems quite bland and boring.  I have owned for a while and often come back wanting to try it, but I am always disappointed.  If you like it, good for you.  I don't."
Negative,So spent the last 48 hours trying to fix a crash that happens with no error as soon as i press the play button on the launcher. no word from support tho from what i read online it doesn't help. Once they decide to help those having this issuse i will rewrite this review.
Negative,"I finally pulled the trigger on my decison to play ESO. Now, I LOVE Oblivion and Skyrim, and I've never played any other Elder Scroll games but those two. I'm just mentioning that to give some background to my exposure to the series. ESO is a bit frustrating for me as it is so damn beautiful and the quests are pretty good as well. However, in my limited time playing this, the immersion for this game that I'm so used to in other Elder Scrolls games is just not happening for me in ESO. I can't really get into a game when I'm in an area that has dozens and dozens of players mindlessly running around with silly ass names like ""XxX No5cOp3 XxX"" or, and I shit you not, a guy with the name of ""Jewless"". Seriously, what the the fuck? So yeah, this game would be amazing with this graphics engine in a single player format. The MMORPG aspect just kills it for me, I wish I had an option to simply NOT see other players.            Also, fighting in this game is simply a spamfest, how fast can you click? However, I have only played for a few hours so far so I'm hoping it gets better and more immersive. Another immersion breaking thing is trying to play stealthy in a dungeon is just useless when, just as you are about to sneak up and stab the monster in a back, some dipshit simply runs up, engages combat and kills the creature before you even get a chance to do ANYTING.  Ugh."
Negative,"I like this game but........ Instead of improvments it seems to get worse. For starters, there are only 2 server options both of which are shit if you live in Australia. If you like pvp don't buy this game, you'll be fighting against 400+ latency. If you're looking for the same experience as Skyrim you'll have too look elsewhere. People who perchase this game, and don't live in North America or Europe should get this game at a discount. I've put 1000+ hours into this game hoping it would get better. So far the only thing that has kept me playing is the fact I've played all the previous games and an a fan of the series.FUKIN FIX IT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD"
Negative,"If you are looking for a game where people won't slow down for anyone else, or an MMO to Breeze through like it's an afterthought, ESO might be for you. I lvld 1-50+cp and collected 2-3 sets of gear: I did not find any meaningful strategy, difficulty, or social bonding in this game. The difficulty feels like a punching bag you know you will always win against. After countless dungeons and veteran dungeons I really wish there was something to slow people down and get them to treat the carefully placed enemies like they actually mattered. That said, this is an absolutely gorgeous free to play MMORPG with a lot of attention to detail. Great artwork and setting."
Negative,i can't refund it cause i spent 4 hours trying to make it work
Negative,Wouldn't consider buying if situated in Australia unless you wish to enjoy large latency issues and constant drop outs in town.
Negative,"Asian player can't really play this game due to the lack of nearby server, so if you aren't near EU/NA don't bother buying this game, in the other hand, the world building is what you can expect from an Elder Scrolls® game, beautifully done (but Fallout 76 is better imo)"
Negative,"having played this game for a few years, and having spent a small fortune in in money and a huge amount of time learning this heres the truth.if u like mmo and you like elder scrolls, this isnt a bad game overall.that being said the customer support is beyond terrible.  if you have a technical problem or a gameplay issue you will ave to turn to player forumns or reddit for answers, any reply by the devs is cookie cutter at best, mostly just silence.recently  i was banned for playing the game the same way i always have, in imperial city.  seems the programmers messed up and experience was being given at a huge boosted rate, yet the patch notes said that the experience gain was adjusted that day (it was patch day), so i assumed that the increased rate of xp was part of the patch, as i was already beyond the highest usable xp limit it didnt make any differnce to my gameplay or character at all.fast forward, after replaying several times to the ban mail (2 week temporary), they reduced the time to one week and said ok all done...  Except they rolled back farther and stripped a massive amount of xp, literally dozens and dozens of hours worth of xp.   i of course made a reply mail about this and have been met with stony silence from the devs.in short great game but shoddy patchs, buggy game play (client often gets hung on zone changes require restart of game), soul crushingly long ques to get into pvp zones, and massive lag fests where all you can do is stare at the ground, all combine to make this the worst elder scrolls game in history.  only play this if you need a huge time wasting sink of your life with no support at all from the developers.  and expect that every time you figure out how to make you character effective in the game through gear and skills the next patch will likely nullify it to uselessness and there wont be any way you know about this change unless you troll pages and pages of forumns and patch notes to figure out what changed."
Negative,"Heheh, this game has changed since i played it last. Its ""awesome"" now. Thats if you get to play it.I install the game from steam, the install was done in the morning, about 87gb....I push play happy that im gonna try it again....but oh what a surprise, the ESO's own launcher wants me to install another 87gb. of data. Searched the forums about it - it turns out its a known problem from last year. There people said its probably just patches and that they may be less than whats stated. Well thats cool and all, but it doesnt let you neglect the warning unless you have more than 87gb.So all in all....a very strange situation, which unfortunately will make me have to put a negative review on that one.At least fix your installers people. Thats like the first thing your customers see when getting acquainted with your games.Edit: 4.11.2020, two and a half years later - still the same. (facepalm)"
Negative,"Decent game that is plagued by massive paywalls and annoyances. If you're like me and one of the best things about an MMO to you is gathering stuff to pimp your character out be it outfits or mounts through hard work, then you're going to be severely disappointed in ESO as nearly all cool mounts and many cool clothes are exclusive to the cash shop. What's worse is that many things are even hidden away in lootboxes. The game itself is fun enough but the reward system is counterintuitive and you're more rewarded for just spending money. Besides cosmetics you can pay for just about nearly any progression in the game really. Mount speed, xp, you name it. So many progression elements have mobile game timer mechanics that it'll just make you groan if you've played any other MMO that lets you go at your own pace. Also the auction house system is really needlessly complicated which is another huge bother you face when interfacing with ESO.Overall the game is fun particularly the combat is pretty unique for an MMO. But the rest of the experience hampers it to the point where I don't really enjoy it."
Negative,"Major sign in bug, can't even get to menu because it won't let me create and account. Tried using an existing account from years back but it never sends the password recovery email. While this isn't about the gameplay, issues like this still give and idea of the quality of the game. Played it before on console as well and it was just kind of boring. Feels more like a cheap MMO with no skill and everything comes down to numbers and stats for the most part. Only skill needed is knowing when to use what abilities in a fight, other than that it is stand around hitting the enemy and hoping you have enough health to take them down. PvP in the game is terrible because of the same stats issue, unless you are insanely high level you can't do anything because all the enemy players kill you in one shot because of the difference in stats, not because they are any better at the game then you."
Negative,"Gameplay was like any other mmo really. Better maneuvering and unique combat, but it was the same. I got screwed over somehow, and I can't connect my steam product number to ESO website. And now I'm in a limbo where steam send me to ESO and ESO sends me to steam, so you know. 30 bucks gone."
Negative,"Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will ""sell"" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really."
Negative,"Subieron casi 18 veces el precio de suscripción para los argentinos, ¿estás loco?"
Negative,I understand now why people hate Bethesda
Negative,Return Crown gifting and crates
Negative,"1. Buy this game for 60 $(!) 2. Install (53Gb)3. Start playing, fun and cool story and quests4. After 3 hours you will think, hmm I want to go to other cities 5. Find out you need a online subscription to access everything (ON A FUCKING 60$ GAME!! 11!!)6. Uninstall and think about what cool games you could have bought wit that much moneyI would spend even 50$/Year if this game was free to play. but after spending 60$ on a game, and finding out that it limits you to 1/8 of the map without DLC or a monthly fee, im just disappointed."
Negative,"I'm updating this review to add that the devs intentionally misled users as to the nature of certain game functionality becoming unavailable, and when a solution was put in place using customer support as a workaround people who used that workaround were accused of violating the TOS by using it and some people got strikes against their accounts or social bans for following the instructions given by the developer.Additionally, the developer is in the habit of turning off game functionality without warning and without any advance planning for what might happen to players who get caught in limbo when that happens.My personal experience with customer support involves never having any of my questions answered, often being outright lied to, and generally being ignored once I have made it clear that I do not accept responses that do not answer my question.As Bethesda has responded to this review and Zenimax Online Services has not, I will say: I have told everyone who asks that I will give this game another chance when Zenimax Online Services stops running ESO like a game of three card monte, which at present looks likely to happen sometime after hell freezes over.I met a lot of really cool people through this game, which is why I played for as long as I did. But at the end of the day, bugs don't get fixed, features appear and disappear seemingly at random, customer support is nonexistent, and the devs maintain a level of information control that would make North Korea jealous. The player community is honestly great, it's just too bad the people who make the ESO seem to hate the game and everyone who plays it."
Negative,"Doesn't update through steam. So you had better boot up the game once a week or so, even if you aren't going to play. My web is not awesome, and this recent update comes after over a month of my not caring about ESO. This should only take hours...As for the content and worth of the game itself, you would be wise to read some positive and negative reviews. There is an insane amount of grinding, and it all only feels worthwhile if you tithe to Todd Howard and subscribe. Even then, this is very much NOT Elder Scrolls. It's kind of a generic MMO with names and skins of things that will remind you of Elder Scrolls locations. In modernity, there are many MMOs of all genres to choose from, and many are free-to-play, funded by cosmetics. You should ALWAYS be wary of paywalls between essential content and yourself. At least with games like EVE Online, it's more obvious what the difference is between free and paid accounts, and with good social ties between yourself and players, you can grind a little and actually pay for your subscription with in-game money. Not so much with Howard's Lies here, in ESO. You can have this whole situation with Neverwinter too, and that honestly is no less polished than this. You'd be better to play both for free and do your dailys once you hit the pay plateau, rather than dump money into cookie cutter mmos. Save your cash for games that offer a complete experience without hundreds of micro-transactions.Is ESO fun, though? Meh. Maybe if you play with friends. If you must pay for anything Online, Final Fantasy has more story than anything I have ever seen. I hate that game, and it is actively devolving to the point where every class is identical save the black mage. I also do not care for the aesthetics. But it's better than ESO in almost every way you would judge such things. Zenimax gave us some okay games, and some great games. Then they pooped on our chest with this and Fallout 76, after they swore there was glass between us and their sphincters. I have played ESO hundreds of hours over three classes on console, and it all just feels like grinding for the sake of grind. With a subscription, you get all the add-on chapters and the crafting bag, but those chapters are as empty as the base game, and the crafting bag just isn't worth a hundred and eighty bucks a year."
Negative,"(""""""New ReiewI am not changing what I have said before but I am changing my review from positive to negative for the below:- Do not buy or invest your time in this game, it is fun but ZOS does not respect you or its player base, their main goal is racking up as much $$ as humanly possible from its player base.Recently they have decided to stick it to almost every vet player of this game ""- this is you if you continue playing -"" by nerfing and wasting everyone's grind time and effort, to put it simply, there are some RNG based arenas that grant powerful weapons that is now accessible to everyone with the new upgrade, they have required people who have already grinded old material to regrind it AGAIN with no change to the material itself, simply a waste of time to get a slight advantage on the newly introduced weapons which is not worth it, YES they could've upgraded existing weapons, YES they could've replied to a 33 pages long thread from people ASKING for a reply of why is this happening in their own forums but they chose not to, because ZOS does not care about you, or for a matter of fact anyone as long as they are getting some cash in. (Google eso update 26 combat preview) before you purchase.DO NOT BUY, WASTE OF TIME and EFFORT. Spend money Elsweyr lol."""""")(Old review - I can already tell that I’m going to waste my life on this game, all I can think about is playing this game. I’m gonna get fired from my job, my family is going to leave me, my friends are gonna think I’m dead, society will slowly forget me and the whole world will have to continue without me because I’m going to be wasting my time indoors playing this game. Also I got a gym membership last month, anyone wants that?~400 hours later: This is my number 1 favorite game...~1000 hours: love it.-)"
Negative,"The game itself is good and all, but the inventory space is unbarably small if you dont buy Plus Membership.Because Plus Membership grants you the crafting bag which takes all your materials out of your bag.If you dont like paying 10,40-14 € a month, then i cant recommend it, sorry"
Negative,"Good game, terrible servers and management , Dont play on EU server, constant lag spikes, unplayable pvp. They said they would upgrade the EU server and they did.........but its even worse than before.  Also, have fun on 1 hour +  queues, because the servers cant handle multiple events at the same time, like the current event+eso plus trial."
Negative,"You buy the game. You buy from the crown shop. You buy expansions. You buy monthly memberships. All this wasn't so clear to me. I was prepared to buy the expansions. But the level of monetization on this game would make a free to play provider blush. I guess it is so popular because it is so easy. Didn't have a problem maxxing my character in the highest rated gear, solo. Mastered almost all crafts via salvage and just had to research the designs which is just a waiting game. Graphics are awesome. Story is engaging as well. I just couldn't stand the continual barrage on you for your money after spending a fair sum to ""own"" the game. If I didn't feel like I was playing in an advertisement I would give it a thumbs up."
Negative,"Played 8k hours on this game, toxic community mostly, lagg and bugs , endless maintenance & crashesDon't be like me, get a life. zenimax don't care about you "" just your money "" and they won't fix anything"
Negative,Don't. Just don't. It's really not worth your time.
Negative,"The best Login Error Simulator on the market.Edit: I just wanted to edit my review 1 year later. It's still the same. Still server errors, can't login, can't enter dungeons..."
Negative,This piece of cra...game code not launch through steam
Negative,"Game has really improved since beta. However I bought a 5500 crown pack about week ago and they still haven't given me them in game. Wasted multiple hours in the support help sending screen shots of my game account, the reciept, and everything else they asked for. They claimed they fixed it this morning and my crowns would be in my account the next time i logged in. Checked 9 hours later on my account still no crowns. Cant back this game if they are litterally just stealing my money and not giving me my product that is flipping digital."
Negative,"After having this ESO account since beta, I finally sat down to play this game.I have played this game faithfully for a month now. There is no recommendation that can faithfully articulate how much I come have absolute disdain the player community. The economy is solely guild driven. Which has shown to be the most cut-throat since Eve Online. Players will literally steal from you in open world and in guilds. It has been a long time where I hate to see another player near me in an MMO.The story itself is shallow. The NPCs have no depth to them, and rather to talk you to death with trivial lore. Yes, the entire game is voice acted. Which is why the game download is at least 100 GB.The gameplay itself is also shallow. It's really ""spam the 1 key to win,"" if the combat system doesn't lag. Then in end-game, they'd rather drop the kitchen sink to kill you. There is no middle ground or meaningful encounter development to engage player skill. This is the first MMO that actually injured my hand with the tedious gameplay mechanics.Then, there's the cash shop. It has also been quite some time since I have seen such a greedy system. Outside of the chapters (AKA Expansions) all additional DLC is locked behind the paywall. This locked content also includes inventory space and a crafting bag which alone is the reason to subscribe to the ""Plus"" membership. You won't have space to store your stuff otherwise.""Crowns"" is the cash shop currency. Want to look cool - Buy with Crowns. Want to advance your skills quicker - Buy with Crowns. Want good player housing - Buy with Crowns. WHICH can cost you 100s of real world dollars.If there's any silver lining, you will have hundreds of hours of content to delve into in the Elder Scrolls world. Plus, crafting is simple. And the graphics are gorgeous at maximum settings.But, there are still numerous other titles that are better served with your time.EDIT: To the developer response - I understand you have an obligation to up-sale your product and it's features. However, this title has left me with a genuine feeling of buyer's remorse. If I were able to claim a refund and close the ESO account, I would. That is how sour I have become after playing this game in a month's time."
Negative,"I played this game during Open Beta, was severly dissapointed with a lot and didn't buy it. Free weekend is here and I heard they made lots of improvements so I gave it another shot. While most of my original issues were addressed, this game is plagued with such little polish it gets to the point of unplayable.After installing the game for hours on steam, it starts up a launcher and makes me install the game again, and this time I had no space so I had to uninstall so I could reinstall it on a driver that had enough space for both installs. This worked, or a least for a little it did. The next time I booted it up it stated giving me this error saying I wasn't logging in through steam even though I was launching using Steam and I'm always set to online. Restarting didn't fix anything. Currently waiting to reinstall this game for the 4th time. I looked around and seems this is a common bug.The 2 hours I got in the game, I already managed to encounter multiple bugs, one is that someone riding their mount had a running animation so they were standing on the saddle in a goofy matter. Not game breaking yet, but certainly immersion breaking. As for the gameplay, while significant improvements had been made since launch, it still has some serious issues. Every dungeon I attempted was underwhelming as there were actually no boss fights for the ones I explored. Instead it's just fighting goons. Unlike Skyrim where you can clear a dungeon, in ESO the monsters just keep respawning, so they tried to prevent this from being annoying by making the monsters ignore your player unless you attack, meaning 80% of the monsters in the dungeons you can just walk by without really doing anything.Just like Skyrim, the puzzles in dungeons, or atleast the ones I encountered were uninspired and dirt easy. Ooh match the symbol and click the pedastals, really nothing good puzzle wise. I don't want to be unfair, as the game did have it's strengths. The combat has dodging, ability slots, and generally better combat than previous ES games. The voice acting was very good and believable. The graphics were impressive. However my multiple experiences with this game have continued to convince me that this is not a game I will buy, and it's not a game you should buy. I think I'm just going to go back and play my Skyrim with 100 mods again."
Negative,"Every time this game gets patched, you have to download 50GB+ of files. If you have a slower internet speed like I do, you will never get to play this game. Steam shows I have played 600 hours - I've actually played less than 10. All that time is just having the launcher opened because I constantly have to re-download the game. Don't waste your time!"
Negative,"If you don't mind game devs taking all your hard work, dedication, and time learning the game's semi complex mechanics and turning it into a game where you are forced to play a class that has a 3 to 5 second channeled ability that plays for you then this is for you. But for real the devs cater to the player base that uses their wallet more than light attacks."
Negative,"cant login to server, cant link steam account says I have to buy the game but I own it, there are problems within trying to find solutions to the original problem. Be nice to play instead of spending hours looking for fixes."
Negative,"Moderately fun at least for awhile but if you're looking for actual challenging content you won't find it here. Even vet trials (the game's hardest PvE content) are incredibly easy. Also, the dungeon finder literally hasn't worked properly since launch which is...kind of an important aspect of the game. Dev team seems to have shifted primary focus to ""crown crates"" and microtransactions while letting the quality of the core game and its features fall by the wayside. There have been literally no noteable quality of life improvements made in actual years (including the fact that it still costs thousands of gold just to respec your toon). Coming back to this game after taking a break feels like eating stale potato chips, cannot recommend in its current state. Simply put, the developers do not value your time"
Negative,"Not going to spend another 40 bucks to basically re-buy the damn game every year when they come out with a new expansion. I've already paid full price for this game 3 times buying the last 2 expansions. What a rip off! Not to mention the fact that they completely tweak everything on just about every patch, meaning that every few months you have to completely redo your character's skills, gear etc. Edit: In response to the 'Developer response': FULL game price, EVERY YEAR for one little zone and one trial, not exactly what I call ""incredible vlaue"". Cha-Ching! Also ZOS seems more interested in promoting identity politics and pandering to a small group then actually adding valuable content to the game. I now identify as Non-Buynary."
Negative,"Dogshit support,woke ppl abusing position in company to abuse players. devs dont listen to comunity at all they dont fix bugs that are there for years."
Negative,"too lag for player outside NA and EU. More over, DLC too expensive and combat so boring, creating character too ugly"
Negative,Idk it seems fun and all but it would be better if i had friends to play it with
Negative,"This review is not against the game, but against Steam's system. I purchased a DLC on Steam for the game, and it locked areas that was previously accessible. I then purchased the same DLC from Bethesda, it opened tha areas that the Steam DLC locked, and asked a refund for the DLC from Steam. Steam refused the refund.Steam is not compatible with this game, purchase the game directly from Bethesda...Steam also took my money for nothing, and refused the refund for the DLC..."
Negative,"Username since 2015 @CRAZYBUTTSTABBER got changed by ZOS to @yellowmuffin today without even a warning or an email. Spent 40min trying to login thinking my account got hakced. Now can't change my account name because in order to change it I have to answer my secruity question which I forgot. Can't change my secruity question without answering the old secruity question even though I have my linekd steam account, emial account, every used password, billing info. ZOS won't answer my support ticket. BEST COMPANY EVER 11/10CRAZYBUTTSTABBER is the most offensive name ever in a mature MMORPG"
Negative,"Game is a scam - if you don't want to pay-to-play game, don't buy it. Steam has two DLC to buy - just be aware, that all other DLCs are also locked. You just have to buy them using a micro-transactions (in-game donate shop). You can't get donation currency by in-game methods. Just grab your wallet and pay additional several hundreds USD to unlock game content. And if you spend more than 2h watching cinematics and playing tutorial (hell, even non-closed game launcher counts) - noone will refund you, because of Steam rules."
Negative,"I'll start with the good points, I Like the world, being able to go in any zone at any lvl is the thing I liked, mainly because I'm an Altolic, so far I got 11 characters, made it to lvl 30ish at best.the class system is kinda flexible while being somehow restrictive, I've ended up wandering all around the world just to grind all the skyshard on most of my character and ended up bored of it.I expected way more from the promise of Elderscroll : Daggerfallhere come the bad side, It's kinda deep story driven, and like most MMORPG the element of RP is mostly that you are the lead character of the story, we all are lead character of those story, that's always bored me in MMORPG, I don't wanna follow that mainquest but doing so will make me loose some skill points, so I end up being forced to grind and repeat the main quest lines over and over on all my characters and get bored to death, because there is no alternative path.why  are all the mmo(pseudo)rpg always that way!?Choice make no difference WE ARE ALL THE CHOSEN ONE, and all follow the same storyline and no choice would change anything... that's a themepark exhibition I made a vampire, and when heading it the dark brotherhood zone for a quest involving a vampire, I would had liked to have other option as to side with that vampire, instead of the dark brotherhood.But no, everything is streamlined and you got to follow that line, there is few decisive choice here and there but I can't tell if they really change anything in the storyline.So for the gameplay well, it's limited, you got 1 or 2 set of 5 abilities max with an additionnal ult ability. and the 2 set are bound to weapon swap DW (like guildwar2), so it's not like when I played ES3 or ES4 where you could switch to whichever spell you wanted by scrolling your mousewheel.It's an Action type of system, focusing on spaming so abilities, but there is no missile hitbox and no bullet drop, you cannot should an arrow in the air to see it drop on a target far away  and damage it, no you got to aim with cross-air; and once launch the missile will follow the target even behind wall(going through) if it was visible when you shot.It's made for allowing anticipation mechanic and the 5+ult abilities are for the consoles access I guess aswell as the anticipation mechanics.Crafting system design is as I like, but tedious grinding and restricted by lvl, so you cannot make only a crafter who gonna never quest nor go out for adventure.finally the world is quite easy to go by, I play without using potion of anykind, to me it's like cheating so I don't.soloing boss with 20 time your health is easy.I finally just got bored and stopped playing, I like the game but it's just too easy, been in some random dungeon group PUG and didn't saw any hardtime, made a sorcerer healer.if you like easy, simple, action and beautyful mmog with RP limited to your character creation, well you'll enjoy that game.one thing that really bothered me is that trend of feminism and women empowerment, men are the buffoon and the badguys, women are so better. leader of the warrior guild: a female; leader of the mage guild: a female; leader of thieve guild: a female; leader of aldmeri an intelligent and strong female; leader of the wood elves: an old fart buffoon; leader of the ork: a mommyboy idiot, with a harem of strong and intelligent womens; etc. the pattern is too much obvious and the bias of the authors is just obnoxious."
Negative,I don't recommend this game simply due to the fact that i cant link the account to my ESO account. And when trying to contact the CS team for help they just send auto reply emails. The issue is that when i try to log into the site with steam it is sending my verification email to an email that does not even exist they are miss spelling my email i explained that to them and they tell me to check my trash folder... If a person would read my ticket they would see this but they wont. The CS team only gives out auto replys to tickets very lazy CS team.
Negative,"The developers don't know what they want to do with this game, how to fix the game, nor how to keep it going. The first two years were terrible, in fact it was soo buggy i couldn't even log into my account.Years later i played it, and it was fine, some lag here and there, nothing to crazy. Multiple patches later, everyone is a god mode tank, can heal to full health, and fights lasted 10-15minutes, unless a ball group of 6 players came through and wiped an entire group of people. Then they changed it so everyone is squishy and killable, with broken gear sets that only the dirty folks will abuse to be degenerates. The game is exceptionally unbalanced, and then you have an in game store which is absurd. The subscription isn't ""necessary"" if you don't care about bag space, professions, or anything in regards to making money.The PvE imo was trash, but i'm biased towards PvE in a negative sense.  WoW has better PvE and PvP over all, and  servers that actually function. I tolerate wow's pve far better than tthis games pve. The game now can't calculate damage, so if you do a bunch of damage, and another guy does a bunch of damage, but you win the fight, and you happen to be walking away and 20minutes randomly die, yeah thats from the game being unable to calculate the damage, and you getting desync killed. Don't waste your time.Last time I played was Dec 3-2019 when all this snowballed down hill and the final climax took place.This game is not Improving for the better at all. I was rank 7 in Leaderboards for PvP at the time. They've destroyed this game beyond any reasonable repair."
Negative,"Positives:- Nice graphics overall- TONS of pve content- Music is mostly good- Optimized pretty well, never got below 100 fps- If you want mostly PVE stuff and like Elderscrolls you have alot of content- Tons of nice locations, a good amount of variety as far as locations looks goNegatives: - The combat just isn't all that great or engaging, despite some cool abilities- The PVP is not very fun or very good- Sometimes annoying doing certain missions with friends- The pathfinding to missions isn't always accurate or has bugs- The housing is very focused on getting you to buy crowns to get stuff for your house. I did get a few while playing but mostly they want you to buy dem crowns to do most of your customization to your houses- UI is annoying- Missions are pretty basic most the timeOverall its not all that bad, it has improved a ton since I last played (during beta), with tons more content and less bugs, but the combat and the PVP are both lacking to make a lasting positive impression on me. Still had some fun and there is alot of content here if you want a game like that, it just doesn't pull you in or blow you away like some MMO's do. Bottomline is play it if you want PVE and ignore it or skip if you want pvp or you want solid combat.Where would I rank it vs other MMO's? Not as good as my favorites like Ultima Online, Age of Conan (on launch) or WOW. How does it compare to others? Slightly worse than Guild Wars 2, but about even with what I remember of Aion and not as bad as Black Desert Online. Won't be playing much more, but give the game a shot if you want more of a singleplayer mmo with nice graphics, cool locations but meh combat and pvp. My time in this game has been enjoyable yes, but also a little boring at times. Either way, it was fun to get in the MMO mood again after not playing any for what seems like ages, despite being a tad underwhelmed overall by ESO, mainly do to the combat and pvp quality. But there are many things to like about the game, others might enjoy it alot more than me!6/10 if I had to score it, if there was a middle ground between Like and Dislike I would probably pick that."
Negative,Its infected by the mentally ill. This game is dead.
Negative,"The User Interface/Experience is absolute garbage. I cannot find anything, there is an excessive amount of keybind options and no guidance in the game whatsoever. Elden Ring showed how open worlds can lead the player through a game without making it a liniear experience. Elder Scrolls Online should take notes, in my opinion. I really tried to get into it, but even after hours of me trying, I amonly getting more and more frustrated with this game. Hard nope."
Negative,"Great storyline, great graphics, poor performance. I love the freedom of exploration and the story quests are some of the best in Elder Scrolls history. The look of the game seems to be more like Oblivion in terms of style but blends the updated textures of Skyrim with amazing result. The combat system is fluid and offers a wide range of play styles. Now for the drawback. The server is not reliable AT ALL. Even in areas with no other players I experience horrible lag and get constantly booted off even though my internet connection is perfect for games like this. Any game that takes up over 90GB of hard drive space should NOT have issues like this making the game almost unplayable. Getting disconnected from a party I can understand, but being unable to play at all is ridiculous. I understand that this is an online mmo, but seeing as the majority of the game itself is rendered using your own hardware this problem shouldn't exist and Bethesda refuses to even acknowledge this issue even though so many players are facing it, some having even better internet speeds than me. If it was patched properly to stabilize the connections to the server this would be the ultimate Elder Scrolls experience, but until then you're better of saving your money and sticking to other ES titles in my opinion."
Negative,"The game has only 3 languages somehow, the graphics and animations are terrible and the game doesn't teach you anything at all. Still lame after 3 years"
Negative,"While I have poured hundreds of hours into this game, I never really fell deep into it like I wanted to. Basically, I played it because I got tired of WoW and GW2. Factions are so unbalanced it isn't funny. Everyone plays Aldmeri Dominion, so people like me in The Daggerfall Covenant are screwed in Cyrodiil; pvp as well as finding groups in general.Getting a group can take a long time. Not joking, as a DPS, I once waited 4 hours to find a group after spamming chat and using the useless LFG tool. Even as a tank, it took me too much time. Just keep in mind, I played on the least popular faction.With this game, you outlevel an area way too quick, not as bad as WoW though. The graphics are impressive, but I find that stylized graphics improve the lifespan of a game. Crafting is cancer. The whole ""research a trait"" thing will piss you off. Literally, you will wait an entire month to research your final trait of an item. Questing was fun at first, but got soooooo repititve that I would smash my head on my desk and cry. Yea, it's nice that there is voice acting and some choice making, but I didn't like the stories. Keep in mind, I LOVE Elderscrolls games. A lot. I wanted to love this one, but couldn't.Combat? Meh. PvP? Meh. Crafting? Kill me, please. Socialization? Unless you play with games with friends or join a non-cesspool guild (of which there are a lot), you will not speak. Story? Well, it actually has a decent one. This game just made me wish they stuck to single player massive adventure games. This is like multi-player Skyrim, which isn't as cool as it sounds. Release Elderscrolls VI already, please, Bethesda.Game chat is cancer, too."
Negative,"more than six hours were spent in game waiting for maintenance and downloadingplayed for one hour,did not like it  ,wanted a refundbut steam does not give refund for games played more than 2hrshow am supposed to know the game play by just waiting for maintenance"
Negative,"Took 8 hours to download the game, then another 6 to install it, then another 24 hours trying clear up with bethesda that I bought the game and should have 30 days of free online subscription, before I simply said to hell with it.  I never got into the game.  The only reason I wanted to play the game was  the awesome movies I saw online, but that was not enough to make me waste more of my time."
Negative,"I decided to see how ESO is doing after not playing it for so long. I can safely say that it is still shitty, but not as shitty. See if you ignore all the shoehorned modern day politics shoved into a game put 1000 years in the past of its more racist future iterations. You can actually see how this game does a few good quality of life things that most MMOs could benefit from. However it is really just reminding me how low of a bar MMOs have to hit they still fuck it up.At best it is a coop elder scrolls game to play with some friends and at worse it is a wearing the flayed skin of something it isn't."
Negative,Login screen simulator
Negative,mods are butthurt and ban people too easily
Negative,"THIS GAME SUCKS it's SO pay to win, u literally have to pay for so much stuff including stash space. AND ITS BORING AF. Seriously terrible combat, like i'm about to fall asleep. Graphics are total butt. Quests are dull, mostly fetch quests. Lots of walking simulator vibes. Very complicated but at the same time really really dull. BAD GAME BETHESDA HAS FALLEN SO FAR DO NOT BUY   D O   N O T  B U Y"
Negative,So after creating my character I cant play the game :(character load takes forever I googled this probem and it persists since 2014 now 4 years and they still did not fix this problem not recommended until they fix this problem)
Negative,"Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will ""sell"" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really.DONT BUY ESO PLUS"
Negative,"First...SPYWARE check x86 files hidden, cannot be removed according to the provider of the spyware last I checked. Then there is throttling by the game managers. All normal and usual, if you have several characters you will notice. There is also the lovely detrimental effects that last 49710 Days 6 hours and 30min. Everybody loves being on fire and or poisoned and or having major breach and or bleeding ect.... for 103years game time, until you log out or leave area. Game play is not consistant ever on any character, some abilities will vary from use to next use on time and action. Favored characters and races ( for promotions and new chapters ) will not be favored forever  and will be nerfed in favor of new promotions. Enjoy,  I did't so much."
Negative,"I bought 8000 crowns for the singular purpose of gifting an item in the crown store to a friend. Then I find out my account hasn’t unlocked gifting. Okay, no problem I think. So I submit a request to unlock gifting. A week later I am told I am not an active member and therefor the request will not be granted. I log in at least once a week. I have accumulated over 200 days worth of play time. My champion level is over 2000. I am active in multiple guilds. So I take a screenshot showing my playtime and respond to the ticket to ask that the decision be appealed. All I want to do is spend money on the game that I enjoy to give something to a friend. And a week later I get the response that the decision is final and will not be approved and if I don’t like it I can submit feedback. Are you guys serious? I spent close to $100 to buy a friend a gift and not only has my money been wasted but so has my time. You guys can do better than this."
Negative,"*Only* 300ms ping on Australian NBN! :-( Since the nearest NA server is like 10,000+ miles away, and I've yet to see any suggestion of adding Australian servers, I think I now remember why I quit playing this thing ages ago. That kind of latency makes games not worth playing."
Negative,"Ok I will say up front that I do not like MMO's and have only been playing this one for lack of a single player alternative.  Yes you can play quite a bit of this game ""single player"" - there are large swaths that are multi-player and are very hard if not impossible to play through as a single player.  I have often been playing a single player delve and get to a boss and thinking ok this should be interesting when someone or more come charging in ruin the fight.  I get a completion of the quest and did NOT get to fight the boss on my own which was the only point of playing the quest.  So I hang around and wait for the boss to magically resurrect (real immersion there) and fight them hopefully on my own but already outside the quest and not nearly as satisfying.  Then there is the matter of people running around like little minions on an LSD trip - many in reasonable attire for the environment but some in glow in the dark stuff that has absolutely nothing to recommend itself if you are looking for anything remotely appearing to fit in with the environment.  And as noted there are multi-player areas (most of Craiglorn for example) that you can generally forget about on your own.  And then they put interesting items like high quality armor or weapons behind these multi-player walls.  As soon as a good single player comes out I doubt I will be in this one again and while there are some very nice aspects such as graphics and such to like about this as a game, the negatives of being an MMO are just too much for me.  Others love MMO's - great, more power to 'em.  And if you have a group of friends that you like to play games with that might be good.  I play solo so whatever.  If that's the kind of game you like, you can putter with this one but it is unsatisfying in many ways."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME HERE !!!I would never buy this game through steam, the amount of buggs caused by the steam log on system is rediculous. I will be claiming a full refund for the game and purchasing it dirrectly from Bathesda. Months of the same problem because of steam...  i expect better."
Negative,Steam Log In issuesBe Warned.Come on Zenimax
Negative,No Australian Servers
Negative,"About 6 hours to download, 2 hours to update and 1 hour to ragequit. Game's painfull both to look at and to play. Couldn't endure it even for free. And they say game's got better. If that's ""better"", then... oh, god //_\\"
Negative,"Maybe if they loosened up a little on the paywall, more people would get into this game. The fact that you have to pay the $15/month for double bank space and a bag to hold the crafting components is crazy. I've played for 22 hours, bought 2 bank upgrades and 2 inventory upgrades (with in-game currency) and I still fill up on everything every 30 minutes. I can pay $13/month and get so much more access to everything on ff14, which is a much better looking game with a ton of progression. The price of the individual dlc in eso is way to high for what you get in each of them."
Negative,An unexpected internal error has occurred.An unexpected internal error has occurred.An unexpected internal error has occurred.An unexpected internal error has occurred.An unexpected internal error has occurred.Fix your fucking game.
Negative,"DO NOT BUY FROM STEAM!! They fuck you in the ass. You cant connect to the serves while everyone who bought the game from Zenimax have no problem what so ever. Its been on and off for over a week now, so they are apperently not going to fix this issue. Had no response from anyone on this matter, other than ""we are investigating"". my ass..."
Negative,"ESO was a great game. Now they ignore their player base. Put everything in the cash shop. They don't go back and fix old content. They have changed the damage for the worse not better as they stated it would be. They are bleeding players like wow did when they ignored their community for too long.Played 1000 hours on PC, 5000 on xbox. Spent over $1500 in cash shop between both."
Negative,"--------------------------DO NOT BUY THIS ON STEAM--------------------------Here is what you get for 19,99€-A Bethesda Launcher-Error 206,209,210 depending on the weather-Login issues due to incomplete download etc.-No steam support bc they say you should contact Bethesda-No Bethesda support bc you have to log in before you can open a ticket-A post-download to chew up your refund timeI cant judge the game because i cannot play it--------------------------DO NOT BUY THIS ON STEAM--------------------------"
Negative,"I was thinking about donation and buying some DLCs... but servers are down. Old players say this issue happens regulary. They ""restart"" servers at the morning and they just failed again and again. Maybe they don't know maintenance should be done at night? So if they not intrested in good service, I'm not intrested in investing to this game."
Negative,"I can not play this game. I download the game on Steam and then try to play it, and it opens on the installer. And it sits at loading forever. And after looking into it, this is a pretty normal problem.I attempted to get a refund, but because steam counts hours when i am not physically playing the game, i exceed the time steam allows for it's refund policy. I know because i have attempted a refund (so i can buy it on the Bethesda website or DMM or something), but i do not qualify.So, maybe this is a good game. But i cannot reccoment getting it on steam. There are many problems with it now. Try it out somewhere else."
Negative,The game is good but if you got any problem the support just simple wont answer for youI have a ticket from 1 month ago and i still dont get eny answer
Negative,"Don't buy it through steam, the login service that goes via steam is going down weekly or more often, just don't buy it this way."
Negative,The Loading Screens: Online. Nice music tho
Negative,dogshit client wont even install i have to look up reddit threads for issues that persisted for 7 years for a crumb of help. whoever made the client is sweaty and dusty af and they got dry lips and no money and no future
Negative,Sat at the load screen for to long without some kind of notification........
Negative,"Do not buy! If you want to play ESO, do not buy the Steam version. If you have a problem with the game account (important since this is an online game and they lock the ESO account to the Steam one forever and you cannot change that), ESO or Steam will not help! *yep!"
Negative,"Money, Money, Money, sure they'll say you can get everything in game grinding for years. its fun at first because they make it seem like a solo player game to get you hooked, but once you get going its all grinding to get this or that. Even making money is a grind, trying to find the right guild to sell in with no global market/auction which is cool and all but then your forced to become friends and beg to be in a guild so you can sell items. Bugs with Npc's for quests not appearing seems really common, also the reviews on the later content worry's me all i hear is low production, high price its not worth the gamble going though half a game to get tricked into spending money because i as a new player, is in a area of the game the had a higher production budget and thinks the game is worth it.Its not hard to see after a while that Zenimax might know this and they're milking the cow its shocking how expensive everything is and then to see the recent reviews is sad and again not worth the gamble, this game might not even be as populated in 2 years once Elder Scrolls 6 comes out i think they just know people want this type of game so they're making cream at this point"
Negative,"I love The Elder Scrolls universe. It's probably my favorite fake video game lore ever conceived. So of course I was hyped as hell to play an Elder Scrolls multiplayer game when it dropped back in 2013. But I was quickly let down when I discovered that it was just a WoW clone with barely any of the identifying factors of a single-player Elder Scrolls game. The side quests, the characters, the environmental storytelling... none of it was present on launch, and it just felt like a hollow imitation of what made me love games like Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim.Fast forward to over a DECADE later, after I'd heard from countless reliable sources that ESO is now a respectable Elder Scrolls experience, and with 500 hours logged in New World (and even a few dozen hours of Classic WoW) under my belt to better ease myself into the MMORPG genre standards, I felt it was finally time to give ESO another shot.And to my surprise, it's actually a pretty respectable representation of the Elder Scrolls universe... on a thin surface level. I admit, I felt excitement exploring familiar areas like Vvardenfell. I was stoked to interact with recognizable characters like Lord Vivec after all my time spent playing Morrowind as a teenager. But the nostalgia goggles eventually loosened when I was forced start experiencing the core gameplay loop. What I discovered was: this game is boring. It's just so boring. Combat, even by MMO standards, is incredibly uninteresting. Even when I was intentionally putting myself in situations well above my pay-grade, I never came even close to dying. Maybe this is just an early-game quirk to avoid discouraging new players, but for me it had the opposite effect. Playing alongside a friend or even randos doing the same dungeon as you makes clearing areas less than trivial. You just run in, press your attack buttons, and everything eventually dies while you take no damage whatsoever. No strategy required, no class-specific situational advantages. Just run in blasting. I figured it might just be the class/race I chose, but I saw literally every single player doing the exact same thing. I quested mindlessly for about 20 hours before I realized I wasn't having any fun, and decided to call it quits there. For an MMORPG, I suppose this is probably a middle-ground standard - after all, there weren't any frustrating enemies, no annoying mechanics to deal with, no game-breaking bugs or graphical performance issues (at least during the relatively short time I played). But as far as a video game goes, especially one with the iconography of The Elder Scrolls series to work with, ESO is just a big fat nothingburger. Mindlessly clicking on enemies and sorting your inventory... that's pretty much it. It's just a painfully boring video game."
Negative,I installed it and made an account saw loot boxes and pre-order bonuses 90GB's download then just sat there while it was trying to load for about 15 mins and i have a computer that can handle this so i returned it. figured it would be better for my mental health.
Negative,"After the fall of that other famous MMORPG I've been trying out all the alternatives. Unfortunately this one is the least appealing. All other MMO games catch you right from the start, whilst ESO does the exact opposite, you can feel it's a little off just by the looks of it.The difficulty to delete my account later proved my point, as there is no easy way to do it except opening a support ticket and waiting a few days to get your info manually removed by the support team."
Negative,Fix the fucking login issues. DO NOT buy this through steam
Negative,"The one and only reason I will not give this a thumbs up or recommend this to other players is the fact that you have to pay $15 a month in order to be able to store your crafting materials for future use.   It;s the reason I quit playing ESO so long ago and the reason I quit playing Fallout 76.  If dropping $180 for a years worth of play doesn't bother you then, by all means, do so.    But not for me."
Negative,"What does it mean? For gamepads. There are only 6 active action buttons in total. Do you remember pure PC MMORPGs (pre-Cataclym World of Warcraft, Age of Conan) when there were not enough panels for binds due to the abundance of versatile abilities? Here is less buttons than in Dota 2. If desired, this game could be released on smartphones without losing any functionality. Cramped, stuffy locations. Everything is located 10 steps from each other, which ruins the logic of local quests and scale of the world. Crowds of people are running over their heads, stealing quest items/enemies faster than toilet paper in the local supermarket after the quarantine was announced. Almost all skills are instant. As a result, positioning is not important, everyone runs around like a pricks for no reason mid battle. Casting spells today is anachronism, I guess. If you can't cast, then you can't interrupt. I'm afraid to imagine what PvP looks like at high levels.Harmless enemies. The roads were intended for safe movement through the location, without entering into battle. Here you can run directly through the camps of enemies, no one will stop you. Because of that, there is no point in joining groups to defeat a common threat. All problems are solved in solo. What is the point of being multiplayer then?Every aspect that directly concerns the open world, social and role-playing systems here is just as catastrophic as in any other modern MMORPG. ""So where does the positive rating come from?"" - you may ask. The power is in the name, not in the content."
Negative,"WOWOWOWO VERY NICE GAME!!!!Ok now LISTEN, I want to explain my journey in this game with you.Made sorcerer, didn't like it, deleted it.Made dragonknight, loved it, brought it.So I started to level up, but I got so happy that I bought ESO+ and some crowns.I played and got really involved into the game.Played for a bit and I said ""oh it's too late let's go sleep and play tomorrow!""The day later...I open game and receive the email that I got banned WOW bethesda shit :)I hate cheating, I hate exploits, I hate glitches.But they banned me anyway (for cheating ahahaha, why should I? And can you cheat in these games, really? wow).Another thing, people who cheat surely hide it and you don't find that they are cheating, while if you don't cheat, than bruh, you will be found a cheater with no reasons, the life makes more sense with you for sure :).GG Bethesda, ban a normal player and  don't ban real cheaters.Maybe people are nice, but support sucks so much.They are all nice until these things happen.As a true fan of Bethesda, you guys suck so much and I would say to fuck you all, really, for every money I spent there for you, you should be sad in your life because I got my money by working, so it's like fuck you all is, like, you made me so angry <3I suggest this game because is cool but if you get banned then I told you my experience :DEDIT: 17/08/2023Nobody of the support cared about this, and they just answer me with a bot saying the same things, nobody tells me WHICH kind of code of conduct I didn't respect, nobody tells me WHY shouldn't I get unbanned and WHY they DON'T CARE about their customers, this is maybe why they don't deserve so much players on that server.Let's go back to New World, maybe I could enjoy more :D"
Negative,"This game has changed significantly over the past few years. It is currently not worth playing. Zo$ has become greed-driven and does not care about the player experience. Please don't waste your time, play another MMO instead."
Negative,"I enjoy the game but I couldn't recommend any game with loot boxes or that enables auto renewal of subscriptions without consent. Both practices are dishonest, disrespectful and should be eradicated from gaming.Scamming your customers is bad!"
Negative,"I bought the game and downloaded. The in game launcher is responsible for all the patches and I have a slow connection so it took me 7 hours to download the patches. I downloaded the patches and the game crashes on startup every single time I try to play, I tried all the fixes and nothing worked. So I filed for a refund and they said ""Can't refund you played 7 hours"". I have literally not gotten to play their game at all, and it doesnt work at all, so I am out all this money and they aren't being reasonable.Don't buy this game if you expect reasonable support in the event that your game doesn't work."
Negative,"My brother bought the gold editon for me, but i cannot log into to play it since i need to verify my account and they are not sending the verifcation code i would love to continue playing the game if they would just let me =( great game terrible customer support"
Negative,"I've heard pretty good things about this game - loads of content, good progression, etc etc.That would be great if I could even start the launcher, but some galaxy-brained genius decided the launcher needed its own installer. Zenimax, I already used an installer, it's called Steam.Instead I get an error window with only this:""Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.""""Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit."""
Negative,"> Installs Game> Download 90GB install file from Steam> ""ESO will now start the installer""> ""Downloading ~50GB Update file""> ""Failed to extract download file""> Press repair to repair installation> ""Downloading ~27GB update file""> Installation finished!> Starts game, immediately starts at Elsweyr> Guess I don't need to play any of the previous chapters> Play through the starting area> bag full from crafting materials in 30 minutes> ""Subscriber to ESO Plus to get unlimited crafting bag""> have to right click on each ingredients to destroy to free bag> not even close to vendor and crafting items are mostly worth 0 gold> uninstall"
Negative,"buy through ESO website, not through steam.  steam has downtime of 1 day per week that ESO-purchased game does not have.  steam experience is horrible and they will not refund you if you buy game and cannot log in"
Negative,"Great game but PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT ON STEAM!!There's constant login errors connected to Steam where you can't login and play!Meanwhile, everyone who bought it through the website or on other platforms is fine. Wish I had known this earlier, thanks steam <_<."
Negative,"Company isn't loyal to its customers, it's loyal to its customer's money. They follow a strict NERF only meta, where they shit on every build that players like to use, just so that the players chase another build and spend more time playing this game. They are very much ruining the game patch by patch, and the worst part, is that they only ever listen to feedback when it says ""Nerf this, or nerf that"". Good game, horrible company, ZOS went to hell in its recent years. Honest to god, it's a dead ringer of Jagex, except instead of shitty content, it's constant nerfs everywhere."
Negative,"I want to recommend this game but I just.. can't. I love what the idea and concept of this game is but the grind, paid expansions, excessive capitalistic targeting for some of the content. It just leaves a sour taste. Key things like changing your character or character slots are paid, alliance changes are paid, just about everything is paid. I'm genuinely guilty of dumping a good bit of cash into this game and I did have fun but I really can't keep playing this game with how easily it could run my wallet dry. It's also a shame the expansions have lately been rather dull and following the same formula. I digress though. It's still a fun game at heart but I only recommend it if it's on sale or if you have money to burn. Otherwise I myself need to step away from this game, especially with how much space it demands on my computer."
Negative,"It shows some of that old game jank, but there's an interesting game here. Ability lines are unlocked by doing things in the game and just using equipment. Skill points that are earned through levels (and other means) can be allocated into those skill lines to make abilities available for use.The more necessary micro-transactions, such as inventory space, are ridiculously expensive. Looking at the game's cash shop, everything follows suit with content expansions. It was interesting while it was free, but the sheer deluge of materials and other items you don't want to throw away combined with a dollar per inventory slot makes it hard to want to stay in this game."
Negative,"All games, ultimately, are an exercise in trading game content for money. But ESO has tilted that balance very hard toward the ""getting money"" part. As a result, the game experience is now a convoluted mess of pop-up offers, navigating menus, navigating the poorly designed Steam store, and navigating the poorly designed Crown store. In order to motivate players to come back every day (no doubt because Bethesda has run the numbers and determined that those players spend more), the game encourages/mandates all kinds of extremely repetitive behaviors. The game takes every opportunity to put more ads/offers in your face, which quickly takes you out of the in-world experience assuming you were able to get into it in the first place. What little joy I still feel in logging on is now quickly destroyed when I'm reminded what a repetitive, boring, and confusing morass ESO has become. Just make Elder Scrolls 6 already."
Negative,"Do you like Skyrim and feel like you want more of it, but with a different story?Are you a fan of Morrowind, the best Bethesda game - hallowed be its name, and think the ESO Morrowind expansion sounds great because it takes place on Vvardenfell?Do you have poor impulse control and games easily hoodwink you into spending money, whether it be regular microtransa**ions or lootb**es?If the answer to any of the above questions is yes, then forget you ever heard about ESO. --------The ESO Morrowind's story reads like bad fanfiction, the gameplay is pure MMO and if ESO was a person they would literally try to sell you a piece of shit they found on the ground for 9,99€.Is it a bad game? Not at all, it's pretty good. It puts more effort into the story than Skyrim, there's lots of moral choices and all sorts of content to ensure that you are never bored - pvp, public dungeons, cyrodiil (similar to guild wars 2 wvw), shit ton of quests, crafting, daily quests etc. Just be aware that it's a very greedy game, the MTX store is very extensive and apart from DLCs it'll try it's best to sell you convenience features and even lots of stuff that you can very easily buy with gold from other players. And also that it won't scratch the itch left by Skyrim, Morrowind or Oblivion. It's an MMO, with MMO-like zones and MMO-like content. (If you are interested in crafting you'd better pick another game because you don't get access to the craftbag without ESO+.)"
Negative,"UPDATE: Somehow they managed to make the game worse. They added new useless stuff like NPC companions that die to overland mobs. But hey, you now have an expensive pet to look after, buying or farming gear for them that costs millions on a market, trying not to lose rapport by accidentally killing a bug or doing daily crafting writs (not even joking here, Bastian will hate you for crafting beer).They completely destroyed the balance (once again, they do it every three months) with the new sets and mythic items. 12 person group limit in Cyrodiil forces ungrouped people to stack at one place. If you're riding to a heavy siege on a mount, the game won't be able to sync you with the battle and will kick you back to the lobby. Half of the time you don't see the animations of any attacks, neither enemy's nor your own.N.B. (not related to the product) Don't bother with the game's Forums. You can get flagged by mods and banned for saying the most trivial things. They will take your words out of context and twist them to their liking if you're even slightly critical of the game.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I don't recommend this game but this isn't a negative review. ESO is a good game, could even be great if it wasn't ruined by the abysmal server performance.If you want to have some easy casual experience in TES setting, by all means buy this game.Art and music are great. Older areas may look dated but they have their own charm and you can produce good screenshots with a little help from ReShade. Most quests are OK, some arcs are good. Voiceover is good. Overland content varies from easy to a mediun challenge. E.g. Harrowstorms from the latest Chapter can easily wipe a dozen of unprepared players but also can be cleared by just two veteran players.If you aim for a rewarding competitive end-game experience, do yourself a favor find something else to play.Some dungeons are virually never played because of the bugs that haven't been fixed for years.Your flawless arena run can be undone by a health desync or a disconnect. You never know when several players will crash during a boss fight in a trial. PvP? More like PvLag, get in a keep fight with 50 people and hope that any of your skills work while still getting damage from siege engines and proc sets."
Negative,"I really dont want to hate this game, but the trader guilds system is terribleIf u r  not a frequent player, its hard for u to sell anythingI cant see why the auction will be harmful with the present monopoly by big guildsArrogant Bethesda and Zenimax"
Negative,"IMHO, the game looks kinda dead. Was queing like 30 mins to an hour for a dungeon and sometimes you pair up with quitters and have to wait yet another 30 mins for someone new to join in. Not suitable if you are starting the game now. Everyone usually already have their own group. So many dungeons and yet its not rewarding enough to make people to queue for it so it sucks if you don't have friends playing this game. Subscribed for ESO Plus for 3 months and I only play for a month since the game doesn't offer much things to do. I'm at CP 250 and the only thing I see CP600 do are either AvA or repeatatitive boring trials and daily pledges. That being said, if you like ES series/lore, you should play the game to know more about it. But in the end for myself, the combat/gameplay/content/addons/ESO Plus subscriptions is not worth the time and money."
Negative,"I played this game a lot. Loved it for a while, but expansions are becoming just re-skinned versions of the same previous content. Zone to zone, it's like the same stories being retold with different actors. The crown store.... god don't get me started. Never before have I seen a game that doesn't want to sell you something. You can't buy any of the cool mounts... noooo you have to either have no life and play 24/7 to earn endeavors, or use gems, which you can only get by buying crown crates, then cashing in whatever RNG garbage you get from them that you don't want, for these gems that you can eventually use to buy a mount or whatever, which may or may not be there because they cycle everything out so often. So, no thank you. Who's got the time for this kind of crap... I'd like to be able to enjoy my games and something of a life as well. Elder Scrolls has become the worst kind of game, manipulating you into biting fish hook after fish hook.... I finally just had to uninstall it and not look back. Best decision I ever made... there are so many good games out there by honest developers that actually work hard for their audience. If you keep feeding piece of trash companies like this, well you get what you deserve I guess,"
Negative,I started this game and was hyped. The combat felt great and healing seemed like such an important part of the game. I did my first dungeon and was absolutely smitten. The dungeon felt fun af and the whole team got wiped a couple times so there was a certain level of challenge.I did like five dungeons after that and kept getting matched with people who were like level 2000 and one-shot literally everything. We just walked through the entire dungeon. I chatted with them to see whats up and they said I needed to get to at least lvl 160 (you start dungeons at lvl 10 btw) before there was any challenging content (veteran dungeons).Screw that. I can't believe they would do this. Why match brand new players with maxed out heroes that just defeat the entire dungeon solo? Why would I ever do a dungeon? It's a walking simulator?
Negative,"A couple of months ago I would of recommended the base game despite all its bugs and random balance choices as there was enough content to still have fun.  But now I can only advise to avoid this game.  Anyone thinking of getting it should read the current patch notes for themselves, massive 30-40% nerfs to all classes and random selection of skills.  After all this time the combat team still have no idea what they’re doing and all the hours I have put into game trying to get a decent build have just been flushed down the toilet.  This is nothing new, they will release a new DLC with gear which has decent stats and nerf everything else again hoping you’ll buy it.  Rinse and repeat."
Negative,"The game is beautiful, quests are really unique and fully voiced acted, and skill trees are fully thought out and would allow for really a very immersive and amazingly complex combat system. Would. Except for the game is so ridiculously easy that you have no need to master combat. No need to try new skill combos. There's no challenge (until late game when you can team up for harder dungeons) The overworld and the solo quests offer no challenge whatsoever when you can smash your face into the keyboard and kill entire armies. God this game would be amazing if it was a challenge. Upgrades to weapons and armor are meaningless."
Negative,"Edit 2: Doing a character takes time, all the changes I made to a new character were lost because there is no way to save it. Idiots.Edit: If I want to revise my review? Oh sure, why not?! I am having more bugs than ever, I have trouble finishing quests, I have trouble interacting with any stuff at all from time to time after combat, the methods to make people ""NEED"" the dlcs are as always disgusting. I don't care if this is the best mmo on Earth or not, MMOs are all cancer unfortunately, and I have this much hours because a friend of mine likes the game a lot. Otherwise I would just go on with my life...Original: I'm smashed by the truly terrible experience this game has been to me. AWFUL. I don't even know what there is to like about it. It has ruined the experience of the ""Elder Scrolls"" for me. Skyrim is one of my favorite games of ALL time. And this ESO is just here to ruin Tamriel for me.I won't play it again if every time the game wants to make an update I need to download from 80GB to more than 100GB!! WHat???! 100GB for an update?? 90% of the data I'm donwloading I don't even have access to play! Why are you making me pay so much (yes I pay A LOT for GB of ""internet"") for... for what?I'm sorry for the rant, but this is getting passed the point of ridiculous. One of the times the game forced me to update more than 100GB everytime I needed to pause it made a reset and wanted to download everything again!!! Whyyyy???!"
Negative,I recommend buying this on the Game's website. Steam is not worth it and is broken for a lot of people. Save yourself time and buy it anywhere but Steam.
Negative,Another boring MMORPG. As if there were interesting MMOPRG?
Negative,spent an entire day downlading the game then it opens a second downlading screen gets stuck at 3% and then freezes.
Negative,"Pay to pay to pay to pay. For the price of a full game, get half a dlc! Then pay for membership! Pay for the price of a full game just for a mount! Then, pay twice the price of a full game for your own cyber estate!This is generic, recycled cookie cutter content shamelessly macrotransactioning you out of every penny they can swindle. No matter how much you spend, you're just going to end up with a terrible taste in your mouth after playing."
Negative,"This is my brutally honest review and I don't expect everyone to like it or agree with it.ZOS does not listen to community, crownstore is over priced, pvp has been neglected and basically left to die. Arrogant and out of touch devs. There is little to no communication with the devs and players. People even got banned on the twitch for asking for certain things from the devs or simply disapproving at certain changes the devs wanted to make. (U35 comes to mind). It lead to an exodus of end game players. Servers feel like they're from the 90s at times. Graphics are fine but a lot of textures and zones look so out of date. Only the new chapter zones actually look stunning. A lot of class animations have been the same since launch. Only templar recently got an animation update. Game is definitely starting to look its age.I mainly play this solo even if it is an MMO I only do group content if I have to. I usually have had very negative experiences with guilds. The only guilds I seem to find that are decent and friendly are housing guilds but trade and pve guilds are just mentally painful to be in or around. However due to the nature of the game you're kinda forced into groups for certain things. As you'll see below.Community is usually fine but god forbid you need to do a trial and have to join their discord where you will only hear cringe, unfunny Germans who feel the need to fill the silence with bad puns and icebreaker jokes. Not to mention how anal guilds are about requirements and rules. Assuming you have the required 80-120k dps (which you can only attain via animation cancelling - it's a feature not a bug) you'll be allowed IF the trial is already not full and these guilds usually operate and run at times that may not be convenient for you. Which is usually the case for myself. If the trial goes over a certain allotted time then they will disband even if you're at the final boss you just spent 2-3 hours trying to get to. They'll just quit. ESO's community know little of patience or perseverance. Expect the same generic excuses of ""Oh I have another raid"" or ""I have dinner"" what psycho does raids back to back on the same day. If you're already in a trial and you're on the final boss, commit to it. Trade guilds function like a criminal syndicate. The rich get richer and they profit off of your sales by getting an automatic tax cut but then will have the audacity to push you into donating on top of that and threaten to kick you if you don't. If you don't meet your ""sales quota"" expect to be kicked too. As the Joker said ""all you people care about is money"" pretty much true there.  I won't even go into how the richest 1% players have formed a cartel and literally play the market and manipulate prices. Mass purchasing a bulk amount of one item then marking up the price and selling it higher. They don't even need the money it's just pure greed.I do feel despite all of this, the game has a lot of potential the devs need to get in touch with the players, actually have a line of communication and not get offended like children when the community doesn't like or doesn't have faith in their changes. (U35) I think the devs don't realise we are their customers.Also AVOID THE OFFICIAL FORUMS. It is overly moderated to the point in which it's an echo chamber and you can be banned or have your thread locked, or post deleted because the mods are either told to clamp down hard or take everything personally and hold a grudge. Most anal and most vague rules used to justify tyranny. You will never be able to voice your true opinion there, so don't even bother."
Negative,"Can't play it, I'm not receiving any confirmation code for an account on the ESO webpage"
Negative,Game getting woke now...
Negative,"DO NOT BUY FROM STEAMThe game is very nice and I would reccomend it, but if you buy it from Steam you will never be able to login to actually play it. Waste of time and money."
Negative,This game does not have asian server. Only NA and EU server. I don't want to play multiplayer game at 200ms++ ping. Refunded.
Negative,"This is an excellent single-player game but a terrible MMO.The storyline is great, and there's always plenty to do on your own. Playing with others, however, is impossible. Many of the quests have areas that are instanced, so unless you're on the exact same step as your friends you can't do the quest together. Grouping up is impossible, too, unless you all start in the same region and progress through the game at the same time. If this was just a single-player game, I'd probably give it a good rating. But I don't like that it's an MMO that I can't play with my friends."
Negative,"First, I want to say that I'm a Skyrim veteran of 10 years, WoW veteran of 7 years and a master mod builder for Skyrim. I had a friend talk me into trying ESO so we could hang out ingame. I downloaded it 6 months ago and this is my review.I give it 2 Stars of 5. Yup, only TWO stars. The two stars it got was for #1 Graphics and #2 Storyline. So those two things are on par with my expectations of the game before I signed up. Now I'm going to tell you why it failed to earn another three stars from me. Firstly, all the crap that I hated about World of Warcraft, some jackass programmer put in ESO. And I do mean ALL of the crap I hated about WoW. The crappy PvP, the nerfing of the game constantly, the fact that your character is stronger at level 1 than they are when they are level 50 with 500 champion points. The fact that everything you actually want is monetized out the ass and will cost you a fortune to get it all and that you can kill stuff in ESO and it SHOULD drop an item and nope... it doesn't. Forcing you to keep wasting your time killing it 100 more times to get it to drop. Ugh.... The fact that you often get kicked from the server because of a server time out, or the lag in a dungeon is terrible and you're supposed to be tanking it but the bad guys don't spawn for you like the do for other players so you're standing there swinging your sword at nothing until the game catches up with you while your dps and healers are taking all the damage. Frankly, it's a shitty theft of the original WoW gaming mechanics. It's not original at all and it pisses me off that ESO ripped it off. So please go back and FIRE the asshole that you fired from Blizzard and gut all the crap that he programmed into your game that has ruined it. You don't need it. It's shit anyway. Now do something original that isn't a sad knockoff of World of Warcraft.The outrageously limited bag space is stupid and frustrating. When you spend tons of gold and real life cash on extra space to still have a full bag on all your characters it's a serious problem and causes the game to be extremely frustrating rather than fun. The fact that the programmers of this MMO know that this frustration is present and rather than trying to make the game more fun for people, instead they use this frustration to force you to spend more and more money for containers in game, or throw away your loot is just downright obnoxious. The frustration is so bad that every time I play this game - I want to log off and rage quit. I think daily about deleting this game and am on the brink but since Bethesda hasn't brought out a new Skyrim. I'm playing this and trying to be patient as I wait for a good game like Skyrim. My next complaint is this. The styling in this game is very male oriented. Whoever it is that is supposed to be building female outfits and content needs to be fired and you need to get someone else who actually has an idea of what women want. I'm a female gamer and most of the items you have for clothing, weapons and housing furnishings are very interesting to a woman. To be frank, they are ugly. This game has the potential to be so beautiful and the 3D programmers have the style eye of a hermit crab. Please hire a proper 3D artist with actual style. Otherwise, I don't want to spend my money on shit that you offer in game. Finally, this is why you only got 2 out of 5 stars from a veteran gamer. I'm not impressed, just disappointed and frustrated that you guys ruined what could have been an amazing game. Fix the problems I pointed out and you will have a higher amount of satisfied customers."
Negative,"The launcher is terrible.  It took me 4 hours of ""play time"" between the initial installation and a subsequent patch to even get be able to launch the game.  I specify ""launch"" for a reason as the load time to actually log-in and get playing took me a few half hour attempts.  I thought something was wrong; Checked my firewall, followed a couple of suggestions I found (upwards of 5 years old) with no results.Turns out you need to wiggle the mouse and press buttons on your keyboard during this unbearably long sequence so you aren't disconnected for inactivity.  Haven't actually played yet, but might update this review come later. (Hopefully microtransactions are only for cosmetics / DLC since there's an entry fee in the first place)UPDATE:Regarding the load times; Everything seems to be fine after launching the game once or twice.  Fair warning though, you probably wont be able to return the game before so much as playing it.I've only encountered one bug so far being that NPC's and players wont load properly if you have multithreading enabled in your video settings.  All of my friends encountered the same problem, but it was easily fixed.The game is... fine, a cut above standard MMO's but not by much; Don't buy this if you're expecting a standard Bethesda experience.  Worth noting I've found it very difficult to play along side friends save for just trying to do the same quest at the same time.  You /can/ share some quests but it seems to make no difference gameplay wise.  The UI is confusing at best and there are ads for microtransactions everywhere (the saving grace is that they are in fact just for cosmetics and DLC as far as I can tell).These are just nitpicks but...So far the game has been mind numbingly easy, I'm sure things will ramp up eventually but I feel as though I've been through several hours of introductory quests.The NPC's talk allot, like ALLOT; Usually to convey very little or awkwardly blurt out a metric ton of exposition.  As much as I want to be immersed I find myself skipping through most of it and thoughtlessly wandering to the next quest marker.TLDR:Skyrim this is not, playing with friends is so-so, pay-to-enter (not to play), ads ads ads, VERY hand-holdy but probably good for casual players.P.S. UPDATE:I've had this 100 GB monster installed for a few months now and can't bring myself to sit through a patch to play it again.  Uninstalled, no regrets."
Negative,"Before purchasing the game there are some things a new player should know.Bag space is very limited unless you also purchase the Plus Subscription. Whilst playable it makes crafting difficult as there are many crafting materials. The subscription costs $24 (NZD) a month.Some quest lines I.E. Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild are DLC and have to purchased with crowns ranging $20-40 each. Or you can buy the Gold version of the game for a cheaper deal. More ways to suck money out of an unsuspecting new player who chose the cheaper option to begin with.There a lot of basic features missing from the game that require third-party addons to remedy. I.E. a minimap.There are some game store items to make life a lot easier (portable banker or merchant) but also are not cheap ~$40 each.Last but not least: refunding is almost impossible. Launching the game brings up the game's launcher which proceeds to download ~40GB of patches. If you've got a slow connection your 2 hour refund window is gone before you can even play. That doesn't include the hour you could spend creating a character or the hour spent in the tutorial area.Please do yourselves a favour and read the other negative reviews for the real story before purchasing.Since I am now stuck with the game I will continue to play it but will not be pouring all my money into it."
Negative,"I purchased this game a couple weeks ago. After about a week liked it enough to get ESO plus through Steam. Then one day while playing I got booted and couldn't log back in. It was down almost a full day before it came back up. I found after some research this sad to say is some what normal for ESO through Steam. While it was down I repurchased through ESO and installed. After it installed I logged in through ESO with no problems at all, then logged back out and tried to log in through Steam. Nope, login server still down. So uninstalled, cancelled my Steam ESO Plus and just logged back in through the direct ESO game. If you are thinking about getting this game, I would recommend you just get the game through ESO and don't use the Steam front end as your login portal."
Negative,"Good lore, likeable fully voice acted characters, full adventure and familiar lands hiting you right in the nastalgia.... if this was it, then it would easily recieve a 9.2 out of 10... but it loses at least five points due to every last detail within being strictly locked behind DLC microtransactions and loot boxes. Literally, this is one of the few games people point at when they are making the point that microtransactions kill games. I have no problem with games containing a cash shop, but having this bs is just downright pathetic and game ruining.If you want the best and newest elder scrolls adventure to date.... go play skyrim."
Negative,"I've been a big fan of Elder Scrolls since the choppy days of original Xbox Morrowind, but I haven't found an MMO I've wanted to play for more than a month.  Videos looked promising on actually putting Elder Scrolls into a multiplayer format outside of the normal MMO conventions, but in the end this game can still be summed up as: You talk to NPCs, get quests, run outside of town and kill/help/collect something/someone, and repeat.  The story lines are good, along with every conversation being voiced, but it's still a hotbar button pusher, juggling cooldowns, and weapon types hardly seem to matter.  Like if you're playing one hand weapon and shield, it doesn't really make a difference if you swing a mace, sword, or dagger, only DPS and effects are relevant.  Same w/ two handed, it could be a hammer or an axe, all that's really going to change is the sound effect when you hit something since the skill tree has been massively wiped from a normal Elder Scrolls skill tree.  ** On the other hand, If MMO's with these repetitious fetch quests don't give you Groundhog Day syndrome before you hit lvl 30, you'll enjoy this."
Negative,"One of the most singularly new-player unfriendly games in the MMO market today. You're not paying for an Elder Scrolls MMO so much as you're paying for a worse version of Skyrim without mods and anything else that actively defines the Elder Scrolls series as the games that they are. If you want to play this game, go buy the 500th version of Skyrim that's been released and mod it to your liking instead of putting up with lackluster content releases, musical chairs for class balance, and a copious amount of obfuscation as to game mechanics that are vital to your long-term enjoyment in the game itself."
Negative,"Couldn't get past the account creation. They won't accept a gmail or link to steam account. Spent almost 10 minutes just trying to create the account. It shouldn't be this difficult just to get to character creation. I would like to review the actual content of the game but my patience ran dry so this is the review they get. Free to play weekend with a 75 percent off purchase tells me they are looking for fresh players, perhaps make it easier to start the game."
Negative,this game has practically no cutomer support. if something goes wrong like a character disapeares or you can't login then you are screwed. I enjoyed the game until one day i had a login failure and have never been able to login since and that was over a week ago.  the only customer support they have is a ticket that they don't seem to respond to. essentially you are taking your chances of having money stolen from you
Negative,"A warm hearted attempt to make TES an online expierence, but the game really requires an existing love for MMORPG's to enjoy. If you don't already enjoy that format of gaming, ESO will be hard to enjoy even if it attempts to step away from the common qualities of an MMORPG."
Negative,"Honestly, I cant reccommend this product. The base game itself is quite expensive. Also, its not really B2P; You WILL need abonament if you want to play it any serious. The game itself is difficult in the wrong way; Its not about skill, its purely about mere numbers in equipment. The system requirements are high, even tho the game engine is outdated.If you looking for good MMORPG, go play SWTOR instead. It runs much more smooth, its abonament is 2x cheaper (30 pln for SWTOR vs 60 pln for TESO). Its kinda WoW-like, but faster, better looking and sci-fi. Not to mention the obvious fact that Star Wars universum is much better than TES universum.If the devs will remove, lets be honest and name it, Pay-to-Play, or just make the base game free, I can reccommend TESO. But not for now.TL:DR - If you want good MMORPG, go play SWTOR. Its cheaper, more interesting, and runs better."
Negative,So I purchased the game as it was on sale and waited 2 days to download it all just to find out that it opens the installer and then crashes.
Negative,don't get bored and uninstall the game and forget to cancel the subscription for it if you got one. no refunding that.
Negative,"ehh, not really as good as i thought it would be. Played it with my 2 friends and it kept crashing (mostly because of my friends horrible wifi) but i still wish i could get a refund"
Negative,WHY SUPEED BECOUSE WAS MEAN THE START IT YOU GUYS DIDNT SUPED THEM
Negative,"I don't think its worth a buy for anyone staying in Asia or Sea region since there isn't any server that i know of at the time of playing the game. It's not just 200 plus ping, its 999. The combat isn't suited to my type of gameplay too since you don't feel any impact."
Negative,"It makes me sad to play a game that monetizes everything. I paid them a sub and I still have to pay for every little thing on top of that. I get their gross paid currency with my sub but I have to spend it all on little conveniences that cost them nothing like buying a $10 appearance change token to change my hair one shade of brown or I have to remake the whole character. In wow I just go to the barber and fix it easy peasy. I could even change my whole look 10 times, who cares, it doesn't even cost in-game currency. It costs the devs nothing to put that in. You get like 20 outfit slots in wow and usually won't make enough outfits to know there's even a limit to it. In this game, you start out with one outfit slot and you have to pay $15 for each additional outfit slot for one character (not unlocking a new slot account wide. $15. One character. What the fuck). There's 100 more examples where they make things unnecessarily inconvenient and then charge real money to make it what it should have been in the first place. I wouldn't even mind if they charged real money only for cosmetic items. It's the real money for a functional gameplay experience that really frustrates me. It makes me really not want to play when I still feel like I'm being wrung for every penny they can get out of me even though I already signed up for their subscription service. I'm cancelling my sub, though, because this is a really unacceptable way to run an mmo. I would have subbed longer, because I love playing the game, but the greedy money-grubbing microtransaction-required-to-function manner this game is designed makes me not want to fork over another cent.The gameplay's great. The game itself is great. I love being able to be a criminal and a murderer. I love that the story is actually interesting. I love that there are so many character emotes. I love the art. I love the detail put into everything, especially all the little animals. I hate being inundated with microtransactions."
Negative,"After having a few hundred hours on this game, seeing most content, but mostly playing PvP, I have to give it a big no. It's a great game for people who like exploring and solo content. This is also a review on EU servers.The combat: The combat is alright in PvE, but in PvP there's just too many variables. If they're running a pet build, you're likely to hit the pet with 60% of your abilities, no matter if you're ranged or melee, since they can keep running around and through their pet, since they dont clip, and make you waste your stamina/magicka on the pet. The pet is also very tanky so you can't really kill it. - Abilities, mostly ultimates tend to bug. Without going too in depth, the ult will ""fire"" and waste it's charge but won't do any damage and no animation will show up. - There's no cooldown on the abilities, which is cool in concept but it actually means most builds have this one spamable ability with the rest just being situational and/or cc.- The CC in this game takes a different approach. Instead of breaking a hard stun with a spell, you have to press both mouse buttons at once to break the stun. The problem with this mechanic is that half of the time it just wont work, and you'll sit out the stun, most commonly leading to your death.The servers:Eso servers are the worst I've personally seen in the last 10 years of playing video games. They are the same quality that you'd expect from a 2001 era MMO. There's this thing called ""prime time"", which is when most people play, and it just destroys the little amount of server stability that there is.- During prime time, if you try to queue for a dungeon or a battleground, you'll most likely get a ""unable to queue at this time"", which is something they've apparently implemented to stop their servers from crashing. The thing is, this game doesn't have as large of a population of players as for example WoW, yet their servers perform a lot worse. - Also during the infamous prime time, you can say goodbye to any meaningful action in Cyrodiil, because it lags like all hell during it. You can zerg and hope for the best ( which means spamming one ability firing off with a 3 second delay).The content:I've had a subscription running since I bought the game, and I can say there's a lot of content to play, both group and solo play. The maps are big, varied, and really bring out that Elder Scrolls feeling.- The dungeons are great. They look good, they run well, the boss mechanics are fun and as a whole package are worth checking out. I've seen a couple of raids but I'd say there's other mmos which do a better job at raids.- The inventory gives you enough space, but only when you've got the subscription going. The basic inventory space is 70 slots, but with the subscription going, you get a material bag (and there are waaaay to many materials to fit in your regular 70 slot bag) that can fit as many materials as you want. You can also expand your inventory for gold, but you'll probably want to focus your gold on upgrading/buying your gear.- The gearing is, well, grindy. It's not about the stats, since the armor gets capped at 160 champion points, and doesn't upgrade beyond that. It's mostly about which sets you want to run to get the max out of the set bonuses. There are craftable sets which you get by crafting, there are ""overworld"" sets, which drop randomly throughout the world, there are pvp sets which you get randomly by winning and/or losing a battleground. All three of the mentioned types of sets are tradeable. There are also dungeon and raid sets. They're not tradeable, but, at least the dungeon sets, they aren't hard to get. You can get a set of blue gear and upgrade it to purple/gold by buying the materials for the upgrade. There are also monster sets, which themselves are a huge rng grind, because you need both the shoulder and the helmet piece to get the maximum value out of the set. The helmets drop at the end of veteran (heroic) dungeons, while the shoulders you have to grind quests. You get four quests every day, and from those 4 quests you get keys with which you open a box and hope that it drops you the shoulders. So, 4 shots to get a shoulder piece (mind you, if you need it a certain weight; medium, light or heavy, for your build, you can't change the weight, so you have to keep farming until you get the right one you need) in a chest containing 12 sets. TLDR: Servers are bad, gearing is grindy and not hard, combat mechanics dont work as intended and it's very subscription orientated, even though it's marketed as a ""buy to play"" game."
Negative,"The Elder Scrolls Online could be the best MMO for PvP you have ever played.Sadly it is not the best in it's current state (last 4 months+) The Studio in charge seem uninterested in fixing the massive performance issues the game is currently seeing. During peak hours The game is unplayable.If you decide to buy this game, do not buy it on steam, since Zenimax has very often connection problems with people playing through steam.If you just want an MMO to run around and see a world and play around with your friends, this game will give you many hours of entertainment. If you however want to battle in PvP and try to be as good as you can be, be warned, you will be disappointed by the game's current performance.I can not recommend this game to anyone that wants to do anything else than play storylines and do quests."
Negative,"The game is aging and animations are really outdated.I got the game when they announced the Necromancer, but the Necromancer in this game feels nothing like the necromancers you see in the game as enemies. It's not a pet class, and sadly the decided to make the Sorcerer the pet class instead.Very disappointed."
Negative,Honestly i enjoy the game but i cant give it a positive review at this time as they fail at communicating properly with their player base. A 2 hour scheduled maintenance period could go for 4 to 6 hours plus with little progression towards fixing really game breaking bugs or any explanation given for the extended down time. the only real priority that seams to get pushed is making sure they make as much money as possible from micro transactions and pushing out over priced unfinished DLC before fixing issues that have existed for months if not longer
Negative,"After the so-called hardware update, the game has kicked me out three times when I'm about to taking a keep, within one week."
Negative,Game is fun. ZOS is the reason I dropped it. Anyone who plays for any amount of time will tell you that they seem to have fun making players lives miserable. All this for a few carrots they drop you every once and while. It's a love\hate relationship I don't want in my life anymore.
Negative,"Unable to login for the past week ""Requesting Login................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ ""Connection to server timed out. Please try again later. In short I got jewed"
Negative,"I know review section on Steam should be all about gameplay of certain title, but I would like to take this opportunity to review (criticize) a horrendous update system of TESO:TU, a fine looking and playing MMORPG set in the The Elder Scrolls Universe. See, the game itself is definitely not that bad, and I've played a fine number of hours with my Bethesda account, before buying Steam key in the last Humble Bundle Monthly package. Truth be told, I did buy HB Monthly for the sake of getting Steam keys for The Elder Scrolls Online and Quake Champions. I like my games on Steam. I like when they autoupdate while I'm watching a movie or reading a book.But of these seven hours registered to my account, 6 went into updating game and applying patches. Now, I do understand that the massive amount of data equals massive amount of megabytes and that ever changing universe does gets updated pretty much often, but somehow, I would like Bethesda to understand that I'm 31 year old working male with family who can't spend free hours of his life looking at their update progress bar.Therefore, I am deeply sorry, but pushing gigabytes of updates every single time I launch TESO just ain't gonna work. Thank you."
Negative,"Some players that are oblivious to the world around them may be okay with a game developer collecting personal information to sell to 3rd party advertisers and even state in their user agreement that the personal info will be used for ""targeted advertising"" and then when you finally get the game installed with the installer going so slow as to make sure it takes longer than 120 minutes to install ensuring that the user cannot receive a refund from steam. If you try to opt out of them sending you spam emails when you make your character user name, it will give constant errors and when you finally do check the box it will say the user name is already in use cuz you just created it a minute before. But guess what, you cant use it.Oh and the game itself is 87 gigs but the installer needed another 20 gigs to install. Thats ridiculous. Why would a launcher need 20 gigs?"
Negative,"2/10 one of the worst MMORPGs I've ever playedall this games potential in its soundtrack, world, and story were completely wasted on me with the game's terrible combatliterally just skyrim, but with arguably 5x worse gameplay, and you can see other players walking around and doing the same quests as you"
Negative,"The PvE is repetitive and simplistic, it's an MMO so OK fine whatever, however the reward system is more underwhelming than any game I've ever played. Little to no glowing/shiny loot drops or alteration abilities, no reason to do most of the harder content except for a stupid pompous title or for the  ""challenge"" however as first mention, gameplay is repetitive and simplistic. Healers exist to buff the DPS, tanks exist to stand and look stupid and gather stuff for the DPS and of course also to buff the DPS, and DPS exist to left click and choose between 5 whole buttons to mash to a 1 second beat/ rhythm to do DPS/win the game... basically just FNF (friday night funkin) with extra steps. Also the ""challenging"" content generally accepts only a couple different gear loadouts/classes, boring.The PvP had promise but has been completely neglected. It is laggy and empty and boring and... has no real rewards. Abilities often don't work, and some gank/troll builds are so incredibly advantaged that they can turn corners and invis instantly and simply live forever. While not being a threat, they can prevent you from ever accomplishing any goal. If you play cyrodiil as designed, a large group sieging a fortress, one person with dark convergence and vicious death can wipe the entire sieging force.I only still play because of some friends and because there's just nothing else worth playing.I no longer play."
Negative,"I tried to give this game a chance, even after Angry Joe demolished it in his review...If it's not fun with your best friend, it's BAD.I played this with my best friend and it was super boring. The game breaks immersion constantly, and gave me absolutely no desire to experience the story. There were a couple of interesting lore books at the start (which you can't pick up btw, only read), but none of the quest characters had any 'character' to them or got me interested in continuing the game. The one exception might be Naryu, who is the quest giver for the tutorial level - she is pretty cool, but immediately after this quest all life was sucked from the game.Hardly anything you pick up has value (0 gold) but you're limited to 60 items in your inventory which makes looting pointless. Everything interesting or unique costs real world money (Micro Transactions gtfo) and even that I don't see the point. Why buy a horse or a house (both of which came with vanilla Oblivion/Skyrim), or a ""non-combat"" pet (i.e. glitter), or the ability to marry a character (which seems like a fairly standard feature) when the game itself has no appeal?Combat is floaty and doesn't feel real or satisfying in any way, and other players running through dungeons at top speed to one-hit-kill enemies and sprint away ruins the experience for a first-time quest. You don't feel like you're in battle at all, and sometimes will miss your target if you stand too close to it.  With poor combat mechanics, I don't see even PvP as enjoyable.Literally pointless. I love Elder Scrolls and sink hours and hours into Skyrim, so I was excited to play the world with my best friend. Honestly it's way more fun to sit on the couch playing Skyrim next to each other than actually being in the same world on ESO together.Massive disappointment."
Negative,"I uninstalled this abortion and am probably never going back. The devs are incompetent and do not care about the players or the health of the game. They care about dollar signs. Balance is an afterthought and they love to introduce new items that are strong as hell with new content just to nerf them later. Essentially a bait and switch. This game does not reward hard work or dedication(short of the vSS mount). New players cry and cry about vets being stronger so ZOS keeps reducing the power gap between noob and max level. Most of them don't even stick around, they come in, complain about things being ""too hard"", then leave shortly after ZOS appeases them and ruins the game more. If ZOS wants to fix this game they need to listen to the players who know how to actually play, not these people who sit there and LA with a bow wondering why they can't do damage. Out of the patch notes released June 1, 2021:""In response to the feedback that there is still too much vertical progression in the Champion Point system, we have further reduced the maximum number of stages for passive stars (non-slotted) available. This will lower the vertical progression cap to 1560 rather than 2100 in the Warfare tree, and 1626 rather than 2352 in the Fitness tree. This will reduce the maximum power of the Champion Point system as well.""Who asked for this? Seriously? What serious or long term player who's spent hundreds of dollars on this game wanted this? None of us. It's new players crying, yet again. This is an RPG, you're supposed to get stronger as you play and level up more. If you can't handle that pick a different genre.And don't even get me started on how fucking shit the servers are or the fact that an overclocked 9900K is my bottleneck. Optimization is trash.If you have a fraction of my playtime and think this game is great and going in a good direction you have no idea what you're talking about and are likely part of the problem. Not sorry."
Negative,"This game has potential, however there is a few things that makes me not recommend it...1 - Everything cool about the Elder Scrolls is hidden behind a paywall... Want to play as an Imperial ? Gotta buy the Imperial upgrade in the Crown Shop. Wanna play as a necromancer ? Gotta buy that class from the Crown Shop. Want a player home ? Gotta buy it from the Crown Shop. And forget micro-transactions, they are going for the big deal : 95% of those ""pack"" have a selling price over 1,500 crown (which (depending on the discount on Crowns) is roughly $15... With many of them at 2,100 crowns (roughly $20 - $25). Man, if I wait for the right time, I can get a full game on Steam for under $20. And you want me to pay that amount for countless ""DLCs"" ?!?! Nope.2 - Drop rate for gold is hillariously low. I've been playing this game for a little less than 10 hours and I made (if we exclude the 5,000 gold they give you at the start of the game) about 650 gold. And dont even try to sell looted weapons or armor pieces as they are worthless... literally ! They sell for 0 gold (unless they are enchanted).3 - Game mechanic is very different from Skyrim... although you can relatively easily get used to it.4 - There is also a lot of bugs, which is a classic thing for any Bethesda game.The pros :1 - Large maps with a lot of NPC making the world look alive.2 - PvP arena (for those who are into PvP (I'm not)).3 - It's a MMO, which means to can join guilds an play with your friends... or strangers. Whatever floats your boat.Bottom line, if you absolutely want to play an other Elder Scroll game while waiting for TES6, then please, buy it... but only on a 70% (or more) discount. Otherwise, you're getting robbed."
Negative,"Game won't start. Uninstalled, reinstalled, tried all the fixes I could find on google and still nothing."
Negative,I hate this game.
Negative,"I played with my wife, and she loved the game. I tried to enjoy it, but found gameplay to be hindered by attempts to convince the player to shell out additional cash. I was bored and didn't see any reason to invest my time in the activities provided. Why pick anything up if my inventory is so limited and nothing has any value? Why craft anything if none of the items impact my gameplay? The combat was tedious, but had some charm. I liked the need to block and dodge, but found my progression hindered by the fact that I only used five abilities, yet had a new ability point every level. I just stopped investing my points after a while and found no difference in gameplay. Overall, I found the game soulless, which really surprised me because I was incentivized to enjoy it because I had a partner, and I enjoy RPGs. I WANTED to like this game. I wish I had. I recommend looking elsewhere."
Negative,"Highly sophisticated sequence of roadblocks between you and the game. Step aside Square Enix account management system, there's a new sheriff in town."
Negative,NOT WORTH THE MONEY     MICRO TRANSACTION CASH GRAB GARBAGE
Negative,This is a bad game! If you want to buy anything it blocks you. If you want to communicate about that.... it blocks you. Basically these people don't like making money. That makes them idiots in my book.
Negative,"Lag is SOOO real, they have had years to fix and have been unable to. And if you enjoy PVP, don't bother. Many many many many disconnects. Traffic is low, queues for dungeons very long unless you are tank or healer.  Bathesda has a great game here, just wish they had better management."
Negative,"If there was a neutral review that would be my view on the current state of the game. But unfortunately, since they rely almost purely on FOMO tactics and gamble crates as their business model, this is the tiebreaker for my negative review.It's still a decent game if you are not that deep into its endgame content, because after you reach that point, you realize everything that's wrong with it, and more often than not, the wrong direction the managers seem to take this game."
Negative,"Stick to the Singleplayer Elder Scrolls main series.This is fun for exploration only and only if you're a fan.Once you have seen everything or when you have to get into gearing and min-maxing it becomes dull very quickly.DLCs bought in the past become a free adition to the base game after many years (looking at Morrowind).Combat is very messy compared to other MMOs, it's hard to get used to it and doesn't feel as satisfying.Not really worth to make any purchases, but once you buy the main game it is free to play without subscription.Give us Elder Scrolls VI, Todd Coward!!"
Negative,"Whatever you think this game is going to be its not, spend your money and storage on something thats not a cash grab."
Negative,"Lets be honest, its not the best piece they've done, and we all know that"
Negative,"Pay to Win. Buy ESO plus. Get crowns. Sell crowns in game for gold. Real money lets you purchase any items you need, with almost no need to work for it.Keep your ESO paid up, and you never run out of in game money. Don't forget the bottomless bag of crafting material storage. Basically a must have if you want to craft without the constant hassle of worrying about every single item you might pick up. You can play without the craft bag, the extra 10% exp, the extra crowns too. But it feels like you get screwed without ESO plus. The crafting, if you could call it that, is more like a dismantling tutorial that takes months to complete. After you have invested huge amounts of time waiting to learn something you can eventually make some nice armor and weapons. Mounts are truly sad considering the amount of time it takes to level them, (or crowns) and they aren't even account bound on progress. Also, combat is pretty plain. Light attack, use skill, rinse repeat. Meta builds rule the majority.  On a positive note the world is pretty great, visuals and area design especially."
Negative,I got banned right after finishing my first quest after the tutorial and I still don't know what to do next. I haven't received any email about it either.
Negative,FUK NO. ITS EMO WONDERLAND
Negative,Game sucked cause the community was horrible and the combat wasn't skill based at all.
Negative,I bought the Greymoor Digital Collector's Edition and it didn't include the Summerset and Elsweyr expansions even though the ESO website said it would. I am very disappointed because I can't even buy the right version for myself since it says I already own it and now it'll cost me like $50 to buy enough Crowns to re-purchase the content I already bought.
Negative,"I've been around in eso for 5ish years now, don't be fooled by my hours right now because i picked it up on steam this summer but played on the normal launcher beforehand and have a couple thousand hours. I am only a pvp player and haven't tried much pve or raiding ect, so i will begin on what i know. This games pvp has been a roller coaster the past while. The servers are unplayable at prime time (7-12 ish) and abilities are bugged and huge delays happen whilst in combat, this hasn't been tweeked or improved at all and is still getting worse each patch to this day. This is also the same for PVE instances in raids as far as I know and  some guilds have quit the game recently due to this.  The max level system (champion points) is a broken system and simply doesn't work. The no cp pvp is now more popular due to this. Certain classes are far too empowered with the buffs you get from cp and can be practically immortal and do stupid damage with a meta set up. Finally the devs simply cant balance the game properly, there's classes that are simply way too over-stacked and outperform the rest. One of these has been in the top 2 for 4 years now and not nerfed properly because they cry on the forums when they get the slightest nerf. The game now has removed all skill by implementing and buffing proc sets so that everyone runs these horrible set ups that reward even the worst players in the game so much they could kill one of the best on a normal set up. We have had a meta like this already and it didn't work, that's the funny thing, it was the worst meta ever made and they brought it back....... Honestly with the state of the game right now pve and pvp( particularly pvp) I would leave this to the side. The game is really in a rough spot but it can definitely make a return with the right changes. The Devs are constatly altering everything to the extreme. For instance if something is strong and needs a tweek. Instead of nerfing it slightly they will completely kill off that said ability or set pointlessly. The devs need to open their eyes. Currently would not recommend this even though I love this game. I will leave an update if changes and improvements are made. All the best."
Negative,orginal - I didnt recommend bc they removed battlegrounds for some reason.edited - i recommend bc of fixedited 2 - i dont recommend. game is entirely too monetized and doesnt have voip. the whole reason i got this and convinced my friends to play is bc of the voip when it was released on xbox.
Negative,The most boring game I have ever purchased for myself and two of my friends. . We all played for a week solid and then never touched it again. Missions are very boring. Nothing that is stunning or makes you say WOW! It's plain as cream cheese.
Negative,Lyris Titanborn is more then welcome to step on me but the game is a hit or miss. They have been going more and more into hybridization which im not a big fan of. ESO is still a very good mmorpg and the community is very new player friendly.A Few Tips for New Players1. Start new characters ahead of time and upgrade the mount speed every time you login so when you're ready to play them they already have a fast mount.2. Find a good guild. Guilds you join will most likely have crafters that can help you with training sets which give you bonus Exp.3. Addons will make your life so much easier. I use Minion which is a Addon Manager. Dottz Gaming has a good Installation guide on YouTube
Negative,"Disclaimer, the game is the perfect MMO, but the EU version sucks at the moment.So I played the game in Beta and it was a trashy game. I bought the game recently after I noticed that the MMO market is more than dead and because a friend has recommended it to me again. I have to say this game improved so much and is to me, the best MMO i've ever played (I play MMO's for ca. 17 years now, seen them all). This game offers you a fun solution, regardless of your preferences. The stories, quests, dungeons are all wonderfully thought through and fun to solve. The reason why I wouldn't recommend the game (at least if you're willing to play in EU) is the tragically low EU server perfomance and the carelessness of ZOS. You can be sure that whenever an event launches, a DLC comes up the servers are going to be down for at least half of the duration because they don't invest into that. This happens for years apparently and there were no improvements whatsoever."
Negative,"Coming from Australia, disappointed on the game having no dedicated Asian servers. No fun playing on constant 300 ping."
Negative,nice servers for eu
Negative,"Am take it this game but no have in game pets... so high price game,,, where is me presents?"
Negative,waste of time energy and money
Negative,Great game. Was having a blast till....the server nations attacked and wouldn't allow me to log in anymore.
Negative,"U35 is the biggest literal trash I have ever seen. These devs don't have a clue on how to make a game. they get offended we say they just sit there and golf. Buddy you do you don't even play your own game. Your only combat tester said he hit a target dummy for 80 hours testing, but not once did he even consider PVP content because you guys don't EVER consider pvp content. Hey though, if you enjoy fetch questing for some shit gear you wont ever use this is the game for you! if you are a low tier player crying its too easy for u i got news for you! you wont be able to do shit next patch good luck!!!!!! hazzzzah!"
Negative,"Bug of Scroll OnlineUpdate > Bug > Update to fix bug > More BugMy character has skill bug, cannot use any skill and this usually happens every few minutes.I have to reload the UI about 5 - 7 times when playing a dungeon because of this damn bug. And it only happened to one of my characters (DPS)Really very disappointed.P/s: yay, more bugs. Disconnect from the game when you die. Nice job ZoS"
Negative,Have you heard of the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV? With an expanded free trial which you can play through the entirety of A Realm Reborn and the award winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 for free with no restrictions on playtime.
Negative,"You have to buy the game and pay for a subscription or you will never be able to gather crafting material that is essential to any MMO. As long as this problem persists, this review will stay as is."
Negative,"Garbage filled with predatory microtransactions and boring combat mechanics.The elder scrolls IP is not strong enough to save this garbage game, avoid at all cost."
Negative,Considering how much this costs and how long its been out its shamefully buggy.
Negative,Imagine if over 50% of your dps was locked behind a hidden mechanic that no one told you about until you had 1500 hours in a game.Imagine if that hidden mechanic literally gives you carpal tunnel.Bad game design is bad game design.
Negative,"Absolutely amazing game. ESO has improved so much since its early days, so do not let old reviews hold you back. I dare say this is the absolute best game in its genre.Broken/buggy instanced content, particularily trials, where players experience disconnects left and right. An overland difficulty which is so laughably easy, you'll beat whatever threat Nirn is currently facing before they're done spouting their dry 5 second monologue. The support taking 3 months to get back to you. 100'ish euro player houses which are only available for a week, and how almost every single character-skin, unique armor/weapon-motif and mount is obtained through the Crown Crates (lootboxes). The whole Crown Store as a whole, with it's absolutely bonkers prices for these digital items. ZoS being ZoS.This game managed to climb all the way to the top of the MMO mountain, then tripped over itself, and faceplanted right down the other side."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THROUGH STEAM!!! Figured I would come back to this game since it went free to play, so I bought the game through steam. After the agonizing 60 gig download, I click start to be greeted by the Zenimax installer, which promptly crashes with no error message or warning as soon as the loading bar reaches 100%. That was two days ago and since then most of my free time has been spent trying to get the damn game to work, to no avail, no matter which wild and crazy ""fix"" I have tried on any forum or help site."
Negative,"Been playing wow for 7 years, and this game takes the cake!You can play how you want with no pressure to be ""top dps"" or restricted to certain weapons.UPDATED REVIEW 2023:So I have been playing it for a very long time (2825 hours) and enjoyed every minute. However, it seems things are changing up again for the worse; the crown store chests just encourages gambling and give nothing worthy in return; classes are still the same with same skills; I was hoping as the years go by there would be more customisation options like more hair styles or an eye patch for your right eye at least! Sorcerer pets and warden bears all look the same and could use a bit of personality.It seems more and more experiences as expansions go are being ""recycled"" with only reskins of same model creatures/mounts/mobs and it's gotten a bit boring.One good thing is that the community is still the best in this game than any other mmorpg and the companion system is what still brings me back .Maybe I have been playing it for too long, for new players it is definitely a joy still for story line and quests alone (just don't buy any crown store items or fall into the trap).Edit: Changed it to negative because I honestly don't get joy anymore from the game. People are still amazing in game, and the best feature is to have a companion you can adventure together with plus dungeons/trials, the story is still amazing...BUT, the difficulty in even getting stuff doing daily endeavours, the constant re-skins of items/mobs/creatures...Necrom was the only expansion I had no interest in getting.Hopefully things will change and I can change my review again to a positive, but for now, I feel it still hasn't deserved my upvote anymore."
Negative,I used to be addicted to this damn game. Playing it non-stop from the time I wake up until I sleep. Then they decided to change the whole concept of the game. Everything has switch to a single player game concept instead of it being MMO. The developers never listen to their player base; with each update you would think they can't ruin the game more than it is; then you would be surprised how those idiots can ruin it even more. The game has been going downhill since Paul Sage & Nick Konkle left and I don't see it recovering if the damned Matt Firor is in charge.
Negative,"This game is great! When it works... Since early May 2018 there has been significant downtime of the login server, which ONLY impacts people who bought the game through Steam. I can totally recommend buyign the game, but I cannot recommend anyone buys it via Steam. I wish I hadn't, but unfortunately I've played too long to get my money back and I gurdge buying it twice.If you like the idea of the game, do yourself a favour and buy it directly from elderscrolls.com"
Negative,buh buh buh BORING plus they sell your info
Negative,"After like 2 hours of logged hours, I was able to make it into the game and spend like 1 min ingame.TL;DRAt first, it had issues with linking to my Steam account which I resolved after like 30 mins. Then, it simply got stuck on loading screen for more than 15 mins (after 15 mins I left the PC for like 40+ mins and when I got back I was on the char creation screen). After letting me in, I changed a graph setting, ending up with another like 30+ mins of loading. Others are also complaining about it and they say I would experience the same ingame when zoning.. It's unacceptable. So, it's a no-go for now."
Negative,"It would be a great game if you didn't have to animation cancel in order to participate in end game content. This game literally expounded upon an in game glitch and used it as their ONLY means of separating themselves from mainstream MMORPG tab targeting style combat games like WoW. At the end of the day it feels like every other MMO but with a convoluted combat system. On top of all of that there is very little actual class customization and the 'meta' is one that rotates so classes are constantly being nerfed. So once your at the point you think your okay on the charts, nope. The RvR is ok but the dungeons are boring and in no way prepare you for end game unless your farming monster sets and even those are subject to meta restrictions and are also nerfed and in rotation. tons of micro transactions obviously since they come out with a new DLC every few weeks. Most of which hardly offer anything aside from a couple hours of story and a couple cosmetic items. Oh and an Expansion is not a DLC and a Chapter is not a DLC. So you have to either pay a sub and buy the DLC or you have to fork over cash for each. Its sorta like 'Warhammer; Inquisitor', they charge you for everything and whereas this makes sense for a gamesworkshop title, it does not make sense for a zenimax game. This is not a game, its an investment and it will not return the favor."
Negative,Mile wide and an inch deep
Negative,"It's not the fact that the servers are down all the time for me, it's the lack of communication while trying to get it back up"
Negative,"Great game, but I wouldn't buy it through Steam.  Servers have been down just for Steam Users 2 weekends in a row and multiple times in the last 4 months.  They have a workaround for everybody else who bought the game for PC, except for Steam users.So yeah, buy this game at a discount, and expect to not be able to play.ZOS/Steam/Bethesda refuse to acknowledge that there is an issue with logging into the servers (especially on holiday weekends), and their response is to give us a free crown crate.All I want is to be able to use the workaround like the non-Steam PC players..."
Negative,"Spent lots of money on this game. Only to have them give it away free before ramping up servers. Now Its hours+ just to try and log in. Note I said ""try"". Time to uninstall and find another game / company that knows what they are doing and gives a poop about the people that play."
Negative,"Can't even log into the game. Bethesda refuses to let me change my Bethesda account's security question properly, as even after I change the question and answer, inputting the answer I just selected tells me it's wrong. That's just a small part of many larger issues. The Bethesda help website, as linked on their main website, no longer exists according to the error code I received. So customer support just doesn't exist period. Trying to launch the game and log in via Steam tells me that either my email is already associated with an ESO account (it is, but not on PC, only on Xbox), or that the server timed out and it can't log me in. This is after I forcibly allowed the game and launcher to pass through Windows Security firewall. So I tried launching the game via the exe within the files. Tells me the computer I'm using isn't authorized, and I need to verify a code they'll send to my email. They have sent zero codes. I've tried several times, though to be fair it does mention that you have to wait a mere 24 HOURS before trying again! I've never once played an online game with this many ridiculous roadblocks to playing. Bethesda is owned by Xbox! Let me log in with my Xbox account and be done with it! Bad enough they removed the game from PC Game Pass for whatever insane reason! This is absolutely absurd, I would have requested a refund already if not for the fact my friends have already been playing for too long to request refunds themselves. Lucky them, having 30-something spare emails to throw at ridiculous situations like this one. I cannot even comprehend the level of incompetence in whoever programmed this game, this website, this entire combination. Absolutely absurd that I now have a 120GB chunk of utterly useless data sitting on my hard drive. But then again Fallout 76 did the same thing when it refused to uninstall. If this level of complete carelessness is the standard for Bethesda/Zenimax, then I absolutely worry for Starfield and all future games produced by these companies."
Negative,"I was enjoying the game and didn't have too many negatives however i have not been able to log in and play for almost 2 weeks. I have sent a ticket and I have had no response so at this stage until you can actually log in to the game and play I do not recommend buying it, don't waste your money"
Negative,Account was hacked after about a 1 year break from the game and swiftly perma banned. No way to recover the account now even after submitting tickets to their support trying to un-ban my account.
Negative,The game does not show in my steam library i spent that money for nothing!!
Negative,"Noooooo!   I do not suggest this game to even hardcore mmo players.  It's built to not be user friendly unless you pay for the subscription and even then it lacks a lot of features that even the most old mmos have.   The servers are terrible!  I'm currently paying for eso+ and still get booted on a regular basis.  Just looking at what the crown store bundles come with for the price should show you that this is just another game to suck your money away.  The price to upgrade your game is unbelievable with big updates, practically paying full price with each dlc.  Really scummy.   Not surprised with how the gaming industry is lately."
Negative,Good luck to the new buyers installing this game. Because you guys need it.
Negative,"This shity launcher installer is taking forever, 90% of my game time is installing the game instead of playng"
Negative,"The Elder Scrolls Online is an MMO game, which sounded great at first, but when I got to play it on the free 2 week trial, I got really bored of it really fast and I just couldn't force myself to continue on with this game.Pros:- Elder Scrolls universe- You can create your own character and classes (Obvious for an MMO game)- Graphics look quite great- Soundtrack is really good- Lots of content and huge maps/areas to explore- Every dialogue is voice acted- Dungeons- PVP- Guilds/ClansNeutral:- The story was okay in my 10~ hours of playtime, but not that great or engaging, but I didn't play the entirety of it, because there are way too many so I can't say much about it story wise.- Text chat is there, noone really uses it, I've only seen clan advertisementsCons:- Movement feels janky- The combat is really bad and clunky, even for an MMO. I never played much MMO games, but the combat in this one is just yikes.- The game is too easy, enemies doesn't give much damage and you just spam LMB and your abilities, not really engaging.- Heavy microtransactions and the game is not even free.- The game doesn't look so spectacular yet the performance can be quite bad a lot of times.- AI is janky6/10 The problem with this game is that the combat is so janky, bad and repetitive. I'm not saying the game is bad, because it's full of content, but it's just simply not for me, if you are into this MMO stuff, I'm not gonna judge.I just played around 10 hours which is quite a short time for a game like this so I didn't experience everything this game could throw at me, but first impressions weren't so great."
Negative,"It's just not fun. Everything responds, is super spongy and the story is insignificant."
Negative,PVE 10/10 PVP 0/10
Negative,"If you want to play Morrowind in 2018, I guess this is what you're getting, unfortunately this game doesn't grab me in any way. Combat is really weak for an MMO and is really just glorified skyrim with a skill bar. Limited inventory space was a real killer when I got 60 crafting items and ran out of space, and wasn't shown how to craft any of them so I just had to delete them. I didn't make it three hours before I just, decided I don't care at all about this game. Like a bad $10 meal I'm going to just forget I ever ate it."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY FROM STEAMIt's a great game, but Steam has been having login issues since I started. Every week we here it's ""fixed"", next week it happens again. These are not small outages, many lasting >10 hours. Buy from the online ESO store, they can always play while Steam users cannot."
Negative,"if you just want to follow quest markers and fight samey mobs every 200 feet or so, this game has weeks of content for you and you'll probably love itotherwise, it is absolutely terrible. terrible drop system for dungeons, terrible skill system with pve-focused skills locked behind doing pvp, terrible enemy aggro because the developers want you to fight absolutely everything on your way to your quest objective or whatever it is you're pursuingthe NPCs are forgettable (despite how hard the game tries to make you remember them, even reusing some NPCs across multiple DLCs and dungeons) and the dialogue is uninspired. I feel bad clicking through dialogue until I actually read it and realize I have to listen to 20 more NPCs per zone prattle on because that's how quest-dense this game isthe worst part of dialogue is the meaningless choices because there is not a single fucking decisive npc in this game. NONE OF THEM, from peasant to king, can make a fucking decision for themselves. this is what turned me off the storylines so much. have fun shaping the world to how you want it by deciding which NPCs live and die that you'll never see again anywaystoo bad, the open world/caves/ruins/etc are great and have much more variety than skyrim, but the stuff they put in it is just bleh"
Negative,"It's a scam. Most of the content is locked behind in-game paywalls. The game should've been free to play by that logic, but its not. Also, there isn't an option to buy all the content up-front; you HAVE TO PAY IN_GAME for several individual DLCs no matter which ""pack"" you buy. It's true that there's always more content coming, but each of the zone DLCs costs almost the same as any modern AAA title if not more, and the contents are like one-fifth of the size of any other game that you can play at the same price. And for all the Skyrim fans out there; just stay away from it. This ain't a sequel; it's just a mage simulator, a very bad one at that."
Negative,DO NOT BUY THIS THROUGH STEAM!It's a good game overall but steam users are constantly locked out due to logins being down. Buy it from the ESO website but DO NOT buy a steam version!
Negative,Don't bother with this they've gone woke and added Dei companion characters

Negative,THE DEVS CAN DRINK MY HOT PISS
Negative,After all the hours I have put into this game they change the game so much that it's completely ruined. At this point I do not wish to learn hours upon hours of new builds just to make up for their complete remodel of the entire system. I do not recommend purchasing this game.
Negative,"I enjoyed the feeling of playing an updated Morrowind with the architecture and the world top notch.  The trouble is there was never any sense of threat or challenge, playing solo just cutting through the quests like a hot knife through butter.  Morrowind I remember having to be very careful which quests to do and then how to fight; this is just spam any attack you like from wherever you like and you'll probably be fine.  This takes the edge away from the lore of the quest, because you know you can do the quest so easily you can rush through it."
Negative,"It feel like a cheap knock-off the Elder Scrolls game. I have tried to get into it twice by now and each time I lost interest in two hours or so. Typical MMORPG flaws such as overly complicated systems and general chaos in everything like UI, menus etc. could be expected and forgiven. The bland gameplay cannot however.There is but one interesting mechanic in combat and that are status effects affecting the player and not just NPCs. The problem is that they are so poorly executed that they feel like a glitch in the game rather than intentional effect applied to the player. Think when you got hit by heavy weapon in Skyrim but instead of smooth screen shake a ""feel of being hit by something heavy"" you get stuck in place unable to move or do anything. Yeah... I mean no. It gets old really quickly. It might work in 3rd person view but in the 1st person it is just terrible experience.The biggest problem however are the class and skills system. What Skyrim did absolutely right was getting rid of classes altogether. Sprinkle some racial bonuses and let anyone develop any skill however they wanted. Well not in ESO. It is not even Oblivion style character progression but your generic XP and skill-points based system. The skill development plays some minor role in that it is required to ""level up skill"" in order to transform it (upgrade it) which however still costs skill points. What could have been absolutely superb system for an online game was completely ditched in ESO.These were two points that I feel were most important for me in both attempts to get into this game. But I really cannot recommend it. In comparison to other MMORPGs it is ok, maybe even better than most, but as Elder Scrolls game it is pure garbage. And yet all it would take was to actually take the inspiration from the Elder Scrolls games and not just the name..."
Negative,Too much MMO not enough Elderscrolls.
Negative,i really like the hot cat men but i wish the gameplay was more fun...
Negative,The Elder Scrolls® Offline
Negative,login issues...every single day
Negative,"It's not awful. But there are much more fun games out there, and Elder Scrolls can be much better than this MMO."
Negative,"ESO is so poorly optimized and super CPU bound, as are most mmorpgs, but this one isn‘t even utilizing my CPU properly, my GPU load drops so low it goes into powersaving mode, pretty awfulThe true ESO experience is getting stuck in a 20 minute loading screen booting up the game just for being kicked out due to inactivity, tbh it's so annoying that ZOS isn't working on fixing really annoying bugs that have been there since launch or at least since i started playing (loading screen bug) and we got more bugs AFTER every patch, i mean: should fix the previous, but no, they just introduced more bugsESO is actually pretty fun, the world-building and side quests are *chef's kiss* and the crafting in this game is SO GOOD!! but what the hell zenimax, the optimization puts me off from coming back to this game"
Negative,Cons:-High ms ( current servers are not enough for all people world wide ) which isn't viable for pvp players-Toxic DDs who dont deal dmg in end game pve-U need to own every dlc or else u will lack something (including gear that will give u a huge advantage in pvp and pve) which is pretty bad for a purchasable game ( if it was free this wouldn't have made it in the cons )-The large scale pvp ( cyrodil ) is empty most of the time especially at night which isn't viable if you have a job or a scheduled day same thing goes for the pvp/e (the imperial city)-Poor optimisation-Long Qs after midnight for pvp matches (battleground) and pve veteran dungeonsPros:-The sound is great an eargasm to say the least-The plots (main story / dlc stories / faction missions / dungeons) are well written and voiced-A friendly community out of end game pve of course-Auridon and the players standing in it <3That's it i hope my review was helpful
Negative,"Actually a good game aside from slow trickle rate of real end game content, being forced to pay a sub for a game that already was purchased, expansions sold seperately, the ""crown store"" and the subsequent crown crates are extensively ham fisted. want a mount? pay up sucker, dont have enough inventory space? sub up sucker. all of this can be put aside because at this point and time all these aforementioned issues are just the cancer of the gaming industry at present. live service games, microtransactions for everything (e.g. a merchant you can summon to sell your trash can be bought for 5000 crowns/£40), inadequate progression for a touted mmorpg, etc, i could go on about all the little issues about eso but aside from all of that, the major glaring issue of course is lack of optimisation, struggles to ever use more than 4 cpu threads so fps can be a rock solid in a dungeon at an easy 240fps but once you go to the overworld be prepared for sub-30fps and there is nothing you can do about it, dont even try to pvp in Cyrodiil 30fps with 120ms ping for a uk based player on an EU server is shameful in 2021. Cyberpunk 2077 on max settings runs better than this game, thats all that needs to be said really."
Negative,"this is a big let down to the elder scrolls franchise as it takes away the sweet golden centre of a honeybun and turns it into a steaming pile of shit. The scaling is horse shit as the beggining of the game i cant die and i can kill everything and the later dungeons i still can barely die but everything is unkillable, if your looking for a challenging experience this is not a game for you. Also the story is boring and lame.1/10"
Negative,Only makes me want to play skyrim and morrowind again
Negative,"I put way too much time, effort, and money into a game that thrives on microtransactions and literal loot gambling. Though I've participated in all of it, I'm not proud of it. Will I continue doing it? Probably."
Negative,"I enjoy about half my time in game as is. It's riddled with lag, disconnects, and problems though that I don't really get excited to log on and do anything, knowing I'll get interrupted by some system issue on their side. When reporting the issue or asking for a fix? Silence from the other side. Cannot recommend as is."
Negative,"You cant transfer your character. Coming back from working over sees for a couple of years, that was heartbreaking. Everything is lost, Everything you worked for. You cant even purchase a transfer. Uninstalled. Get it together Bethesda."
Negative,"It's been years of the same cycles. Ignoring feedback from its playerbase, buffing something to the point where its not fun to play anything but that thing, nerfing it to the ground and making it unplayable for 6-9 months at a time.They can do better and simply arent. Imagine getting bought out by Microsoft and still acting like you have 5 dollars to your name when it comes to managing a game that makes as much money as this one does. Just listen to the people who want to give you money so they can give you money. If you get the game for free, dont put a cent into it. Youll feel like a chump if you do, just like me."
Negative,"this is the worst MMORPG I ever played, I played bad games that had a lack of content like the world of warcraft but at least they are work just fine, controls are responsive servers are stable, but in ESO u can't even control your character so much input lag in large content, PvP completely has broken, Support section most of the time never gonna answer ur Ticket, so many years past since lunch and still u see day 1 problem in this game if u are a casual gamer and u just wanna explore the world by yourself and u play for the lore of game it's an ok game but if u are hardcore gamer u gonna suffer a lot that why u waste so many time on this garbage gameLong story short, we should never ever support Bethesda and Blizzard anymore, those companies belong garbage can like other Clones(EA and etc), money-hungry piece of *****gonna start playing Final Fantasy 14 instead of this trash, hopefully this game doesn't make me leave with a deep wound"
Negative,"This really isn't that great. Sounded good as I love most of the elder scrolls games and sounded like a good mmo. Was happy and excited for it.Until I got it, the game has been out for 3 years and during the 3 DAYS of playing I have encountered the same bug 4 times. The bug includes me not being able to interact with anything, this then makes me have to log out. Which isn't that much of a pain until you are in the Imperial City and have to run back to where ever you where. This is tolerable, just a time waster and an annoyance at most.But then, no Oceania servers. What. The. Fuck. People live on this side of the Globe and not just in NA and EU. Its even annoying in PVE having enemies who seem like they aren't in melee range hit you with melee. Then PVP is unplayable, my friend and I decided to have a duel for fun (We live 2 blocks away from each other) and it was the most annoyingly difficult fight for the both of us. We would hit when we thought we missed, we would miss when it should have been a hit etc, etc.I imagine it costs a lot of money to get Oceanic servers but it is really a necessity, I also know not many mmos have Oceanic servers but I thought one with a publisher as big as Bethesda would.TLDR: Good Gameplay, Bad bugs, RIP Oceania"
Negative,"Elder Scrolls Online is, by no means, a bad game: It is competently made, has some cool missions, and can be really fun with friends. My problem with the game is that it doesn't know if it wants to be an MMO or just Skyrim, but way worse. The main story really doesn't fit for a MMO, because you're the great hero, the only problem being that there are 20 other ""great heroes"" running around doing exactly the same things as you are, which destroys the immersion for this. The story is not bad, but not that great either, so it doesn't really compensate for the weirdness of the disconnect between the story and what's actually hapenning in the game. There are some pretty good quests, which will be especially cool if you're an Elder Scrolls Fan, but I would describe none of them as great. There is a lot of them though.Playing this game with friends is also pretty weird, because you can't really do most quests together, so you will just have to start the same quest at the same time and do them at the same time. The only thing you'll be working together in will be killing the enemies and the rest everyone has to do themselves. There are dungeons that are made for coop, which are pretty fun, but they're more the exeption rather than the rule.One thing that is pretty great about the game is the PVP mode, where you try to capture or defend castles from the other 2 factions. This can sometimes really feel like you're sieging a castle and really requires working together. The problem is, that to capture a castle, you'll need to have a lot of people to destroy their walls, so you'll either be lucky and find people that want to siege and just come along, or die in one minute after you arrived at the castle.Elder Scrolls Online is, as I mentioned before, not a bad game. It's just neither good as a Single-Player RPG, nor as a MMO, which makes it not only feel really weird to play alone, but also weird when you play with a friend. If you really want to experience the semi-single-player content, I think you'll be fine if you can accept 5 other players doing exactly the same thing as you, but if you want this for playing Coop, I do not recommend it."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM!!!I love the game and I DO recommend it to new and vet Elder Scrolls fans (on consoles and on the Zenimax launcher) but seriously, don't buy it on Steam! Ever since Summerset was released, there have been constant login error issues on the Steam launcher that take hours if not a whole day to resolve and if you buy from Steam, you're unable to launch the game without the Steam launcher. In other words, you bought a game you can't play. The negative recommendation is only for buying it here. Do play the game somewhere else though."
Negative,la boucle du scénario...
Negative,"When I first joined ESO, it had such a unique feeling to it. It was a new experience and really had an interesting style. I fell in love with the game.Now I slowly change my opinion.The animations were the first thing to make me shudder, but are nowhere near as disgusting as the voice acting. The only good or sometimes remotely decent voice actors were those from Skyrim. Next, quests. I learned something really important; you know a game has good quests when you remember them all the way through from the first playthrough. I can't recall a single quest I did until I re-do them in an alternative character.The next thing to point out was how quickly I saw that the game is a pay-to-play. Upon its release it was a subscription based game. Don't fall for the lie- it still is. They made the game a single-purchase, but now in order to have access to so much as the air the developers breathe, you must pay a criminal's fine. Or just go for the subscription! Which grants you access to all of ESO's goods, with exclusive rewards just for you, the wealthy or simply daft enough to waste money on it.Next up is how all the playthroughs feel like a vague dream, or distant memory. One slips right through a dungeon hardly noticing they were playing it. It feels odd and unsettling.Guilds; the dev's couldn't care less about it. All they wish for is money. But guilds are fun! Are they not? To have more features like dedicated guild-halls which actually appear on the interface, maybe a custom player-submitted quest / request system! A reward for anyone who can do so and so, or who can hunt down this world boss! Yada, yada! So much room for fun, so much room for growth, so much room for perfection, yet if it brings no money it's not worth it.However, if the game was actually worth people's time, wouldn't it bring more money indirectly?Don't misunderstand me- the base ESO is a fun experience. I really enjoy it even today, despite having so little to do of remote interests (eurgh, quests make me feel ill at how uninteresting and dull they are), but it is not worth shedding a molecule of a penny beyond that point on this game.In short, buy it if you dare, buy DLCs / literally anything else other than the base game if you're stupid."
Negative,There needs to be a one time fee for the bag in this game.I can't recommend because of this one thing.I stopped playing awhile ago.
Negative,Removing tamriel ed. from store was soo clever.
Negative,"I really, really wanted this to be something I could get into indefinitely.  I am one of many jaded MMO players who are sick of companies who cater to casuals, and basically ruin every thing that made MMO's great to begin with.  I have started ESO online about three different times hoping I would have a different experience.  This time I made it to lvl 39, I have had two conversations with actual people the whole time.  Dungeons are rushed, people just run through so fast you can't read the accompanying quests or enjoy anything.  Leveling is scaled to such an extent that keeping any loot is pointless until ""CP 160"" where gear stops scaling.  I loved the voice acting, the quests, the world in general.  I have yet to find any players other than standing around in towns.  The game is riddled with micro transactions, naturally, as all modern mmo's tend to be.  I would gladly buy things if I felt I could catch up or find some players to actually enjoy the ""online"" experience.  You can join pvp and be owned by a mad mob or someone who has many thousands of hours of ganking noobs like yourself...yeah no thanks.  Leveling up doesn't even feel rewarding, as you feel very powerful to begin with...mobs are not a challenge during the leveling process.  I won't be purchasing anymore Bethesda products."
Negative,"I jumped into buying this game relatively blindly on the prompting of a few friends of mine. I'm sad to say, I'll not be able to play the game at all. (Refund pending at the time of this review) I cannot in good concious recommend this game. Unless your computer is extremely good AND your internet connection is also /EXTREMELY/ good, I would not buy this game. Save yourself the 30+ bucks, go buy Skyrim. (Which, oddly, I can play just fine, even with a lot of mods)Of my small amount of 'play time', almost the entirety of it was spent in a load screen. What little wasn't spent fighting the mighty load screen boss, was spent fighting with the character creator. (I had to wait an average of 45sec-2min for any change to actually apply to my character) Couple these issues with the ~10+ hour download that literally ate the entire internet connection for my household (hard to do when normally we have several computers and a TV all on the same connection doing different things)....Yeah, this bundle of trouble left a bad taste in my mouth and an ache in my already thin wallet I'm hoping will be soothed shortly."
Negative,The game doesn't have dedicated Asian / Australian server so forget playing this game if that's your region. The developers dont care about their playerbase and refuse to listen to what we want and need to play the game. Lag lag lag lag. Its also a pay to win as its basically impossible to enjoy the game without membership. So have fun paying $15 a month on top of the $35 you pay to buy the game just to be laggy and not even capable of endgame content.
Negative,"Edit; This is still 100% relevant in 2020. Just encouraged a friend to buy the game. The EXACT same thing is happening to him. I think it's an issue from our beta accounts. We both played during Beta. It's the only thing that makes sense. Because for whatever reason when he tries to reset his password he doesn't get a reset email-- just like I didn't. Then when you try to login to customer service, you can't because you don't have access to your account password because we can't reset our accounts. We're both adults and know how to use computers, it wasn't in our junk mail folders or anything like that. Like I say below, others have experienced this. I had to end up refunding through Steam then purchasing it through the ESO website. Basically lost my account that had been in existence since 2014 because they don't have their stuff organized. I was never even able to access the game. I was told by customer support, over Reddit, that the problem I was experiencing had already been solved. Then I was ignored. Why was I receiving customer support over Reddit you ask? Because I had absolutely no way to contact their customer support by any other means, except Facebook and Google+, I took the lesser of three evils and tried Reddit. Honestly they genuinely believe the issue is solved, even though dozens of people are contacting them via Facebook, Google+, and Reddit. I've seen six Facebook wall posts there by people describing the same problem as me all posted after the EOS rep replied to me on Reddit. ( https://www.reddit.com/user/ZOS_GinaBruno ) Here is the response I received. ""Was the issue that you guys aren't receiving your one-time passwords? If so, we did have an issue with them over the weekend, but has since been resolved. If there's something else going on, though, please let us know.""First thing wrong with that is that she stated ""over the weekend"". I can see reports on their Facebook of the problem occuring a couple weeks ago, and after searching online I'm seeing reports of it fairly consistently for about three weeks now. So the issue itself is that I'm being told I need a confirmation email to login to the game, and their support forums. I'm able to login to the main website, but the main website is just the game store essentially, and your account information. To access their customer support you have to visit a different website that requires you to login separately. Also worth noting is that I am using the correct email, I've received one confirmation email when I first set my account up, I think that's why I can access the main website, because that's where I entered the confirmation code. There's nothing in my spam folder, I'm familiar with computers in general and am not experiencing issues like this anywhere else. They provide no other means of contacting their customer service other than by being logged in to that customer service website. That means that if you need customer service in order to regain access to your account, you're completely 100% shit out of luck. That to me is the main issue at play here, not the confirmation email issue.Just the way that the one response I finally did get was so dismissive of it, because it was on their social media they obviously had to ""get ahead of it"" and make it seem like the problem was already gone... Instead of actually trying to determine exactly what the problem was, and whether it was fixed... Anyways I can't recommend this game to anyone, I've been talking with a few other people on Facebook who I've seen posting on their Facebook wall, we're all incredulous that this can even happen. I mean I've never experienced anything even close to this in over twenty years of gaming on a PC, and I've dealt with some pretty shitty companies.If this was a new game I could understand it, new games have kinks that need to be worked out. This game is over two years  old, these systems they have in place are there for a reason. It's easier on their customer service if they don't receive random messages, I get that, but the idea that someone will never ever ever run into issues with accessing their account is asanine. That's what they're relying on with the system they have in place.Luckily for me I was able to get a refund even though I technically had two hours played, which was just the ESO launcher downloading a bunch of updates and patching them."
Negative,"Gameplay is good, graphics are also good which makes the fact that you can't log in into the game for 3 hours each day on average (i'm not even counting usual weekly maintenance) even worse. Try googling ""Bethesda Support Twitter"" and check how many times they had server down.I recommend you to stay away from this game."
Negative,"wont buy this game . . . never . . .  developers didnt listen to you , they want just money and dont care about players. . .  you should pay money for all DLCs and every 6 month you have new DLC . . ."
Negative,Get all the things. Run around in circle in town. Close game. Endgame experience
Negative,"Ok gameplay, but lack of any significant feeling of progression due to abilities being frontloaded, passives not having significant effects on gameplay, and scaling enemies.Combine that with a terrifying Ala Carte presentation of gameplay (to the point that even using the Dungeon Finder is in a $20 piece of DLC). What most MMO's (both Free and Subscription) would provide as free content patches, this game charges you $15-$25 a pop for.The only reason I got as much playtime as I did was because it made Morrowind look Beautiful, and Morrowind  is probably my favorite fantasy setting ever, but that only goes so far."
Negative,"If your someone who prefer buying the game ounce and hoping to enjoy all the content it has to offer , this game is not for you. This game in a way pressures players into paying for a subscription service in order to enjoy everything and have full advantage over players like me who just buy the game ounce and don't want to spend anymore real money on in game  . Oh not just that they also make DLC every year where you have to pay for it every year and DLC cost like a price of a new AAA title that just came out, in United states thats about 60-70USD. Come on they should really make a deluxe edition or season pass that if someone pays a bit more , they should have automatic access to new DLC every year . But nope we have to pay for it as it come out. This practice is totally unacceptable but its really unfortunate people still support and praise the game . Come on this is a paid game to begin with not a free to play, but it acts like a free to play and locking contents under either a subscription service or Paid DLCs. I understand they need to make money but there better ways , not like this ."
Negative,please make SEA server bcs your game is so damn lag here.
Negative,"Stop banning more iranian people! The Sanctions are removed, you have no rights to do it anymore and i suggest that you unbann poeple who are banned due to this act."
Negative,"The warm atmosphere in Skyrim, Oblivion and Morrowind is unfortunately in absent  this game.Bethesda developers do not give the necessary attention to this game. The only thing they do is make money with new map packages. The updates they publish in order to fix the mistakes sometimes damage the game. Tasks resemble each other and repeat each other.Kısaca, Bethesda sen Online oyun yapma."
Negative,"Game got better after tons of patches, still have lots of work to do.The loader still excruciating, every patch, every crash make you download 65GB all over again...The game turned to be like others ""free to play"", just a bit less annoyingly on remembering you are a freeloader...Personal taste: they destroyed bow mechanic to me, huge let down.For game currency and goods had only headaches as Zenimax simple ignore in any hassle you may have with his new man-in-the-middle payment system Xsolla, who not accept currency outside USD and USD credit card."
Negative,"If you've player ES: Morrowind, ES: Oblivion, and Es: Skyrim and really want more in the Elder Scolls world, this will scratch that itch, but don't expect the same satisfaction of exploration & discovery you had in those games. Below are the issues I have with the game, but before I get to them let me tell you what's good about the game: It has stories in settings familiar to anyone who has played the single-player games. It's pretty satisfying to run through the story around Vivec, set about 1,000 years before the events of Morrowind. Side quests don't feel like random fetch quests either, ranging from short 1/2 hour affairs of minor events (rescuing slaves, for example) to longer stories that might take 2-3 hours (like working through the intricacies of a nobleman's daughter caught up in the Morag Tong assasin's guild and trying to figure out the mysterious exile of her brother) But in short, story ==  good, gameplay mechanics etc == mediocre.One of the core problems is that difficulty scaling is taken entirely too far. People complained about it in Skyrim, but ESO takes to the extreme. You'll encounter 3 levels of enemies: Those with 30k health, those with 60k health, and those with 100k health. And no matter your level, it's about the same difficulty to beat them at all points in the game. There's no exploring and finding an area with high level mobs and struggling to find a strategy to take them down. Fighting a 100k enemy near a starter area is pretty much the same experience as fighting one 20 levels later in some far flung environment. This takes a lot of fun out of exploring: You can't sneak your way into a harder area, craft a strategy to take down a high-level enemy or sneak in to grab so awesome loot and come out with something unique. I want to stumble on 300k health enemy, get whipped, come back prepared with potions and a strategy. Know how many times something like that happened to me, in about 300 hours of play? Once. The first time I found a 200k health enemy. Next time I dodged a bit faster, and never had a problem with them again.This pretty much means leveling is meaningless. You never have the experience of finding a hard patch of enemies, running away, leveling or forming a strategy to come back to dominate them. Some quest lines will throw the occasional 200k health enemy at you, which takes a bit more strategy, but they're all pretty much the same. And there's the occasional high-danger 1 million+ health enemy spawns for daily quests that require a group to take down, which, again, once you've done one you've pretty much found the formula for them all in the usual MMO trifecta: Tank, DPS, Healer. There's no leveling process that will eventually let you take on such an enemy alone: It will kill you in 10 seconds whether you're level 5 or 50. Otherwise, some of the same basic mechanics of Elder Scrolls games remain, but it's like a watered down version that lacks the soul that makes the single-player games so compelling. In the single player games, you can pick some starting attributes, but you're not bound by them. You can level any you want with trainers & practice, the only exception being you need to advance core skills to actually level up the character itself. In ESO, it's completely different. You choose a class, and you're stuck with it. There's some common skills around armor, crafting, etc. that anyone can choose, but the skills that impact your main experience are hard coded. If you chose a sorcerer class, you're stuck with it: You have no access to class skills of other classes to try & go your own way. And you get the same spells as everyone else: Want to craft your own spell that delivers massive damage but drains half your magicka? Nope, can't do that sort of thing here. The skill leveling process is also a bit of a bait & switch: it seems like things level the more you use them, and sure if you never use something it will not level, but if you do use it, your ability to level it is pretty much capped by your overall level. The skill XP required to level a skill increases so much with each level that you'll never really be able to advance a skill much faster  your core level. And an XP levelling system for your base level is the core of this issue. Normal ES games you level up when you level up skills. In ESO, you do it by XP from mobs, quests, etc. Combined with a nerfed skill leveling system, it takes the heart out of what made the single player games so interesting: No fixed class, no limits on skills, just get better the more you do something.Single player ES games also have great crafting systems. In ESO it's the epitome of MMO grind. There's ""node"" and if someone else got there first, it's gone for a set period of time. Everything is scarce. You could spend an hour scavenging for any materials or ingredients and come up with 20. In fact that's roughly the average. In Skyrim, I could pick 20 herbs just by taking a casual 7 minute stroll from Hagen to the starting town, not looking too hard for anything.Then there's the gear: In single player games there aren't level caps on gear. You could get lucky and stumble upon a piece of heavy gear deciding for yourself to balance the added weight against lost room for more loot, throwing points to strength as needed. Not here. Iron gear until level 16. Then steel gear for a while, etc. Even that has level caps. Slightly better iron gear from what you start with is capped for level 8 and above. And given the auto leveling system, which levels loot too, a few hours of play will give you gear that's about as good as it gets for your level. A level 16 steel item item really isn't a whole lot worse than a level 25 steel item, the cap for steel. You CAN get some a little better, not a whole lot but a little, if you grind crafting and make it yourself or get lucky with loot drops. Over a solid week of play I managed to get most of a set of Poet armor, which has nice but completely unnecessary stat boosts. Once you have the game's mechanics down, you really won't get killed much more or less with basic armor for your level or the better stuff, and it's a huge grind to get the better stuff, by which time at least a few pieces are a no longer the best because you've leveled out of them. Not that it makes any difference.Basically you're left with a game that gutted the core gameplay mechanics that make the single-player games so compelling and substituted them with MMO versions. Instead of trying to give the soul of Elder Scrolls to an MMO environment, they gave the typical mediocre gameplay soul of an MMO to an Elder Scrolls game. Play for the stories set in a familiar & compelling world, but don't expect the satisfaction of gameplay mechanics from the single player games. Combat is boring. Loot is boring. Exploring gets you nothing worth the effort. But because the game auto levels the difficulty, you can at least enjoy the stories without having to grind much."
Negative,"Update 35 killed combat. Devs don't listen to playerbase and even belittles us on social media. Good luck trying to git gud when nerf hammer comes every 3 months to ""shake up meta"" or ""accessibility"". PVP is a lagfest on that one campaign where everyone is, the other campaigns are mostly dead.Otherwise if you like questing or RP-ing, it's like Skyrim Online."
Negative,"Cannot log in, ""unexpected internal error has occurred"". Seeing posts all over forums with the same error message since last year. Can only mean developers simply do not care."
Negative,"Absolute garbage, worst game I've ever played."
Negative,"So far, updating the Launcher counts a ""play time"".There goes the refund policy if I continue to just install this game.Paused till I make up my mind about this sneaky tactic."
Negative,"failed logins, constant crashes, 100000 bugs and don't try to play in the evening cos u know servers will lag so hard monsters will start spinning in place doing nothing."
Negative,"I bought the game to play with my husband, it has arround 70gb to download over steam but the game one steam it`s ridiculous old, and it would need more 20gb of updates. Result I let the game updating and installing, steam counted the time on the laucher as played time, we didn`t like the game and we coulnd`t get refound. As the game hasn`t any free trial, demo, etc. I watched a lot of videos in youtube and the game just simply didn`t reach my espectations..."
Negative,"common occurrence for the servers to go down for extended periodsdisappointing balancing(PVP), forced to play metaover 20 dlc's you have to pay for(including very basic ones like dark brotherhood, thieves guild and different classes) or buy a monthly subscription. The game feels very expensive, crown store prices for pretty much anything are very steep. another detail of the crown store is that you have to pay for (almost) everything like changing the race of your character. leveling up a new character takes a very long time.lots of enemies are exactly the same with a different name and more hp, even in ''newer'' dungeons. this is common for a lot of mmorpgs but very noticeable in ESO.Leveling up and following the main storyline was the most enjoyable part for me as most quests in the game are well made, even if some quests don't exactly follow the Lore. However to progress the main story line you have to buy DLC's ..."
Negative,"I really enjoyed this game but what killed my experience with it (and why I will no longer play it), is having to run back and forth to towns and my stash boxes to manage my items and storage space. I find it cruel and oppressive that to thoroughly enjoy this game (in my opinion), you have the option to pay for a subscription which provides the functionality that eliminates all that hassle. That is to say, for 14.99 a month, they make available to you an extra inventory in which all the items you would be spending time going back and forth to manage, are now in an infinite storage space. Without paying for an infinite inventory space I found the game more stressful than fun. It's very disappointing to me that this functionality is not included in the game itself because this is one of my favorite games. It's still a fun game though, nonetheless. But I would not recommend this game to others for the reason of having to pay for inventory space."
Negative,"Seeing that after 7 hours of trying, I still could not manage to even access the login, I have to say that I do definitely not recommend the Steam version of this game. Apparently 5 years aren't enough time to fix an issue that smacks you in the face 10 seconds in. I'm severly disappointed and do not think it was worth the money, discount or not. I didn't pay 10 quid to stare at a loading screen that constantly spouts ""Requesting Login"" for over 5 hours."
Negative,"The overworld was painfully easy and made the game boring. I was wanting to play because of the lore and stories, but the brain dead difficulty made it impossible to take seriously. I know there are ""hard"" dungeons, but these are an extremely small sliver of the story potential of the game. Additionally, having all areas being public, like little delves, completely ruin the immersion. I'm being told this crypt hasn't been opened for 1000 years by some NPC and when I enter it's just a bunch of players grinding the monsters and boss. I quit the game and I don't plan on coming back until this is changed."
Negative,"New players listen, ill conclude this to you - its a good game, but without the subscription (not talking about buying expansions) you wont enjoy it like you should, in the long term."
Negative,Devs need to figure out the advertising for this game. The $60 version comes with very little. Nearly all areas are locked behind the membership. None of this is explained on any of the store pages.
Negative,You need to but DLCs to progress or continue into the gameThat is so trash WTF
Negative,"Too expensive. The skins, the DLC, the memberships, all of it. Not a complete waste of time and effort at all but if my two options are ""yes"" or ""no"", it's gonna be a ""no."""
Negative,craft bag is dumb
Negative,"Never actually got into the game, i couldn't activate my account as i never got the confirmation email, after nearly a week of talking to support and despite being told i'd be contacted by another team, i never heard back.I was already on the fence about this 'live service' product, but not actually being able to play at all after the 120GB+ download, solidified my decision to refund it."
Negative,"bought the gold edition for $80 back in like 2016 that included everything or at least almost everything, the code i was given to activate it never worked, i contacted support and they basically told me to do everything i had already done, didnt work. they sent me a new code. new code didnt work. so i refunded it. now it is terribly monetized because the developers only care about money and i can never get it again, and will likely never play this because of the terrible monetization practices."
Negative,The game has no real progression at all once u hit the basic low cap all new xpacks and content are the same level and same gear tiers... its only a reskin of armor.. Same abilitys same everything. Overall a horrific launch now thats its stable and Solid the content design is a joke a MMO designed as if a single player game. This and 76 were both two greedy attempts at multiplayer games for a company famous for RPGs... failed us wasted tons of money when they could have just made them both single player or small team RPG games and made tripple the income.
Negative,"It's a cool game, the graphics are okay, the gameplay is the same of Skyrim, but the microtransations(Housing is basically just buying with real money), Loot Boxes and forced DLC's(you need buy a DLC for use a basic function of the game like desconstruction of a ring) this three things make this game not worth the price.Oh, and if you think buy this game for PVP, better think twice before buying because it's extremely unbalanced the two things happen is you vs X or a immortal one-shot people"
Negative,"Great game, however do not purchase it through steam. There's always a log in issue. Bethesda will put the blame on steam and once you try to report the issue to steam, steam will tell you the problem should be solved with Bethesda. What a shit show."
Negative,"The game is really fun, I love it. But do NOT purchase this game through steam (you may not even be able to refund). Just purchase from the developer directly.Steam version of this game has login issues every now and then. Mostly after an update or during a very busy weekend (when there is an event going on). Mean while non steam players will be happily playing the game.The game launches via a Launcher which handles all updates and run constantly in the background even when you play. Steam counts run-time of this launcher for total play time. So while the launcher is downloading the initial updates and updating game files, steam will increase your ""play-time"". And when you finally find out you can't login due to some issues, you can't refund because you have ""played"" the game for a while.The game itself take some time to get used to but once you do, it's really enjoyable. There is TONS of things to do in-game other than the main quest. You can easily spend thousands of hours in game and still not feel bored.So I highly recommend purchasing the game via game developer. Don't bother buying through steam."
Negative,"Do not purchase this game. It does not correctly load. You will be able to play sporadically. Please read online, the steam client is heavily glitched."
Negative,Incredibly boring leveling experience for an MMO.  And thats saying something haha.
Negative,Very boring grind fest that's too easy. The story seemed interesting but the Game play took away any enjoyment i would have had. I was very hyped for this but now I'm extremely disappointed.
Negative,"Ahh... the game nobody asked for.Nobody wanted an MMORPG Elder Scrolls game.  We wanted to play with our friends, like a couple of them. The MMORPG-ification of this game has removed the single greatest thing about any Elder Scrolls game. Immersion.  No more can you be a stealth archer.  Sure you can try.. but while you're sneaking around, Yoloswaggerton McDickbeetle is going to come blasting by you at 200 MPH, kill everything in the area, loot all the treasure and any possible chance of enjoying the story line or ability to play this game like an Elder Scrolls game is dead. You will find a world packed full of interesting quests and stories... and every time you get into story mode, some 12 year old is going to blast through the area like a wrecking ball, absolutely demolishing any level of focus or captivation you had until eventually you'll find yourself skipping all the cutscenes and racing along side them.  At which point you'll realize that you're not playing the game the way you wanted, you're playing efficiently because this is an MMORPG... and then... you'll start to resent it. You'll resent the players... the game... the lack of arrow physics.This game brings to you all the shitty parts of an MMORPG, and smears them all over the Elder Scrolls universe and it translates horrifically. This is the game that nobody asked for, and while I'm sure some people found it to be a suitable WoW clone,  it is absolute garbage for an Elder Scrolls game."
Negative,"I love the Elder Scrolls series and I always wanted to try out ""the online"" version before I buy it. I got thrilled about the ability to play one of my favorite games with friends. Finally I got my opportunity... and I'm very disapointed.First lets start with the positives:+ It's Elder Scrolls+ Finally you can play with your friends+ Great sound track+ The ""lock pick"" is the best in the whole series+ The ""enchantment"" looks promissing (did not have time and will to do a in depth testing)+ You can travell all arround tamrielNow the negatives:- The quests are boring and not involving (Again I did not spedn 100+ hours playing the game so it might change)- The story did not absorbe me- When you do quests ""in party"" each member needs to do the steps required by the quest individually and that removes the magic of playinng coop- When you start to do a quest you can end up simply walking into a room pressing a button/collecting an item without even drawing your sword. This is due to the fact that someone has just done this quest and killed off all the enemies.- Tons of loot that is worth ""0""- Maximum number of storage slots instead of waight bases dystem- Although this is a MMO I was able to do every mission (Again I did not play for long) by myself- The loading time is just to long (for a 2year game), and no my PC is not slow other, more demanding (according to recommended system specs) run much better- Framreate drops. On average I had 60+ FPS, but some time without an apparent reson the FPS dropped to ~10 (not an issue with the PC I double checked it)- ""Blury"" graphics. When you walked near an NPC the whole figure is blury (lo res texture) and it gets better after 1-2s. Sometimes the hi res texture never loads.- Lo res terrain texture. Some parts of the terain are lo res. For example when you get close to a wall, rock etc. the texture is all blured, and this does not fix itselfe when the texture loads. Sometimes I noticed that a piece of the rock had a hi res texture and a pice had a lo res."
Negative,"The game has been great for many years.  But alas, over the past two or three years the Devs are hell bent on major combat changes every 3 months or so.  Of the last 13 updates (counting Update 35 to be released in a week or so), 11 of the 13 are major combat changes.   So every three months or so you have to revamp your characters with new gear, different skills, changing race and so on if you want to remain viable for all Vet content.  This is tiresome and not needed.  No one asked for these nerfs to the game.  No one likes the constant hard core changes in the game every three months.    Many have ""Patch Fatigue"" including me.  I have over 18,000 hours in the game (I don't play through Steam).  Five accounts and a ton of characters.  I play every class and have played every race over the years.    Now it seems there is no set path for the game by the Devs except  to continue to do major combat changes every patch.  I do NOT recommend this game any more.  It now reminds me of New World.  The Devs are sassy and nasty to us, the customers.  They refuse to listen and go full steam ahead in destroying Elder Scrolls Online.  Stay away from this Dumpster Fire."
Negative,"Bethesda's DEI practices have been seeping into ESO for a while now, somewhat subversively, now they've gone full curtain pull announcing their first non-binary companion, so just like everything else they make in-house its just a vehicle for their agenda, I can only imagine what modern audience horrors TES VI will bring."
Negative,"Best MMO I've played. Played it daily for 3 years because of good combat, game mechanics, tons of pve and pvp content. However, server performance, long lasting bugs and nerf hammers every patch sourced from forum complaints but without actual balance in mind made it unplayable for me. Class and attribute balance is far from what it should be and heading in the wrong direction. Dev team should test before changing skills seemingly arbitrarily and thus rotating between OP classes every release. Don't recommend for competitive play"
Negative,"in its current state this game is broke asf. group finder is bugged, grouping is bugged load time and dcs are horrible."
Negative,"generic, not immersive, underwhelming, and lacks the feel of Skyrim and earlier TES games I tried hard to enjoy it and gave it numerous chances, but this game isn't for me."
Negative,Played 6 hours bored to death. Maybe a personal thing but a review is personal anyway. Maybe shouldn't have expected a skyrim online.
Negative,"not a fan, tried to play several times but did not find it fun. Also like the Sims 4 its a DLC simulator."
Negative,pls do not get this game ZOS has no clue how to make or manage a game the amount of micro transactions is insane the community is very very toxic pvp has no type of balance and the grind requierd to get most things in game that will make your build work are not worth the time bc they will change everything about it in a few months save your money and brain from rotting and do not buy this game
Negative,"The game itself is a lot of fun, much better than most other MMOs because combat is more fluid and action-y, the quests are good and have interesting choices and so far the community seems to be decent. However the steam version sucks and has issues logging in 90% of the time (at l east 2 hours on my record have been just waiting for it to log in) so if you're gonna buy it it's probably better to do it off Steam."
Negative,"I've tried coming back to this game again and again. It's okay-ish but nothing to write home about. The plot of the main quests and DLC content is bland and uninteresting, the combat is far too easy, but it is an Elder Scrolls game and likely the last one we're going to get before the heat-death of the universe."
Negative,"Great mmo. Plenty to do and see although you will be royally pounded by storage space. More likely than not if you see something you like you will have to pay extra for it. $79 for a mmo that almost forces you to buy micro transactions. What a joke. This isn't Tamriel unlimited, it's a portion of it, you will need to drop another $120 or buy eso plus to fully experience this game. If you don't have the crafting bag then you pretty much cant play. Make the crafting bag available for purchase via crowns!"
Negative,"Do not buy this game from Steam.  Go directly to the Zenimax website.It is an *excellent* game.BUTSometimes the Steam launcher no longer recognizes that you have it installed and it will prompt you to reinstall the whole thing.  Sometimes Steam players don't get to play all weekend while everyone else does due to technical issues.To circumvent these issues, I had to buy a second copy from Zenimax themselves, wish I had never bought from Steam.  Buyer be warned."
Negative,"My scoring & reviews explained HERE[desozone.wordpress.com]+grand story, lot of lore+a lot is fully voice acted+large world with plenty of activities+great visuals and music-scaled leveling-dull combat-meh ""fashion"" optionsDidn't play game enough to explore most of it's features. But I can tell you that much. 2 things pushed me away from this game rather harshly.First of all the combat. I got tired of spamming LMB to a point I felt like making macro for attacking. Everything was so spongy, and I felt absolutely no progress of becoming stronger. Yay I got more passives and skills but absolutely nothing changed. Very dull and weightless combat.Secondly.. the whole gimmick of ""level scaling"" that lot of big mmos nowadays for some reason succeed in. I simply cannot comprehend it. I love in MMOs or RPGs in general becoming overpowered.For example, at a weak low level player. Encounter some sort of tough elite enemy or new zone with tough corners. Where normally I die a lot or back off to grind for those areas or win with great difficulty. That feeling of accomplishment is very pleasant. Now let's say, hundreds of hours have passed through content with it's challenges, hard work and most likely grind. you return to that ""memorable, damn this was difficult area/enemy"" and TADAAA.. U simply use 1 AoE spell or whatever just to wipe the whole zone out of frustration. You are now a god. Applaud. That is what I love. I can return to lower level enemies.But with scaling system.. that level 1 slime will be barely weaker after 50000 hours into the game. (yes skills, passives, better gear etc.. will make easier.. but still progression becomes rather irrelevant.)To make lower level zones relevant at higher levels without scaling...there are many methods. Crafting/gather, world bosses, events, unique npc/s currency grinds for fashion or what so ever... and so on.With scaling.. everything just becomes fancy walking sim where everything is a sponge no matter what level and gear. Moral of the story is I do not appreciate whole scaling system at all. It simply takes away from me one big portion of what I like in RPGs... which is that after long playtime and effort and grind I except to become god eventually. (obviously challenge will remain to end-game content, which is usually fun dungeoneering and raids.)Long story short. Screw scaling system. I'm done with this game."
Negative,"Of the 10 hours I've ""played"" this game, about 9 of them were insteall times"
Negative,"U35 in it's current form is actually game ending. Play for purely casual fun at the very best, nothing more. Spend nothing in the store. Not worth if there's nothing worth going for at a progress level."
Negative,Combat is painfully boring.I played through Morrowind main quest and it was alright.Pick it up if it's on sale for 5 bucks.
Negative,"if you have gambling issues avoid. Monetisation is kinda horrendous but not weird for a mmo. Still a lot to be seen and a lot to do, might change my mind later, or not."
Negative,"If you aren't comfortable breaking out the credit card for every other thing you want to experince, it's a good game with a lot of content. But once again, you keep being led into getting excited for features that just end up being behind a pay wall. Simply due to the game design. After paying for a game, you should't have to pay even more for random stuff"
Negative,"Only recommend this game to die-hard TES fans, but even us TES fans have been in debate about this title for years & its identity/validity as an “MMO.” I, & the rest of the TES community, agree that this game is a spin-off of the franchise. This, with the fact that ESO is listed as a spin-off on every TES database, the amount of inconsistencies/retcons the game contains that simply make it not canon, & no official statement from BGS. I would rather play through the entirety of any of the numbered titles besides Arena. This product takes away everything that makes TES great.Played this game for a long time on the launcher. Started out with friends, then they all left & I started playing by myself. During that time I’ve gotten to the end game & did a multitude of content & did high-end raiding. Joined a group to try & stay active with the community & make friends so that I had a reason to stay. However, I did end up leaving & have tried getting back into the game 4 other times with no luck. There are just better MMOs out there with better quality & that respect your time & money.Story:There are the Main Story Quests that only go to level 50, Chapter/Zone Stories, & Alliance Story, each have their own self-contained story. These quests are what make the game world come alive & great for people who only like questing. However, there is barely anything that makes the player care about the characters or what's going on, especially when you get to chapter content because then it gets worse. It lacks strong & memorable characters, & when the player does see some of these characters again in later content it feels like they have become a shadow of their former selves. These stories don’t narratively set up anything for later content & have no payoffs for things that have happened previously. Sure some quests tie into each other in some way, but it doesn’t do it well or in an interesting way. This doesn’t have an engaging story, overarching story, fragmented if you don't follow an order, & doesn’t have continuous character development. If you are looking for an outstanding story that keeps you engaged throughout, this game doesn't have it.The Main story was not interesting & was literally the plot to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, but with several inconsistencies & retcons to the pre-established lore of TES. Combat & Gameplay:Combat is just atrocious & deviates hard from the holy trinity, which makes roles useless & makes group content underwhelming. Instead of auto-attacking like in any other MMO, the game makes you do it yourself to create the illusion of an action MMO. The animation canceling as well as the combat feels very clunky & floaty. Animation canceling requires too much skill from a new player, isn't fun & isn't an intended feature. If someone wants to do any endgame content they need to be able to do it, otherwise most guilds will not consider them.The other problem with combat is the abilities. You can have a total of 10 skill slots, 5 for each weapon you have equipped. After a while combat gets quite repetitive & there are not many buttons to press, while other MMOs have a feeling of variety compared to this. When I am high-end raiding I want to feel like I have my entire toolkit.Endgame:Endgame trials & the trial design is bad in my opinion. Bosses have some decent mechanics but it just isn't very fun, interesting, or have depth due to the poor combat. Trials also don't drop powerful gear which is worth chasing after or any cool cosmetics.Zenimax started putting very overpowered gear into each new expansion/DLC to get people to purchase them, & then they nerfed those items within a few months. It is downright scummy.At one point the devs ""forgot"" that healers are important. There were heal checks in the game which mathematically couldn't be passed without trial gear & you needed to pass that check to get your trial gear. The devs don't play the game at all & act like the end-game community is just trash. Raid Leads are the sole reason why new players can get into trials right now.What is an MMO?Probably the least MMO feeling MMO I've played. The general community is very toxic. Player population isn’t doing so well & has declined, but doesn't look like it because of the Megaserver. Anyways, there is little to no interaction with players. The majority of them are minding their own business & do not react or respond to you. No one seems interested in interacting with a random stranger. You might attempt the same open dungeon with a stranger, but they refuse a party invite. It doesn't feel like an MMORPG. More like a single-player game disguised as an MMO, which happens to have other players in it that feel like NPCs.Difficulty:Next aspect is the difficulty, or rather, the lack thereof. This is a shame, as the world design is incredibly good, & the level designers did a fantastic job. However, the perceived dangers of this world are not reflected in the actual difficulty of the game. It's nearly impossible to die. You can run through all the mobs & kill the ones you need to kill, even in 4 man dungeons by yourself. The lack of challenge may also be the reason why nobody wants to interact with another person. The game scales you to max level at the start & slowly nerfs you while gear scales up. It is the least satisfying leveling experience in any rpg.Only challenging thing in this game is the high-end-raiding. Veteran Hard Mode Trials are the only thing that makes this game difficult, but they are disappointing & don’t have really good rewards. This means there is less incentive to do them & leads to a problem of no sane player wanting to do them.Monetization & Retention:I have noticed that ZOS loses players & shoves more advertisements in your face. Maybe fine for free-to-play games but this is pathetic, neglecting to add legit ways to earn cosmetics that add depth to the roleplay experience as a massively multiplayer online role-playing game.It’s very hard to play without the monthly subscription as inventory space is highly limited which pressures you into buying ESO+. Even after subscribing, too many things are paywalled. The game has 95% of mounts pay walled with no other way to get them & the good ones have to be gambled for. Housing in this game is decent, but it's so ridiculously overpriced as with everything else in it. New dungeons that should be included with new map DLC are sold to you as micro DLCs. Instead of making great content they just add more crap to the cash store. Bottom line, they don't care about gameplay, only the cash shop. Now even skill lines & skill points are sold through the crown store, which is needed in more difficult content. They are grindy & boring to level up. It literally takes 100 hours to grind all the skill lines on one character. Many players have asked for it to be account wide, but in the end the solution is sold through the crown store. So the crown store isn't limited to cosmetics only, there are game play impacting items as well. I would call it pay-for-convenience-to-win. All of this is the ZoS way, create a problem & then sell you the solution.Other criticisms:They shut down any criticism & leave bugs hanging for months if not years & ask you to keep spending money. The changes are also causing more & more people to leave. It adds up to 2+ hour dungeon queue times & with nobody running older trials as there is no incentive to do so for newer or older players.Zenimax’s strategy seems to be to ignore the few long-term customers because they aren't going to leave, & focus on the new players who are dumb enough to spend tons of cash on the game. PvE is oriented to catch new players, hook them up, then take a hot dump down their throat when they reach end-game. For people who like TES universe, not general MMO fans."
Negative,"To me it's an incredible, wonderful game that I just can't bring myself to play more than 30 minutes. This is the game that I own multiple expansions for but just can not play. World-building is top notch, music is incredible, immersion is overall pure joy. But the day to day gameplay is just soul-crushingly bad.Combat is frustratingly repetitive and weightless. Class diversity is non-existant even at base design level. They all play the same: buff up, dot up, spam a button, repeat. Every class uses couple ""unique"" abilities (and by unique I actually mean reskins\recolors of ""deal X amount of direct damage"") and the rest are from trees available to all classes. The community tries to sell a century old bug that the devs could not figure out how to fix as a feature and gate content if you are not willing to abuse it. Combat is already floaty and unimpactful as it is, add the whole animation cancelling they for some reason call ""skillful gameplay"" and its even worse, making your character look like it's having a seizure.Everything is mind-numbingly easy. You are never in danger and everything dies in a second. Die-hards would have you know that ""it gets better after X amount of hours, in the X activity"". Which begs the question - what is the point of the rest of the game outside that sole activity then and why do you have to eat 99% of a turd pie on the off chance there might be a sliver of chocolate stuffing somewhere really deep inside."
Negative,"One of the most abusively monetized top mmos. Gambling is strongly encouraged and nearly all visual rewards are locked behind it. Not only that, but the prices on all items are extreme. Tiny amounts of content are broken up so you have to purchase hundreds of dollars worth of DLC to unlock the full game, or pay for a rather steep monthly sub in addition to buying the base game and whichever latest expansion.The combat is imbalanced and has been for years without a fix. PVP is a joke, open-world PvE is ridiculously easy, the quest writing is generally mediocre at best and laughable at worst, and at least half of the zones are copy and paste generic fields and forests. The mount upgrade and research system are abysmal, and the mounts look absolutely ridiculous when fully upgraded. ESO is one of if not the most lazy major mmo out there. All they want is your coin, and they make no effort to hide that."
Negative,"this is note for SEA players who r goin 2 buy this game, pls note that this lovely game got no SEA server, not even asia tho, our beloved bethesda and zenimax looks like won't release any servers in another country anytime soon, since they had only NA and EU servers lmao. this is so sad, can't enjoy the full immersion of the game just because we're not on the other side of the planet xDwhen will you guys release SEA server? this game would be great if it only had at least SEA server, those 200+ ping is not a joke, man. this is so frustrating, plz"
Negative,This game is pathetic! I have never played a game with such basic and pointless fetchquests since ever! And what makes it worse is that i cant die in this game! There is no challenge! And nothing breaks immersion to a game more than coming to a place where everyone is dead because another player has been there already! This game has all the awful garbage that old MMO:s suffered from which made me hate them! And the limited inventory system is just awful! Why is there so much crap in the game to pick up if im not allowed to pick them up?!? This game feels like a scam!
Negative,"Stay away from Murkmire, it is the most awful voice acting ever."
Negative,gonna replay it and see how i feel about it
Negative,horrible borring gameplay. glorified single player.
Negative,"Love the game but, the greed of Zenimax and their branches have gone too far....they must realize when is time to stop trying to swindle their users, in this case is with their limited stuff on crownstore that is avalable for less for a week and is worth like 40 dollars, therefore trying to make people panic and buy to stuff; a dirty tactic that it might work in the beginning but it will cost you a LOT in the long term"
Negative,"I want to recommend this game but cant. This is because of the lag in pvp. Dont get me wrong I love this game, spent a good amount of time on it (reached cp 357). The thing that just put me off in playing it was the lag. I live in the Philippines and it is in SEA, knowing that my internet here is crappy. On top of that ESO dosent have a dedicated server for this region (with the whole megaserver thing). So thats why I cannot recommend this game to anyone (at least people living in the PH)."
Negative,"Back in the old time when they announce the release of EOS, I am very excited and eager enough to get a copy of it as soon it was release. However, I did't because I knew how f*ckup a game was during it's early release and couple that with numerous complain by the community; I decided to wait until the developer polish the game before I buy it.It's been 2 years after it's release, I completely forgot about this game until it's free trial weekend. I decided to play and see if it was worth to be purchase or not, wondering if the game have been fix and improve to a degree which it would shock and awe me. One at a moment where you would get addicted to the game you just don't want to leave your seat even for a second.Sadly enough, the expectation came crashing down on me. I should have knew it better to leave ESO to Zenimax instead of Bethesda. The gameplay was mediocre and only Elder Scroll on it's name, it lack soo much features and feel unpolish. Even the story and quest within it look pale in comparison to Bethesda work in the past. It make us wonder, why even let Zenimax handle such a awesome masterpiece produce by Bethesda at first place.Several quest I encounter would always give us 2 option that have absolutely no effect on the reward and progression. You pick the choice you want, claim your reward and end of quest, that's all. Really? Zenimax? Are you guys trolling us player out there? Let's not get started on latency issues. During peak period, the game is soo laggy and the loading time could take up to 5-8 minutes (Which I consider to be good since some player said they experience it far longer). If your quest involved killing a boss, do not expect any hype out of it when you are playing during peak period. You can be in a full party and expect a tough fight, only to end up reaching your destination with the boss current health below 10% or dead with your quest shown as complete. Why? Because literally everyone is doing the same quest, not just your party alone. Kinda kill joy when it happen, eh?There is more to said about it, but I already have enough about it. Would I buy this game? Yes!! Would I recommend this game? Yes!! But only if Bethesda take over from Zenimax. As the current situation it was in, I would stay away from it for now; it seems Zenimax is more interest to milk their community cash instead of improving the core mechanic of the game itself."
Negative,"fun for a while until you get decent CP and / or a half decent build, then 80% of the content becomes far too easy and boring.game has a lot of overland content and quests which are mostly boring and tedious, bought necrom today and it's just more of the same, easy boring quests.i enjoy dungeons and pvp but it isn't enough to make me want to keep playing, i can see playing again if the devs make more positive changes to performance, qol and just listening to the community.tldr: game is pretty cheap on sale to try for yourself (even just the base game), fun for a hundred hours or so doing quests until the only challenging pve content is vet dungeons and trials. pvp is fun but performance isn't great.also screw crown crates :("
Negative,"güzel oyun ama sıkıyorayrıca ne kadar kasılırsan kasıl sanki güçlenmen duruyor gibi bir yerden sonrave çok zamanımı yedi, siz de yedirtmeyin benim gibison olarak da solo maceraya atılacaksanız siz de sıkılacaksınızdır bir zaman sonra (neyse ki kitlesi iyi, güzel arkadaşlar edinebilirsiniz)"
Negative,"Returned this about a year ago after waiting twenty minutes for the character creation screen to load. Recent reviews show that technical issues like this are still a serious problem. Don't waste your money on this, even if it goes on sale. There are better Elder Scrolls games and better MMO's."
Negative,"Im quite neutral to ESOIt is a nice MMORPG, but besides of the races from the ES-lore I miss the general ElderScrolls-feeling. ESO often offers free playtimes here on Steam where you can play it as you like, but they should improve theyr data-management, bc you might need to download 100GB to download for the installation via steam and afterwards 2,5GB or more of data via the launcher ...Is it not possible today to give out current data?You have a lot of dungeons and quests available, so it won't get boring soon and although it carries the Bethesda-logo and therefore has some downsides in qualitymanagement (e.g. reporting bugs via videos might get you banned o.O), the game doesn't have a lot of bugs, so I give it a thumbsup.Edit 2022-10:Have to add something:After a long time now playing ESO i lower my rating to not recommended. Reasons are1. Alpha walls. Generally these things are the most lazy and for most gamers most despised solution that can come to devs minds, when they do not (for whatever reason) want players to reach certain areas in a game. Well original ES games and other Bethesda concoctions have them aswell, but this game is FULL of them.2. Hey DEVs, WTF are you thinking in creating events for DLC-Areas ONLY? And only for the newest one? Greed ftw :p"
Negative,"It is a fine casual game, but the devs are greedy to a ridiculous extent. Currently, they are running their annual subscription demo, and they cut a DLC accessible through the subscription to exclude quests that give you companions. This is the most recent example of how aggressively they pump money out of you. Every year they introduce new paid DLCs with new gear, classes and mechanics that give a huge advantage to people buying them. If you do not invest in it every year, you are left behind. Even if you pay for the subscription (it does not cover the most recent DLC, which is outrageous).Play SWOR or Skyrim instead.UPD. The newest cool update, Endless Archive, is free for all, which is a move in the right direction. The overall issue persists tho."
Negative,"ZOS is far and beyond the worst dev studio/team in charge of any large MMO right now.  A refusal to fix month old issues, there STILL being no promised features announced prior to fucking Necrom, and so much more across the game's lifespan.I'd say this game is being driven to its grave, but ESO is already dead. I hold that ESO had some of the best writing in TES. But that has rapidly changed. There has been a clear change in narrative since Blackwood and the writing style I came to enjoy has gone. ESO has started to feel like truly generic fantasy by a group of people who wish they were working on their own LOTRO instead.Can't wait for your Star Wars MMO, ZOS! With how ESO has gone, it'll be an even bigger embarrassment than TORtanic. At least TOR turned itself around. I don't see how ZOS is capable of that.I fucking hate Bosmer so fucking much burn Valenwood to the ground"
Negative,"I was really excited for this game despite the high starting price, continuous monthly payments, and 80GB of space. After a very long install the games graphics were not loading all the way for me - no floors, no character (exept his weapons would show) I contacted ESO for support and they got back to me right away with a generic reponse that didn't solve the problem. By their suggestion I ran a report that gave a diagnostic of my computer, I sent that back to them and they sent me a spam link to buy some product to chack for diver updates. Really dumb. In a nut shell - very frustrated with the lack of support. The game is not working up to expectations and neither are their support staff. Save your money on this one."
Negative,"After so long I finally gave this game a chance.. I must say I was extremely Disappointed and really regret buying it.I'll go straight to the point;1. Inventory Space is nonexistent. (They basically force you to Pay for a Monthly Subscription to fix this issue)2. Crafting feels like ass compared to Skyrim Crafting, You always feel lost and you can't find a place to craft like ever.3. Combat system is Slow, Boring and Mediocre at best. I really tried giving it a shot but it's just bad guys.. sorry.4. Movement and Animation feel Rigid at times which kinda ruins your experience moving across the vast world and experiencing Fantasy-like moments within the game.5. Enemies are dumb, They chase you like puppets and they also can kill you through walls at times.. yes .. walls..6. Archer Build is really sad early on in the game.. you run out of stamina after 3 or 4 skill shots so you basically ruin your own mobility because you can't Roll or Run when out of Stamina;Which means you're this D!ckhead that is out of breath after 3 weak shots and you're about to get your butt-cheeks whooped by this monster who has apparently infinite Stamina.7. You can play this Solo and have some fun but if you try to play this game for the MMO aspect it's not good.. It's also not the worst but it's not all that much is what I'm saying.Summary:If those things above doesn't really bothers you then you will enjoy a Rich Story from Questing and leveling up like I did.But even ONE thing that I mentioned above doesn't sounds good for your liking then you shouldn't waste your money on it and regret it at the end like me."
Negative,"You dont need the subscription to play, but you need it to do endgame so this is pretty much modern scamming"
Negative,running simulator of boredom
Negative,"The game itself is great, but unless you enjoy downloading massive 50-100gb patches, (through the slow as hell bethesda launcher btw) all the time, for content YOU DONT OWN, then don't buy this. It should be free to play considering a solid 70% of the content you download is locked until you buy some overprice packs."
Negative,"The epic feeling of The Elder Scrolls is gone. You know, that uniqueness of being the Dragonborn in Skyrim? Now you're just one more in the server.This is just a generic RPG with the same old quests: Kill 10 of these, bring me 10 of that."
Negative,"Excessively monetized with gambling based loot boxes, a subscription service that sells you the solution to artificial design problems and an overabundance of egregiously overpriced micro-transactions (including housing that costs upwards of $100). All sprinkled with an unhealthy amount of FOMO tactics.Overall a great game if you wish to be treated like a wallet to be milked dry."
Negative,"I bought this game *specifically* to play as Necromancer, but damn that class is horrible."
Negative,"waste of money, installed game twice now and it will not run. won't load after hitting ""play"" in the steam menu"
Negative,"I come back thinking I'll feel different about MMO gameplay but no. It's always the same. Pick this thing up, and give it to someone else. Pick up those other three things (that are literally in the same room) and hand them over because the quest giver can't find good help these days and she's just too busy to do it herself!Then you get booted from the server and must wait 20 minutes to get back in (error 307, per their instructions). I'll take this as a sign and re-uninstall."
Negative,"Do I recommend this game? Yes! From Steam? NO! I just got the game last week and was unable to login for probably total of 24 hours (~12 hour server downtime in a day!) thru Steam launcher. So I ended up buying it from ESO website, paid another $10 and asked for refund however Steam wouldnt refund since i played more than 2 hours... Unbelievable how they dont want to assess the situation and make an exception here because this Steam's fault! Lost my trust in steam honestly."
Negative,"Spent most of my 12.2 hours trying to log solve "" ERROR 334 LOST LOBBY CONNECTION - ERROR CODE - THE ELDER SCROLLS ONLINE "" problem, and I still couldnt find any suitable solution. I saw on youtube that somebody had the same issue like me and the video dated about 1 year ago."
Negative,"Albeit not a bad game in any sense, the pointlessness borne out of everything being scaled - and therefore eliminating any real challenge - becomes painfully apparent the more you play. I'd recommend this only to real Elder Scrolls lore fanatics as the story is the only worthwhile - yet, to anyone foreign to this franchise, utterly meaningless - element of The Elder Scrolls Online. The standalone single player adventures offered by the numbered Elder Scrolls' games offer more rewarding and concise experience."
Negative,"Awesome game, go buy it now! But don't buy it on Steam. Buy from ZOS directly. Last two weekends, PC player who bought the game through Steam has not been able to log in and therefore cannot play. My first experience of such an outage two weekends consecutively. One lasted 10 hours, and the other lasted longer. Beaware of this risk, it does feel fustrated when it happens. The game when I can log in, is great fun."
Negative,Good MMO. Just don't buy it from Steam. There has been 3 major issues with Steam login in the past month. Every case has taken many hours before they were able to fix them. Buy it from Zenimax Online if you want to play this with less issues.
Negative,"Broken ping, impossible to access the endless archive - everything freezes. It is impossible to go to trials due to the constantly jumping ping to 999+. They broke everything!Technical support only writes that they cannot help."
Negative,"Pros:- Some of the story and characters are interesting.- I was having fun in the first 50+ hrs or so while you are learning about the world and combat mechanics etc.- No pay-to-win mechanics as far as I'm aware.Cons:- You can't go 5 meters in the open world without running into enemies to kill. This gets really annoying, especially at high champion levels where these enemies can't even hurt you and don't even give enough exp to waste time killing them. This is vastly different from the other Elder Scrolls games where you can actually explore the world for hours and only initiate combat when you need to.- Again, contrary to the other Elder Scrolls games where the inventory limit is based on item weight, this game has a fixed inventory limit based on the different items you are carrying with max inventory limit of 210 I think. Apparently, a piece of apple occupies the same space in you inventory as a heavy armor which is just stupid. - It is obvious that the devs implemented this bullshit inventory system to force players to buy ESO plus where the unlocked ""Crafting Bag"" allows them to store all the crafting materials and makes the inventory system way more manageable. The Crafting Bag should have been part of the base game as the game is almost unplayable without it. - A lot of the NPCs have Sameface Syndrome. Even Skyrim had more varied and memorable characters with unique faces. I have played this game for 500+ hrs and can only remember a handful of characters as they are also all so boring and most stop being relevant after their 1 quest. - For some reason, a lot of the castles in this game also have the same interior even though the outside looks very different. I guess the devs just recycled them and though gamers wouldn't notice?- Speaking of quests, this game seems to have a lot of them but all the quests can be boiled down to 4-5 SAME formulas and become really boring once you figure out the formula.- You can't loot the armor off of defeated enemies like you could do in all the other Elder Scrolls games. Stripping people naked after killing them was what got me into Elder Scrolls in the first place and I feel that this game has sacrifices an inherent part of what makes Elder Scrolls by removing it.  - The main story itself is pretty convoluted. The war between the 3 factions don't really make sense and feel shoehorned in as the only way the devs can tell a story is through conflict. I am also amazed at how incompetent the NPCs leading the war efforts are as they seem to fuck up EVERYTHING that can be fucked up. Not only that, they need the Main Characters help to fix EVERYTHING. I'd be surprised if these retards can go to the toilet without needing the MC's help with wiping their own ass.   Overall, 4/10. The first 50 hrs or so are fun but then the game drags on and on and you keep playing, waiting to have the same fun you were having before but it never comes. It becomes a chore to log in everyday just to do your daily writs and get the login rewards. Honestly, I'm just sick of this game and doubt I will play it again in the future."
Negative,"This game is great if you subscribe monthly to unlock the craft. Crafting is a HUGE part of the gameplay, so if you don't want to subscribe, this game is way less fun."
Negative,My 3 hour playtime summary of this game''Connection to server timed out. Please try again later.''
Negative,"I've found that eventually this game becomes the very essence of futility and boredom. After playing for a while the only reason to log in is to do the dailies purely for a tiny amount of in game currency. Leveling characters becomes boring and repetitive, the challenge is the same idea as putting your finger in someone else's rectum ie. you could do it but no one really wants to, The physics is sometimes annoying. If you try to jump over, say, a rock, or a bush, it may take several tries. I regularly get stuck walking into a pebble I can't see until i lean forward. Gameplay is just tedious. And combat is - I find the keybinds to be deliberately stress inducing. But really this is just my opinion, some people may enjoy this. It requires some time to really sink in.Edit: After more gameplay: Bugs, missing quest npcs, annoying mechanics, but the character progression system is somewhat addictive. But they really capitalise hard on every scrap of potential profit. Restrictions on how you play the game are everywhere. This company is exactly the sort of company that would enslave people, and then work them to death for a 5% increase in profits. Fortunately slavery is illegal.PS. watch out for fallen branches on the floor, you can get trapped in between the twigs. I once got stuck between a rock and a tree branch....then got pummeled to death by the swarm of enemies i was trying to run away from. Actually that happens every time i play..."
Negative,Installers broken. It downloads the updater and an old version of the game that doesnt work. they dont wanna fix this crap they dont want my money. no thanks.
Negative,Just don't buy it via Steam.
Negative,"After installing this game it would not launch and then gave me an error. I spent over 2 hours researching and trying to resolve the issue. I have played almost 100 other games on my PC through Steam, EA, Xbox App, Ubisoft etc. with no launch issue whatsoever. After a clean install the Launcher fails and then says it needs to repair the game files. (After a clean install????? WTF!??) I try to repair and then it says it doesn't have sufficient permission to create a folder in the C drive. Much time and research later I end up finding an article on Bethesda's website saying that I have to contact Microsoft to figure out how to enable ""Parent folder permissions"" for the launcher to successfully repair the files.What a glorious waste of time. I'm so glad I didn't pay for this."
Negative,"Buy it from the Elder scrolls online website instead. There is an installer glitch if you buy it through steam where you need another 80GB of space to use the game installer even after you have used up 80GB installing on steam. Got a refund and purchased it from the website. In therms of the game though it's pretty fun, some parts are annoyingly solo when me and a friend wanted to do them together. I was expecting a kind of ""Skyrim Co-op"" and was kinda dissapointed to get an MMO instead. That's not to say the game is bad, theres tons of stuff to do loot looks good (although I'm not that far in). Walking can bget a bit tedious. Mounts are naturally expensive and you have to grind a lot if you aren't willing to use the microtransaction store.To summerise YES I DO RECCOMEND THIS GAME, but don't get it from Steam to avoit the bug."
Negative,"Massive amounts of DLC. Even if you buy the base game, and the Morrowind Expansion pack, you still basically have to have a monthly subscription to access most content. This isn't properly explained to users and in fact is cleverly hidden. It's not until you look carefully at the world map that you see how much is locked away behind a paywall as most zones will give a pop up telling you that you need to buy the DLC or have the monthly subscription in order to access that content. This is frustrating considering the game already requires that you put down a lot of money just to play it. On top of that there are loot boxes and a crazy expensive cash shop."
Negative,"When the game works, it's a decent MMO. It is not an exceptional TES game, but I'm not that much of a fanboy anyway.What completely screws everything is stability and availability of the service. During my gameplay I experienced an insane amount of outages and maintenance (the game has around 80% avaliability for me, which is abyssimal). From what I gathered, creators gimped the game on Steam and treat Steam players as second category. There are other games using the same system without any problems.Some game elements were outright broken for months from usability perspective. I'm talking mainly about battleground and dungeons. After finding a party, you sometimes get placed back into queue in a loop for tens of minutes. All users experience this, not only the Steam ones. I've also encountered a lot of lags. The game crashed at least 30 times in my ~200h of gameplay.Suprisingly bugs and glitches were not a problem. I've seen only a few of them, mainly impacting animations.Another major gripe I have is that the in-game store crossed the unfair barrier. There are aspects significantly impacting gameplay (storage, convenience, consumables, and progression speed). I know many people would say in this moment that many more MMOs are worse than that. I know that, but it's not that ESO is good in that aspect, it's just MMO standard that is horrible.On the bright side, lately they seem to concentrate monetization on appearance and vanity.In short if you value your time, money and sanity, I would not recommend ESO. I regret getting into it."
Negative,Game recommends 105GB disk space. Download is 138 GB with a 90GB patch on first launch. Why was that not included in the download on steam. What broken says 105 GB required will fit the 228 GB Download?
Negative,"Good idea, confident execution, poor experience and the typical MMO experience with not much variety with Quests. Looking forward to ES6"
Negative,"Good game, 200 ping in Aus is not good"
Negative,"Game wont let me login and keeps saying ""Connection to Server Timed Out"" though my wifi and internet is completely fine."
Negative,"Would love to review the game, but its never worked properly.  There is a bug that does not link the purchase I made through steam to the game servers so I only get error message.  It counts as game time, so Steam will not refund, and then Bethesda says its a steam issue.  Neither are willing to help so here I sit with a game I purchased that I cannot use."
Negative,"This game could be so great if Zenimax wasn't so fucking greedy. This game has everything it needs to be one of, if not, the greatest MMOs of all time but stupid Zenimax just wants to find more ways to milk their players wallets without offering ANY improvements to gameplay after a decade. This game has been stale since 2018, oh but you can guarantee theres a ton you can spend REAL WORLD money on! 1/10. Im sick of this shit."
Negative,"This game looks like TES 3 Morrowind Remastered, lmao but multiplayer and more stuff some copy of  world of warcraft or somehow, not my favorite, i prefer oblivion or skyrim singleplayer , but not this."
Negative,"Pros:-Played the Morrowind quests with Vivec and the story/quests were enjoyable to play.-Combat is pretty good for an MMO.Cons:-Purchasing previous story content with their premium currency costs hundreds of dollars.(Or apparently pay $15/mo to 'rent' them.)-$15/mo to store materials(People recommend using mules or waiting for rare events where the ""crafting bag"" is free to use.).Smaller Cons:The leveling and skill tree/abilities you unlock were not very satisfying, but I hadn't experienced anything past lower levels due to other glaring problems.Don't feel like paying money for a game to be treated like a F2P player. Wouldn't be as huge of a deal if they sold the crafting bag as a one-time DLC and buying the previous expansions weren't separate from the base game and added up to 200+ dollars(as of ~summer 2020).If money and not encouraging terrible industry behavior aren't a problem for you, the game is fun and worth trying."
Negative,"It's a great game but the company running it are a bunch of morons.Until you can actually download, update and just PLAY the damn game, I will never  recommend this game.  Absolutely RIDICULOUS that a game this old STILL has this many problems just being DOWNLOADED.Just to add, I was a beta tester for this game before it came out and I have always absolutely loved this game.  But the company and the people you have to deal with at customer service are just terrible.  Does anyone remember being able to log into a complete stranger's game because they screwed up account information?  That was Zenimax.  If I download it from the Zenimax site, it updates and everything is fine.  But it won't accept my log in no matter what I try.  I have changed the password and tried contacting CS, but they constantly spout the same nonsense that it is something with VPN.  It makes 0 sense.  So they are telling me I need to buy a VPN (which is another monthly fee all together) just to be able to log into their game correctly?Do not bother playing this through Steam.  It used to work ok but the launcher just hangs up now for no reason although again, they will tell you it is because they are being censored or something and not all of the files are allowed to download so once again, you need a VPN.  I don't use a VPN because I just use the Brave browser that does everything a VPN WOULD do but for absolutely free, including anything having to do with torrents and I'm sick of paying a monthly sub for every damn thing in the world from watching anime to watching horror, free shipping on certain items, better deals at stores, etc. etc. etc.!  I'm SICK of monthly fees just draining our bank account ontop of bills!FIX. 👏 YOUR. 👏 DAMN. 👏  GAME. 👏"
Negative,People are rude trash on this game you join a group through random queue which is fine. DPS queue as a tank so they can get the faster queue then you have to work harder to live because they were a selfish POS who want a fast queue. Then when you try to do the quest inside the same dungeon you have to work harder to live because of said POS they train all the npcs to the last boss so they can finish the dungeon as fast as possible. If you want to be a POS this is the game for you.
Negative,"I'm sorry ZeniMax, but your game violates my ToS."
Negative,"its meh. dont know how to describe, but something about it lacks any soul. if you really want to play this, make sure you play with friends."
Negative,"I tried out The Elder Scrolls Online during the recent free weekend.It's a massively multiplayer online game that takes place in the continent from all the games combined, though many iconic places you might like to visit are locked behind either one-time or subscription payment--this is in a game you're already paying for!Combat feels loose and I don't feel engaged by it at all. It features attack animations that give no real sense of impact leaving PVP feeling slow and endless, with both sides constantly regenerating health with skills. For PVE, The Elder Scrolls Online uses a system similar to Skyrim's for the difficulty: scaling enemy levels. This means that you can travel anywhere in the world without fear of running into really powerful enemies, but it also means that you'll have no trouble anywhere in the game world at all, if you're careful.Elder Scrolls games aren't known for their story, but when you're with friends in a call together, that story becomes completely irrelevant. It's hard to justify sitting around and listening to slow uninspired voice acting for five minutes when you could easily skip it and be told where to go with a waypoint.In fact, the only quest I enjoyed was one where you aren't given any waypoints! It was a treasure hunt that had us looking around for clues while following hints from a note. This quest had us actually collaborate towards a goal, all on the lookout for the next landmark, instead of lazily following a marker from point A to B.Freedom to play how you want is heavily restricted to the typical MMO format. When we discovered that the cheapest horse in a stable cost a whopping 10,000 gold, could we afford that? No. Could we steal a horse and run off with one? Also no.Overall I can't say I enjoyed The Elder Scrolls Online. I put about 8 hours into it during this free weekend and the gameplay never got interesting or engaging. From the combat to the exploring to the dialogue, none of it gripped me.Maybe a fan of MMO games might find something to like in this, but it's decidedly not Elder Scrolls. I'd compare it to an Elder Scrolls-themed attraction at a theme park. Even if it was free, at over 50GB in file size, is it really worth the space? I'm not convinced."
Negative,"Well I played this game a bit (way too much in reality), I've done all raids in hardmod even hardest success (speed/nodeath/hm) and it was quite fun but... this game is a joke and has the shitty devs, they don't even play their game so their changes don't make any sense every patch is ""surprise this set is now super op"" so only one DD class is playable for an entire patch if you want to finish raids, plus this is probably the most bugged mmo on steam... they don't even give reward for all the shit players must go through... this game was bugged for more than a month it was ridiculous! Well if you give it a try don't do it for high level content, but quest and story otherwise you're just loosing time."
Negative,"You are out of bank storage space, please swipe card for more."
Negative,"One word: Unfun.I love the Elder Scrolls, it's one of my favourite gaming series of all time and I truly believe that Bethesda have put their all into this game, but that doesnt stop the game from feeling empty...If you want to play an Elder Scrolls game, play one of the countless editions of Skyrim, Oblivion or Morrowind.If you want to play an MMO, play World of Warcraft, The Old Republic or Guild Wars 2. (Guild Wars is free to download btw).With everything else on the market? This is just a waste of money. Sorry, Bethesda. Still love you."
Negative,"I've put 500 hours into this game (or just about), and honestly? As much as I loved playing it with friends, the game is really meant for competitive players, NOT casual players who enjoy Elder Scrolls lore. I've been into Elder Scrolls for a very long time, and as much as I've enjoyed some of the quests unrelated to the mass boss-fights or dungeons, most of it is done in annoying fetch quests, or ""go to this location and kill everybody!"" The game gets incredibly stale after a while, especially if you're not into doing trials or dungeons, or don't have many people to play with. I mainly used to play this game to role-play my characters (shout-out to my several awful Altmer), but honestly? Would not recommend to anyone who doesn't enjoy tons and tons of unnecessary grinding and lots of micro-transaction hell."
Negative,Don't get me wrong it's a great game but the combat just doesn't feel right. The monthly bag system is pretty dirty too....i get that folks need to make money but it's borderline P2W. Lastly steam auto charges for sub and no refunds. GG
Negative,"I love the game and the new content with the purchasable DLCs. Unfortunately there are frequently login issues. Especially loggin in from Steam seams to be problematic and for steam users such as myself, there is no workaround.The ESO server status page is always green, even when there are major problems with loggin in and playing.I can recommend this game for anyone who likes the Elder Scroll worlds, but please get it from the official ESO store, unless you want to deal with login issues."
Negative,"GAME is good, but the Servers are bad. Today I just got 999 ping wherever I go, checked my net speed, and it's fine, check my other online games ping is fine for them. So I don't know what's going on. The game is like 10 years old but can't fix there servers."
Negative,"I paid for the game but the play as my favorite race, imperial, I have to pay again?"
Negative,"It's NOT a great game - to put it simply.  Great story, but it pretty much fails everywhere else. UI is clunky, combat is meh, is just feels very unpolished."
Negative,"Game is great, except I'm from Philippines. Needs to have atleast 1 Asia Server or your ping will be forever at a minimum of 200-250 ms."
Negative,A 35 Min waiting Queue to play a paid game. hard no
Negative,"currently can't recommend. Incompetent people working for zos managing to fix one issue and breaking 5 more (including the original problem). ""balancing"" the game in every way possible except the right one.Until Rich finally gets his useless ass kicked from the team, don't waste your money on this."
Negative,This is the worst server I have ever seen. . . I regret buying it. ..............................I'm an idiot......................Your game design roles and novice teaching. . . . It took us more than 2 hours to complete the front. . It was not until the large areas where the contact was changed that the internet speed was severely stalled and delayed. . What is it now? ? Is it game fraud? ? ? Cheating those of us who can't get a refund after playing for 2 hours? ? You guys have disappointed me too much. I will make your game notorious
Negative,"Do we even make games for the passion anymore?Gamers didn't make this game. Clearly agents of The East Empire Company developed this game.Greedy N'wahs. Save yourself the dissapointment and play Morrowind, when game development was about pushing boundaries and not the limit of the consumers stupidity to throw money at a name. I regret buying this game."
Negative,"Bethesda has seriously messed up across the board. It’s been awhile since they have produced something meaningful, and their stance on issues pertaining to their staff and contractors shows that they would rather commit to doubling down on corporate bullies than recognize/respect the immoral approach to situations like the Doom composer Mick Gordon. The abuse and harassment this company is willing to subjugate to an accomplished, respected artist shows that they are a company removed from developers’ best interests. It is a shame to see that Bethesda chooses to handle things they way they did."
Negative,"The inventory system alone killed this game for me. I paid $20 for this game, why the hell am I being treated like some free to play scum that doesn't deserve inventory space. They have the gull to ask me for 15 additional dollars per month, just so I don't have to sit and scrap 90% of the items I pick up. I'm aware I can upgrade it, but that doesn't fix the problem.I can live with paid DLC, all the interesting character cosmetics being locked behind a paywall, pretty much any desirable mount being locked behind a paywall, but the inventory system is so intrusively bad and limited that I basically feel forced to pay keep my items. I will never do that."
Negative,"Between the bugs and crashes this game is little more than a rip-off.Edit (07/01/2023): Example of how they'll rip you off; the game just had a two month PVP session, but only issued one month's worth of rewards."
Negative,"Come on @Bethesda, what the fuck price is in Turkey? Are you serious or you don't know nothing about world and countries..."
Negative,"It's alright as an MMO, but if you're looking for the next elder scrolls game after Skyrim, you're better off pretending this doesn't exist."
Negative,"Every week it becomes impossible to log in thru steam. I reccomend this game BUT NOT THROUGH STEAM. Buy it from Zenimax on the official website, you'll have zero problems logging in."
Negative,This game sucks
Negative,"After raising Crown Pack prices +453% above the Valve Suggested Price, I'll just give a huge FUCK YOU to this game.What's next, give a raise to subscription fee? Yea do that and let me get done with this game forever.Edit:AND YOU'VE ACTUALLY RAISED SUBSCRIPTION FEE TO x3?FUCK YOU THRICE!"
Negative,"I purchased morrowind at $35 with my first salary because unlike WoW, I thought this was not subscribe and play. But in a way it is. you can play this game anytime but all game content is not unlocked. you have to unlock it with crowns which are quite expensive or you have to purchase a plus subscription which kind of makes it subscribe and play. Now today morrowind is available for like $10. Even if you purchase the main DLC you will not get the side story lines which are quite interesting. You have to pay for them or purchase that plus membership thing or whatever it is. dont get me wrong, this game is stunning with graphics and combat and all but it is for kids with rich parents or people with fancily paid jobs. I am sorry but I ain't rich and this is a wallet drainer.. Ima try Conan and see what that's all about.."
Negative,"The story is OK but nothing amazing; after some days and weeks you'll probably just click through any dialogue. The quests are repetitive and require too much running around.      After buying the game you can play the ""free"" version which is heavily limited in terms of inventory management, etc. You basically are forced to pay an additional monthly fee so that you can gather crafting materials, etc.      Dungeons (for groups of 4 players) are not at all rewarding enough so most players avoid them and the wait to form a group thus take a long time.     The graphics are fine, but not great.      The community is OK but shrinking (the game lost around 60% of players on Steam in the past  months according to steamcharts).      The balancing and game changes are terrible. The balancing team makes absolutely awful changes to buff and nerf classes, changing skills completely (e.g. to require stamina instead of magicka), and don't sufficiently explain why the changes are needed.       In general the developers don't communicate nearly enough; they always say sorry, they will start communicating more, but actually they never do. All in all, I would say try ESO out in a free weekend but keep your expectations low. You can get some fun out of it but it's not worth it in the long run."
Negative,"I love the world, almost everything is excellent but..I like exploration and reading the books and lore. Unfortunately thats quite hard to do when the server disconnects about on average every 30 minutes or so. You realise there is a problem when interacting with the word stops. Like you try interacting with an npc and nothing happens. Then about 30 seconds later the login screen reappears, totally destroying any immersion in the fantastic story.So sad to say, I cant recommend this game. Its really unplayable for me, particularly  when they offer a free play week ( or whatever) and presumably the server gets even more overloaded than it is already.I'm in England using the europe server, maybe you guys in USA get a better deal.If they could sort out the server issues it would be my favour!ite game"
Negative,"Game seems a little broken, my account details got reset at the login screen and when i try accessing it now i can not even login the the game/launcher.. what a ripoff scam and their customer service is also shit expectating me to be able to provide information which can not be seen anywhere."
Negative,"Bethesda customer service is awful #101I got this on PS5 recently. I received a free mount with my Amazon Gaming membership so decided what the heck, I'll try ESO again, even though they were so pathetically cheap they couldn't even give us Oceania servers, (I am Jack's complete lack of irony.)My ex girlfriend played years ago during a free weekend on PS4. All my linked accounts use my email, except the old PS4 one. I sent Bethesda an email explaining that it was my ex-girlfriends email on my ESO & PSN account, I'd just got a PS5 and wanted to recover my ESO account on my PSN account so I could just link my email and get my free horse. After chatting to the ex whilst waiting a week for a reply, she told me that she wasn't getting the recovery email anyway. I then received a reply that they were sorry I wanted to delete my account, even though that's not what I'd emailed them about, I just wanted to unlink my email to fit the same email on all other accounts. I told them to actually send me a proper reply because the reply didn't even fit the email I originally sent. I got bounced around between agents for another week and a half, was sent an apology and then they asked what I really wanted, even though they had chat logs of it. Eventually I realised that the provided email my ex girlfriend used had a minor typo, meaning my ESO account on PS4 wasn't connected to a real email at all, let alone to my exes. I sent them a follow up email letting them know they could just unlink the broken PS4 email so I could relink it with my real email, like I originally asked and like I'd sent screenshots of my email, accounts and proved it was all linked to my email. By this time I'd played for 2 weeks and made some fair progress on a character. I was then passed to another agent who emailed me letting me know he had successfully deleted all my characters, YAY. But hey, atleast I could link my account and get my free horse. Too bad I'll probably never play the game again."
Negative,"It is a much better game than when it came out years ago and has tons of content. Action combat is really fun and being able to roam every land of Tamriel is amazing for a TES fan. However i cannot recommend the way this game is monetized: pay for every additional campaign/adventure OR subscribe to a monthly pass to have access to it (beware though, the latest expansion will always have to be purchased on top of this). It may seems an optional thing to do but then there's additional QoL services that are just too convenient not to have, thus misleading the player into thinking this could be a buy-to-play product: it is not. Either subscribe to the monthly pass or be doomed to have very limited inventory spaces and drop tons of money to get all DLCs. I wish there was a ""ultimate"" bundle that covers this all, even being around 80-100 euros i would buy it and then enjoy everything this game has to offer. I despise games that puts everything behind paywalls.Until something won't be done, i'll gladly stay away from this."
Negative,"Terrible ToS & Privacy Policies. They seem to certainly be going after every method on monetization. Good from their corporate perspective, not good for players if we don't get much choice. Crafting effectively isn't possible without paying the monthly subscription.Almost works on GNU/Linux but it won't launch without Steam and Steam won't let me launch it because ""it doesn't run on my OS"". Well, the launcher works fine! I was able to install that through a roundabout way.If this game ran on GNU/Linux / Steam OS ""officially"" and all the privacy invasive stuff were /opt-in/ then the game itself seems fine."
Negative,"First off I have to say that I do actually like ESO for the most part. Good varriety of zones and things to do in the game.My problem and the reason I do not recommend this game is the fighting mechanics of the game are basically broken and the dev's refuse to change it. You can play this game and do okay for the most part, but to do true DPS in this game you have to do animation canceling. What this means is you have to constantly swap weapons out to stop the amimation that your character is going through to cast it's spells and do its abilities. This is the only way to maximize your DPS. You will never do high DPS without taking advantage of this. Why have animations if they make the character do less damage? Why make people use scripts and such to maximize DPS. This seems like a broken system to me and I will take my entertainment dollars elsewhere."
Negative,"I am not pleased with this.I played the beta, and was disappointed with the sheer volume of bugs. My favorite example being the travesty that was the party system. If you have ever wanted to know what it would be like to be stuck in your own timestream courtesy of the Butterfly effect, then party up with someone and get ready to: follow your own versions of the same dog, rescue the same people from spider cocoons, while skant inches away from your party member who just cut the hapless spider dinner free, kill a boss and one party member who was LITERALLY one step further away not get any credit for it, who then cannot finish the quest with you because you can no longer do that quest... The list goes on and was embarrassing.Here we are two years later, and at the recommendation of a coworker, I start to look at this again. Thinking that they MUST have fixed something, added it to my wishlist to keep an eye on it and then it goes on sale. 10 Bucks? Sure, why not. So I buy it... For me, for my brother, and for two friends of mine. It is only 10 dollars and supposedly much, much better than it was. 19 hour download later, I'm playing... Funny enough, it seems that nothing has been fixed. Oh and as icing on the cake, neither my friend nor my brother can play at all. They are stuck in whichever Daedric Prince's domain it is that Governs infinite load screens. I'm thinking Azura's Star or Sheogorath's realm; you know, because they are stuck unable to go anywhere but forced to pantomine the same actions over and over again? Restart, repair, restart, repair, reboot, restartrepairrestartrepairrebootrestartrepairrebootrestartrepairrestartrepairAll work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."
Negative,"always error connection, they dont have Asia server"
Negative,Elder scrolls Offline.... at least thats what you get if you play through steam...
Negative,"ESO is *almost* a good game. Any game can be fun with a good group of friends and an awesome guild. But the core gameplay of ESO has been stagnant for years with their cookie cutter approach to DLC. I'm sure they have metrics behind the scenes justifying their decisions, but for too many years they've followed the ""1 Large Expansion, Dungeon DLC, 1 Small Expansion, Dungeon DLC, Repeat"" formula. They've ignored PvP, never released more weapon classes, refused to implement an auction house and rely on community made tools to make it usable, sell ""assistants"" for $40+ each, lock so many artificial ""bonuses"" behind ESO+ that the subscription is practically mandatory to play the whole game (crafting, housing, outfit dyes, special inventory limits), never implemented any real community building support (actual guild halls, in-game guild event tools). The upcoming 2-player endless dungeons is a step in the right direction, but in nine years they've only released two 4-player arena's and two solo arena's. Two of those came out within the first two years of the game.Do I expect this review to change anything? No.Am I still going to be playing ESO? Probably.But I've worked towards weaning myself off needing ESO+, staying away from their predatory loot boxes, and enjoying the game in a single-player manner. Until ESO looks in the mirror and makes some serious quality of life improvements, I can only recommend new players to stay away."
Negative,"Actually, this is a great game. BUT, you'll have great problems with playing it. They have the worst maintenance service in all industry. Someone clever in Zenimax thinks that making maintenance on Saturday during 4 hours that is a great idea - who cares. After almost every maintenance patch steam players from Europe cannot login and they have to wait a day, maybe two before they fix it (and this problem continue to happen not the first year!!) - oh, that is not a big deal. Their proud - MEGASERVER - is one big epic fail - lengthy loading, freezing even on very powerfull PC. They didn't even bothered themselves to create a minimap, decent inventory interface (and this is MMORPG) and so on, so you just have to use a lot of different addons (special thanks to the community). I'm to lazy to write about all other disappointments (you can read about them in other reviews), but that is just the top of my list. I don't know maybe Zenimax thinks that all that is not big problem's at all and everything is fine, cause they obviously have time and resources and regularly adds new DLC's and new useless cosmetic stuff (of course not for free). Until ZOS will change their attitude to their project and especially to the people that bought that game and help them to feed their families, i highly don't recommend this game. P.S. Buying the game through the official website will just solve one problem with logging after maintenance and leave all the rest."
Negative,"bad f2p experience locks you out of a large section of the game, even subscribed you are microtransactioned to death. Wait for a good MMO or play WOW f2p or runescape, much better experience"
Negative,"If you like games that get more updates to the micro transaction store than actual content or performance, maybe you like card games, or maybe you just like pvp content that lags constantly, its possible you like games that are in maintenance mode and on the back burner. only thing i regret is wasting time thinking the Dev's would attempt to fix the disaster they have created."
Negative,"Unfortunately have to give this one a red flag. It's just a milk-farm now. 10 years on and basic QoL still missing. Cashstore prices still on the extreme high-end, with minimal discount values that are recycled.Apart from the questionable balancing updates (kinda forces you to play optimal builds for group content), the performance issues.. abysmal. Gets frustrating even for casual PvE experiences nowadays. Believe it is unplayable for anyone outside the US region. Latency constantly averaging at 600+ms for me recently, that is with all the port-forwarding and troubleshooting checked out. Extreme rubber-banding issues in group-queue content. (Found out that other players utilizing Exitlag also facing same issues).Support barely exists as they repeatedly shove the same troubleshooting advice down your throat. (Had some other tech issues in the past but had to figure out solution on my own).Chucking this one into the archives until the day of miracle, when they manage to iron out the major issues."
Negative,"Maybe this game was once amazing, but now it's abysmal. You begin with 16,000 in Health, Stamina, and Magicka. Starting spells cost 4,000 -- what's the point of such high numbers? You can't wrap your mind around such high numbers. Even WoW recognized the need to reduce numbers to reasonable amounts. Further, you gain 1 attribute point per level to put into 1 of the 3 stats: HP, MP, Stamina .. but you only increase the stat by 111 .. that's an increase of barely 0.6% - nearly 1/2 of a percent .. WTF? So, even if the level cap is 100, you'll only increase 1 of your 3 stats by 60%. Utterly pathetic. That's the lowest increase in strength I've ever seen. That means you'll *never* cast more than 6-8 spells per battle before you're out of mana - *maaaaybe* 10 if gear will grant more Magicka, reduced spell cost, or whatnot. After that, you're limited to spell staff damage, which is actually pretty reasonable.Lastly, the limited skill/spell access compared to how many skills/spells you obtain is just absurd. They're doing it like Diablo 3 - lots of options, limited selection. Lame.I don't recommend this game in any way whatsoever. Let's all hope the actual Skyrim team is allow to produce quality game mechanics for Fallout 76."
Negative,"Let me start by saying that I do not hate the game, I don't love it, but I don't hate it.Right now, there are 6 primary reasons why I gave this game a negative review.1:  Level Scaling:I just hate the level scaling system with an absolute passion.  You feel no different at level 1, than you do at level 50.  The only difference is that you have more skill lines unlocked. It gets rediculous though, when your fighting the same mud crab at level 50, as you were at level 1.  Common f'king gamblers can DPS you down in seconds if enough of them gank you, and it just creates a meh feeling where you don't feel any real benefit from the leveling process.  I have actually created several toons, who I don't even bother leveling.  They are all still under 10th level.  I only use them for alchemy crafting and loot farming, that's all I use them for.2:  The bounty system:Don't even get me started.  You can accidentally steal something, and get a bounty that takes an hour to decrease.  Otherwise, if you kill gamblers, like many of us do, because it's easy gold, you might end up with a half a million bounty in 2 nights worth of murdering.  Get used to the idea that your toon will probably have a bounty for the rest of their useful life.  If like me, you have a half million bounty, it will take literally months of game time for the bounty to  drop off over time, and you have no chance of making the money you need to pay it off.  On top of that, all guards are invincible.  It's a little bit easier to live with bounties now though, due to player housing and the thieves guild.  The only real reason you need to go into towns now, is to use the guild vendors, and obviously for questing, which can be problematic.3:  The Micro Transaction Store, Crown Prices and Housing:Whoever comes up with these prices needs sacking.  9000 crowns for high end housing (about £75),  5000 crowns for 1 mundas stone (about £20), 4000 for one crafting bench, 140 crowns for a bed...  The prices are completely insane, and completely out of touch with what a majority of the community can afford to spend.  What ZOS are saying is that a single Mundas stone, is worth as much as an entire DLC pack.  Summerset is due to be released on the 21st of May, and that cost £20 for the basic edition.  The real money store prices need a drastic re-think, because all Zenimax have done, is price themselves out of their own market on top of making it all look like a money grab.  A lot of players won't pay those prices, which is a pitty, because if the prices were cheaper, it would be really nice to have crafting benches and Mundas Stones in player housing, but at £20 each, it isn't going to happen.  The problem is that the micro transaction store has become so over bearing in game, that it now no longer matters if the base game is complete and utter trash, as long as the MTS works.  The coding can be completely and utterly broken, as long as your able to buy stuff in game.  That's all that ZOS care about now.  As long as your spending money in game, nothing else matters.4:  All classes feel the same.Every class ends up feeling exactly the same, no matter what you do.  If you take some skill lines like two-handed, two weapon fighting and ledgerdemian etc, every class ends up feeling the same.  This is made worse by the fact that your classes typically end up crafting and equipping the same crafted armour, as well as putting points in the exact same places in the champion system.  The result being that you can have 8 characters, that all act and feel identicle to one another.  ZOS would have been better off sticking to the traditional ES leveling process, where we only have 1 character, but can learn multiple skill lines and abilities.5:  Class system and active skills.This is the only game in the series that uses a class system, and with that system, specific class skills.  To a degree, that system is what is harming the game.  No other ES game has a class system.  You only need 1 toon, and each toon can use any skill.  The other problem is that the class system has restricted the skills that you have access too.  There are no schools like Destruction in this game, or illusion etc.  Therefore, it is impossible to cast certain spells like chameleon, invisibility and mass berserk, because they don't exist.  In previous ES games, those spells made encounters with invincible guards fun, because you could just cast invisibility or berserk.  You can't do anything like that in this game, which is why encounters with invincible guards are boring, frustrating and anti-fun, because there is absolutely nothing you can do against them.6:  Forced group content.Most of the activities in ESO are now focused on group content.  This is largely due to the One Tamriel update, which introduced a scaling system.  Before that, you could effortlessly solo world bosses.  Now, you need a group to play a good proprtion of the content, and you need to be a member of a guild to make any money from a trade guild, since trading is solely a guild activity.  This reliance on a thriving community, and focus on group activity, might sound fine in the heads of ZOS, but the implications are obvious.  Trade guilds only survive for as long as they have active players.  Group content is only good, when you have a healthy population.  When the begins to community die, which it will at some point, the diminishing player count will ruin this game.  Without groups, without a large communtity playing it, most of this games content, including it's economy will crash.  There needs to be an equal amount of focus placed on single player activities, and a single, central auction house for solo players.  Otherwise, we will be stuck with a game, where we can't play a majority of the content, with an economy is none existant.Conclusion:Sorry, this is nothing more than just another MMO.  Its an ES game in name only.  In many respects this game can even be called anti-fun, especially for solo players, which ES games have always, traditionally been.  As for ZOS, I don't believe that ZOS can be trusted.  Many bugs have gone unresolved, while constant improvements and additions have been made to the Micro Transaction Store.  Obviously ZOS care more about sales, than they do the state of the game.  ZOS themselves also lie, claiming that there are 10 million players in game.  In 2016, it was announced that there were 2.5 Million only, and that was 2 years ago."
Negative,game wont start even after allowing it through firewall uninstalling 2 fucking times such a pile of shit launcher
Negative,"They did 1 patch and my game won't load, my computer meets/exceeds expectations of the game, I repaired 3x and it still won't work, not sure I would recommend this."
Negative,"Buggy, laggy, bad optimization, constant server problems, regular crashes. 0/10"
Negative,This game's lovely--if you don't buy it on Steam.Steam users have frequent login issues that take forever to resolve.7/4/2018 EDIT: The issue has recurred twice since this review was originally put up.
Negative,"Idk... Kinda bland. It's almost like someone took many different kinds of game mechanics, slapped  them together, and put a big ESO sign on the aftermath. Like:The ui was made in Japan~Russia created the leveling system~Iraq did the combat~Australia wrote the story~And the graphics were made in the USA~Then they all caught a flight and met in Texas, packed everything in a rar file and shipped it to Zenimax who injected it with Microtransactions.DLL."
Negative,"Bethesda and Zenimax are effectively conman scum these days.I wouldn't piss on them if they were on fire.This is not the company that made great games - those people are long retired or moved on to other things. The people running this atrocity now are the worst kind of money-hungry corporate stooges with no concept of what makes a videogame fun - only an endless stream of monetization schemes and scams, on top of conning and screwing over their own contract workers and employees.They are on the level of EA - possibly even worse, since I think EA at least pays their contractees."
Negative,"Can't log in on steam. Will be giving this game a negative review for now. It's a bloody disgrace, especially when you realize that players that are logged in are being punished by not being able to claim their daily rewards etc. More like The Elder Scrolls Offline.However, the game itself is fun."
Negative,skyrim was better
Negative,combat is so boring after 2 hour play dont try this in 2020
Negative,I think it's nice some of you have played the game. I wasted my money to watch it refuse to load or finish downloading. Thanks
Negative,Downloaded 79gb just to find out that the game isn't updated so I have to download another 12Gb at 350kbps... is that a trick so if don't like the game can't refund it? Because the update is from the launcher and count as game time...EDIT: Finally it downloaded another 12GB now I need to update the game again for 48 f***ck GBS!! NICE!
Negative,"Played probably around 8k+ hours on the non-steam client.Used to be a good game, only going downhill since about 2 years, cant bring myself to play this game anymore, its really damn bad these days.Devs making the game more braindead every patch by lowering the skill ceiling, content gets worse and worse in proportion with the  server performance, this game will be a fucking empty wasteland after TES6 releases when all the roleplayers leave the game for the new TES title.If youre looking for skillful combat, decent performance, a corporate staff that isnt just out for money / genuinely cares about the game and competent devs, youre definitly wrong here :)"
Negative,"What I like about this game is that you can pretty much everything you want in this game, buy a house, play with other people, kill other people, do end game content, solo content. What I dont like about this game is the developers inability to listen to their players. If you go to this games forum, is mostly filled with complaints and request to fix certain aspects of the game. For example, Cyrodill(PVP), the game nowadays is laggy and full of loading screens that sometimes last more than 10 minutes or forever. Instead of balancing certain skills or certain sets, the developers reasoning is to completely nerf the set or the skill to the point that it becomes useless. Ive seen many people leave this game every time a new DLC comes out. The major problem with this game is that developers do whatever they want regardless if it will make people leave. Not only that, the only thing that is making money for them is the CROWN CRATES which are stupid. Your chances of getting a rare mount are ridiculous. People have spent thousand of real money in order to get this mount and still dont have it. This crates does not improve your game at all, mostly asthetics so its pretty much worthless. Get your sh*t together Zenimax Online because your game is leaving much to be desired."
Negative,"I've played it a few times throughout the years—around launch, maybe three years ago, and again now for the free period (or I tried, anyway).I really love TES and can spend hours and hours just reading about it even. But there's something about this game that is just....crappy. It doesn't flow properly, and on top of that it often has weird bugs. The dungeons are almost fun, but not really. The only redeeming feature of this game is the lore... but you can read all of it online anyway.I'd critique the game in more detail however... I couldn't even get it running this time to refresh my memory.Apparently there is a launcher bug that's been going on for nearly 7 months which has left me unable to play it this time. I couldn't install the game via Steam or the ESO website because of the ""download stalled""/crashing launcher bug. (For reference, I don't have either ISP they are claiming is causing this issue.) Seeing as this has been ongoing for so long, they clearly do not care about this game in the least. Requiring a VPN to install a title from your own country is unacceptable."
Negative,"A beautiful game mired by overly aggressive monetization despite being Pay-2-Play. People are very quickly separated between haves and have-nots. Thus I cannot in good conscience recommend this game, in spite of how fun it /can/ be."
Negative,"EDIT 4th of February 2021:When I first wrote this review, my playtime was ~12 hours. And people might say (as some did) that's insufficient for a fair assessment of ESO's entertainment potential.To be frank, that's not why I returned to the game!During Corona lockdown, three of my closer friends decided to try ESO, as a means of social contact and entertainment. I gave alternative options, but was outvoted, so here I am again.Other than having more playtime, I got to experience the following features:- Playing in a group- Following quest-lines to the end- Solving more ""puzzles""- Fighting more foes- The disappointment of actually having bought the game (Played it on a free weekend before)Yes, playing in a group is more fun, because that rule applies to (almost) everything.But...My previous review doesn't change much. I rewrote/deleted a few lines here and there, but the verdict is the same.My friends were not convinced either. One of them shares my opinion entirely. The other two are a little more lenient, but were also rather disappointed than satisfied with the experience.Here's how I'd describe playing any MMORPG:It's like playing pirates in a huge kindergarten, with dozens of kids, aged between 5-10. Any of them running around, partially absorbed by their own fantasy of what they believe is currently happening. They're interrupting other kids by shouting at them, to let their opinion be known, to express that they've spotted a new point of interest, to make a joke, to bully someone, to let everyone know they have an idea, to throw a tantrum.It's loud. It's chaotic. Any good idea and all notions of a story are being destroyed by there being too many kids, ruining the execution. Re-purposed teddy-bears and furniture have the same narrative depth and immersing effect as the common AI-NPC. You know that one kid, that isn't running and shouting with the others, but just standing in the corner, watching? That's probably me.MMORPGs are a horribly designed activity that, to my impression, can only be enjoyed by those who can focus their attention to the point of shutting out what other players and the game engine are doing around them.I don't mean that as an insult. It's just a quality I don't have.- EDIT end----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just a fair warning for anyone who's mildly compelled by the game world and the graphics as shown in many videos...If you expect anything other than a run of the mill MMORPG, you will be disappointed.As far as MMORPGs go, I'm sure this is about as good as any of them out there...so if you like those, why not try ESO? I'd just add that you may want to wait for a test-for-free-weekend, like I did. Not sure how frequent those are, though.Below is a list of features that I consider huge flaws in games, but no one playing MMORPGs usually cares about.- All non-scripted enemies walk randomly back and forth or sleep on their spawn-point. They won't do anything else until they spot and then attack you. All enemies are also almost blind and won't spot you before you're about 10m (33 feet) away from them. That spoils immersion.Imagine standing on a road surrounded by about a dozen enemies. All of them randomly walking back and forth in a small radius. None of them taking any notice, despite their task being to ambush you.- All enemies are always level scaled.Which means combat is not challenging at all, unless you aggro too many foes at once, or you fight a ""boss""-enemy.No matter where you go, regardless which tomb you enter, every single enemy will be easy to kill, except for ""boss""-types.- All loot is also always level scaled. No matter where you go, regardless how deep into enemy territory you venture, loot will always be bound to your level.So even if you're in the most highly guarded castle of the most highly feared creatures of this entire world, every single (non-boss) enemy will be easy for you to kill (even at lvl 1) and the treasure you find in the golden chest of the king will eventually be a pair of torn-up, dirty pants (or something of equivalent value for lvl 1).- The world design is a little too small and linear, for an open-world game.Many regions are designed like linear FPS maps. There are branching paths, but considering the landscape is meant to represent continents, the ""open-world"" experience is very underwhelming, compared to other (even older) games.- None of the areas in the world actually feel alive or realistic to any degree.All you get to meet are mentally damaged enemies, randomly walking back and forth in a small radius and NPCs whose AI and dialog rather made them feel like robots to me. Other players will only rarely, if at all, help in making the world feel alive. If you ever played any MMO with the occasional random player showing up in your location, to quickly finish their quest toggle their objective status as done and then leave, you know what I mean. It's especially grating when their task is exactly the same as yours and there's a constant stream of them, while you're trying to get immersed in a quest that, by description, made it sound like you're performing something unique.- Exploration is not rewarding, unless you enjoy the view. (I don't)As a consequence of all the things I listed above, the world bores me to a shameful degree. There is absolutely nothing worth exploring/finding. Loot is the same no matter where you go. Creatures always pose the exact same threat and have the same AI routines, no matter where you go.If you enjoy the vista, then there's at least that.- The mission design is done without any care or cleverness, to the point of laughable.I mean, it's an MMORPG standard. No matter how good the story idea might be, the genre-specific game mechanics are pretty sure to make the execution look clumsy and dumb.One example: During a fight, boss-enemies despawn if you leave their designated zone. They just reappear in their previous spot, continuing to do whatever it was they did before you fought them. They won't be alarmed or even aware of your presence. That applies to any situation, regardless of the scenario.- The more elaborate quests almost always feature NPCs performing dumb actions and dialog.Part of the reason is that even the most mentally challenged players are supposed to be able to solve any and all of the quests. The NPCs will usually point out how to solve any of the ""puzzles"".- Failure and death have absolutely no consequences, except for the time loss.If you die, you'll immediately respawn at a mere few feet distance. Enemies return to their previous unalerted status. That's it.Failure just means you try again.All MMORPGs basically have these flaws in common. What saves them are the customization and collecting features in a multiplayer environment. Even for those people who mostly play alone, the ability to publicly display their prestige items is meaningful. It's a binding social activity with a multitude of options to individualize the experience.If that is all you need to enjoy a game, I can't see how you'd go wrong here. I'll pass."
Negative,"I play this game every two to three years because I forget why I don't like it so I'm writing it down: Elder Scrolls combat sucks in the main games, the only fun thing about Elder Scrolls is fucking with the NPCs and its all fake and MMO-y here"
Negative,MTX and FOMO hell
Negative,wow is better
Negative,There is an ongoing issue with the steam launcher being unable to log in. If you want to play this game get it from the elder scrolls website. Do this and you will be playing while steam players are raging on the forums about being locked out of the game.I do recommend this game. Just save yourself some rage and get the non steam version.
Negative,"My review for ESO was once positive. I felt like Summerset was underwhelming and that the development team was getting too comfortable with the content they were making. Then they promised Elsweyr was an expansion that would take place over the course of the year, and hell yeah, cat-land! Finally! They even said the story would come to a conclusion in the last, 4th quarter content drop of the year. CoolFast forward to Elsweyr release, it's just more similar content - like Summerset - but in cat-land. And not even the full Elsweyr! They named the expansion Elsweyr, but it was really just ""Northern Anequina"". The Southern region of Elsweyr would become the last content update of the year... and it would conclude the story following a cliffhanger... so the date of the final content of the year comes around in a patch... and out of nowhere... as a SEPARATE PAID DLC (or through a subscription). What??? Where was this info beforehand??? Was I just stupid to assume that in the goodwill of purchasing an expansion and being lulled into thinking it would cover the relevant content for the year? No, pay fucking 20 bucks to finish the story of the expansion. Great. No, I'm not doing that.So the new expansion gets teased, a region of Skyrim, titled Greymoor. THIS TIME. This time they mention that the added area with the purchase of Greymoor is a an expansion, and that the later added contents are specifically DLC. You guys know what you did. I'm not playing your nickel-and-dime game anymore. Morrowind was the last good content you made. The quests are well-written, utilized the entire region, felt more Elder Scrollsy than anything else in your game. Then Summerset was a wet fart (despite my AD bias) and Elsweyr was sugar-coated in PR too effectively, while also being way too similar in play like Summerset. Put so much hype into Dragons... they're just moving molag bal shrines.Zenimax is way too content with making mediocre expansion content and shitting out constant new costumes and accessories, rather than *doing something as demanded yet basic as adding a new weapon class, i dunno, like spears? Hand to hand???? Shield combat????*"
Negative,having an issue with logging in and linking steam accounts i cant log in as it thinks i dont own the game which i do on steam and it doesnt give me anymore details than that i have tried every possible ways to get it working but its just not happenening
Negative,"Bought the game.  Could never log in with a single character.  Stuck on a loop of ""Requesting Character Load"" which would disconnect me from the server and account entirely with an error code #334.  Upon logging back in and trying to load into the server with a character, it would do the same thing.  Fought this for hours trying everything I could.  Just ridiculous and a waste of time.  Some people pointed out it being an ISP issue and their problem was running a VPN or getting a new ISP ( not gonna happen ).  I played this on Xbox One for 2 years with no issues. Got a refund and gave up.  What a disappointment."
Negative,"It's a good game, one of my most played games and one of my favorite games ever. I love this game so much but I will leave a negative review because I feel like the devs don't care about their players at all. They can't take constructive criticism, and the devs have an extremely unprofessional attitude that takes all criticism as mockery and never fixes the issues people are constantly pointing out. Plus, they are getting greedier and greedier, locking a lot of stuff behind limited time offers and High Isle has no homes you can purchase with gold, unlike the previous chapters. I love the Elder Scrolls universe and just playing this game, decorating my house, doing quests and dungeons and reading the lorebooks are very relaxing and cool but the devs' shitty attitude towards their players really makes me sad. If you are looking for a good elder scrolls / fantasy mmorpg, this is the game for you. I recommend getting this game but I recommend avoiding the crown store especially the crates because lootboxes are just shitty business practices. Also, if you want a vampire bite, DO NOT get it from the crown store. Most players will give you a free bite near a vampire shrine in Bankorai or the Rift"
Negative,"I swear I tried to give it a chance on xbox and then again on PC, but this game is a brain dead variant for those who wanted an MMO similar to the function of Skyrim, but even more watered down in combat difficulty and mechanics.I can't fathom how someone puts 1000+ hours into this game.  It's just unfulfilling."
Negative,"Wrestled with errors and sifted through forum threads for way too long, never got it working. Apparently there are a significant number of issues with the Steam version, so you're better off getting it from somewhere else."
Negative,"its good and bad a the same time, don't think this is going to be like skyrim or oblivion but online, it's quite different, don't let the nice store page videos fool you, go on yt and check actual game play videos to see if it's for you. if you don't already have friends prepare to be lonely.the in game store .... wait this game is a cash grab ?this game should be free."
Negative,Just heard they now sell personal data of players to third parties. DISGUSTING! I really start to hate these video game companies!
Negative,"My God, this game is a pain to play. Sorry, but I do not recommend this game. The animations are all clunkey. There is a delay when you activate certain things such as a door. I just do not like this, sorry. It's just so exhausting trying to review this game that I stumble on where to begin. I'm frustrated because it took me an entire day to install a 70gig game plus updates. I was so dissapointed. Like I'm not joking in anyway whatsoever when I say Elder Scrolls: Morrowin Game of the Year Edition on the Xbox Original is a superior game. I felt like I had no sense of freedom and it was very scripted. You get locked into one on one fights. As if I'm magnetized to the enemy directly in front of me. Where is the freedom man? The graphics are sub-par at best. I can easily max everything out and it still looks like Elder Scrolls two in comparisson. It feels clunky, outdated, obscure and an all around mess. Let me help direct an Elder Scrolls game. I could do better, I'm serious. This is a tragedy because if it was even slightly better I may have purchased this. So in the end I'm satisfied it was free so I didn't waste money to play this steaming pile of waste. 3/10 is the rating I'll give this game. The only thing saving it from a 1/10 is Dumbldores voice at the start of the game. Enough said."
Negative,"-I went into the game and created an account.I wrote my nickname, checked all sorts of boxes and remember, clicked on the box that indicates that I am OVER 13 YEARS OLD (remember this). Later, I click on create an account and it says: “mail does not meet the requirements” (it was written in the same way as Google mail.) I decided to see what people were writing about this on the Internet. They said that Bethesda is a bastard and they registered incorrectly within the game. Okay, I thought. I went to the site, clicked on the registration button and was asked to fill in my date of birth. I bet that I am over 13 years old, and they ended up blocking me because I am under 18 years old!Excuse me, Bethesda developers, but you yourself made a special button in the game that is responsible for the age that I am over 13, but after I wrote my date (I am under 18 years old) they blocked me! Is this such a brilliant and cunning plan to make money? Very clever. But I’m already returning them. Thanks for taking my time to download this game. Suck my dick."
Negative,"It's not an MMORPG in the traditional sense. It's not an Elder Scrolls game. I don't know what it is.There are combat mechanics, but I don't care when I can stand in front of everything mashing mouse 1 and winning.I ran around Vvardenfell trying to find anything that could kill me. It doesn't exist unless I walked away from my PC (and something tells me I would have still lived).If everything scales with me, and there's no challenge to begin with, what incentive do I have to continue? There isn't even downtime between fights. My stamina bar was nearly depleted the entire time and I just keep winning.Maybe the game gets better 1000 hours in. Not sticking around to find out."
Negative,"Awfull customer service as well as being still bug filled & prone to game breaking glitches along with frequent crashes, there are many free2play MMORPGs out at the moment that are better than ESO, don't waste your money on this when you can have a better & more complete experience with a free2play title."
Negative,"TL:DR I lost £35 buying it (store price change), £30 staying on it (subscription fee waved/optional), £45 on zone DLC (£60 overall but I only have access to 1), and Bethesda customer support are unsympathetic. Overall I've lost about £110 on this game but really up to £140 because I don't plan to play further...So I have an expensive history with this game,I bought the game, at £50, at full price/pre-ordered, received none of the benefits for it except the crowns (in-game currency), I then paid for about 2 months of ESO plus before I realised ""this game doesn't even hold a candle to the other titles of the series"" so cancelled, then when the game was dropped to £15 (with full price buyers not receiving any bonuses) and the subscription being optional, I decided to try join back.Over time, I thought, wow ok, this is a bit like Runescape, I'll play it, I'll get bored, but I'll come back - it's sort of un-quittable.Now, after Blackwood, I purchased an upgrade believing (apparently wrongly) that it would benefit me the other 3 zone DLC as well as Blackwood, I already had the 3 zone DLC under my account, but now after activating Blackwood I have lost the other 3 zones!I can't even return to where I started my character and have 20/25 quests for because that's apparently in the Morrowind DLC. I have lost £45 and when contacting Bethesda support it went a bit like this:Me: I have purchased Blackwood and it has removed my other DLCBethesda: Show us the Blackwood purchaseMe: *shows them the Blackwood Upgrade purchase*Bethesda: Actually, that's the upgrade, so you don't get the other zone DLC with it, thank you. *closes ticket*Me: What? So I don't actually get the zone DLC I purchased before back?Bethesda: Send us information of the DLC purchases from 2+ years ago and we'll get back to you...If Lore is what you're into (which is what I am), this game will be ok, it doesn't feel like the Elder Scrolls nor does it play like that and it's definitely not the social utopia everyone expected an online elder scrolls to be... You can spend forever on this game and get lost in the lore but so much of it requires DLC purchases which as mentioned before, is a quick way to losing you money it seems unless you back up every purchase you've ever made so that in a few years time when asked to provide evidence of purchasing it, your inbox doesn't remove the receipt/invoice emails..."
Negative,"The game itself is fun, I cannot recommend the game becausethere are too much bugs, performance issuse and since the last (reach) update also crashes and grafic issues...Also there is too much payments mechanism in one game here: Full price game + DLC's + Abo + expensive expansions + Loot Boxes with random content for money + free to play progression than can be speed up with real money (old trap like ingame mechanism similar to a free-to-play game) + optical things to buy    all that for game crashes or disconnects (my PC and Internet connection are both fine) during boss fights, lags in PVP, impossible to upgrade jewelery to best quality without playing houndreds of hours (or investing real money), small inventory without abo (especially for crafting), and so on....decide...Update: It did not get better still very expensive Expansions (with little content, because part of new content are sold as extra DLC), each new content brings new bugs, old bugs stay.Still no good performance in PVPStill Crashes in PVE, especially in some Dungeons on Bossfights it is not that uncommon, even If i can play good, an other member of group may get problems.The Game itself is still fun, but I quit my Abo, no chance that this bad software is worth the monthly money....NEXT UPDATE. It did not get better, some sets from last expansions did get nerved, so that new expansion sells better? Game performance and Bugs did not improve (therefore the nervs and changed mechanism did not help....) Also to reduce the Damage triggered by sets is sad if you farmed the sets ..."
Negative,"WHY I CHANGED THE REVIEW TO NOT RECOMMENDED: PAYWALLS!Changed due to them keep asking ""upgrade this to access this"" stuff in-game, basically keep asking for more money but in subtle way.Personally I really dislike the idea of a game where you need to purchase multiple times in order to access their full content, in other words, Ideally, I just want to only spend ONE per product. Multiple request payment games like ESO specificially, and Fallout 76 does this a lot. And shamefully both are from Bethesda.And it really annoys me when they strongly made a huge gaps between users that paid one vs who paid MORE (i.e a friend asked you to join in a boss raid, only that you cant because you DIDNT PAY for that paid DLC. Ha, shame!)You can feel it even further especially when they shove it into your screen. Like in launcher, they promote BLACKWOOD. Inside the game, they give you quest, but tells you to BUY THIS UPGRADE. I mean WTH. Same goes for FALLOUT 76. ""New update, but only for paying user! You need to pay more after you paid the game!"" This I really hate. Same goes to ROCKSTAR who shove their players to buy this and buy that. I already paid for your game, STOP GIVING ME ""ADS"" TO TAKE MORE OF MY MONEY. To be fair, the gameplay is good and okay, it's just how the developer/publisher keep finding way to make you pay more, and put in on your face (as per the time I write the review). Please, don't do this, Bethesda or whoever developer that does this. You guys made tons of good games, don't need to shove advertisements in front of us all the time. It's better you either charge us one time or made subscription based, and not charging us first time we buy THEN STILL offering us to subscribe. It's greedy. What's funny is only a little of games do this and again its by Bethesda. Even JEDI KNIGHTS OF OLD REPUBLIC is free to play but to advance to high end content you need to subs. I think it's fair, even though price is a bit much for very old game.Monster Hunter World does roughly same, but they don't shove it into you everytime you log-in or inside the game. In MHW you basically have the base game, and cosmetics are purely cosmetics, same goes with Iceborne, but that's just two big DLC, you get all high end ultimate content. That's it. Warframe is free to play and you can freely choose to pay or not. But this two games ESO and FO 76, they shove it everytime they can. ""New updates, only for THIS DLC payer / subscriber only!"" And they keep doing it over and over. GTA Online and RDR 2 gives free update 100% of the time, sure they ask you to buy more stuff but COSMETICS only, but there's no gap between paying user vs those who paid for more content. All major content is the same! The other game that does this is STAR WARS OLD REPUBLIC : Base game is free, which is good, but your level will be capped to 50 or 60 or something and to get to 75 you need to be on subscription to continue and enjoy most of the high-end mission. Sure paying once is okay, but.. PAYING for subscription forever to play an old game that is outdated in character movement, combat, and so on?  No. I'd rather pay once like MHW and be left alone for me to play game without being shoved all the time to upgrade or burneded with paywalls.Point is I don't want to be differentiated with those who pay more vs those who already paid (just make super VVIP then next time!). We both paid. Once is enough. So why I dislike the idea? Here: If the Developer wanna make extra layer of subscription-type in your paid game, make the game SUBSCRIPTION only based then (like WOW and FF Online), don't ask us to give extra money when we already PAID for your game to access the game. Pros/Features:+Core gameplay and basic features are superb. No major game breaking problem bugs me.+Fast paced action! You can spam skill at every interval. Enemy attacks can be blocked or dodged!+Enemies are scaling (or you can say you get buffed). No enemies are too hard/high leveled to one shot kill you, unless you're going for that overpowered enemy boss.+Classic roles are not as set or strict as more classic MMORPG games (warrior vs mage vs knight build) instead most class can do general stuff (i.e you dont need speficially tank guy to tank the attack, but it's ideal/better to have tank specified build to have an optimal or maximum battle conditions or the general idea that tank can only be a meatshield but no damage. that is not true.)+Mix and match skill to suit your playstyle.+You get free  mount, free house. You can customize your house any way you like it as long as you got the money.+Freedom to explore, revisit old places from previous games+Good graphics dan demand little specs. Good optimization I guess.+Fashionnnn is good!+The story/lore is kinda good, makes me like a part of the story itself. But the mechanics of the mission/quest is very boring. Go here, talk here, kill here, repeat. I would prefer they put some kind of cutscene if possible,  or a stronger sense of mechanics, such as stealth, something like RDR2 (brawling with npc's watching, fishing, play minigames,etc) , but that's nearly impossible since we're on multiplayer online games, therefore the quest feels very shallow to me. Hey, even Skyrim you can do open brawl, stealthing, stealing, and stuff, it's just feels very different here.Cons:-Too much small updates for no reason, (maybe cosmetics? events?). Everytime i wanna have quick play, boom UPDATES! Took a long break and decided to play again, only to be slowed down by updates. By the time i wanna play, either im not in the mood anymore and play other games, or just to get inside to grab freebies and turn the game off.-PAYWALL. In order to access certain features, like maps, certain enchanting/crafting tables, quest on add on map that requires you to get another add on, you need to PURCHASE that DLC, either using in-game currency or real money. If you're like me, simple man who prefers I pay all but all contents unlocked for free (like GTAV) then you better steer clear of this game. Tons of paywall.-Lore or character involvement is not as deep as offline ES games.-Major Updates are not free. For some people, this is an annoyance. For some, it's normal. Your choice to decide its pros and cons, for me, its cons. If you have friends who  bough the DLC and asked you to come, you cant, since you dont have the DLC. Price is a bit pricey too.-Microstransactions. This can be pros and cons, but I hate it and I put it here.-Lack of inventory slots-Lack of spesific tutorials (buy this here, repair this  here, etc) you will learn as you go , not at one spesific tutorial point.-Main quest is linear. Go dungeon here, kill this, return. Repeat.-Even regular quest is boring. Go  here, talk to this NPC, collect this or kill this in a cave, go to npc this, dialogue. very boring and linear. This almost happens everytime. -Connections MAY be bad. Servers are in NA and EU, if you got slow or unstable connection, prepare the worst. Dont get this game if you're not sure of your own connection. Sometimes disconnected with no apparent reasons. Only two server location, but they're  megaserver, a good one. But if you have below average internet outside these area, be aware! Most of the time its  not lagging, but lagging happened sometimes. Im in SEA Region and got 260 ms ping. It's not laggy most of the time.Conclusion:If you're not a big fan of ESO and not a big fan of  MMORPG, DO NOT GET THIS GAME. Pawyalls, grinds, microtransactions, and the game itself can be repetitive and boring. Overall the core of the game is fun, but for me, it get's boring especially with the quests and quest chores, and I know you can just ignore them. Those connection problem is rarely happen. The only problems I really despise is the connection (can jump from 200 ms - 400 ms in Asia) and the paywalls. But these two aren't serious problem (not game-breaking), the game is still much playable."
Negative,"Incredibly grindy, to be expected for an mmo but still. Combat is dull and repetetive, not much news there as combat wasn't a strong point in the elder scrolls series anyway except for probably the sneaky stuff and magic, but they cut on spells heavily and the sneaky stuff is pretty dull as well with a different sneak system than what TES fans are probably used to wich... well i don't like it.Abilities are lacking, varying to an attack that does more damage, one with afterburn, a shieldbash, yada yada yada not original stuff or just plain dull basically. qeusts feel like ""go from point a to point b""/""get 10 of these items""/""kill 10 [ENEMY NAME]"" because they litterally are, at least every quest in the main/beginning area varied from ""kill 5 enemies invading the city's shores"" ""kill 10 of the spooky ghost people and use item on them"" ""kill 10 of the scary crab things and bring back their drops"". of course, this might just be in the starting area, and i might be completely wrong here, but if i have to grind my way through that to get to the fun part of a game it isn't fun for me anymore.if you're an elder scrolls fan i wouldn't really recommend this, you'd be better off getting any of the other elder scrolls games, even if you think older games are bad for some reason cus you only care for graphics, you might wanna try out oblivionif you're an mmo fan, idk, i'm not a fan but i heard world of warcraft isn't too bad.tl;dr it's missing the good parts of the elder scrolls and it's quite meh as an mmo"
Negative,"This used to be a very good game. ZoS stopped giving a crap about the game and it's players. Every update is game breaking, guilds are falling apart because ZoS has shown them no love, and guilds are the only real reason players stick around. The in-game economy sucks, zone chat is disgusting, and overall, after 10 years, this game has progressively gotten worse. Not worth the money pit this game has turned into."
Negative,"Please note, all of my play-time is on Xbox. I got this for free on Steam much later.Full game costs well over $300.You need to buy the base game, expansions, and all the (on-disc)""DLC"" in order to have access to all the areas and content.The leveling system needs to be reworked heavily, the scaling factor means a level 5 is on-par with a level 50. Leveling is only there for arbitrary skill points and sh!tA full set of good gear will take you as long to get as it took guilds in Vanilla WoW to get spec'd for Nax40, no joke, I'm being serious.If you think you're getting an Elder Scrolls Experience™, you're looking at the wrong game.Zenimax/Bethesda: Just make CO-OP a standard feature in the main TES games. (They will not do this for TES VI or so on, because there's too much money to make from gating the entire game off behind 20+ microtransactions)Too bad stuck up entitled modders lock away working multiplayer TES mods behind their grimy little patreons, there are people who dedicate their whole lives to working on the guts of an operating system, Linux, and they don't ask for a f|_|(kin dime."
Negative,"I can safely say I have not played a game so perfectly bland and mediocre in my life as this game is. It's the mild cheddar cheese sandwich of games, bland, unexciting, tasteless but at least you can live on it which is about the only positive I can say about the game. Not only is there no TES DNA in the game, but it's generally poor. 10 hours in and I've yet to be challenged to the point I may as well be playing on god mode, non of the VA's can be any more arsed than most of them could in Skyrim, it appears to have been written by a two year old, and for the love of god, would it kill you to have accents other than generic American A and generic American B when I'm supposed to be talking to Vikings? I'm playing on the free weekend and barring a miracle, as soon as it's over I'm uninstalling it. Perhaps if it was free I'd play but not at the price point BGS want. Save your money, buy some paint and watch it dry, it'll be eminently more entertaining than TESO."
Negative,"As others have said, Steam version of this game has been screwed for a long time now with no fix in sight.But the best part isa. ESO support has not responded to my ticket for over 7 days now (I want my steam account unlinked so I can get over this nightmare).b. Steam won't provide me with a refund even with ZERO (0) hours of the actual game played. Hours of troubleshooting with the launcher logged approx. 14 hrs on steam. Guess they still hire bots from Asia to do their customer service. Got a canned response on both my refund requests.I know some of these reviews are telling you to buy from somewhere else, but with the response from Zenimax so far, I'd say skip it. Complete waste of both time and money.Oh, and pls BUY OUR LOOTBOXES KTHX."
Negative,"You can no longer gift through the crown store.For me, this is a problem. Crowns are too expensive and earning gold is a great time sink and can be traded to someone who can buy crown store items for me."
Negative,I will never get time back from this game and that hurts deeply
Negative,Zero difficultyJust boring farming missionspls don't even try it
Negative,"I bought the morrowind chapter with summerset and they never actually gave it to me only summerset, so now i have to spend another 30$ for morrowind ,some promotions are lies, its not worth spending money on dlcs if they dont give them to me"
Negative,"Monthly subscription is not justified. The game offers the same quality of service than a F2P without subscription, even worse. And does not even allow to farm the virtual currency in game to allow people to buy things regularly in the cash shop. A function ordinary implemented in most of the mmorpg.In addition, there are recurring problems of connection for over a year. It preventing people who bought the game on steam, to play. This is the case as I write this review. Even ESO+ subscriber can't play frequently and for some days, they pay for nothing.It is also impossible to separate his ESO account from his Steam account. And when you buy the game on Steam, Steam does not provide you with virtual keys that allow you to subscribe the game on the game producer's website. As is normally the case with ALL mmorpgs that can be found on Steam .Teso is a set of rather unpleasant exceptions. A shame because the immersion is not bad and the gameplay system with progressive difficulty depending on your level is not bad.Game to avoid in the current state despite all the good points he has. TESO is a pretty rotten red apple from the inside.------------------------------------------------------------------------Abonnement mensuel non justifié. Le jeu propose une qualité de service pire qu'un F2P sans abonnement. Et ne permet même pas de farmer la monnaie virtuelle en jeu pour acheter des choses régulièrement dans le cash shop. De plus, il y a des problèmes de connexions récurrentes depuis plus d'un an empêchant, les gens qui ont acheté le jeu sur steam, d'y jouer. Ce qui est le cas au moment où j'écris cette review. Il est aussi impossible de désolidariser son compte ESO de son compte Steam. Et lorsque vous achetez le jeu sur Steam, Steam ne vous fournis pas de clés virtuelles vous permettant d'enregistrer le jeu sur le site du producteur du jeu. Comme c'est normalement le cas avec TOUS les mmorpgs qu'on peut trouver sur Steam. Teso est un ensemble d'exceptions plutôt désagréables. Assez dommage car l'immersion est pas mal et le système de gameplay à difficulté progressive en fonction de votre niveau est pas mal. Jeu à éviter en l'état actuel malgré tous les bons points qu'il possède. TESO, c'est une jolie pomme rouge pourrie de l'intérieur."
Negative,"Given to me by a friend who already had a copy. I freed hard drive space and downloaded it, 2 hours later i try running the game only to have it crash immidiately after the installer reaches 100%.Spent another 2 hours looking for a solution (the first solution i found was missing a step and didn't work untill i found a video which included that vital step),  found that the ""launcher"" folder is incorrectly placed in appdata and wont run properly till placed in the Zenimax steam folder for the game. I finally install the updates and launch the game.. only to be stopped by a window telling me that i need to register with an account. I make an account on the site and type it in the game's login and it's as if the account i just made doesn't exist, i thought maybe i have to register the game key to the account on the site? The key i used to download the game through steam is rejected by the website as ""invalid"", this led to me looking over the support page which says, and i quote, ""Please keep in mind that the Customer Support team is unable to assist with invalid game codes purchased from third-party retailers (including Steam)"". I fucking died luaghing, Zenimax is complete trash to actually claim that Steam is the cause of my problem when i already have the game, and the game itself doesn't let me play it. At this point ive lost track of how long ive been trying to get the game to work but i'd assume i gave up after about 6 hours. The day after the game fucking accepts my eso account without any error!Zenimax more like Zeninconsistent.=====//AND BEFORE YOU SAY ""THIS ISNT EVEN ABOUT THE GAME""//=====(there is no point in stating the above cause i havent seen a single negative review of this game not spammed with dislikes (probably bot accounts hired by zenimax or mmo fanboys who like to latch onto one game and dump all their money and time onto who try and convince themselves it was worth it (probably couldn't make it this far in the review anyways)), please give feedback if i got anything wrong and you are a real person.)After jumping through all these hoops, is the game worth it? No, even if the game's installer & registration was not a pile of unoptimised trash, it's built like a free to play game where everything is a grind but you can choose to pay real money (and not like $5cdn we're talking $15-20 per micro dlc.) to get that dophamine gambling rush or to skip or speed up the grind using better items and mounts (minimum $10cdn for your first normal ass horse (not $10 per horse) only possible with the given in-game ""Crown"" currency that you start out with. You could choose to play the game for 35hrs or grind for 9hrs till you can afford the cheapest horse. You'll also need to buy everything again and create a new character if you have a friend who uses the other server (EU/NA)).  In combat i spend more time looking at my skill bar, for when i have enough mana to use a skill, than the game itself maybe dodging and interrupting attacks will eventually become useful but so far it's a cake walk where the npcs get distracted by my summons so i have the time to leave the game and make tea.Along with the cancerous ""enemies scale to your level"" sh!t to let you play anywhere in the game map, theres no goal to beat 'the hardest enemies to get high level loot' and seeing someone with max level gear on a flaming death horse beating skeletons at the beginning area at the same rate as a homeless man with a dagger, it looks really dumb and inconsistent.The game is definately playable with friends to occupy the bordom (though there are a lot of alternatives for people who dont care whether you can see everyone who is playing the game on one server or not.) and i heard pvp is alright but i can't say yet, just wanted to share my shitty experience that is potentially applicable to buyers of this game."
Negative,I have played this game since beta and all I have to say now is this.  It's time to put this on the MS store where games go to die.  It's time to go now...
Negative,I spent 1-2 hours playing it.I spent 3 hours trying to login due to problems with Steam servers.10/10.
Negative,Game gets a thumb down for putting Jewelry Crafting and gear transmutation behind DLC paywalls.
Negative,"LOL, gonna need a second life to grind, and a second mortgage to pay for every piece of lint in this game.  Very confusing, no community help when asking, quests are spread all over the place, really just no direction at all.  Like eve online, take forever to grind unless u pay monthly sub to get frills and double xp.  Dont waste ur life, nuff said."
Negative,"DO NOT buy this game from Steam.-During installation the game is downloaded twice, reaching ~150 GB, with many people running into problems during or after that, having to look up guides online and delete files manually. -Their servers are very problematic, the ping for some being consistently over 100, frequently hitting 300, disconnecting you from the game at random or at times not letting you log in for hours.-Since the game is downloaded a second time through their launcher and their launcher running is counted as time spent playing, by the time you have managed to install it you are already well over the 2 hours limit for steam refund.This is the first game I have regretted buying on Steam, alas, I cannot refund it for the above reason. If you have a poor soul as a friend that has bought it through steam and you want to play with them, you will have no problem if you buy the game from the game's official site as there are just 2 megaservers, NA and EU."
Negative,"I have over 500+ hours in this game so I have definitely given it a fair shot. The biggest issue at this point is the outdated engine, graphics and clunky gameplay mechanics. I know they are making bank and yet they refuse to update the graphics in a significant way. We need updated textures and Raytracing for example. No option to mod the graphics because that's.. cheating? Makes no sense. The screenshots are fake btw. Graphics and gameplay mechanics aside, this game is not made for anyone who is even remotely an introvert or someone looking to make new friends and play with them. You start alone, not with a group of people which is the biggest problem. Most players are veterans or bots at level 600. Again, not very beginner friendly. In all of my 500+ hours I have yet to find a group that will fight a boss. They are all dolmen groups. The NPCs are soul-less and cardboard-like and even Animatronics at Disneyland have more life to them. There is just no incentive to play this game at this point unless you have a lot of friends who play, but even then you will be left in the dust. Many bosses / areas, etc are not do-able with 1 person. Everyone over level 200 seems like a bot. Enemies are scaled to your level and some can only be defeated in a group, making you feel under-powered despite being a high level. Overall cannot recommend this game."
Negative,"Aggressive Monetization (You have to buy every individual dungeon if you aren't a subscriber, and some player housing can go up past 100 USD in their Premium Currency costs (though they can also be bought with in-game currency)) Sky Shards being tied to said dungeons and monetization (after completing a zone (including dungeons) the first time, any alts you have will have to pay for unlocking them or else you have to chase down all of the shards again...) and even the prestige system being unhelpful for leveling side characters (It doesn't actually activate on alternate characters until level 50 in a game which does not offer Level Boosting for whatever reason)This game is overall incredibly unfriendly to anyone looking to pick it up... so DON'T."
Negative,"Too Long, Didn't Read belowExamples for why I do not recommend this game:GLITCHESThe second boss of the endgame veteran trial Hel Ra Citadel in Craglorn splits your group of 12 into parties of 6 to fight two bosses at once (commonly referred to as top and bottom boss), if one side wipes the other enrages, it's a neat mechanic, but if the group fighting bottom boss does not kill their boss first try, the lower boss resets but does not respawn, leaving the top group permanently enraged, requiring a reset to reattempt.  This trial has been in game for more than a year and this still hasn't been fixed.  For reference, the first boss you have to re-kill is the 6 armed stone guy in the  screenshots.I personally have game crashes on average AT LEAST once every 2 days, sometimes 3 to 4 crashes in 5 hours of playtime.PvPIt's nice to have fights of 50-100 people fighting to capture/defend keeps, but you might change your opinion when the framerate drops to 5 FPS, or the fact that with the drop of Homestead people become invisible (not rendering) and kill you without being able to see them, this goes both ways but it's very disappointing.Cheating/ExploitsThe only permanent actions I've seen against people is a forum ban when they bad mouth the devs on there.  Get caught using cheat engine? 3-day ban.  Lag-spiking in Cyrodiil PvP?  Have yet to see actions on that.Upcoming content/ESO+ subscriptionIn Quarter 3 they are releasing ""a dungeon-based DLC"", and beginning Q2, ""Chapter's"" annually.  Basically a zone the size of Wrothgar, (another DLC, but included with ESO+ subscription, or purchasable with $30 in Crown's, the Real Money currency for the game) but also including a class and the games 6th trial.  This Chapter will NOT be purchasable with crowns or included in the subscription.  you need to pay $40 if you already own the game, or $60, and you get the base game, but none of the extra content in Gold Edition.I complain about this because for $15 per month you get 1500 crowns to spend, so you cannot get this content just by being subscribed.ZoS has plans for Q4, but the only description right now is ""content-based""TL;DR In-game bugs are game breaking and have existed un-patched for well over a year, support is awful at best.  End game is stagnant.  When it works, it's a pretty game, buy it for $10, enjoy the 3 main questlines, then dump this game."
Negative,"I do very much enjoy this game. However I will say this until I am blue in the face but: ""forcing"" players to pay a monthly fee for INVENTORY/STORAGE is ridiculous. I understand having the DLCs and all the other fun stuff that goes along with the membership but paying $15 a month to have inventory space is just so backwards to me.If they were to remove this from the membership and have it for base game then I would recommend it. But not until then."
Negative,"This is an incredibly beautiful and extremely well made game that is unique from other MMO's. That being said as a fan of the ES series since I was but a child, I found this game to be extremely disappointing and an overall waste of money. The immersion from the series is completely annihilated by Bethesda taking what should stay a single player franchise and making it into a MMO. What normally is an experience of being a unique and powerful figure is now just being another tough guy in a room full of mostly tougher guys. If you enjoy MMO's this game is most definitely for you, but if you love ES for its story lines and immersion as well as the uniqueness of your character then stay away from this game."
Negative,I could describe this game in three words... Repetitive cash grab
Negative,NEED ASIA SERVER PLSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Negative,"Combat is boring, Story is boring, and nothing about this game feels good fuck unlimited tamriel update"
Negative,"good game, but they increased the price of morrowind (a dlc) from $10 to $33, and have a subscription available for purchase, minimum price $13 a month for 6 monthsalso, for anyone living away from the servers, don't buy, or be prepared to be locked out of all of pvp along with a ton of other content. the lag in this game is insanely high already, and high ping just makes it worse"
Negative,"I recommend this game but not as an Elder Scrolls game. It has far more in similarities with other mmo's then i does its own franchise. As far as gameplay goes anyway, story and lore is definitely Elder Scrolls. Gameplay is less dependant on timing your hits then it is to hack and slash until you have to avoid a devistating aoe. It also drops direct attacks for skills and spell so they can incorporate classes. The result is less involved combat and more flashy auto skills that more or less happen at the push of a button. You have less freedom with your character then they advertise but its to push for player interaction as some classes are hard to solo with. My advise, play in third person, find groups, and plan your class before hand."
Negative,"The game can have a lot of issues with ISP's, some people need to setup a VPN to be able to play. The game is fine, I've played the hell out of it, but after so many hours invested there is really nothing left to do but Battlegrounds or the same dungeons over and over so it has become kind of stale for me, every DLC is just another set of dungeons or so, it needs to freshen up its gameplay, give the player more things to do that are not an insane and boring grind.Update: there is a trend with Zenimax and this game, apparently as they are running out of ideas and instead of listening to the community they just nerf everything once a year or so. It has happened for 2 years straight now and I guess they will keep doing it just for the sake of selling the new classes, armor sets (DLC), etc."
Negative,"Absolute terrible game, boring, dull, overpriced, with people only being attracted to it because of it's set in the elder scrolls universe (though you need to pay extra for DLC to unlock many areas). I paid for it but it isn't worth my time to play more of"
Negative,"Repetitive after so many find this, kill that things with nothing but a fresh coat of paint on it is really shallow and meaningless after a while. Now be mad about it. Also, I want magic to mean something. I want my spells and my runes and my alchemy to be NECESSARY in the use of magic. I want to raise the damn dead like a real necromancer,  I want to create incredible magical items and craft my own spells, and I don't want ANY armor wearing min-maxer to have the same power as my mage! If NECROM is not what I am looking for in a mage class, I am quitting this game and demanding a refund."
Negative,Boring fetch quests and extremely repetitive combat is all that i have expierenced in this game
Negative,"Game is quite OK, but can't recommend this game to asian people because there are only NA and EU server and you are likely have huge internet issues unless you have a really good and stable internet"
Negative,The game was not enjoyable. Too much of the same old grind and the cost is way to high for the benefit.
Negative,"Locking classes behind paywalls... What decade are we in, the 2000's?"
Negative,DO NOT BUY THIS ON STEAM!!You will not be able to login and play for days at a time! There is no support and just getting it setup will pass the time allowed for a refund.Total ripoff!
Negative,not worth the 150gb it makes you install
Negative,Never had so many problems trying to make a game run.
Negative,"IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY THIS GAME, DO NOT BUY IT FROM STEAM!!If you buy this on Steam, you will not be able to play at least once a week. You have to load through Steam every time, even though they had their own launcher, and the connection is disrupted constantly. And you account is locked to Steam only, you cannot just use your username.The support is literally garbage. Just don't do it."
Negative,"If you think, since it's a buy to play game, you can just buy it and play, you're wrong. To be able to normally play, you will need to buy the ESO+ subscription, otherwise your inventory will be full with crafting materials all the time. And the inventory here is not weight limited, like in Skyrim, but slot limited, so 50 apples use the same space as 1 apple, and 1 apple uses the same space as two-handed battleaxe. There are tons of different kinds of materials, which with the ESO+ subscription can be stored in a separate material-inventory, and without the subscription It's unplayable."
Negative,"really boring to play solo, repetitive, bad art style, weird additions to the lore, very pervy, cruel, boring, disgusting and generally awful writing, very bland characters too, if you want to play elder scrolls with a friend just get the skyrim multiplayer mod"
Negative,Fun game when you can log in when you can't it's bad adn makes me dabb
Negative,This games events are repetetive tedious and anoying
Negative,"Bugs, Bugs, Bugs, Bugs, More Bugs and completely broken game mechanics.  Latest one blocking a core game mechanic has been broken for 6 weeks and is going to stay broken for at least 2 more weeks.ESO 2022 is in a worse state than most pre-alpha games."
Negative,"I am writing this review mostly as a reminder to myself, not to try to play it ever again. I am unable to deal with such a small inventory and I am definitely not willing to pay for bigger one, this is  pay to play at its worst for me.  I have tried it 3 times... 52hours and nope this is not for me... wasted money.."
Negative,Game itself is great but game servers are trash. Sometimes the game won't even let you log in with your character for hours. When I tried to use any reccomended addons by community it gave me : unknown error while loading character: :. Until they fix this stuff I can't give this game positive rating.
Negative,"I loved the Elder Scrolls games but not this one.  Although it has its strong points, some overall way this game was put together just doesnt fit.  For the money you are spending, it is almost worth it but I simply could not get past the fact that every quest feels copy and paste with the same kind of story line and action.  The worlds are nice but the graphics are sub par at most.  So much money was put into voice acting for this game and not into animation movements or lack of world polish with lots of the quests (especially the main storyline missions).  ESO keeps updating the game with new add on content but it is pretty up in price.  I purchased a horse for around ten dollars which is pretty much needed.  If you dont want to spend real world money on it then be ready to grind a lot.  It is much improved from where it was at launch but Bethesda should have simply invested the money else where.  The community is still going and there are some great guilds our there but I imagine it to drift down to almost nothing in the next coming years as the games continues to age and newer and better mmos come out.  The dirrection of the game was poor from the start and bringing it out from where it stands will take a lot more work."
Negative,"After 8,000 hours on record playing the Elder Scrolls Online, it is safe to say that ESO is a terrible game that you should avoid wasting your time and money on.The developers are woefully out of touch with the community. The developers, particularly Rich Lambert, spend more time trying to wordsmith around concerns, work to invalidate customer concerns rather than listen and validate them, and delivering reskinned and formulaic stories, instances, zones and other content. First, the main focus of ESO is storytelling, and each chapter is just a reskinned version of the past one for the last 3 or so years. Second, end-game trials and content are reskinned version with continually decreased difficulty. For those completing harder difficulty content, there's less and less rewards now for playing the content other than the satisfaction of completing it. Third, PVP has not received an update in over half a decade. Fourth, the player base, particularly in the last 8 months or so, has crashed in a noticeable way. Steam charts show thousands of players have quit and when you log in, the game feels like a ghost town except in a few major cities. Do not buy this game. It's a shell of its former self. Go play Final Fantasy or New World."
Negative,"To start off Ive played lots of MMO's :SRO, SRO:R, TERA, Tales of Pirates, Flyff, C9, MU Online, Vindictus, WoW, WAR, Rift, and many more i forgot about already...But never i have seen such stale combat system that bores me to death, i never expected it to be Oblivion/Skyrim type of combat in the first place, but a solid combat system on one of the largest game series titles ""The Elder Scrolls"" are..Dont get me wrong story, world exploration ive seen so far, even quests are pretty damn good and im pretty sure there are god knows how much to explore more, but the god damn combat is just utter garbage and in my case just kills it for me...What i expected was a god damn combat system that is similar to TERA, Vindictus, C9 considering this is ""The Elder Scrolls"" title on its name.. And i got more stale combat system than god damn SRO that came out in 2004....Development team didnt even try to make combat appealing just look at the abomination archery is:*Infinite Arrows ( dont ask me where they come from as i have no idea myself )*Homing Projectiles that never miss (skills never miss too) even if target goes behind a hard objects while its still traveling towards him, it will just ignore everything and hit, only way is to block them unless its AoE type of skill those must be dodged/started blocking first second you see area marked up otherwise you will be hit (last second dodge/block wont work)*Blocking with a bow (aparently this is a thing somehow and dont ask me how a flimsy wooden bow can block a heavy attack from a greatsword)*Youre stuck with arrows your bow comes with.. As there are no bow ammunition in this game at all as i mentioned before.Melee and Mage combat have similar problems in their own way so i wont even bother.Skill variety on this game is lacking, you get Weapon, Class, Armor skills. (there are also few other skill trees but i wont even bother):*Weapon and Armor skills get divided into categories like Heavy Armor, Light Armor, One-Handed, Restoration staff, Destruction staff and ect.. Each has its own skills and passives, skills have ability to morph which is pretty much slight change to its mechanic with added extra effect it didnt had before YOU CAN DO THIS ONLY ONCE PER SKILL.*Class skills are Divided in 3 sub-classes that got 5 skills and 1 ultimate ability, rest of stuff is same as weapon skills and ect except Ultimates as they dont have options for branching up 2 ways or more.. And thats it, youre stuck with same animations with small tweaks to them for the rest of the game.Character stats are nonexistent with ability to put point after you level up one of the following: Magicka, Health or Stamina but ill let it slide as it is Elder Scrolls game after all and we had this system kinda always.How to fix the game to make it better: *C9, Vindictus, TERA(pre BAM nerf + attack area light ups we are not casuals after all) style of combat, this game really needs a fast paced combat that is quite challenging to master completely yet rewarding. Sneaking needs some tweaking as well because you can stand in open wide area, let light shine on you and enemies wont notice you unless you hit them, they get you into their aggro distance (its smaller if you sneak ofc)So conclusion.Game looks great with HUGE map to explore, loads of lore and great expansions as far ive seen other people do in their gameplay videos, yet i cant recommend this game because in MMO's combat system makes up most of the gameplay experience as you will have to kill hordes of monsters be it quest or just grinding.If i still could refund it i would gladly do it. Im feeling bad for choosing this over Witcher 3 GOTY.."
Negative,"This game has sucked since they started catering to casuals that just whale on the Clown Store for ""pretty"" cosmetics that are useless but cost $50 for their player homes that offer almost no gameplay benefit unlike in other games.It was fun PvP at one point but after years of neglect it got worse and worse. Even in the newest DLC they managed to completely break Cyrodiil when there was no PvP content added."
Negative,This game is the best game ever made. Buy it and fall in love but:DON'T BUY IT ON STEAMBuy it on the ESO website to save yourself countless connection issues.You'll thank me for this.
Negative,"i had a pre-existing ESO account and whenever i tried logging into it, the game would refuse to take the account without any reason."
Negative,"The game is great, holds up fine as an mmo. Can be a bit vapid, I recommend playing with a few friends if you can.The DLC/Store system is down right PREDATORY in the way it misleads you. Basically, you're locked out of MOST dlc unless you sub, once your sub runs out your access to DLC is also denied. For anyone thinking they can buy a ""complete edition"" or some other bundle- this is incorrect. Besides a select few larger expansions (pretty much blackwood and thats it), all dlc is exclusive to in-game crown store and they are not what I'd call cheap. The best advice ive seen is to sub and use your monthly crowns to buy DLC's. I believe you can buy crowns in game from players also. But yeah I'm not impressed, since I was drawn in by option to not sub (too many subs as is) and I'm down to just buy DLC but this is bullshit. while I'm at it, this ""ken doll"" shit on male characters is getting old bro. 4/10"
Negative,"Overall, I'd give this game a 2.5/5, but that's an average over a wide variety of factors.Community +5/5. You'll meet some of the coolest people playing this game. Friendly, helpful, talented.Customer Support -1/5. Their abuse department in particular will issue suspensions/bans for the most inane of reasons and then refuse to walk it back even when you explain in excruciating detail how they've mistaken, replying only with corporate copy-pastas and not even responding for weeks at a time to any information you provide. Maybe you'll get lucky and have that not be your experience. It wouldn't be a big deal (to me at least) except they did this even though I had an active subscription. If you do decide to get this game, do not subscribe unless you are fine gambling that they will make up some reason to suspend you for multiple days of your subscription (i.e. don't expect to get what you paid for).Game play +4/5. Pretty good PvE combat system, good extreme late-game challenges. Pretty well crafted balance of grindiness (assuming you like MMOs in the first place, some amount of grinding is fundamental to the genre at large imo).Stability +2.5/5. Get used to game breaking bugs every single patch. The worst ones usually get fixed within a week, but some more niche bugs will stay in the game for months at a time."
Negative,"Everything about this game is ""pay to win"" every turn the money will speak otherwise the game is super good!Hey Bethesda you know what i actually trying to say the prices has to be ""local prices like for every country"" on their money listings, you know your game is doing good because of million players around the world but that doesn't mean every player can afford the US prices. I know before reply was a auto bot reply but if this message somehow reaches bethesda !""Please change the crown store items/monthly subscription to local listing prices that would make every player in the game collectable/affordable"""
Negative,"So like... Great idea, a lot of great ideas actually, but closing EVERYTHING behind donate is just stupid. Just like you CANT play without spending money, on Premium, or on addons, on slots, and many many more. And ""free week"" wont make it, sadly, any more better, any more interesting or anything like this, Tho i enjoyed this game, this huge world of TES games, this all thing of ""pay us more"" is just stupid, this is not free game to begin with to ask for THAT much money. Nope.To other things-Graphic- uhhh, okay, i'm not that choosy, so okay. Gameplay- Good. Maybe. I prefer ""a lot of spells on the hotbar"" and here it's like 4, ult, and just 2 stances to switch on the go. So ~10 spells if i havent missed anything. Skills- wekp, here everything is okay. A lot of things to choose from, transforming my paladin into oth mage and rogue is kinda funny. Conclusion- I still sometimes enter game, play a bit, but thank you but no. It becomes too boring too fast. Ofc many other could tell- But man, you have only N hours, you havent gotten to any raids, you are just noob, what can you say about this game, you have seen nothing. My answer- i have seen enough. If on ""max level"" this game becomes ""the best game in the world""- good, but if gameplay BEFORE this is stupid and boring af- why should i even overcome myself? The entire game must be interesting, not only some kind of ""Late game"" that shows on the horizon."
Negative,"I'm going to start out this review by saying two things: first, I'm not generally a huge fan of MMOs.  I've tried a few of the better-known ones (WoW, SWTOR, EVE) and just never managed to get into them the way I get into single-player games.  Second, I'm a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls series, and particularly enjoy the world of Nirn and the depth of its lore, to the point where I'll avoid playing an Orc or Dunmer in Skyrim because I have trouble mentally justifying why the Aedra would bestow the dragon-blood blessing on a Daedra worshiper.  If this paragraph doesn't sound like you, then feel free to ignore everything I'm about to say.Now, with the preamble out of the way: out of all the MMOs I've played, ESO is my favorite.  And out of all the Elder Scrolls games I've played, ESO is my least favorite.I enjoy ESO as an MMO because it mixes in some action mechanics to make the gameplay more dynamic.  Where other MMOs have a tendency to fall into a pattern of ""select target, start rotation, rinse, repeat"", ESO throws blocking and counterattacking into the mix, making each fight feel a bit more like its own unique situation rather than repeating the same fight dozens of times over.  Character building is also a lot more flexible than your standard MMO, letting you pick and choose your favorites from three class skill trees, a racial skill tree, a weapon skill tree, and a few other miscellaneous skill trees, rather than shoehorning you in to one of a couple predetermined skill trees, so I really felt like I was able to make my character my own.Or I did at first, anyway.  See how I said up there that the flexibility is ""more than your standard MMO""?  I used that phrasing deliberately, so buckle in, because this is where the gripes start.If the flexibility of character building is a step up from the MMO side, it's a huge letdown coming from the Elder Scrolls side.  One of the huge draws of the series is the ability to do just about *anything*.  Want to be a spellcaster wearing plate armor?  Do it.  Want to be a thief who turns into a rampaging werewolf when cornered?  Do it.  I can't even count how many times I restarted Skyrim because I suddenly had a new idea for a character that I just had to try out.  To an extent this is still true in ESO--as I said, you can do a lot of mixing and matching from a variety of skill trees--but the problem is that it's really hard to attain that level of flexibility while also balancing for a multiplayer game.  You can give your players options, sure, but eventually those options will start to narrow down as players figure out what the ""best"" builds are.  And this is reinforced by some of the game's mechanics.  For instance, your armor-wearing mage can technically exist in this game, since there's nothing stopping you from wearing heavy armor as a Sorcerer... but then your character's going to be sub-optimal because you're missing out on the rather substantial Magicka bonuses from the light armor skill line.  The most noticeable manifestation of this is that the particulars of the ways weapon and spell damage are calculated means that pretty much all builds are going to be ""pure Magicka"" or ""pure Stamina"" in terms of stat investment.  Again, you *can* invest in both stats if you want, but again, your character is going to be ""sub-optimal"" if you do.And this last bit might be a minor gripe, but it's actually interfering substantially with my enjoyment of the game so I'll mention it anyway: fluff-wise, there's no ""pure fighter"" class in the game.  Supposedly the Dragonknight and Templar are supposed to fill that niche, but the Templar's your average paladin type and the Dragonknight's skill trees are geared towards fire magic, earth magic, and turning into a dragon.  (Why is this last bit even in a game set more than 1000 years before dragons start reawakening in Skyrim?  I have no idea.)  If you're used to the rough ""fighter-mage-thief"" grouping of the other Elder Scrolls games it can be a bit weird to feel like the first third of that equation is missing, and it was definitely disappointing to roll up an ""Orc warrior"" as my first character only to find that my character concept basically precluded taking any skills from my three class trees.Anyway, tl;dr if you're looking for an MMO this game might be worth trying out, but if you're looking for an Elder Scrolls game I'd recommend giving it a pass."
Negative,Never played on online Rpg and I now know why. It's way too crowded and feels like your at a fun fair rather than exploring a world by yourself. What's the point of trying to sneak on an enemy when 10 pricks suddenly appear and destroy your target? Completely kills the mood to have people everywhere and all the time.
Negative,"Too many people having issues with the launcher including myself. Wont give a good review or recommend this game until they fix this and it STAYS fixed for more than a week.EVERYtime I try logging into ESO it doesn't work. It will do the mini load icon than nothing. So I searched the internet and found work arounds. They work for a day and than the next time I try logging in it doesn't work again. Rinse and repeat. Now today none of the work arounds even work. Yes, I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, DOES NOT WORK. I've tried disabling anti-virus DOES NOT WORK. Run as Admin and compatability, did that. I did the work arounds to login and update straight from the files but that doesn't work anymore. I have no problem with ANY OTHER GAMES. Not a single one from either Steam or Outside Of Steam ever has a problem. It is always and only ESO. And I know I'm not the only person having these issues. Even here you see people complaining and in google search people trying to find a salution. From 2014 to 2018 and no one seems to have an answer???!!! Like WTH? What kind of MMO can't even get there launchers right? And you'd think a long time franchise like this would at LEAST get that right.It's not just a few people having this issue: More and more people are are speaking up. https://steamcommunity.com/app/306130/discussions/0/3051633726587473775/?tscn=1533947664The game itself isn't bad if you can actually get into the game. If you still want to buy it I suggest downloading straight from the ESO website and avoiding buying it through Steam and avoid linking it to Steam."
Negative,"(This review is writen as of having last played May of 2017)I want to like this game, after 510 hours I do, but it gets stale. The combat is not exciting, the quests are pretty boring. The novelty of being in the ancient Elder Scrolls world fades after a while. There are two semi-pros I would list: the crafting system is something I enjoy with the different race styles, however even this has its draw backs as the rarer race styles usually result in having to spend actual money to unlock them or hope the RNG gods favor you.Secondly the PVP is also fun when its well organized and...when you're not being ganked by ninjas who run basic guerrilla tactics or dealing with players who log onto one faction's pvp server and relay all the movement to their main faction. The times when PVP went well I felt like I was in something straight out of one the major battles in Lord of the Rings. I loved every moment of it and I'd play hours on end, but these moments were sporadic and few.And don't even get me started on personal housing.Being able to join up to 5 guilds can be good and bad. I dislike it personally because it leads to a lack of any real loyalty to a guild. Its simply not the same as other games that have it to a one guild concept. They're less of something to invest in and more of a casual social thing that's just kinda there.Overall this is a game set in the ES universe, but that's really where the similarities end in my opinion. Do yourself a favor and invest in another MMO."
Negative,"Its not what I expected, unfortunately. If the xbox 360 had an MMO, this would be it."
Negative,"Game is fun, I can see myself putting more than 5k hours here, but..Playing on 300 ping is not a great experience. Invest in Asia server, we exist too and you're not a small indie company."
Negative,DO NOT BUY UNTIL THEY FIX STEAM CONNECTION TO THE SERVERS
Negative,"Great story and wonderful world, but the server crashes, high maintenance time, many random crashes after each patch are ruining the feeling of a good game."
Negative,it's like an elder scrolls game but worseit's only downhill from here
Negative,Good game ... if you are logged in.
Negative,"I am a big fan of the single player versions. For me this game however lacks complexity, lore. The game mechanics has been oversimplified.Guess that is unavoidable for MMOs."
Negative,"Even with a subscription you constantly feel their predatory money hungry gaze. You can't even ignore all the things they charge money for and just relax and play the game, its not just a bunch of nice extras they charge for. You will literally constantly be running into a wall preventing you from doing some extremely basic function that you have to pay ten dollars to climb over, again, even if you are paying a sub. Its annoying to feel this wall constantly as a free to play player of games but somewhat understandable since games need money to run, but once you are a paying member you shouldnt have to face that anymore. Not having to deal with that is one of the main reasons to subscribe to something actually, so having it still happen is making me unsub. I am so glad I only bought one month; it will be the last bit of money these greedy people will ever get from me. I would have been happy to pay for a sub for years (I am disabled and spend a lot of time on mmos) if they just let the game be good if you had a sub instead of randomly charging money for basic things like hiding shoulder mogs or being able to make another character or change your appearance. Oh and the character creater has TERRIBLE lighting seemed almost intentionally designed to force you to have to pay to remake the characters appearance once you can see them in better light. This business model is both predatory and stupid; just have the game be good at least once you sub and more people will be more happy to give you more money. If it was just nice extras that cost money i would probably have spent a lot of money on this game, because I really like it. But because they keep making things intentionally frustrating and putting crap in my way that I am NOT happy to pay for, they wont see another cent from me. Congrats ESO, you lost out on hundreds of dollars because you wanted to rake me over hot coals for ten. *slow clap*"

Anyway, let me walk you through communication between the players and Zenimax, in my own experience.Experience 1:1: Ignore the steam forums.2: Several players post a bug/problem, in my case, a bug regarding a lead.3: Players say that the lead is not dropping and that it is probably bugged.4: Zenimax says that it is not bugged, and that it is very unlikely that something like this would be bugged.5: Time passes.6: Zenimax says that it has been bugged, and that they will work on a fix.Happens multiple times!Experience 2:1: Players ask for something meaningful to be added or fixed.2: Zenimax releases an archeology/antiquity minigame.3: Players once again ask for something meaningful to be added or fixed.4: Zenimax releases a card minigame.5: Players complain.6: Forum thread locked/deleted.I rest my case. Too expensive to GET A FULL GAME, WHICH IS EA LEVELS OF GREED. WHY WOULD YOU SECTION OFF YOUR FULL GAME INTO CHUNKS AND FORCE PEOPLE TO PAY AN ARM AND A LEG FOR IT? BASIC RACES AND CLASSES? PAYWALL.  A CRAFTING BAG WHICH GUILD WARS 2 GIVES YOU FOR FREE, BECAUSE ITS BASIC GAME MECHANICS 101 FOR A COMPARISON? PAYWALL. I don't gotta play this bad cash grab game at all to realize how many bad reviews it has on steam, nor how many of them are 100 percent correct You think we're stupid Zenimax Online Studios? WE SAW IT IN DESTINY, WE SAW IT IN DESTINY 2, AND WE SEE IT HERE. Should put up warning signs of radiation around this game's store page, why? Because it melts wallets."
Negative,"This is a great game and I'm enjoying it immensely but DON'T BUY IT ON STEAM.  Steam users constantly run into connectivity problems - they can't login, although all the other users can. I had this game for 4 days, couldn't log in for 3 of them. Of course I can't refund, because 'play time' exceeds 2 hours. I've spent most of my 'play time' on login screen."
Negative,MAKE PVP GREAT AGIAN!!!!!!!!!!! BRING BACK VET LEVELS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK CP SYSTEM!!!!!!!!!!
Negative,"good game. but no one can play when they want to play. when ""The Steam"" allow to play only. DON'T BUY ESO in Steam. if You wanna to play in ESO o'couse."
Negative,"It just works! But not on Steam. This is a great game, but buy it directly from Bethesda. There are too many problems with ZoS and Steam. This caused me to have to get the game twice, at my expense of course.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit: Dear Bethesda, Read what I typed. Minus Cyrodiil/ PvP which has always been its own problem, the game works great just not on Steam. I don't know how that could be any more clear. There have been numerous players that have had issues playing through Steam. The reasons are never clear and I finally became one of the players that cannot play through Steam. I had already submitted tickets and was eventually told my graphics card was the problem as if the handful of people I was juggled by just gave up and wanted to stop helping me. The ticket process sucks and no one wants to do it because of the excuses we get. If the ticket system worked, you'd have a lot more tickets, a smoother game, and much happier player base. Even with my original post you clearly did not read what I said and is a copy paste message pointing to your trash bin, I mean ticket system.Regardless, as soon as I bought the game through your website it worked just fine, like it had before, and still does. There is some disconnect when playing through Steam and a serious problem with your staff that handles tickets. It's beyond upsetting that I had to buy the game twice, but that's what I was forced to do in order to keep playing. Therefore, my non-recommendation stands just as firm: I do not recommend anyone buy this game through Steam but to instead to go to your website and download it directly to avoid complications. You should honestly remove this game from Steam because of said complications.Love,Warrior Whitten"
Negative,"I wasted over 200 hours on this game..There are so many small things holding back ESO from really being an average game.As of writing this:+++The World:Raids are a joke, a timed experience similar to World of Warcrafts ""Challenge Mode"" dungeons with much more bland encounters.Auction houses do not exist unless you want to buy something from a crummy guild that is selling things. There isn't an easy way to compare prices, trading is done via shouting and spamming chat channels in hopes that whoever you are sucking into buying your wares doesn't know the right price.Story missions got old after finishing up one of the factions (there are 3 in total).Crafting is a waiting game, want to craft something with some pretty nice set effects? You'll be waiting close to a year to craft that item as you research what you need to craft.Item drops become tedious to grind, going through a dungeon as a Cloth wearer? Well hope you really really love this plate helm that has the exact stats you want!---Combatish:Leveling is pretty mundane, the grind is worse than a korean MMO and less rewarding overall.Combat is boring, your build may be pretty cool but it is useless compared to the build that people have specced out via Excel sheets and damage parsers! Spam 3 skills and sleep yourself thru dungeons, raids and leveling...PvP is like a bastardized version of Guild Wars 2 PvP, an open world, multi-faction, faction vs faction slugfest...no wait thats not right, it's a boring PvP system where your team goes clockwise and the enemy team goes clockwise in hopes to not encounter one another as you re-capture lost forts and useless nodes.---Final thoughts:The game has SO much potential and it seems to be wasted. The lore could be great and engaging and parts of it are but overall the player really doesn't care about 90% of the mundane tasks they are sent off to do.YEARS later and there are still game breaking bugs that have been in the game since release. You still have to google them and find answers to them that are from 2014 and 2015 because they are the same bugs, never changed and never fixed.This is the game people go to when they hate World of Warcraft and want to put a middle finger to ""the man"" but don't understand that all they did was exchange one ""the man"" for another and this one is more okay with flat out ignoring it's playerbase."
Negative,"Updating takes as long as downloading the entire game again. Play is decent if not dated, but the community is... elitist.I forgot to mention the pay-wall for quality-of-life and overpriced micro-transactions."
Negative,"I purchased ESO and the ESO+ Membership but the game has been unplayable. It gets stuck on Requesting Login at the main menu after clicking Play from the launcher. Many people are having this exact issue. I've contacted ESO support through their main website and have been working with them to try and resolve this for over a week. There has been no resolution. I cannot even request a refund through Steam because it won't let me. It says I need to contact the game's support. I already did that. They can't help me either. What a waste of time, energy, and money. This has been the most disappointing Steam experience in my entire career of using Steam thus far. If this gains visibility, maybe something will be done about for everything experiencing this same issue. Leave a comment."
Negative,"Downloaded this because it was on sale, and a friend keeps recommending it. I have no idea if it is worth the money, because the game has yet to load a single time. It is fully installed, but when I click on the launcher, it starts to download updates and closes itself. I would think it was my computer if it weren't for finding several blog/forum/social media posts about the exact same issue for a couple of years now.  At what point do you realize there is an actual problem with your product, and find a way to fix it, so the person wasting their hard-earned money on it, doesn't have to try and play tech support fort themselves? I have completely uninstalled and re-downloaded the game twice now, to no avail. Wasted time, effort, and money. I won't be buying anything from this publisher again.EDIT:  Apparently this is a known, and frequent, issue with the Steam Launcher for ESO. No one seems to know if it is the developer's fault or Steam's, but they keep letting it happen and drag on for weeks. That tells me that neither one of them care, and perhaps I should quit giving my money to both."
Negative,"You can pick pretty much any MMO ever made and most things about it will be better than this game. The dungeon system is a joke, you wait an hour+ to get in a party just to get irrelevant rewards that don't make you feel much more powerful at all. The gear and skill progression is slow and boring. Most of your skills will only get better through gaining levels as opposed to getting gear, which results in a boring linear progression. Gear only slightly improves your survivability and your regular attacks which are basically just there for you to spam in between using skills. There is no trade chat or recruiting chat. Everyone just spams everything in the main chat (zone chat). The queue system is so bad that people actually just type random letters in the zone chat to request invites to specific dungeons. Overall, the only thing this game has going for it is that the graphics are amazing for an mmo. Everything is great to look at, but boring to play."
Negative,"It's so frustrating how insanely good this game is, but it is quite literally a shroud, one beautifully embroidered shroud!After a few months it's really gotten it's worth, it shines in a moment. It plays great with a controller, there is a ton of attention to detail in the graphics, there is a wide variety of mechanics, tons of skills, tons of abilities, tons of ways to interact with the world, tons of stories and Elder Scrolls Lore! (For an MMO it beats them all). It is mind boggling at times, and does seriously excel above many others in the genre/class.The cons are far more evil, and it seeps mostly against people that stick with the game. Which sucks because you'd think the most loyal customers should be the best treated, or at least equally treated.. (For the record I'm not super loyal)Con 1- Micro transactions: Necessary to fund the title. However, this games economy has a direct translation of in-game Gold to USD. This means, to some extent, you can buy your way through a large portion of the game, with actual money. Examples: Max craft skills, Max out research that should take months, Google meta gear/builds, order the best gear from players, fully upgrade all items, Always have the best potions/buffs on all the time. Basically, give themselves a rather massive advantage over other players in literal Minutes (after spending about a week 1/2 to 160CP maybe). Compared to the actual months, and years of grinding, for the working person. On a societal/marketing level, it makes it hard to define it as a ""fun video game"" at that point, rather a communal cringy virtual projection of wealth, like IMVU if you will.Con 2- Player vs Player combat: It is almost laughable some of the abilities that are copy pasted from generations of other mmos. There is plenty of lore content in the Elder scrolls universe to not have to copy the almost identical Charge|Rush Ability with the exact same sound effects from World of Warcraft! We have the exact same resources as in World of Warcraft PVP. Lumber Mill, Stables, Mine... So generic... this would be perfectly fine if it wasn't for another Con (continue)... Bizarre team vs team vs team variation that makes it feel like no matter what game mode, it's a FFA [free for all] I imagine adding a third team was the only moderately unique thing they could come up with, but it broke the whole experience really. It's very generally unplayable and I have yet to be convinced if it wasn't for the massive free XP Blob slapped on randoms with gear, it would be a ghost town, because it isn't enjoyable. Reward people fairly just for how much they actually do in PVP and it's guaranteed a massive percentage will never touch pvp gamemodes.Con 3- So Much but So Little: In the late game so much goes out the door in terms of abilities, skills, and passives.There is seemingly one or two viable ""builds""... with yet more than a HUNDRED skills/abilities/passives (Just less than a hundred being actual activatable skills!) Don't worry if you messed up your build, you can buy your way to fix with real irl money, or grind a ridiculous amount, then feel bad for thinking for yourself. In a... video game, maybe?Con 4- Unlisted Stat Ceilings: There are stats in the game not displayed to have a cap, and they will not go over this cap, but you cannot know what that cap is, if there is one.(there is no color change, labeling, or pop-up--zilch) Little explanations to what means what. Outside/Third Party research is required for pretty much all of it. ZOS even built a complete website funded by the players to make tutorials rather than have it in the game. What's really crazy, still the ones made by other people for free are better.Con 5- Mods: Mods are amazing and I will never be a mod hater, but in a game where so many pay on a monthly basis for the title, mods should not be required. To a very real extent mods are required or you will be spit on by more experienced players. Perspective that needs to be taken ---> a game that one pays monthly for, and requires the free labor of others unrelated to development company to make the game functional, should be generally frowned upon. (Mods are required to have a minimap, locations of nearly impossible to find objects/locations, actual PVE/PVP combat advantages of quick switching gear/with abilities, Tamriel Trade Center[TTC], if you plan on selling anything to anyone in the game. Much of it quality of life stuff that could've been fixed in the YEARS of development alongside PAID for DLC not included with a monthly subscription) Con 6- It's A SUBSCRIPTION Title: BUT It very clearly isn't treated like one by the company. You would imagine with a monthly, neh guaranteed income, that has a readable record mind you, they might act differently. With a name like Elder Scrolls, you'd think they would take the monthly income the masses very willingly pay them, to simply better their title in all respect where they definitely should. It's not even large asks, change the text line of the lumber mill to something else, display the stat ceilings. Perspective ---> how many $$$ millions does it take to change a line of text, there is still typos throughout the title. When does the consumer start valuing their monthly commitment? Over years for so many consumers...Con 7- The Reality: The company needs to be real and just tell the consumer they are paying monthly for new digital artwork, you aren't paying to better the title, you aren't paying anymore to better the mechanics, or fix BLATANT VERY VERY BLATANT ISSUES. The consumer needs to be told they are paying for a digital work of art, where they can display their real life wealth. Not a game, and I say this confidently because it's YEARS OLD the title already defined itself, and they've already had a chance to fix/implement life altering, generally game bettering, seemingly sophisticated text boxes.Con 8- Settings UI: Settings must be edited via a config file in the games director to fix games broken rendering mechanics (blurry everything, an issue relevant since launch in a years old subscription title.) The rest goes hand in hand with the mods section because mods are required to fix the UI and add missing settings options.Con 9- Blatant Spend Money Here Points: Every turn is a clear marketing ploy, I feel bad for anyone who majors marketing and plays video games. Every turn is a poke at you to whip out that wallet and get crowns to make everything more fun,  easier, and inclusive and and and, It just doesn't stop. If you're an Elder Scrolls fan, you're just clawing through the BS. A Tell Tale Elder Scrolls game with this level of story-line depth would be more enticing and less money grubbing. However that's what it feels like the company is selling, a Tell Tale title, They just need to be honest your monthly dollar is %99.9 artwork and voiceacting, not making the game better. With years of just tiny mechanics changes, that is so blatantly evident it's sickening.Con 10- Pay Wall: Everyone likes to say there isn't one, but there is. It wouldn't make sense to play/grind for the actual years it would take compared to someone who pays for sub. Not to mention there is a craftbag, a craftbag worse than Fallout 76s.I, personally, to get off topic, was far more excited for this ""game"" because of the company. Innovation and making great games seemed to be at the forefront. However, It very quickly turned to, if everyone else is doing it why shouldn't we. An age old formula that doesn't make for good gameplay, or good reputation, it makes profit for an alternative goal, and it plays on consumers psychology, emotions, makes great delusions of grandeur, and honestly, tricks people to spending money, without even being there.Will reiterate..  Perspective ---> how many $$$ millions does it take to change a line of textBut it's all okay... because it's the only Elder Scrolls MMO, and I'll probably still play tomorrow.July 2022 Update: All Still Valid"
Negative,"Combat is cool, game is rich with voice acted quests, if you are into MMOs and ok with subscription based gaming, you will have a good time with ESO+ which is how the game  is *really* intended to be played.I was hoping for a one purchase to unlock everything but even with all the DLC chapters listed on Steam some core functions like Thieves Guild and crafting storage are locked behind other pay walls/ESO+"
Negative,"This game Feels as though it should be a free to play game. After playing neverwinter for a few hours I was struggling to find any differences between the games besides the lore. The character animations are simply awful, thrid person mode is unplayably bad (Your crosshair must be Pointed at the target whilst the character is far to the side of the screen). The game is overprices as balls. You will be paying 'Witcher 3' money for what should be a free-to-play game.  So after paying around £50-£60 for this bad game you will then be offered microtransactions? Really Zenimax? Also the quests in this game are so predictable and linear. This game just acts as a leech to the elderscrolls series, it sucks the money out of the fans. This game does however feature a well designed world... credit where credit is due i guess. All in all I would not recommend that you buy this cancerus game unless it is at least around £10-£15 on sale (even then you are probably going to be dissapointed)PS- Most of the content you thought would be in this game will probably be a paid DLC."

Negative,200 of my 256 hours playtime is loading screens
Negative,Forcing me to write this review?
Negative,It should be Free To Play with all those microtransactions and DLCs. Look at Destiny.
Negative,"READ THIS!the game got a bad review because steam usually kok blocks your log in do not, DO NOT buy it on steam very often you wont be able to log in thru steam launched game and there is no other way to start it if you want this game go on the official page and buy the game there."
Negative,"game is unbalanced even for mmo standardsPvp part of game is laggy , and zerg or be zergedBattlegrounds are the best this game has to offer for pvppve content all feels the same , some cool boss fights but not many Microtransaction are disgustingly overpriced, with systems in place try and force you to spendfor a non free mmo , ex. cost 20+ bucks for full mount speed that isnt account wide or 60dayswould not recommendplayed this game off and on since release regret playing it everytime"
Negative,The game is really great. It's fun. But how they treat the servers is an absolute joke. Never in my life have I experienced something like this. Breaking the servers 2 times in a day. Good thing that most of the DLC's I bought with the in game gold by trading instead of giving them money. You can't support anymore a service like this. At least until they fix this problem.
Negative,"iv been a long term player of this game and have 5k hours + many many more on the launcher from the site outside of steam cause steam version was alwasy fucking up and atm or any point in the future i cant recommend it, if your only interest is endgame vet trials or dungeons then prepare to always get fucked by changes implemented by the small 3 man combat team who doesnt even play the game they implement changes based on the PVP community, they now sell skill lines they recently added a skill line that you end up leveling by just doing the main story this skill line cost $30 and the thing is the only skill that ""WAS"" useful has been nerfed into the ground no build will use it anymore so yeah that's the company you will be validating by purchasing this game,To make matters even worse, if you want an item from a dungeon drop, you have no control over what drops - you may have to run trials hundreds of times and just give up as others get the item you want but won't trade it. i have a good mate farm for an item for well over 3 years and in the end by the time he got it, it was no longer usefulso i highly recommend everyone stay away from this game its not worth italso the problems they don't mentions unless you go digging for them just so you buy the game, if your a player outside of America prepare to play with 300-400 ping depending where abouts you live i live in AUS on the vic border and the pings unplayable for anything other than anything that doesnt involve rp lolbugs that have existed since launch still exist, every patch they release and they do release alot of them they always break something, endgame trials usually are the ones to break and they remain broke for months a major bug that happened made everyones game crash on last boss on certain trials 12 man and dungeons 4 man,  and if you happen to be a pvp player with a beast pc well who cares you still wont be able to pvp without massive lag or pingseriously give this a game a skip the game is run by people who are just trying to milk as much cash from the sorry cunts that continue to play despite the problems that will never get fixed they dont care about the games performance status or the people that have remained loyal throughout the years if you were to hold your breath in wait of them fixing and making the game better you wouldve died years ago"
Negative,I've never seen so many disclaimers and things you have to agree to before playing a game
Negative,Community is awful! Everything is just a re-skin of something that's already been made in game 20 times! A BIG OLE MONEY GRAB!
Negative,"This game is incredible boring, go there do that, talk with X bring report to Y, search for whatever fuck thing, unless you re into the lore is boring as fuck"
Negative,Such an absolute dumpster fire. Pay to Pay
Negative,"While this game has a lot of wonderful, wonderful qualities. The customer service is a complete joke. For the longest time this did not effect me, but I promise you the moment it does, the entire experience will be ruined completely. When you get the automated ""Thank you for your support ticket"" you have to actually respond to it, or they will marked the ticket as resolved. Responding to this gives you another email, thanking you for your patience. This email must also be responded to. At this point, I was two weeks through fighting with it, to get a very bland ""we can't help you."" If you get the game and are a fan of Elder Scrolls, you will probably enjoy it, as I did. However do not risk crown store purchases."
Negative,"It's a terrible Elder Scrolls Game where you feel compelled to skip all dialogue to save time and be completely devoid of story because there's simply no risk/reward to the world and lore or meaningful choices. You'll feel as though you're just another pawn running in circles to kill something or get something without purpose. Just as you finally grind to CP 180+ and spend every waking moment trying to get ""meta"" gear, a new DLC comes out where ZOS makes it so your gear is now worthless to keep you in perpetual motion of once again not sucking. What is treasure today is garbage tomorrow; it never ends. Worst of all is we have somehow become numb to the idea of a clear bug in the game known as weaving is considered a feature to enhance combat. Literally if you don't pull off this obvious mistake in combat flawlessly, your DPS is too low and you will be destroyed in PVE and PVP. Guess ESO meets the definition of a typical MMO - a colossal waste of time"
Negative,"Before this starts - I do play MMORPG games, but I'm not in any way a hardcore player. I did my time with LOTRO, GW2 and Archage (with the most of the time spent in LOTRO).First of all, the narrative part is plain and dumb. Yes, you'll get all the information you need to complete the quest somewhere in those NPC lines.No, you won't get any meaningful story, somewhat worthy piece of lore - it's all about playing fetch from the start.Second would be the exploring part. While there were some nice stages to shoot my khajiita at I've had to travel there by foot, by bow and claw. I could've bought a mount for a mount of gold but why? That lofty sum of 40k gold is nowhere near obtainable until a decent time and real world money spent in the game, and I hate how devs force a player's hand to buy things. Third would be the economy, which is hypocritical at its best. On the bright side you can buy every meaningful piece of ingame content with gold, and hence that you would limit your real money expenditures. On the dark side you'll never get enough gold to buy desired ingame content if you do not spend your real money on the ways to get the gold (crafting access, dungeon DLCs, etc) first. So, why bother?Why bother with this game at all? I thought it would be something like Skyrim Online, but, alas, it's not. This is astoundingly mediocre game set in The Elder Scrolls universe, and in my case this isn't enough to move me to spend cash."
Negative,"Dishonest marketing to their customers. When I pre-ordered Blackwood, it wasn't known to me that the game for a mere 20.00 dollars more would be fully playable in their collector's edition. I spent 20.00 something back in 2019 for a game I never ended up playing, so I had everything they were offering, then a few years passed, never played it, came back in 2021, pre-ordered Blackwood, then realized I bought an upgrade, not a collector's edition, which meant I would be missing two packs which I'd need to fully enjoy the game, and now they want me to fork over another 80.00 dollars for said packs from their crown store. No thanks. I quit!These people sell collector's editions and upgrades. I mean who does that? They have their own terms and conditions in the realm of MMO gaming to the likes that I've never seen before and I've spent 20 years playing these games!You idiots got 60.00 dollars out of me for a game I don't play now, because you've made me mad now. You scammed me out of 60 bucks for 200hrs of dungeon farming in an MMO and your game is buggy, even though it's been out for at least six years now, even in the old content--it's buggy!Get it together folks.I pre-ordered your latest pack and you gave me something I didn't even want! Besides, your latest attempt at a six year old MMO is full of bugs too, so what should one expect, and you want a house, be prepared to fork out another 100.00 dollars!Dude, the prices here are higher than in Forza Horizon 4!Oh, you don't have all the content, subscribe to ESO monthly for a mere 15.00 dollars a month, but listen closely, it doesn't include the latest two packs for the game!I wouldn't have a problem with it, but you're literally giving the game to other people at a discount, and all I was trying to do was own all the content, so screw it, you made it impossible. Also, you want to do all the dungeons, fork out even more money for that too, it's not included with the packs, they have their own DLC for that too, and it's not what you think it's, it's a separate form of DLC on top of DLC."
Negative,They removed the 60 dollar Gold Edition of the game just so that they can charge anybody who bought it extra for the DLC.
Negative,Just doesn't feel like Elder Scrolls. Overpriced.
Negative,"Horrible console UI.Counterintuitive combat mechanics.Convoluted leveling progression.Atrocious server performance.Boring quests.Dated graphics.Buy to play demo.Subscribe to play game.Pay again to play newest expansion.Lootboxes, disgusting, overpriced lottery lootboxes.Horrible monetisation in cosmetics store.Thanks Todd Howard."
Negative,"I could write an essay over all the little annoyances that add up to me not recommending this game, but what really chaps my ass right now is the fact that I can't purchase Morrowind for $10 like new players can, I have to spend $40 on Crowns and buy it from the Crown Store :^)"
Negative,"Ok, I wanna start this off by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE this game. Combat is fun, crafting is engaging, the voice acting is top notch, decorating your own house is fun, side-quests are thrilling, the world designs and npcs are all so well designed. However, this game is going to try and bleed your bank account dry. Most of the world is locked behind very expensive dlcs, which when a huge part about this game is exploring Tamriel it makes that $15 to $25 price tag per dlc really scummy. There is basically a dlc for every province.  In order to buy all of map dlcs you need to purchase their in-game currency ""crowns"" which you can tell from the store page, aren't very cheap. Another thing is that it seems to me the dlc stories aren't very long at all, I breezed through Morrowind's rather fast, and that was on top of doing side quests and crafting. There is also a BAD difficulty curve in some spots just seemingly out of nowhere which isn't fair to the player at all. I understand that this is a MMO and the devs want some fights to require you be with someone but when the MMO is based off a long-running single player game series then maybe make those MMO style difficulty curves a bit less drastic. I will agree though that this is easily the most solo friendly MMO out there but just be aware of those difficulty spikes. Due to the scummy way they handle the map and dlc, I cannot recommend this game but if you really want this game, wait for it to go on sale so you can get it cheap."
Negative,Constant meaningless changes of core class mechanics from development team makes playing this game unenjoyable every content update. Don't spend your time and money here if you looking for great gameplay and not a cosmetic shop with home decoration simulator. It's a huge investment that eventually just doesn't worth it.
Negative,"I played this game for a while and really enjoyed it years ago. It stopped working after some update and then didn't work for years. I tried re-installing Windows, I even got new PC parts. I worked with their team to do all of the possible fixes to no avail. It did randomly work maybe a year ago and then stopped again a week later. Here I am again hoping it might work again but no. If I could punch this game in the face, I would."
Negative,"Eso really need to supply estimates in advance for when and how long servers will be down... i pay for two accounts (me and my girlfriend) and recently we have barely been able to play at all, compared to how much we wanna play. Recently the severs has been down every single one of my day's off. So right now im paying for things i can't enjoy.."
Negative,too much greedy microtransactions taking place of real content and rewards in this game. and it keeps getting worse. there are nice things about this game that you might enjoy but *it* will eventually get to you... i loved my time in eso but baby its time to move on to games that don't only have money on their mind
Negative,"[ENG] Tried to reinstall this game after many years of inactivity and see if something changed for good.Now i remember why i've completely dropped it.Bland, the graphic is bad, boring, is ripetitive and the developers are probably getting rich because the players are wasting money on this atrocity instead of spending it on some actual games. Or maybe heroin if they are so desperate.The game had a lot of potential, obviously wasted because Bethseda is Bethesda... nothing much to say. They have this gift to make bad games, and still have hordes of people that will defend them. Great job my friends!In conclusion: there are way better and valid MMORPGS out there with more contents, more accessibility and a way better development, don't waste time with ESO, the only good thing this game has are the very well made cinematics, nothing more.[ITA] Non buttare soldi su questa merda...P.S.Go play Guild Wars 2 <3"
Negative,only bethesda/zenimax can make you pay 60$ for a game and still lock most of the content and things that should be free behind a stupidly high paywall
Negative,If you are from India don't buy this game as there is no server support for indiai tried it and it was very laggy feels like playing with 400+ ping everything you do takes a 1 sec delay.
Negative,I regret every second
Negative,"Having spent so many years and hours in this game, it's now time for me to give it a negative review. There are two primary reasons for this; one is because of the stupid amount of bugs that plague the game and two is how they try to squeeze so much money from the player's pockets.With the bugs, there are just so many combat bugs that I have completely lost count now. The forum is always full of threads of people saying x isn't working properly, or perhaps block is broken in some way for however many times we can remember. Zenimax Online Studios even said they would spend a quarter of last year fixing bugs up in the game but that really didn't happen, or they just fixed bugs that were rarely triggered by players. There are a multitude of quests that are outright broken because of bugs and haven't been fixed even after being reported years ago.With the monetisation, holy moly has this got worse over the years. If you want one of the utterly-amazing-that-players-have-said-they're-annoyed-about-the-flare mounts, you have to spend something ridiculous like £100-200 on the loot boxes. The mounts they put up in the store for anyone to easily purchase are also pretty damn expensive for what you get with them, especially when it is often just a texture/colour swap. This I wouldn't really be bothered about, but the fact the flare caused by those loot box mounts when people use them? It just covers your entire screen with particles, bloom, and you always hear a loud sound with them. Then if you're following one in the distance, the game's optimisation is so poor that said mount keeps getting unloaded/loaded, and every time this happens, that stupid flare is played. There have been so many threads on the forum asking for us to be able to TURN OFF this from other people's mounts.There are many other little things that will eventually get on your nerves as well - how do you like large, flying pets from sorcerers getting in your way within towns/cities, having them flap right in your camera? This is yet another thing people have constantly pestered ZoS to provide a switch for, and has fallen on deaf ears time and time again. ZoS just basically never listen to the community - there's a lot of backlash from players who main certain classes like templar, which is just in such a bad state for so long now. Necromancer is another that is just terribly lacking and ZoS just outright refuse to do anything about it. Oh and while this doesn't really bother me personally, I fully understand why it bothers others - templar's  main attack, which is a holy spear, uses the skin of a 'spear' from a .. vampire clan. Not a good clan either, yet all the calls about this dating all the way back to PTS, have been completely ignored.The last part of that last paragraph just basically shows how little ZoS care for the lore of the TES universe. One thing that bothered me the most is that Greymoor, which is all about vampires and werewolves essentially, had just one unique line of dialogue to my character for being a vampire, and it was just that - a single line, within the entire expansion. Now I fully understand the whole 'vampires shouldn't tell' thing, but there was a regular basis that I was talking to other vampires and werewolves, and NONE of them made a comment of me being such, even the ones allied to you. This expansion was, in my opinion, the biggest flop of this game. The more recent expansions have been rather 'eh' to me as well, especially Blackwood and High Isle. They were just.. boring. Necrom was much more interesting, mostly because of being able to visit Apocrypha, but that's really it. The actual story writing is just so boring that some side-quests have been much more fun for me.The maintenance of this game is simply shocking, too. Very regular entire megaservers go down and you don't hear a peep from ZoS until hours after the first thread is made reporting issues - and it's often the European PC megaserver that has the issues. They take down the entire megaservers for hours just to apply a single 'hotfix', and the regular (usually every two weeks) maintenance can result in the megaservers being down for anything from 8 to *24* hours, as they end up extending the maintenance right at the last moment. During some expansion releases, such as Greymoor, they had to take down all the servers multiple times during the week due to very bad issues that made the game unplayable. When they did a free trial on Epic's game store last year, it was right in the middle of an event ingame, and oh my goodness did the servers crash from the strain. PC-EU basically completely shut down for the whole weekend because there were too many people trying to log into it, the queue system just didn't work at all.I have not renewed my ESO+ (the optional subscription) after having it for every month since summer-2016, and will not be purchasing the next expansion, having purchased all the others. I'm moving on from this awful game, and I am really glad I have.Update 2024-05-06: While ZoS have worked on fixing some bugs I did encounter, unfortunately there are new ones that break the core-combat and now they're deciding to go through with some really damaging changes to the way guild trader listings and mail work which they claim is to 'reduce database load'. It's more like 'we're trying to make even more profit', even though it's been a universal 'NO' from the ESO community. If you're thinking of trying ESO, I really recommend you go find another MMO to buy instead, or at least wait for one of the regular free-play trials."
Negative,Literally the most boring game i have ever played in my life. I cannot believe how bad this game is.
Negative,Everytime they update the game I am unable to play and have to delete the whole game and reload from scratch.
Negative,Can I use the F word? I really wanna use the F word right now. I can rarely play this game because I can NEVER LOGIN!!!!!!! F-word!
Negative,Only reason i bought this game is bcoz of my love for Elder scroll series..Story and voice acting is very good..But The Game is so boring..Idk bcoz of MMO reason this game has this boring combat system or what..I tried but I cant get into this game.. feels like in some aspect Skyrim is better..I didnt feel that emotion quite right I still feel during my Skyrim playthrough..Its 6\10 for me..
Negative,"I've never regretted the time and money I've put into a game more. It's always been a buggy mess, but I mostly looked past that because I enjoyed the story and the people I played with. One of the most frustrating bugs with this new release was one that would lock you into combat mode, even after combat was over, and you wouldn't be able to interact with anything unless you were able to get into combat again (and didn't experience the same bug) or log off and back on again. I get that we expect charismatic buggy messes from companies associated with Bethesda/Zenimax but it's just ridiculous. It's been like this for every previous expansion I've played and there's no sign of it changing.It's also hard to view a company well when it pays lip service to inclusivity but then holds an employee's healthcare hostage as well. Not the reason for my negative review, but it's good to have it out there in case anyone was thinking of playing this game and finds that to be a meaningful part of their decision to give a company money."
Negative,"I love how this game says it is only $5.99 but in reality is you wanna play with anyone it is $14.99 a month or over $200. There is literally no point to buy this game now, games like this are one of those invest early types."
Negative,"SHORT VERSION:IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PLAYING THIS GAME, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THE GAME ON STEAM — BUY IT FROM ZENIMAX. THE STEAM VERSION DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY.I am a veteran of MMO games from all the way back in the Ultima Online days. I am also a fan of the Elder Scrolls games. My negative review is based entirely on technical issues. This game should, honestly, be removed from the Steam store. There is a discrepency between Steam and Zenimax which makes my copy of the game unable to be played — at all.The error does not break game for every single person who buys it, but there is no reason to take the risk of wasting your money. After doing some research online, I found out that there are people who bought the game on Steam years ago and have never been able to play it. It is a well known issue that has yet to have been fixed.Buying the game from Zenimax separately and then linking it to Steam it seems to work fine, however.Good luck and godspeed."
Negative,"I bought this game on 10/13/2024, and after trying to link my Steam account with my ESO account, which is necessary to play the game, I received an error, and the accounts remain unlinked.

Negative,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THROUGH STEAM. BUY IT THROUGH THE WEBSITE OR ELSE YOU WILL NEED 174 GB FREE.
Negative,Bethesda cant cook anymore
Negative,"To unlock necromancer, after buying the base game for AUD$30,  you need to buy ~AUD$18 of not-vbucks (1500 crowns) and buy it in the not-vbucks store."
Negative,"It has bugs even when you're trying to create an account. Buy Morrowind.ZENIMAX MEDIA ONLINE PRIVACY POLICYCategories of Personal Information CollectedCommercial information: Includes records of personal propertyUsage data: Includes browsing history, clickstream data, search history"
Negative,"This is the first time Bethesda has disapointed me. I recommend to Bethesda, if you're listening. Don't let anyone else touch your work again. The graphics are fantastic like any other Bethesda game except the mountains around just look lazy. It's like the developers just didn't care. However (comma) this plays like any other MMORPG ever. I am not impressed in the least. Not only that but this game is EXPENSIVE. $60 for the game and then you have to pay more for DLC if you want to unlock Cyrodil and Orsinium. I'm giving this a 4/10"
Negative,"What a crock.  Played for fifteen minutes, got booted, then spent the rest of the weekend trying to get the game to work. Loads the game but will not load any character.  Keep getting booted back to the main login page.  No support due to covid-19.  such bull."
Negative,"the constant meta flipping every patch (as of the current edit, every week of the pts), has made this game impossible to keep up to date with unless you make it a second job. i wouldn't recommend unless you are already an established endgame player, in whichever area of the game you play in.do yourself a favor and play a game where the devs care about you."
Negative,"Elder Scrolls Online implented spyware into one of their latest updates and got caught red-handed. They then had the audacity to describe the integration of the spyware as ""unintentional"" and coincidentally all reviews that directly mentioned the spyware being used disappeared overnight. Shady stuff."
Negative,I do not recommend this game its good at one thing putting me to sleep boring bland and totally forgettable
Negative,"It is a great game, but I do not recommend purchasing it through Steam as it is experiencing fequent long lasting login issues.Get it directly!"
Negative,skyrim but worse in every possible way
Negative,Non memorable single player content. Dungeon exploration is bland and all about killing enemies. And pvp is about simming until you get proper sets and stuff.Doesnt feel like playing this game.
Negative,Made a new characterPressed the key to interact with a shopkeeperAccidentally stole an item next to themGot a bounty for 3 gold but have no gold because I literally just started 5 minutes agoGuard kills me and I respawnSame guard immediately runs up and kills me againMy entire character is now completely unplayable
Negative,"The game plays like off brand Skyrim. Everything looks and feels cheap and bland. If you are looking for more Elder Scrolls gameplay after Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim, this will leave you disappointed."
Negative,"so basiclly zenimax made dlc into standard edition so u can buy base game and dlc for the same ammount that other ppl paid for just base game, thing is they deleted dlc from steam store so the only way to buy is through premium store in game and it costs 3x more than standard edition on steam :) thanks guys from zenimax always thinking of old players not just new onesanyway wouldnt recommand it if u dont have friends unlucky"
Negative,"game is offline for steam users more than online , might aswell be a scam you pay for a game that takes a huge amount to download and then its offline unacessable for like 3 days straight , the games good , the service providing is just atriocious"
Negative,"If you're a fan of Elder Scrolls, you might get a kick out of this, but it's a quantity over quality grab at the MMO market, make no mistake. Pros: MMO mechanics are fineCons:  Disengaging combat  Poor story  Horrible freemium model  90's graphicsI'm glad I got to try this for free, otherwise I might have wasted my money some other day."
Negative,This is the best offline-servers-can't-log-in-good-for-nothing-game-only-a-useless-desktop-icon-simulator I've ever played before
Negative,It's just ... kinda ... boring :./
Negative,"Mediocrity incarnate. ESO is as 'fine' as a MMO can get. - It takes so few risks and runs everything so by-the-mill that the mediocrity turns to repetitive boredom.So much in fact that all old content and systems has been completely abandoned by the roadside. Furthermore the cosmetic system is a joke, with you only being able to unlock apperances by learning 'style pages' that drop randomly and rarely - so you do not get the apperance of any gear you collect.(And don't even get me into how horrible their 'justice / thieving' system is)"
Negative,I prefer things with more clarity. It may be my inexperience with Elder Scrolls games playing a factor. But I can definitely see potential. I have played Skyrim but I ended up with the same problem as here getting routinely lost and bored in the game and feeling disconnected.Due to limited time I have to play. Games like that need to rope within the first while to justify play and pay. The problem is this game really hasn't done that. Nothing against those that like the game. Its just something I am not a fan of. This is usually because bethesda games have free-form and other components. Which you could consider Ironic consider that is the type of D&D games I DM. Its just something that didin't grip me. Ilike enjoying the narrative of games. With WoW I had that. SWTOR I did too STO as well. But ESO I frequently loose it and while the lore can be interesting like fallout games is just not something I would purchase and play.As conclusion: I would say overall I find most of it ok and if you did like Skyrim or previous elder scrolls games you may like to play it. Its just for me having a lost sense in the game is something that disconnects me from the game itself. In the end really for me its just a game that was worth a try to see if you like it but nothing more then that.
Negative,"If you're looking for something just to play, solo mostly, and have nothing else going on... this might be a good game for you. You can get lost doing random stuff. The combat just isn't ""good"" to me. Attacks don't feel like they have weight and the spells I had up to level 10 just felt like they didn't have any impact beside a status effect on the enemies. I'll stick with modded Skyrim until a new elder scrolls comes out. I tried this game at launch and hated it. Tried it again 5 years later and while it's MUCH improved, at this point there is just too much going on to really pull you in. All well..."
Negative,"It's an MMO so I don't know what I was expecting, but it auto-aims, so everything from bows to staves to swords have practically the same feels to them.If you're one race and go to a province your race is at war with, you suddenly switch side and your own race starts attacking you. That means the game only really makes any sense if you're in the provinces your faction controls.It's addictive for sure, look at my hours on record, but not enjoyable IMO. I think I've played so much mainly cause I really want to go back to Tamriel and the mechanics on the other games are getting pretty dated and I've overplayed them all already."
Negative,"I have a lot more hours logged in this game outside of steam.I’ve been playing since beta, late 2013.The game has a lot going for it, as many others here can attest, and it has significantly improved since launch. But it has two glaring flaws that completely undermine its qualities which prevent me from recommending this game.First, the Monetization has basically removed much of what should be rewards for simply playing the game. As a terrible reward structure.For example, there are roughly 500 mounts but only 5% are actually available through gameplay. The rest are in the cash shop, and most of them are locked behind loot boxes. (Gambling)This game is B2P, has paid dlc, and an optional subscription. Yet it still has loot boxes. On top of that many of the items in the cash shop are overpriced.You can still earn the armor styles in game, but good luck on getting a mount to match your character. Some people have spent over $500 for the chance of getting the one mount they’re looking for.Otherwise, achievements in this game offer very little meaningful rewards and a few that do don’t look nearly as cool as what you can get in the cash shop. This is 100% due to the overmonetization.——————————————————Second, Overland, the moment to moment experience in Questing, is designed to let you win.The developers state that they made it to be accessible, but there’s a difference between “accessible” and “handing your victories to you on a silver platter”Any game gets boring when wining is a constant guarantee, with no risk or effort.Sure there is hard group content in the game which can be really fun. The Dungeons and Trials (Raids) are top notch, but that’s a small sliver of the game - and the average TES fan is more likely to be interested in Questing and Exploration, but they’re not going to find it nearly as thrilling or exciting because there is little to no danger in the map.There are world bosses and events that players get together to fight, but outside of that, nothing is a threat to you. Regardless of your level.No matter how much they hype the villain, it will always be disappointing because it has bare minimum mechanics and little risk to the player. It doesn’t matter how much you Nerf your own build, it might last longer, but the fight will still be boring and anti-climatic leaving you with the feeling of “That’s it?“It doesn’t feel like you’re playing a game, but rather you’re watching a visual novel.As a consequence of this design, there is a very little reason to actually learn how to play, people who try out the game come away with the impression the combat is boring because they have to play so many hours to get to any content that demands that they learn.There’s also little reason to play with other people - so it’s disappointing to those who wanted an elder scrolls experience with friends.It’s no wonder that players increasingly feel that the yearly expansions have stagnated in creativity because the combat design feels the same everywhere.it’s bare bones, basic, and most importantly - it’s designed to let you win."
Negative,"An ambitious and beautiful game that is crushingly dissapointing, no thanks to being terribly mismanaged by Zenimax behind the scenes. Elder Scrolls Online has frequent and game breaking bugs that are never repaired and a Customer Service team that don't care to respond to subscribers with anything other than dismissals and fob offs. If you pay the subscription you can expect little to no service. You will invest time and money and eventually find yourself tearing your hair out at the insanely frequent and frustrating bugs that the Game Developers refuse to address and repair. AVOID AVOID AVOID."
Negative,"Great game, but the developers' attitude towards players is awful. After the Necrom update was released, they disabled support for MacOS systems on Apple Silicon without any prior notice. I didn't receive any notifications. Suddenly, one day, I couldn't play anymore."
Negative,"Great you lost the whole Turkish market. Eso+ is even more expensive than world of warcraft now. Do you really think that we'd chose eso over wow? You only advantage was eso+ prices. Unlile some say, eso+ is esseltial for constant players. And you dare to raise monthly price +300% at a time. Your sales department consists full of interns? Sorry mate, your game was only good when there were no other options. Now time to go back to wow. Cheaper, funnier, less bugs, far better. Ciao, kisses, bye."
Negative,game ass new class not monk
Negative,"The game has to much server lag, glitches and bugs."
Negative,I'm afriad I just can't enjoy this. You have to pay a monthly subscription for inventory space. That's just the goofiest crap.
Negative,"look im not the biggest fan of this franchise and universe but this game makes every single land and town and area a crippled, shallow version of its former self, that you mindlessly run through back and forth to finish next and another soulless fedex quest... it makes me sad:-("
Negative,"There are a ton of upsides and downsides to this game. However, the whole ""write your own story"" phrase is misleading. The main story must be played in one of the alliances in the Three Banner War, and some races are locked to a specific one. If you want me to write my own story, then why are you restricting me in the character customization? There is a way to bypass this restriction, but it will cost you ($20 give or take a few).Furthermore, the main story clashes with the regional one by spoiling events. Plus, it mostly rewards you with the same things regardless of your decisions completely breaking the replayability of it. I didn't feel immersed unlike playing Skyrim, and it has to do with the game being online. I still play with my friends but no longer treat the game seriously.You can try it out (it sometimes goes on sale), but I wouldn't recommend it."
Negative,I’ve never felt so hurt.I’ve tolerated his gaming habits for the entirety of the relationship because I don’t want to be the controlling wife and I want him to be happy. It’s only the past 3 years that he’s come to bed extremely late. He talks about the game all the time and I let him indulge in his info umping.I’m set to go to the hospital on Monday as I might be close to delivering our first child. He said that his raid with his guild is on Tuesday and Thursday and he’s fighting the final boss of mythic and this might be his only chance to do it. The baby might be delivered next week.I don’t know how I feel about this or how to process this. I’m so afraid he will choose the game over us.
Negative,"I'll try to be brief. Here's a company that somehow manages to get players to pay box price for the game every year when another expac comes out. It's money-grabbing and deceitful. Not to mention all the little DLCs that come out on the regular. Meanwhile, they never seem to fix the things that have been broken the entire time, like: dungeon queues, queue'ing into battleground with only 3 team members and having to trudge through that dumpster fire for 15 minutes, LOADING SCREEEEEENS, myriad other oddities that have nothing to do with my internet connection and everything to do with server-side lag... the list goes on. And every time they patch the game this stuff just breaks again in new ways. It's beyond frustrating and I've had enough. Uninstalled."
Negative,"A game with a lot of potential.However, for a 20€ Game, plus an extra 60€ if you want the DLCs, you would think it wouldn't be littered with  microtransactions, freemium aspects and other predatory monetization schemes such as intentionally very limited inventory space, which can be overcome by a monthly sub of 13€. This is in an already paid basegame + dlc. And I notice this in just a couple of hours of gameplay.. i don't even want to think what else they have in there.... Basically they just create problems on purpose and then try to sell solutions...Scummy..."
Negative,I just uninstalled the the game with 7 months still active on my account. I just can't get behind the update coming in October with the DEI companions and the predatory monetization of the cash shop. Thanks Bethesda for helping me decide to not play your mmo. o7
Negative,"get kicked out for doing a quest in a dungeon, then get soft banned for 15 minutes for queuing to dungeoun too soon.scum playersscum crownshoppay to playashes... ashes.. take up limited space in your bag.devs openly admit to adding in ""filler"" to encourage you to subscribe to eso plus for more bag space that they chose to take from you."
Negative,What a boring pile of shit game this is lol. It even asks you to do shitty things like subscribing monthly for more inventory slots.
Negative,I wish there's server for Asia :(Because it's been lagging for me
Negative,"Save your money, not from the game, but from the micro-transactions.im still gonna play it tho"
Negative,"an ""unexpected internal error has occured."" The game doesn't work.Edit: It launches now but I'm stuck in the tutorial. Mfw the most buggy Elder scrolls game is eso. Also if you're wondering why I have 300 hours in the game it's because all that time has been downloading updates in the launcher.Edit 2: I have now had two more bugs that prevent me from playing. The first was ESO refusing to let me connect? the second is now whenever I try to update my pc freezes."
Negative,"Steam installed 100 Gigabytes data.Internal Update took ages.Lots of legal stuff to click thru.Login to server fails with timeout / random error.Checked out the helpsite help.elderscrollsonline.comIt has graphical advice on how to cope with ""unexpected error"".""Repaired"" my installation after having to fiddle around with directory name on file system.Problem persists.""There's only 1 internet company on earth that provides a Valid Internet Connection for ESO Servers. This is active once a year in a cave under the arctic ocean on a Tuesday in February at quarter past 4."" -- KilnerdyneSeriously?I can understand all the people who feel ripped off by having their chance of returning the game wasted by the updating process taking so long that they aren't eligible for return anymore, as in game updating counts as steam playtime.-1/10"
Negative,"Well, it's definitely an MMO. You pay upwards of $20 to buy the game and then immediately run out of inventory space, which they are happy to increase for you for $15/month. It's the kind of behavior that you expect from mobile trash that you play for a few minutes and then delete forever, but it comes with an upfront fee. If that's the kind of experience that you're into, then sure, you can swing a sword around at some stuff, I guess? You do a quest to escort a guy but ten other people are doing the same thing right beside you. You kill enemies and they reappear again in a minute. There certainly is a lot of content here, at very least, and it can be amusing to wander around and interact with random stuff, but there are better gaming experiences out there.Edit: Heh. Yeah, you know that a company feels sensitive about their monetization practices when they send someone in to regularly run interference when anyone brings it up."
Negative,"1/4 - Clunky is the right description of the gameplay. It is not acceptable. I cannot name any other action-combat MMOs that are this level of clunky. They may exist, but I never played them and I would not want to. GW2 is not this clunky. GW1 was not. DDO is not. This is an ESO thing and it's huge for people who are used to action-combat in an MMO that is not clunky. This has nothing to do with MMOs without action-combat.It's almost as if they melded action-combat gameplay with a low update WOW style architecture. It's gross.Unfathomably bad.GW1 is better than this.GW2 is better than this.LOTRO is better than this.DDO is better than this.Dragon Nest is better than this.Spiral Knights is better than this.WOW is better than this.FFXIV is better than this.Path of Exile is better than this."
Negative,"Its a good game worth the price, it've lots of quests, extra activities and events.But lately it have issues:- Servers Down- Bugs on game scripts (for example the guild store become unavaiable)- Parts of a  collectible with a free events; then suddenly you need to buy a DLC for for the last part of it.If you look for a decent GDR (you can play solo or group) its a good choice.But sometime you can't play it for a day or two."
Negative,"I like it... but I don't love it. I once played the ESO BETA, but there's been considerable improvement since then. I bought it when the Morrowind DLC became available and it was truly a trip to land in Seyda Neen once again. That was kinda awesome. The more I play it though, the more I feel like a piece of meat.What I like:++ Voice acted NPCs (...big plus with me! Not easily done in an MMO when voice acting costs so much and you can't redo voices easily.)+ Interesting, NPC-related missions instead of ""go get that and come back"" busy-work.+ Action-based combat requires you give premeditated thought to your character skills/build.What I hate:-- No in-game tutorials for basic features like crafting. (I still don't know how to fish and I have an inventory full of bait.)- No weight based inventory(+), BUT when you don't know how to do ANY crafting (see my prior issue) your 60 slot bag fills up very quickly.- MOST of the DLCs (Thieves Guild, etc...) are not available on STEAM anymore, so you have to pay full-price for old code AND you have to do it via the in-game microtransaction system.- I got kicked off the server once during a scripted event and had to redo it the next day because I couldn't log back in without getting a logon timeout error. My Investigation suggests this is a STEAM-specific issue, but that it's been around for a long time.And just between you and me, I think a bunch of the positive reviews from around 11/20/2018-11/30/2018 are a little too ""Bethesda PR / Definitely not a player"" reviews. I could be wrong...Thanks Bethesda, but I'm not gonna drop another dime on ESO until you make the DLCs cheaper and more accessible."
Negative,"This game rocks.Gameplay is very similar to Guild Wars, but the Lore is much more captivating. At least to one who has a long relationship with Elder Scrolls series.However, beware!Don't buy from Steam or use Steam to launch the game!Login from Steam is a joke, and seems to fail with connection timeout errors every other night.The issue has been arround for a few days by now, and still it doesn't seem to work, especially in the evening."
Negative,"Great MMO but just don't buy it through steam, you'll spend half your time crying about not being able to log in"
Negative,"Fuck,I am not wrong, I did not use any illegal plugins with cash transactions. Why would you be so stupid as to ban an account that's only been playing for two hours? I even finished the first task? I just used the Internet accelerator to make the game smoother. Did that violate any game rules?"
Negative,"If you like mmo's there are better ones out there that are free to play.If you were hoping for a new elder scrolls game to enjoy you'll likely be disappointed here.The monetization is predatory, designed to obscure the real dollar amount players spend for things like dlc or cosmetics. You will constantly be bombarded with ""quests"" and ""items"" that are actually just ads for dlcs you haven't bought yet. This feels like a skeezy mobile game skinned skyrim and is now trying to wear the tattered remains as a suit so it can sell you loot crates and the same re-skinned pets and mounts over and over again. Save your time, save your money, go play something else."
Negative,"Don't be fooled by this game's first looks. Don't be fooled on getting this game, merely because of TES lore, you will find yourself to be mildly disappointed, not only the graphics look outdated, the animation is still clunky, i've been part of the Closed Beta and plenty of free weekends, as much as people say game is changing and improving, its not doing its very best at that.Some can find it very amusing to play, of course, they paid for it and enjoy the atmosphere of the game, as i'm not elligible to receive a refund, i might come back every now then, to not totally ""waste"" my money. But, what was most disappointing to me on ESO, its the huge paywall for contents and some stuff that in most games would be considered a feature of the normal game, are paid in this game.Bottom line: If you want to consider getting this game, look for one of those free weekends, study on the game, look its pros and cons beforehand, see if they are to your taste and despite of all my ""rage"" don't be fooled to not get this game if you like it, just make sure to do some research, i hope to have helped either way."
Negative,"Don't get me wrong - the game itself is brilliant, especially if you're more TES than MMO fan, however nobody should buy it via Steam. The main reason why is because everytime when there is an update, Steam players are expiriencing login issues. Every single time! And for some reeason, Zenimax likes to perform standard maintenances and updates even during events and weekends. I don't have a demographic statistics for this game, but I'm pretty sure that mostly adults (such as myself) are playing it and due to professional and personal obligations, they have most of free time during the weekends. It's unacceptable for the game to be unavailable for weekends. I was thinking of becoming the subscriber, but being that I'm also a Steam player, I'll most probably never pay for ESO plus."
Negative,"This game charges you at  every  corner.  I want to love it, i really do, but the pay-walls just rip you away from the experience. Forget immersion with your grind, your money and more importantly your time is better spent elsewhere. Try Neverwinter (it's crazy similar to eso and free to play with a much smaller ""crown"" store)."
Negative,$40 on sale with Morrowind for a game that forces inconveniences on you at every turn just to waste time until you can finally get good enough to see the beautiful artwork they tried so hard to reconstruct. It's a goddamn shame because there's a fun game in there but the bodyguards of Lootbox Capitalism™ won't let you in to play unless you've digitally slaved away your time.Art in the digital post modern age is dying of Advert Cancer. Money over message. Toxic.
Negative,"DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY, THEY DON'T WANT IT ANYWAYS OR ELSE THEY WOULD NOT MAKE IT SO HARD TO PAY THEM.For 10 bucks and no subscription fee its an enjoyable experiance and has well written quests (as long as you consider ESO not cannon, which any true elder scrolls fan would) and tell some interesting stories.  Also since it is on a completly different engine than the main games, it actually functions well as a game.  Go figure.  But I can not recomend this game despite liking it mechanically because of greed.  Greed has ruined almost every part of the gaming industry, as a life time gamer I have seen it destroy everything it touches for over two decades.  And greed is exactly why I can not recomend this.  See there are more DLC's than just Morrowind (which is now included in base game) and summerset.  Two of those DLC's not included are the thieves guild and the dark brotherhood.  Literally all of the guilds associated with stealth, not to mention the two most iconic guilds of the series.  But aside from gutting these out of the game to sell seperatly, they have gone the extra mile to make it as costly to the consumer as possible to obtain these dlc's.  See you cant just buy them, that would be pro consumer, and AAA publishers hate that shit.  No first you have to buy crowns, which are the microtransaction Shitzo currency used to mask the terrible store prices.  Each guild costs 2,000 crowns, which would roughly be 17 bucks.  But wait, theres more.  You can only buy crowns in odd increments.  So for each DLC you either have to spend 14 bucks to get 1500 crowns, plus 8 bucks to get another 750 crowns to buy the 2000 crowns dlc, or you can spend 24 bucks and 8 bucks to get 3000 + 750 to buy both dlcs and in both scenarios you have currency left, and not enough to buy anything worth while.  Add to that equation loot boxes everywhere and you can see the problem."
Negative,"Maintenance, maintenance, maintenance. It's one thing to have to put out 15 dollars a month plus tax just to get ESO plus, on top of this I have to put out money each year for expansions that break the game again and again. Then comes the maintenance. Every time I try and play the game it's down for maintenance. It's one thing to waste hundreds of dollars, it's another thing to waste tons of time with maintenance when the game is still as messed up as it is and has been for years. While I'm going to play the game if I ever get the chance, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone new, it's too much money, too much time to invest, too much maintenance that never seems to fix anything and not enough positives to outweigh the negatives. If I hadn't spent so much money and time I'd leave the game for sure, but they have me by the balls so what can I do...."
Negative,"Don't get me wrong, it was good while it lasted but after the initial game it became clear their model for marketing. Paid DLCs that are overpriced. I have enjoyed every purchase of the DLCs to date but they kept getting exponentially shorter stories which is why I now wait for them to go on sale to buy them. I'm not here for the dungeons or the raids just the stories that Elder Scrolls is typically known for. Other games are doing a better job with story telling now to a point where I've uninstalled this in favor of other games."
Negative,this game sucks
Negative,After downloading 128 GB of game you are welcomed by a third party launcher and another 90 GB of update to download.
Negative,"I refunded this game because there is ZERO reasons why I should have to troubleshoot to play a game. It got to where it asked me to sync with Steam and I clicked yes/ok and immediately went to timed out message. I uninstalled and reinstalled the game as well as checking files for integrity. If they cannot even fix installation issue, why give them my money?"
Negative,"Where to start...I have had alot of fun with this game, spent so many hours doing everything the game has to offer, VET trials, Pugs, VET Dungeons, most of the overland quests through most of the DLC's. I also spent alot of money, and that is where my main issue for this game is. MONEY! they are after nearly every cent you earn, sure they made a few of the past dlc's free and available for FTP players, but that's after you spend $80 AUD roughly on base game with the latest DLC.Don't get me started with ""ESO Plus"", $15 a month for non recent DLC access and the craft bag.The ""Craft Bag'"" is essential for playing in the end game, getting in game money, and access to most of the crafting functionality.The ""Housing"" feature for ESO is also such a big cash grab. For $30+ you can get yourself a half decent in game house, that only has a limited amount of stuff you can put into it, unless you ofcourse spend more money every month with the ""Handy"" ""ESO Plus"" Monthly subscription, which doubles the amount of items you can put in your house.Anyway, that is my opinion of this game after over 1500 hours spent on it.Thanks for tuning in."
Negative,"Played 40 hours in the time I've owned this game.  I bought it back during release, played for around 30 hours, and immediately encountered a serious issue that persisted for almost 2 years now.  I had my account security comprimised, and ended up not having access to the game.  I finally, after this time, got my account back (Yes, it took them this long to verify it was me)  After logging back in, I played for a little bit 2 days ago, and had no issues, I was happy to be playing again, and seeing all the new stuff added in.Today, I encountered another, fun issue.  ""Your account does not own Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited.  Please click ""here"" to buy the game""  was the login error I got when I loaded up this fucking game. I went to make a post on the general forums post on the website, blocked, because my account is now being flagged with  ""Your account has been flagged.  Becomming active after being inactive for so long, please make a purchase to revalidate your account"" was the general gist of the error my account had when I logged into the website.  So now I'm here, to let you all know, to stay the hell away from this godaweful game, I'd prefer to buy NO Mans sky over this trash, and regret spending 80$ on it at the time."
Negative,"I like this game but I've never seen a game crash so ******* much!! Taking a wayshrine teleport? CRASH! Browsing a guild store? CRASH! Minding your own business in town? CRASH! Fighting a dungeon boss? CRASH! For this reason alone, I would say don't buy it and don't play it."
Negative,"I've lost track of how many times I tried to get into this game. It just feels ""off"" while I'm playing it. I know that's a really opaque statement, but I can't put my finger on exactly what it is. The fact that the entire game was designed to be played with a controller might have something to do with it."
Negative,I just bought this game 2 days ago.  Was starting to enjoy it then I learned when I wasn't able to log in for 15 hours that every single sunday ESO goes offline for steam users and some other users as well as just something that happens completely unscheduled EVERY SINGLE SUNDAY. Apparently the company has no concern with fixing this issue and I beleieve from what I understand they are going to court because they lied to a customer about it being steams fault? Great game though sucks I cant play it when I have time to.
Negative,"Ive played a fair amount of the game and its fun for a bit but it doesnt feel like elder scrolls. It is worse than wow, worse thand bdo, there are better mmorpgs, and better elder scrolls games, also i enjoyed tera more , 6/10 mmo, 2/10 elder scrolls"
Negative,"Combat is horrible, animations are not professionally made.Almost every quest involves a ghost or is a ghost story.No creativity.Game design completely misses the idea of class customization. I would not spend time on this game even if it went free to play. Bad developer Zenimax. hire new staff1/10"
Negative,"I'm enjoying lots of aspects of this game but the obnoxious they put into it is really dampening my enthusiasm.  Exceptionally poor design decisions such as terrible action bars with only 5 hotkey slots and you have to swap out, thanks for ruining my pc experience because of console limitations, no auction house (major one for me since not really anywhere to sell unless you go through a guild) lots of quests that are downright badly designed and broken, barely adequate group finder. If you are free to play dont craft, you wont have the inventory for it unless you sub.  Its like they have one fantastic designer and the rest of the time are unpaid interns or janitors dabbling in game design. Theres no neutral so Im leaning to thumbs down. If you are a patient gamer and willing to put up with the idiocy in the design you'll probably love it.  Me, well I like it but the obnoxious is overpowering my like for it and I suspect I will quit soon. Got my moneys worth though."
Negative,"This game has:- buy to play model- dying servers- payable DLC (which are absolutely identical to each other)- abilities that won't fire, you can smash your keyboard over your head- payable subscription (ESO+)- ping 300 which in real feels like 8000- payable in-game store (enjoy hundreds of same mounts being just recoloured and introduced as ""new""; shitty outfits, most of them shouldn't cost a coin tho)- devs who delete forum topics cuz its only thing they are able to do instead of listening to community and fixing stuff- ruined pvp- incredible amount of bugs that are not fixed for years- boring locations, quests, npcs, mobs, everything is totally boring and same ENJOY"
Negative,"In my 4 hrs of playing this my 1 big take away is that zenimax will spare no expense to shove microtransactions down our throats.  Anyone who thinks this isnt pay to win is stupid. You have to pay like 10 bucks so you can have a place to store your items. If youre going for any kind of crafting build those are a must have. Also subscription service for a ""crafting bag"" with unlimited space for materials. i genuinely dont see how thats not pay to win. Its signature money type is ""crowns"" naturlly those can only be bought using real money. Oh and cant forget about those fabled loot boxes. This game truly fills me with a sense of pride and accomplishment."
Negative,im not recommend this game if u live in South east asia. there is no asia server there.
Negative,Soulless game created for greedy executives to leech the life from the weak minded.
Negative,Why pay $59.99 for a game when you can pay $109.98?
Negative,"games are greatbut dont buy this games trough STEAM, use ZOS instead, i got ""unexpected internal error"" since last update. until now cant login... but my other account from ZOS can."
Negative,"my ""playtime"" is nothing but trying to be able to login, I have sent 6 emails to customer support tried countless message boards to try and figure out how to solve this but even customer support is no help and honestly too incompetent to help. let alone waiting a day for them to reply when its 4 days left in a free trial phase ( i maxed lvl'd on ps4 years ago so i know this game but i cannot link my account and play, hell i cant even make a new account with a new email and play). ill find some other mmo to play cause this game is pathetic at even attempting to address a issue even after me trying for 5 hours."
Negative,"What I Liked It seemed bug free and played how it was supposed to do. What I Did Not Like Grouping is wonky, which is the point of a MMO.The gameplay isn't bad, but doesn't really feel that deep either.  But I'm coming from experience in so many other MMOs.  It just feels generic.  A generic look, feel, and gameplay.  There is nothing that stands out. Why I Stopped Playing I know I don't have long in the game, but I just can't get into it.  I know it's not supposed to be an Elder Scrolls single player game, but they tried to pull that off and it just doesn't have the same look and feel.If you want an Elder Scrolls game, play the single player.  If you haven't had much experience with MMOs this will probably be a good one. Disclaimer I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!"
Negative,"I do really like the game and a lot of the systems..  Except one.The ESO+ Crafting bag sets Plus and Non-Plus players apart so much.  If you don't have a sub, it discourages crafting, and wastes the time and resources of non-subbed players.  Not to say the game is unplayable, its just a lot harder to do anything crafting related.  Mind you, crafting is used for Armor and weapons, enchanting, creating Housing furniture, jewelry, alchemy, cooking, and some others I might've forgotten.This is really my only gripe, and once this is corrected, i'll change my recommendation to a Positive review.Edit: Just typos"
Negative,"the game is fine, you can have a lot of fun and decent (but running style) PvP. Gear system if very reliable. Locations are not enormous but huge and really looks nice.So why not? Boring NPC and quests and there is a lot of them. Public dungeons delves and dungeons mostly are extremly repetative. Leater on is harder of course and better. But that's not the main problem for me - it's time wasting. All this door opening, craft between two or three locations behind doors of course, not to mention city planning which is cute but you will spend to much time to get what you want. There is more of it sadly. So if you count your time - don't come here or at least not for a half of the year eso plus :)"
Negative,"Assuming you can get passed the broken launcher, I haven't been able to play in weeks due to never getting passed the game launcher because I have to constantly repair it just for it to fail once more.All in all the games good when everything is new to you. Was fun for the first 100 hours, essentially it's enough to get you hooked and enjoying the world of tamriel.but after this the same dungeons over and over again followed by quests where you need to travel half way across the map to warn some dude and he'll tell you to go back and tell the dude ""ight bro i'm warned""To fully experience this game you need to purchase the DLC that's released or ESO plus. pretty much everything in this game involves the purchase of crowns, aside from the first half but trust me I'm sure you can decide if the DLC is worth $60"
Negative,"The game was fantastic.  The customer support could not possibly be worse though.  I purchased the game a long time ago.  When I tried to return to the game it says that it is linked to some other steam account and although I have sent 5 messages to the support team to try to regain access to ESO, I have received not even one reply!!!  It's terrible that I would have to give this game a ONE star rating!!!  Best game in the world with the worst customer support team just can't exist together.  I do hope that someone at ESO reads this because this is a true shame.  Would I recommend this game? NO.  Don't waste your money on something that has absolutely no customer support!"
Negative,its shit lol
Negative,"There is an overwhelming amount of microtransactions which takes the fun out of it. Real gamers who prefer working for their items are left out as there is almost nothing worthy to grind for. Almost all mounts, pets and other unique items in the game are bought with real money (crowns). Though it does have a great atmosphere and decent combat, the game holds your hand way to much and the general gameplay isn't much of a challenge. It's very sad to see a game with such potential and of a beautifull franchise, be so tainted by greed."
Negative,"Reported a bot for farming & another person reported them, came back next day its still there. Not like botting is unfair & ruins the economy or anything.... Shameful the amount of bots they allow, makes the game feel cheap & unfair."
Negative,"This game has possibly the worst support i have ever seen. I bought this game and the marrowind upgrade, spent hours downloading it and updating the patcher. Just to FINALLY get into the game, i create my character and so far so good. Then, i load into the game world and for what ever stupid reason the camera constantly spin to the right or up whether or not im even touch my mouse which is very annoying.  I log off and attempt to google my problem which resulted in 2-3 year old posts, none of which even worked. Then i decided to try a different mouse, still messed up. Then i thought, hey lets go to their support site surely i can find an answer to my problem on the official site. NOPE, there was one result again neither of which worked. I looked for hours for a customer support line or even an email. I am sure i probably over looked it or something because i never did find it. All and all i actually played the game less than 20 mins if that. So i tried to go get a refund  on steam. Well guess what!? because dumb ass steam can't seem to tell the difference between a patcher and a game it says i've played it for 5 hours which i can assure you i most certainly did not!! Because of that stupid patcher registering as time played i missed the two hour mark and there for can't get a refund."
Negative,"I've been playing for a few years, given that This is the Elder Scrolls content we have/had until that mythical Elder Scrolls 6 comes out, and I have watched in almost real time as the quality dipped, and dipped, and dipped. Base game had things that annoyed me, but I could ignore them and keep playing. Craglorn had many things that annoyed me, but it's a hollow zone anyways and I kept playing. Wrothgar was amazing. Vardenfell was decent to annoying. Clockwork City was interesting, if predictable. Summerset was insultingly bad. Greymoor was insufferable...And each time, the real-world politics kept getting more and more in-your-face. Update 44? We have now reached terminal cringe."
Negative,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAMI have bought it only a few days ago and I have already experienced 2 days where no steam user could login because of reasons the support team won't tell us: they keep investigating the problem but it keeps coming up. Needless to say most of us are fed up
Negative,"Short version:Utterly generic MMORPG - ripoff with questionable technical implemetationLong version:I love Tamriel. I spent hundreds of hours in both Morrowind and Skyrim. I just started another playthrough in Morrowind, and I still love it, it feels immersive, interesting, thrilling, fascinating, soothing, deep, aesthetically pleasing (especially with the fantastic overhaul some dedicated fans provide).Memorize these adjectives. Pretty much sums up what ESO is fundamentally lacking. Not only in comparison to ElderScroll games, but even to contemporary games in general. Including the shoddy low- budget end of the market.I consider it quite a feat to achieve this, given the vast story background of the Tamriel Saga, and the fact that ESO is set in an age not featured yet, but where decisive  events for the history of Tamriel take place. To take part in them was a main reason why I let myself be persuaded to purchase ESO. Ok, it´s an MMO, and I am more the SP-type, but could be interesting, just ignore that the maps will be flooded by tourists.I never thought i could be disappointed by Tamriel to that extent that I am now.I installed the launcher. It then told me that I am to download and install the actual game. Which is a whooping 60GB (!) download. With installation time to match. Installation broke. I validated the game files...and DID IT ALL AGAIN!Ok. Next weekend. Now we are ready.Character customization: really great, stunning graphics. Big anticipation. I spent the better part of 2h building an Argonian that looked exactly like I envisioned, and fit his fictious vita: a grizzled, aged veteran, witch some scars and a serious paunch he collected over the years. --SPOILER: Now I spend my time mostly under my first self-assembled helmet, that does not fit the character model at all, is way too big to be of any practical use, covers most of the areas I spent time on designing, and, frankly, looks like a boiled-leather pisspot that I, I realized, won´t get rid off any time soon.I searched the forums for a way to supress the model (possible in many games), and I found serious discussions by ""veteran"" players against the opinions of newcomers like me, arguing that such a feature would be ""unrealistic"". In a fantasy game soaked with magic. ROFL! guys.....come ON!Ok, so now here my proud, stout Argonian battle veteran roams Tamriel: Two pathetically blinking lizard eyes under the shadow of a boiled leather thundermug. Looking like he was very recently bullied HARD in the schoolyard, or is a very enduring elder sibling. But anyway...oh well, what the hell, MMORPG, I was prepared to put up with stuff like this.--I started the game. I was spawned into some kind of hellish dungeon, and, without explanation, singled out and picked up by a strange, rather good-looking (considered the location, and the fact that we are dead), if somewhat grimy, Nord woman to embark on an enigmatic, mostly unexplained tutorial mission that turned out to be absolutely nonsensical to the point of hilarity, and became crowded with utterly clueless folks till the end. Ok, hey, tutorial mission. We all gotta start somewhere, and it IS hard to make a tutorial mission somewhat immersive and non-generic...well...first fail here.Ok, we get spawned into the REAL Tamriel...and nothing changes...the game stays the same...generic, nonsensical, devoid of any motivation to start climbing the near-inexistent learning curve. Where ElderScroll-Games had an intricate system of object properties to explore, experience to gather, character skills to develop, that really changed how the game felt and how you would behave in-game, ESO is watered down to a point where the RPG in MMORPG isn´t even fun any more: Whereas in other games, you need a specific set of materials, to built a piece of equipment with somewhat unique properties, in ESO, any object from a class requires the exact same materials, and styles are merely distinguished by a special ingredient you have to buy or loot...but then again, styles don´t make sense anyway, as the objects have comparable properties across the styles, and you can wear what you like (or loot).You learn by buying or reading books. Point. Ya, right... not much incentive to actually play the game, is there?Battle experience is used to unlock some nifty moves. Not like, getting more efficient with certain weapon types. Noooo, nonono. Nifty moves for your quick-draw.Quests and missions: OMG. This is it, I think. That broke me. I can´t play longer than 2h, or else my brains start seeping out from my ears and nostrils. Some start nice, like a wife being distraught over her husbands disappearance. Then you follow the family dog (nice move, but, like, couldn´t she have done that herself?), around the corner of the barn, and there is someone severly injured lying on the beach a few yards away. It turns out to be her husband, who tells you a horrifying story about how he almost died several times in the last few hours, and on your question how you might offer help, answers"" Thanks for talking to me"", jumps to his feet and RUNS HOME, to a wife who doesn´t notice...Most are the generic usual: Get quest, rush there, encounter hordes of low-level, unmotivated  enemies nobody warned you off, rip, snarl, tear, pounce pounce pounce, loot, bloody loot, there is the marker, stand in line for your objective to respawn, press ""E"", done, off to the next.....what was it, we actually did there? errhh..no idea, doesn´t matter.No, it really does not matter, because the assignments I so far encountered where invariably so generic, nonsensical, uninspired, daft and shallow, I quickly stopped reading and listening, because it HURT, even more so as I was in actual bloody TAMRIEL, the continent and history of my dreams! At times even preferable to my everyday life. Down to history, politics and religion.Ah, politics, yeah. There was said to be some grim civil war between three (nice move to avoid the black-and -white scheme, btw. If it only worked...) factions unfolding. Well there are some sinister figures lurking around, with clearly evil  intent, that we must protect our citizens from, and occasionally slaughter for the greater good (ours). Thats it. We: good guys. Empathic, caring, in danger of loosing home and loved ones. They: Evil, greedy, sinister, brutal. To be killed on sight.What a bummer, compared to Skyrim or Morrowind, games that regularly made you second-guess your loyalties and morals...There was said to be some consequence to your choice of loyalty, but that apparently vanished. Most guild memberships appear to be restricted. Ok. Guilds that merely exist to trade collectibles, or stand around and chat. Ok, here my being an SP-type shows: I can´t seem to get the hang of MMO-guilds. Never did. I am interested in the games. And in people sharing interests with me. 2Mio folks on the server is just an anonymous mass I can´t connect to, not even in the confinements of a 3k-ppl-guild of folks i don´t know, and probably never will meet, and of which ~98% are way too far up in the game for me to actually play WITH them. As in, ""together"".And I really enjoy figuring games out by myself, and not being told at every step what the most efficient (stats-wise or creds-wise) next move is. That apparently makes me antisocial in extant MMOs. Fair enough.29h into the game, and it still does not feel like Tamriel.It feels like a rather nice texture mod applied to the popular first part of an MMORPG by NCSoft. Except that there the missions worked, and the story line, albeit shallow, made sense somehow.If you play MMO as a chatroom with facultative farming if nobody talks to you: give it a try.I wrote this while doing a complete (!) re-install, including 13GB-fix for failed files after moving my steam folder. I´ll keep on searching a game worth playing in ESO. Check my comments for added insight."
Negative,"The support on this game is so so so bad. I have never experienced such poor support from any game I'v played. My character was gone, washed away from the server and they never resolved this issue. This is how they keep 'responding' without helping:---- Response By (Chet) (11/14/2016 09:55 AM)Greetings again,We are currently experiencing very high ticket volume and we apologize for your long wait. We value your patronage and are doing our best to respond to each customer’s issue.If you still need help from an agent, please reply to this email so that we may continue to assist you.We apologize for the wait and thank you for your continued patience.Warm Regards,The Elder Scrolls Online Team---- Customer By (Patrick Leijte) (11/13/2016 10:26 AM)Oh come on now. Is this really the common ESO support? Only repsond by saying that I have to respond back, two times in a row!I was patience but now I had it. I'm going to delete this game permanently.Thanks for nothingConclusion:Make that three times in a row without any help!"
Negative,"This company should refund me my money. They sell all of your information to other companies! I paid for the full game and expansions and you still don't get all of the content, that's only $15 extra a month..Customer support is so slow. They put everything inside of the Code of Conduct to allow for them to delete your account at any time without notice. You'd think you'd get a warning first but nah, straight kicked out. New users beware of naming your character. A short list that's not allowed are African, Hispanic, Indian, European, American, Boy, Girl, Female, Man, Woman etc!I have a duty in life to not support weak sauce companies like these that are running it like Tyrants. Companies  like these should go away like the dodo bird imo for a better world period. You're either part of the problem or the solution and it's easy to see what this one is. They are total hypocrites"
Negative,The inventory space for crafting mats being tied to the eso + sub is scummy as hell.
Negative,Would be a good game if there wasn't a paywall for everything you do.
Negative,Pretty mediocre.  Skyrim with some mods is a much better investment in time and money.
Negative,"Great game story and system, if you want a casual MMORPG play with your friend, it's okay, If you want enjoy its PVP and most trial system, you better consider your region, the unsufferable lagging may ruin your game."
Negative,You know - i was craving an old-school MMO (tab target mmo) and reinstalled this despite not playing it much when it released.Then I saw they added a new character to the game to lean towards the wokies.Immediate uninstall.
Negative,"Played it for a free week. I found the graphics and visuals to be lackluster. Greys and greybrowns and greygreens.I found the plot to be an Elder Scrolls plot, but generacized even further.One selling points was that the game was supposed to let you roam free, but I found this no more or less true than any MMO. You can go anywhere, provided you avoid the attention of beasts twice your level.The game does let you just murder and steal at will; I would frequently walk into a tavern to find each NPCs corpse lying on the floor near their recently respawned bodies.The bounty/theft/thieves guild mechanic sort of intrigued me. Essentially, being seen stealing activates an automatic bounty increase? At some point, guards will attack you on sight, forcing you to avoid city guards, using secret paths and hidden passages, but each city is so filled with other patrons it's impossible to see guards coming. They simply materialize from the ether, psychically knowing all your crimes.All over the game is a boring run of the mill MMO experience with nothing to speak for it. Fetch quests, etc.If you really love the Elder Scrolls universe, to the exclusion of all else, this may be your cup'a. For anyone else, I'd recommend trying out many of the other free MMOs out there. You'll get the same experience from any of them, from the newest to the most broken. Neverwinter is a free direct competitor here. Warcraft and Warframe are leagues ahead of what this wants to offer."
Negative,"Purchased game to play with the SO, tried to link my steam account to the ESO account they make you create, due to some database error on their end it has now been two weeks without being able to play, and customer support is telling me to log into the ESO account with an account that doesn't exist to be able to play my game, after a couple of canned responses not even addressing my issue.  Would not recommend, experience so far has been all hassle and 0 hours of gameplay."
Negative,"Launcher doesnt work, cant play the game"
Negative,I purchased the new Digital addition on their website $101.86 on the 25th it is now the 29th and I have the reciept and still CANNOT ACCESS ANYTHING!
Negative,"This game has no soul! If you are a MMORPG lover give it a try, but if you are someone who want to play a good game ... just waste of time."
Negative,Doesn't feel like Elder Scrolls at all. Game sucks
Negative,They ruined the setting with multiverse stuff.
Negative,"This review is not about the game, but about buying it through Steam.  For whatever reason, fairly often people that bought the game through Steam cannot login or play.  Often this is a weekend day and goes on for 4-6 hours.  Lately it has been happening about once per week!I recommend if you are going to buy this game, buy it direct instead of through Steam...As a side note, I do enjoy the game.  It is a lot of fun."
Negative,"Played a bit, might delete later.Tbf game is nice for casual players but when it comes to anything hardcore, whether pvp or pve, it is totally shunned by ZOS. This is mostly due to lacking content (e.g. competitive pvp) and persisting performance issues."
Negative,"Zenimax ""Accidently"" put spyware in to the latest patch........I dont care if it was put in there ""Accidently"" or not, what the hell where they even doing with it in the first place?If its not intended for This game, its intended for a different one....Though more likely they ""Accidently forgot to hide it properly"" Uninstalled, and recomending to everyone I ever meet again to avoid this shady company."
Negative,Don't bother buying this game through steam. Every week there's an issue where you can't log in and the devs don't/can't bother to fix or communicate with the playerbase about this issue. It takes them about 12-20 hours to fix it each time. I usually don't leave negative reviews but right now I'm doing it out of frustration because this happened 2 days ago.
Negative,"The questing is good and the dungeons are fun, yet the combat is bland and boring (there is no hit confirmation for hitting an enemy with a two handed hammer...no reaction whatsover). The limited amount of skills in the game guarantee that everyone does the meta. The world feels so empty and does not give you reason to go and explore."
Negative,"Elder Scrolls Online feels like a mobile game with the amount it tries to squeeze money out of you at every opportunity. Want to change your hair to one of the other default styles? That'll cost ya 1,000 crowns. Want ONE extra character slot? That'll be 1,500 crowns please which is the entirety of the amount they give you to play around with per MONTH with a premium membership. (For reference: 750 crowns is £5.99)Just save yourself the effort. It's a pretty good MMO but it's just ruined by the stingy developers spitting in your face at every opportunity. I'm sad to say that I've bought this game on three separate platforms trying to scratch the Elder Scrolls itch and each time I haven't learned from my mistake.Sure, you could TECHNICALLY not pay anything but you have to spend the entire game fighting off all their shady psychological tactics to get you to spend more and barely get to cosmetically customize your character at all which is a massive aspect of these MMORPGs. It's just a hostile, anti-consumer environment and really sullies the Elder Scrolls name. I'd be embarrassed to put my name on something like this if I were the developers."
Negative,So this is one of those games that could have been fun could have been great.  However the devs made the mistake of FORCING PVE players to go into pvp areas.  The pvp is filled with trolls campers just in general annoying people.  The devs needed to get people to pvp because most pve players can't stand pvp the numbers of pvp players was to small because SHOCKER people don't like pvp!. So they add this lead you need to get for a chest item that drops in the pvp area trust me you wont get it because its just filled with A holes that you cant even damage because all they care about it pvp and want to rip open the pve players that are forced to go there for that item.  This game in my opinion shot itself in the head forcing pve players to go into pvp.
Negative,"I installed this game a few years ago, played it for a bit, then put it on a shelf to play later. I come back this year and try to play it again, only to find that it has completely broken and I am unable to even launch it. The Steam version doesn't even come with a launcher at all; instead, it launches some kind of proprietary installer that I surmise is meant to install the actual launcher, but which simply throws an error message when I try to run it. The solutions given on the ESO help pages don't work; apparently, many other people are having the same error, but nobody on the forums can even agree what the problem is or how to fix it. Guides that claim to have the solution are many years out of date. I've spent the last two days trying to figure out how to make the game just give me the launcher, and Bethesda's technical support have been staggeringly unhelpful. Until such time as Bethesda decide to actually fix this critical, game-breaking error that's apparently been preventing many users from playing since 2015 if not earlier, I will be staying away from even attempting to play this game, and I urge others to do the same."
Negative,Everything is locked behind paywalls and the animations look like a 2000's mmo.
Negative,Couldn't start the game on macos. When I asked for a refund it showed 46 hrs of gameplay when it was not started once!
Negative,"a gamethat is buy to playthat nags you to pay for subscriptionthat asks you to buy expansion (where aformentioned subscription was supposed to cover all dlc's, let's never forget that one)that has in-game shop with vanity microtransactionsthat ALSO sells you lootboxes."
Negative,"There is a fun game here, unfortunately the steam integration doesn't work.  Steam users are second class citizens.  You can't even login to their forums to report when issues arise, which is entirely too common, and it seems often specific to steam users.I can't recommend giving them money for this."
Negative,"The reason I'm giving a negative recommendation is because of how dull the game is 90% of the time. A big chunk of the game is referred to as ""overland"" content, which refers to PVE questing. The stories are actually pretty decent, very well voice-acted, and the environments are beautiful. Unfortunately, the combat bores me to tears because of how easy it is. There's absolutely zero challenge. If you google ESO, you'll find tons of threads with people complaining about the difficulty, and fanboys defending it because making the combat challenging would ""break their immersion"". In short, the overland combat may as well be a podcast. It's so damn easy that you're almost never in any real danger. I won't pretend that I've tried everything the game has to offer. I played a few dungeons, and while they were more engaging than the standard content, the low-level/low-difficulty dungeons were still fairly dull, but were also way more rewarding than doing story content. On top of that, most PUGs just rush through the dungeons, so you don't have time to even read the dialogue of the dungeon's quest before they all collectively decide to aggro the next group.In short, I find myself at a loss. I want to enjoy the world, but the combat bores me to tears. I enjoy the dungeons, but they feel hollow compared to the overland content. If you're joining dungeons via the activity finder, then you're just being dropped into a random dungeon with zero context."
Negative,"I had a play of Elder Scrolls Online over the weekend. It was great to see the Morrowind island in glorious 4k high-res textures, with creature models having polygon counts in more than single digits. Vivec city looked awesome with the draw distance that doesn't fog heavily after 10 feet.Wasn't really a bad game, but it didn't really progress much beyond a ""slightly faster Skyrim Arcade Edition"".Like a lot of MMO games, they really don't provide any details for store items to explain what they are selling and how it affects the game. This attitude is repeated through the game interface where there's nothing to explain many of the crafting panels, why you can't use something, or what you need to do to unlock a feature. The inventory tabs need to filter by craft and not dump 90% of your goods under ""ingredients"".Even the wiki is useless in most cases, as it tries to confuse all of the previous games onto the same results page and is either missing a lot of entries or just doesn't give you any useful information on how to use items.6/10, and thats all for the pretty graphics and game engine.I'd recommend taking a look while it's free to play, but only if a 80 GB download and some technical setup issues doesn't bother you. If you have to pay a monthly subscription for this, I'd recommend getting one of the offline games and an updated graphics mod."
Negative,"Boring, repetative quest after quest with the whole system of ""Get me that book right there"". Does not feel like you are doing anything for a real reason but just to do quests. The over the shoulder camera is the worst part. There is no fix for this aside from playing zoomed in all the way which is not how I want to play an MMO. There is no auto attack for basic simple attacks so you have to constantly be clicking the mouse/keyboard nonstop making it feel more repetative."
Negative,"Trash game. I belive they made this game just to bring in more money w/o doing any real work.Graphics: They are ok, if they game came out in 2012.Gameplay: Have you played GW2? Its like that, but worse.Crafting: You can craft anything and everything, but you fill up your invetory before you even get a change to craft. Also Your banker is on the ofther side of the map, no where near where you craft items, and the banker is in its own cell. You have to port into a new cell just to get something from your bank.Look: Its looks childish, nowhere near what I was expecting from the an Elder Scrolls game. You toom runs like ""Forest Gump"", its goofy AF.I tried playing this game again, no, just no. I uninstalled this game again after in my first 15 lvls.IMO there are no ""good"" MMO's. This genre is dead and ESO is helping with the that.I do not recomend."
Negative,"This game is fun, but not good enough to be a subscription game. - ""But the game is free after you buy the game itself!"": Yeah, 1/10 of the game is free after you buy it, when you look at the map, you are allowed into a extremely small portion of the map unless you either subscribe or buy the content: You cannot disassemble/craft jewelry (3 out of 10 item slots): Your storage is halved if you do not subscribe, in a game of hoarding, that is a big deal: No way of buying ""Crowns"" (premium currency) for in game currency or achievements, not even in extremely small amounts. So even after paying for the game, you have to either subscribe or pay 50-90$ for the DLC'sAlso, the loading times are incredible, during the free weekend they apparently turned on the afterburners, my PC was the limit on the loading screen, but after that, i've experienced 5-15 minutes loading screens, and dungeon queues are even worse (30 minutes +)The game is good, and fun, but wow, do they hate players who ""Just"" bough the game"
Negative,"Paid £75 x2 once they took the game off subscription only. Release the gold edition with no thought to the people that supported that previously stated decision, via paying £75 a copy. Had i bought this for £20, i would have no problem with it, i even didnt have a problem with the sales etc, as that was expected, but this gold edition is a step too far for people like us who supported them with a very large investment, leaving us with less content, than people who pay half as much now, as we did back then............. Personally if i were them, i would of spared a thought for those people, who disagreed with the forced subscription, but, stepped straight up and paid such a cost when they removed that fee, and made it so people who paid such a high price, automatically got the DLC when this gold edition released.But, they quite obviously could not care less about our long standing support of not only this game , but all their titles. Shows what you get for your support of some developers and publishers nowadays. Filed a complaint and waiting for a response, until we get a response (or one we are happy with), not another penny will go to this studio ever again, which is sad, since ive been a long supporter of their studio and games.But, what goes around comes around and this has put a top hat on bethesda +zenimax for us, great marketing strategy guys................. a one way ticket to ever less sales."
Negative,"Be careful with this one.  If Steam glitches and decides to auto-renew it, Steam won't refund it because the publisher has it set to be non-refundable.  Pretty poor customer support.  Look elsewhere."
Negative,68 gbs from steam and another 87 from the launcher? I don't think so.
Negative,Do not buy. You will spend 350 hours to not even be at the beginning of the game. CP 160. Everything in this game is predatory micro transactions
Negative,"why do political activists have to infect every good thing that they touch?why do companies insist that they need to push their political beliefs on others?why cant we just keep real life politics out of video games?i dont care if its brief or you can ignore it, most people play video games to get away from reality not get reminded of it."
Negative,"In their privacy agreement update they state they will sell users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies. There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game."
Negative,"Good game, thousands of hours played.  Server login is terrible since Summerset.  I've now been unable to log in for 8 days over the course of the last few months - completely unacceptable for an MMO.  I may change my recommendation to positive if Zenimax ever addresses this problem."
Negative,"this is a great game, I love it. BUT DO NOT BUY IT THOUGH STEAM, THE LOGIN SERVERS THEY USE ARE DOWN MORE THEN THEY ARE UP.  Getting a response from the games dervs or steams help desk is really slow.  just go to the website and buy it there!"
Negative,WASTED MONEY CANNOT LOGIN AFTER PURCHASE. SEEMS KNOWN ISSUE. DONT BUY FROM STEAM OR WASTE YOUR MONEY
Negative,After 3 days and several reinstalls I give up! Game updates and patches leave steam launcher unstable.
Negative,"It's a really good game, but for the love of god don't buy it through Steam. At least once a week login authentication goes down for no apparent reason. Valve support says it's not their problem, contact Zenimax. Zenimax says their servers are fine, the problem is with Steam. And around and around we go. Until those two corporate buffoons come to some kind of agreement to actually fix the issue, purchase the game and all your subscriptions directly through Zenimax Online. Or if you want to stick it to them, don't buy anything until they get their shit together."
Negative,"I really regret spending money and time into that game. After got bullied over one year, including trying to talk to zenimax, the only thing they said was, that they are not responsible. I really loved elder scrolls, but now, when I think about elder scrolls, I only get sick. If you don't want to RP on EU servers with the german ""community"" and you love elder scrolls, this game is for you. If you want to do RP, never do that on EU with germans. Better take look to Guild Wars 2, Bless Online or Black Desert Online for role playing!Because I'm a roleplayer and had bad experiences with their support and the german ""community"", with both accounts (this one on steam and my main account via Zenimax launcher with around 200 days of playtime) I will not recommend this game anymore."
Negative,"They lock your account for no reason then refuse to give it back unless you remember city, state, region country where you created account, billing address used on account, last 4 of credit card numbers, level, name, race, alliance of character, names of deleted characters, complete game registration code, answer to secret question, guilds you were a member of and gamertag, psnid. If you fail to provide all the above they refuse to give the account back and want you to buy the game again regardless if you send a picture of you holding your government ID. The game makes you grind forever and you never seem to get ahead. I would always find myself endlessly needing to get new armors and weapons because the way they make it a constant grind to stay strong. 0 stars and I do not recommend these scammers and far left liberals shoving propaganda down your throat."
Negative,"As much as I want to love this game, coming back to it after playing premium for a while, it's simply not a good experience.I'm playing in Europe, connected to the European server.A usual ping from my location, to most European based servers, is around 40-70 ping. I've seen it in roughly the 100's in worst case scenarios.My current ping on ESO is 400ms, the absolute lowest I've seen.It's completely unplayable especially with how the engine works, where your combat can be more than 1 second behind.I enjoy the universe it's in, hell I have 400h logged on SKSE alone with many more uncounted on Skyrim and Oblivion.It's a unique MMO in the way it presents quests and dungeons, small stories and characters are everywhere to be found and the story can be surprisingly fleshed out for something you thought was a simple hole in a cliffside. However, I can't bring myself to play or recommend it when the combat feels worse than many MMOs I've played on NA or Asian servers.Don't be fooled by the sales, it won't be worth your time."
Negative,"I played for a while, had a nice group of people I played with. The game forces you to spend money on QoL stuff like the crafting bag.  I felt very pressured by the cash shop to spend money on ""limited time"" things... so it's a no for me."
Negative,"This is an amazing MMO, and I highly recommend it. However, the Steam version of this has login problems very regularly that only happen to Steam users. The official ""fix"" by their ""customer support"" is to recommend people to rebuy the game from their own site. This appalling customer service leads me to give the game a negative rating. Do NOT BUY from Steam, buy from ZoS directly!"
Negative,"ORIGINAL 2018 REVIEW: My playtime was not spent actually playing the game, but rather trying to solve the login issues that plague this game since 2016 or so (oldest post I found complaining about it date back from 2016, but there might as well be more). I tried contacting Zenimax support, which was unhelpful and so far, last I heard from them was three days ago (and I will not buy the excuse that they don't work on weekends cuz I got my forum invitation THROUGH SUPPORT on Sunday). I found out they knew the problem was on their end through a forum announcement, not through an email, not through the launcher, certainly not through the support ticket I opened Friday.For the record, this issue is definitely not exclusive to me and it's also not uncommon at all. Anyone who bought the game on Steam and wants to play it will have this problem sooner or later as it's been known to happen quite often for a while now. https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/418419/unlinking-steam/p1I'm sure it's a fun MMO, but I would not recommend buying it through Steam.UPDATE 2020: Almost two years later (I bought the game on March 2018) and I'm still unable to play due to the very same connection issues. I went through two fresh Winsows installs, a RAM upgrade, and a brand new SSD. I even had my connection upgraded to optic fiber. I tried playing again last year and while I was able to run around for longer than the first time, I was kicked consistently after 10min or so (every time I tried, I'd get kicked after 10min, so this didn't just happen in one session). I decided to give another shot now that it's 2020 and they got more content out, so maybe this time the issue is fixed. At first I couldn't log in, then I performed a repair through the game's launcher, which did the trick. I played for about 30min until I was faced with a loading screen, which kicked me back to the main menu. Logged back in and gave it another shot. Kicked again. Third time, and again I was kicked. This time I was unable to log back in. One day later and I still can't log in.And I'm giving up. I'm removing this game from my library. I don't even know if I like it, but I urge you NOT TO BUY IT THROUGH STEAM regardless of platform preference or price. This problem still happens to other users, as I found VERY RECENT threads related to such connection issues this week alone. One of the users even mentioned they migrated from the standalone version to Steam and that this problem never happened to them until they linked their accounts. You could turn out to be lucky and never have any connection issues, but that's a gamble. Don't play with your money and time like that. If you really want ESO, just get it from the official website, BUT NOT STEAM!I have removed ESO from my library permanently and will block it from my storefront. There's no reason to own a game I literally can't play. By the way, Bethesda/Zenimax are aware of these issues, but they do nothing to fix them. Seriously, avoid the Steam version like the freaking plague!"
Negative,"So if you download ESO through Steam, theres' a good chance its not going to let you log into a pre-existing ESO account. You will arrive at the log in screen and you will be given an option to log in to a pre-existing account, and upon doing this you will get an error message. As far as I can tell theres no way to troubleshoot this. Unfortunately you just wasted the money spent on this product. If you are reading this pre-purchase. Just buy ESO directly from their website."
Negative,"lazy quest design and repetitive game play loop. Bored after only 5 hours of playtime. Gameplay loop consists of doing 2-3 fetch quests to level up, unlock a higher tier of weapon, and then have enemies scale to your new level; because of this, enemies never get harder or easier and combat feels bland. As a mage at least, there are only a few staffs at your disposal. Your choice in weapon never actually matters though because you'll just end up using whatever you most recently found as the weapon damage will be scaled to your new level. It is hard to feel immersed when you see someone who is clearly 30 or so levels higher than you doing the exact same boring and uninspired quest with similar difficulty as you are. Do not waste your time on this endless grind with no reward."
Negative,"Over 6 years in this gameIt's still dog shit(Now that I have time, I can elaborate more. I've given chance after chance for the devs to get everything together, and on top of nothing working, something new always breaking, and being made fun of in streams, i've just grown tired of it. I raid lead, teach new-comers how to do veteran content and I used to love doing it, now it's just become a chore. A large portion of the community has become toxic, and the game promotes a ""play how you want"" mindset with tons of useless sets that will do nothing in the long run for the ""end game"" they have made.It's a total mess and has been for a very long time.)But it's a situation where I've spent too much time and money to stop."
Negative,Havent been able to get into this game for months - played for quite a while then suddenly an update stopped game from working - found nothing works so far. Devs or steam dont care.
Negative,Don't buy this game if you like elder scrolls
Negative,"A patch later and the whole thing is broken. Forgot it's Bethesda,"
Negative,"I have thousands of hours in this game on PS4. I can't transfer any of it to PC. I would pay to transfer my account to PC. Until then it's virtually unplayable. I've spent easily over 1,000$ on this game and the only thing i'll buy at this point is a server transfer. Until you sell me that this game is a 0/10."
Negative,"played on the free weekend, so i didnt lose much but time and dignity. its ok as far as mmos go, but its not the elder scrolls. combat is boring, story seems pointless, and the only real good part is the voice actors from skyrim returning. this is a weak review, but i already wasted 5 hours on this game. im going back to oblivion or skyrim, not sure which yet."
Negative,"**PLEASE READ** Honestly I want to like this game.. but I simply cannot. It was fun the first 50 hours, then you come to realize its just another mindless mmo, doing hundreds of pointless quests with little reward in the end. In my opinion, the questing in and mmo is what you are doing most of the time. And questing is missing something in this game, theres no sense of accomplishment when you complete it. And they are, for the most part, just bland ""go kill this"" or ""go through a portal and press a button""  Trust me, it gets boring FAST after you realize what it truly is.  Now for the most part, they fixed the long loading screens, but what comes with instant loading is that there are textures, items, and important people missing, so you have to wait 5 minutes some of the time for it to load. Another annoyance I have is that there are forced relogs, every 2 minutes in a town you may show up at a loading screen for about 10 seconds and then you get to play again. Stealing and combat. These are the things that keep this game alive. Combat is excellent, you can really experience the flow in this game. You can move around, block, attack, bash, dodge, and use abilities to demolish your enemies. Stealing lets you steal most of everything in Tamriel. You can also sell the items at a hideout to get a ton of money. Crowns let you purchase special items, including mounts, pets, costumes, consumables and packs. But it takes away that ""elder scrolls"" feel to it. Yes, I understand it is an mmo, but 60$ should be enough for free gameplay. Pvp, the best part of the game. You can siege castles and ride in huge crowds to destroy enemies. Although, pvp does need some balancing for lower levels."
Negative,"Thought I would return to the game, but NOPE. Constant connection timeouts. Do I have to play on a server with different time zone to avoid this issue? Hopefully it will work untill everyone else gets the same idea... Would like to know why Gaben is making problems for gamers since from what I heard non-steam users can play all they want..."
Negative,"You shouldn't bother playing this game anymore because the devs probably doesn't play it but still seems to think they know better than the players. Every 3 months, there's usually a radical overhaul (that involves plenty of nerfs) on combat that no one needs and it has been going on for years. I don't like nerfs but I can get over it. What I can't get over is when the devs have no idea what they want so they throw whatever they can think of and see what sticks, and when what sticks turns out to be crap they either ignore it or haphazardly clean it off, leaving the stain behind."
Negative,"haven't played in years, come back to a banned account, and i can't put a ticket to recover my account on their website because my account is apparently also banned on the website, pretty neat"
Negative,"Right now, this moment, i have been waiting in the queue for like 2 hours. F the server. If ZOS can't handle this then just don't make it 'free'. This is such a shame."
Negative,"Immediately swamps the player with the typical MMO mechanics like microtransactions and menus with 60 buttons. And somehow the graphics are worse than skyrims, do not recommend."
Negative,How is it possible that you make an MMO in TYOOL 2014 and fail to design a Skinner box?
Negative,"This game is like a Chinese knock-off that tries really hard to be like the original but misses the mark by a large margin. It's like the game was constructed based solely on screenshots and spoken stories of gameplay from people who played an Elder Scrolls game, rather than actually being made by someone who has played any of the other games."
Negative,"Bought the game through Syteam (mistake).  Had log in issues, so I purchased the game AGAIN through ESO website.  Couldn't figure out how to transfer my account to the new one.  Tried to contact support, kept getting codes in my email that never worked (copied and pasted to a text editor, directly, typing it in, nothing worked).  Had Paypal message them and made a claim.  They never responded, and Paypal decided in my favor.  Tried to log in, my account is permanently banned.  Guess that is their revenge for the Paypal decision, and so this poor review is mine."
Negative,"If I wasn't so bored of the games currently on the market I would never play this game.. Its combat is lack luster, the story isn't interesting, and generally speaking the game is very, very boring. However, the community is amazingly friendly and super helpful. If it weren't for the community I would not keep playing.. Even then I am still having a hard time going back over and over.."
Negative,"I wanted to like this game so much. I most def deceived myself though. It's your standard mmo rpg. I guess I was just hoping the elder scrolls lore and setting would be enough to keep me hooked. My gameplay was spam left click then ""1 1 1 1 2 3 4 R"" and that was ALL the time. If you're like me and you enjoy more fluidity in your combat, then ""Black Desert"" has that, but is lacking in other areas. Idk, like I said, truly wished I liked it more. The biggest thing I liked was the world settings and graphics. Truly beautiful game."
Negative,"The game is deep, engrossing, and detailed in both visuals and sound. But the publisher seems to be skimping on back end support; it is becoming a regular occurrence that when the server load gets heavy, they go into a fallback mode; when this happens, the likelihood that you'll get disconnected when zoning between instances spikes hugely, and once disconnected, you'll get several hours of ""Connection to login server timed out. Please try again later."" when you attempt to reconnect, with only the red banner ""We are aware that some Steam players are having issues logging into the North American and European PC/Mac megaservers. We are actively investigating and will let you know when we have an update. Thank you!"" on the official forums showing that there's any work being done on the problem."
Negative,not a fan of the equipment degradation or the microtransactions
Negative,"Unfortunately, there is no Asian server so i get ping around 350. I'll definitely buy if there is one."
Negative,getting lobotomised with a plunger is more enjoyable than this game
Negative,This game has so many bugs and lag issues that PvP is ruined for me.
Negative,"2016.11.17game will NOT login, it keeps trying to FORCE binding to steam id, for just a free weekend play session, but the bloody game will not get past login, many others hav similar login issues. Even trying to loginto bethesda.net home page and there are login issues there too, and support is a joke.Took a 67GB download just to keep geting denied login, with no customer support."
Negative,"First you buy a game.Then it bugs you to buy expansion when you start the game. Then you see that without extension you cannot do everything at start of the game. It is not endgame content, but you get bugged in-game by this extension content early on the game.Then you see that interface is tainted with micropayment stuff. Instead of harvesting gold you should buy ""crowns"" that magically get you some stuff. They even harnessed the quest for this micropayment curse.Insult to injury is when you realize that on top of all of this you should sing yourself to ESO+ program to get simple things as Crafting Bag.I really like the world and stories, but I really hoped that I would bought the Skyrim instead of this money grab."
Negative,"The game is okay but if you don't have Plus it is limiting.  Even so I was enjoying playing it.  I got enough gold to consider buying a home and picked one out in an area I hadn't gone to yet but was in a nice location next to a wayshrine.  It lets me buy it, but then says I can't go outside of it because I don't have access to that zone (apparently a paid-only area).  Well that sucks but fine, give me a refund.  I reach out to support and they're like too bad, doesn't matter you were mislead, nothing for you.  You'd think they'd go ""sorry for the inconvenience but have a little gold for your trouble.""  But not even that.  It was prompt but quite unsatisfying support.  So enjoy the game but don't expect much help if you need it."
Negative,"DON'T BUY THIS GAME THROUGH STEAM, AND CONSIDER IF YOU WANT TO SUPPORT A CRAP COMPANY BY BUYING IT ELSEWHEREThis is a great game, but you won't be able to login literally half the time if you buy it through Steam. Beyond that, the customer service is pure garbage. The game can be down for 12 hours at a time every other day but all we ever get is a copy/pasted post on the forums about how they're aware of the problem and are working on it. I doubt they even have time to remove the post between downtimes, that's how common it is at this point.it sucks, this game would be nearly perfect if the people responsible for it's maintenance were fired and replaced by people who know what they're doing."
Negative,"The game consistently reminds players of its reliance on real-world purchases to obtain houses, mounts, and access to most dungeons, creating a constant reminder of its transactional nature. It can be argued that visiting a casino in Las Vegas would be less stressful.Moreover, while the combat initially holds some intrigue, it quickly becomes monotonous and repetitive. The mechanic of Light Attack Weaving, an unintended exploit left unaddressed by the developers, only exacerbates this issue. This exploit allows players to initiate a light attack animation and cancel it with another ability while still dealing damage. Consequently, combat devolves into a mindless repetition of clicking the left mouse button, resembling a simplistic and uninspiring clicker game.The game's world scales the level of enemies and quests to match the player's level, permitting them to venture anywhere and undertake any task from the beginning. This approach defies the norm established by most MMOs, where leveling usually progresses upward (scaling lower-level zones to higher levels). This peculiar design choice results in a lack of meaningful progression within the game, as there is no distinct leveling path to follow. Consequently, decision-making, a vital aspect of MMOs, is absent in this game. Ultimately, players are left with a tedious experience lacking direction. In contrast, a game like Guild Wars 2 handles scaling more effectively, as it allows higher-level players to explore lower-level zones while still requiring them to traverse the world to level up.Lastly, the presence of daily quests as the sole means of improving crafting skills is a glaring anti-gamer tactic. Instead of rewarding active engagement and gameplay, players are encouraged to log in daily for a mere ten minutes to complete these mundane tasks. This approach creates a fear of missing out (FOMO) mentality, discouraging players from investing more time and effort into the game due to its lack of a clear leveling path.Overall, this game fails to captivate players with its constant reminders of real-world transactions, repetitive combat, lack of meaningful progression, and an exploitative system of daily quests that favors logging in over actual gameplay."
Negative,"I'll start by saying that I approached this game as replacement for Dark Age of Camelot so was searching for open world PvP MMORPG. The combat mechanics and overall the game design is solid ten out of ten, but the experience is ruined by antique servers. Why the game fails boils down to poor performance, and it's not just me. I have high end gaming PC and 400Mbit connection and run every other game easily without any lag. PvPers consider ping of 200 as lucky, for me the ping on good moments is ~100 and during spikes is 999+. Even the 100 is absolute garbage in modern times and makes game very unresponsive. I really liked the game mechanically and the PvP has decent enough skill ceiling to allow better players to showcase their skills and dominate. That being said most of the PvP is instanced and full of PvE players doing their daily mission, so not exactly challenging. If you don't get heavily frustrated by poor performance or happen to live right next to the server this game might be good enough to wait for something better. For me I'll just play another genre (MOBAs, FPS) to get my PvP thrills."
Negative,Got the game two days ago and played it for about 23 hours I come to login today and realized I could not went to the forums and saw that the steam users have this problem. Do not make the mistake I did and buy on steam.
Negative,This game would be good if I was fine with not seeing the sun
Negative,"If you are a Mac user, I would not recommend this game as the MAC client is buggy and crashes a LOT. Add to this, if you go looking on the ESO forums, you'll find a lot of discussion surrounding Mac support going away; so the situation is not likely to improve any.I am continuing to play, as I love the game, but the crashes are not improving. Layawiin is pretty much a no-go area as I can almost guarantee a crash whenever using a door or the waypoint. These crashes will sometimes just cause me to have to login to my computer session, or at worse it will completely crash my window session to a black screen forcing me to hit the power button."
Negative,"I've tried so hard to like this game.I played through Morrowind (took several years to complete) on the Original XBOX, and then replayed it and beat it on PC. Beat Oblivion back in 2008 and then finished Skyrim after 100s of hours. I even played Skyrim VR, although as beautiful as it was, the motion sickness got to me hard.This game, feels cheap in comparison. Graphics are not up to snuff when compared to Skyrim, despite coming out afterwards. Storyline is weak, and the game is just a series of fetch quests, resource collecting/combining to the point where it just feels pointless. The only thing elder scrolls about it are the names of the towns and the races of the characters. Reminds me of how I feel about the The Old Republic. I purchased the game at full price when it came out, purchased the Morrowind expansion because it was my favorite game in the series, and have just continued to be disappointed each time. Please release a single player version of an Elder Scrolls game, one with a real story you can follow."
Negative,"The monetization in this game is truly grotesque.  The game makes itself worse at every chance it gets, artificially creating engineered problems so that it can sell you the solution.  Every time I learn about a new feature or mechanic, I learn moments later that it is locked behind a paywall.  And the game never lets you forget about the monetization reminding you in the pause menu and everywhere else with constant messages urging you to buy lootboxes so you can pay to play the game you already bought.  The quests and story are shallow and dull, and all of the characters are impossibly two-dimensional.  I can't recommend it to fans of the series, or anyone else for that matter."
Negative,Game start failed on Proton/Linux
Negative,"I love so many parts of this game, but the technical problems I run into every few months like clockwork have finally forced me to stop playing entirely. Zenimax's relationship with steam, how they handle monetization, and the awfulness of bethesda/zenimax support has just soured my taste of this game.I have yet, in my entire history of playing video games, ever to come across a support staff as incompetent as the one meant to ""help"" players of this game.For the longest time, I was stuck in the sunk-cost fallacy for my relationship for this game. So for anyone like me who's sunk hundreds of dollars into this game, get out when you can. The game is addictive and abusive to those that fall for its trappings, which is a shame, since at the core of this game is a great MMO with a great playerbase."
Negative,"Game was good on ps4, got a pc decided to just get the base game to play with all my buddies on here and when I finally finish installing the game. It just ends up kicking me off every 5-10 minutes. I've contacted my ISP uninstalled and reinstalled this game and reset my router numerous amounts of times. I've been able to play other games just fine (R6S, WoW) being my most played and nothing ever happens to that. not sure if this is just a ZOS issue at this point but I'm glad I only wasted 10 bucks instead of the full amount for the whole game if this is what is going to keep happening I'd rather just look for another MMORPG. Which sucks cause this game is really fun like I said I've played once before on my ps4. Until they fix this bug I'd highly recommend it."
Negative,"If you're a fan of the Elder Scrolls series you will probably like this game. If you like to play mmo's you'll most likely enjoy th is game. The game is fun, challenging, and gives you plenty to do. However, I WOULD NOT buy this on steam. There are so many issues logging in through steam that players who purchase from the website don't experience. Plain and simple. Buy from the website not from steam."
Negative,"Ultimately I found this game to be extraordinarily boring. Story, from the bit I had seen, was sub-par. Graphics are absolutely terrible, in comparison to other games out right now, and you may claim ""It's an MMO!"", but I still feel that doesn't justify the bad graphics. I also felt the optimization left a lot to be desired because my FPS was lower than what I felt it should have been, but I'm no expert. I played with a friend, but I feel like questing sucks with friends (Which is the point of playing an MMO.) because they can finish the entire quest without you, and you just get exp. Where is the fun in that? Boring voicing and text, bad combat system (Although Skyrim wasn't good either, if we're being honest.) , and childish graphics. Perhaps MMOs just aren't my thing, but I could never recommend spending more than, say, 20 dollars on this game. Sorry if this sounded overly negative. I spent nearly nine hours playing this game, and after spending 60 dollars, I felt I should have gotten more play time and a more enjoyable experience out of this game. If you're looking for a game to show off how much cash you have by blowing it on pets and mounts, you may like this game. If you're looking for some sort of an immersive experience, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. (Final thought, I will add that I never got to PvP, which I have heard is a huge part is what makes this game fun. I'm just not willing to grind it out to level 15 in this game, because I would much rather have a blast playing Rainbow Six Siege or something.)"
Negative,"ANIMATION STICKING, every hour or more you cannot attack unless u die or log out, your stuck in a animation and now u cant to any skills or attack so you can also FORGET about pvp, with HP and healing taken  items for a tank with alot of armor, im still getting one shotting in a place where everything should be even, This is what it: is im full tank mode and no damage abilites ,one 2hander guy with the same gear will take us all out (5) with maybe getting down to half health. its a zerg/ganking game with the way they have the classes set up, u cannot tank, only can tank with 2hander. u can even take a buff with 44% dmg reduction, it will still be near one shot for u.Its ridiculously unbalanced. not worth to pvp at all unless u want to play only specific classes with specific builds, they pride on making builds so dynamic but at the end of the day u can only have one with what your doing to do anything non casual. So now your trying to decide to get this game, if your interested in story and and immersion this is the best out there, other than that GL dealing with the stress of nothing working right, especially the servers."
Negative,"Don't. Save yourself the headache, and just don't."
Negative,This did not age well
Negative,"Any good will earned by attempting to turn the game around from the bungled 2014 launch has been pretty thoroughly trampled by the ever increasing presence and focus on FOMO, sweeping kneejerk changes made to systems and classes every three months, and longstanding bugs remaining unfixed, and grossly overpriced expansion ""chapters"" that offer less and less content each year... all made worse by the development team's open disdain for the playerbase, blanketing level headed and honest feedback supported with facts under the same umbrella as the ""kneejerk crybaby reactions"" coming from manchildren who send death threats on twitter and reddit.The content design suffers from requiring heavy to extreme optimization to engage in anything above the entry level (and generally steamrollable) PVE content while PVP suffers from bugs, performance issues, and a vicious tug of war of balance with PVE where nerfs and buffs to items, sets, and skills are doled out frequently based on how hard playerbase A screams about playerbase B affecting their gameplay. Because it's apparently too difficult for them to balance items and skills separately for each mode, despite having the capability to do so and displaying it in the past.If you're in it for the overworld experience and questing, nine times out of ten the questlines are one of the same five setups with different NPCs and hokey writing. Clockwork City's main storyline, while commendable, was a lightning in a bottle scenario and stands tall above everything else in the game. You may as well save yourself the money and look up the lore on UESP.EDIT: This isn't even touching on the notoriously bogus Update 35, which I'm sure plenty of other negative reviews made around this time have touched on. Blanket nerfing damage across the board to the point it affects beginners and mid-core players while leaving the optimized hardcore players unscathed in the name of ""raising the skill floor and lowering the skill ceiling"" makes no sense because you're still requiring the newer and mid-core players you're nerfing stuff for to optimize their weaving rotations. You're arbitrarily reducing damage while changing nothing in the grand scheme and adjusting some classes to near useless levels. Bravo."
Negative,"I like a lot of things about this game. The quests and lore are solid, everything's fully voiced, and without reaching endgame, I'm having a really good time....when things work. This game has had 35 updates. It is riddled with bugs. I play this game with my wife, and we collectively have 5 support tickets in now. All 5 tickets the only option is ""oh well, abandon the main quest line and start over."" These are simple problems - quest items disappearing from quest inventory for only one of us, NPCs refuse to talk to only one of us, cinematic completes and only one of the two of us progress.Highly recommend if you plan to play alone and treat the experience like ES6, understanding that you won't be able to do most group dungeons or trials.Do not recommend for playing with others. You'll spend more time repeating content and opening support tickets (or not, you'll learn that they can't help you and you're wasting your time) than you will actually playing the game or advancing your character.Additional data afer another 225 hours of play: my wife really likes this game, so I continue to play it. We continue to have to repeatedly complete content or abandon and start over quests in order to get credit for them...but it's never together, it's like one person gets the quest advancement and the other doesn't.For all that, it's a fun game to play. There are a lot of creative ways to build a character and the endgame progression is lengthy enough to stay engaged. My original observation remains though - there will be times when you'll spend hours doing the same task 3 times, hoping that THIS time the quest will advance. I had to throw 3 scamp heads through 3 portals on three occasions just to get a minor side quest to complete, because the first two times I lost the head, watched it sail through the portal, and got no credit in my quest log (and there's no way to get any more heads, of course).But I have an awesome wife who likes gaming with me, so ESO it is!"
Negative,dont recommend at all. for example if you want to play on sunday you have to wait at least 2 hours to just login to game. yea i am serious. you payed a good amount of money now you have to wait to play like 2005 mmorpg game. fck this
Negative,"Really horrible install procedure......I downloaded the game, 80 GB total, for 4 whole daysand now it wants me to ""install"" it on the same directory with the same amount of space. They should have given us a heads-up for this situation.Looks like they have to update the system requirements to be 160 GB."
Negative,the game itself isn't bad but im very disapointed with how many micro transactions there are. after paying 60$ on a game i expect to get a theives gulid quest line and dark brother hood quest line at least. then they add crowns to this game and make the game unfair unless you pay for gear with real world money. but the worst thing of all is the fact that you can't travel through all of tamrial only your select factions area. so if i want to be a nord and my friend wants to be a high elf we cant play togather. I enjoyed RIFT far more then i did eso and it was free.
Negative,"my review is just kind of....meh. I mean, it looks and sounds amazing. Art style and graphics are great, and effects and score are cool. But the gameplay and UI just felt clunky compared to other modern MMOs and it just ened up boring"
Negative,One of the better MMO's to come out in recent time. The world is fantastic to explore. The skill lines make the game fun. The quest can be boring at times. Overall pretty decent game.Don't buy it on Steam though. You will not be able to play as often because there is always issues with logging in. I would highly recommend buying it on Zenimax's website or wherever you get it. Just not Steam.
Negative,"It's an alright MMO, though it's very bland. Combat is dull and the world feels very lifeless. Classes share most abilites, except for class-specific ones, though the system of acquiring skill points is extremely tedious (you have to find Shards scattered around the world, there's 100's of them, and to be able to do good builds you need a lot of them, it's also necessary to install addons to mark them on the map). Earning new gear doesn't really feel that rewarding, and of course all the cool cosmetic stuff is locked behind a microtransaction store, which you can't earn through gameplay. ESO Plus is almost needed (though I managed without it) to be able to play the game. Your inventory will get filled up very fast with crafting mats, so often you will have to sit there and delete stuff to be able to pick up things. In addition to fully priced expansions, the game has several smaller DLC's, all together which are really expensive, unless you sub to ESO Plus monthly. If you're like me, and want a casual MMO to be able to play without a sub, then this game is only alright if you're an Elder Scrolls fan. Otherwise I would have preferred if this game instead required a sub to play, and you only had to buy the full expansions. Could have been much fairer, but at times ESO feels like you're playing a freemium game. Guild Wars 2 is my recommendation for the best sub-free MMO instead."
Negative,Title is boring and lacks any tantalizing features. Grind and watch as progression is shown but not felt.
Negative,"By removing your game from GEFORCE you have, without any warning whatsoever, booted a number of people from your game. I hope it was worth it. Good luck."
Negative,"we deserve meaningful quality of life adjustments. (additional info: gave up playing this on mac, DO NOT PLAY ON MAC if you can help it, this is a PC game right now) console from my understanding is doable until one realizes how much ZOS relies on users to create addons that overcome extremely basic issues they could have easily addressed by now. and when they do create base game additions that are often based on addons, they of course monetize them aggresively - meaning that PC users continue to use addons that perform their functions better than what ZOS offers in game, while console users pay real money to get a shade of the performance that PC users have. this leads to a two-tier system that ZOS seems tickled to have filling their wallets.one of my favourite aspects of ESO has been the housing opportunities. however, as I have played more it's become clear that the gathering of furniture materials is both a grind and a gamble if one wants to gather their supplies themself. there is no sustainable way to enjoy creativity in ESO housing without grinding either WILD amounts of gold to purchase often extremely pricey materials, or whacking resource nodes, hoping you might get one or two furniture mats if you're lucky and there's no gathering event on. and then they want maybe 4-8 of the rare and expensive materials for a tiny candle furnishing. so, if you're lucky, making a tiny candle - that should not require heartwood!? - could take you 1-2+ hours of ingame grinding. believe me or not, lots of my logged time is because the ESO launcher just loves to hang on my desktop, and often requires a force quit. it can be tedious just trying to leave the game.I play a lot. I have fun. I plan to play more and I wouldn't tell folks they shouldn't play this game. Overall, there's a sense for me that the game developers have plans for me. and they want me to play them. I have less fun when I feel guided on to a hamster wheel of tasks so over time I find for example events (which I have a blast with) unfortunately can also be stressful with the limited inventory of 12 event tickets. there's only so many you can gather, maybe 2-4 tickets per day, and the wicked mean aspect that you can literally destroy your tickets by accepting the daily prize with a too-full ticket inventory. I could carry over 200 pieces of heavy armour in my pack but I don't have space for more than 12 tickets - not cause of sense, but cause of dev choices to put pressure on players and quite literally destroy the rewards one gets (for having fun)The thumbs down is cause I feel I cannot in good conscience recommend folks to become new players when to name only a few issues there's a lot of bugs that are left unanswered over ridiculously long periods of time, basic accessibility options aren't implemented in this game, pretty content is locked behind crowns - it can be tempting for new players to pay money to look cool right away or gain achievements. There's catches too, if you get an item that you've received before from a gamble crate you'll receive less gems than the items purchase value. Additionally, rather than offering the option of a reward rather than an additional cosmetic one might be disinterested in - ZOS chose to keep loading up our collections without offering any sort functions. this means if you play for even a year or so and buy some gamble crates, it can become exceedingly tedious to find your favourite cosmetics in a sea of costumes and hats you never wear. a secondary and tertiary quickslot wheel could easily help with this and allow for more flexibility going between for example, RP, pvp and pve. instead, ZOS shamelessly and constantly loves to lead you to waste your time away in tedious inventory management efforts.While devs tried and in many ways succeeded in creating an open world where one can just run in any direction and find a quest or some sort- on the flipside it is hard and requires some research to run the game in a way that makes some sense as far as lore or storyline goes after many updates and expansions. I'm still gonna play more and I hope other folks do too, at the same time I've def got my eyes out for upcoming MMOs. I don't see myself sticking around for this game more than a couple years unless some serious dev honesty comes out of the blue and some serious work happens - including more comprehensive updates and staff to support Mac users who play ESO. It says a lot to me about dev priorities that I can only run ESO on an old gaming laptop - rather than on my beautiful mac desktop, which can process 4K video no problem.. on Mac though ESO crashes almost constantly, and most mac folks have to go through the spinning world bug at least once.. what a shame."

Negative,"boring, the handicap system means that monsters are always going to be the same difficulty even if you level up, doesn't make sense"
Negative,"I rebooted ESO after several years to see what had changed. Answer: very little. One new class (that I had to pay for by buying Necrom), and some new content.I've tried, but it's impossible to find any joy in ESO again. Classes still feel poorly-designed and uninteresting, PvP is still not fun, and scaling means the Alit I attacked all those years ago at level 1 still takes the same number of hits to die when I'm level 50 and stacked with Champion Points."
Negative,"UPDATE: THIS GAME THOROUGHLY SUCKS NOW!! WOW!! I WASTED $64 ON IT!! HOW SAD!! I couldn't get a refund because I made a mistake and downloaded it for 15 hours... they said I played for 17 hours, and I couldn't even play for 2 hours because it wasn't working on my computer. Game kind of sucks to me now, oh well! Boo! =(ALSO, IT'S JUST OUTDATED AND BAD. TAKES FOREVER TO DOWNLOAD AND THAT ADDS GAME TIME?! MAKES ZERO SENSE! DISGUSTING!! BLECH!"
Negative,"Wanted to play this game badly. However being an immersion-nerd and a true nord I found it unbearable to have to start in either Morrowind or Sumerset, force yourself through some irrelevant tutorial, travel to your factions starting zone and then get bonkered - and get some half-cut intro to the Wailing Prisons. No-can´t-dos-ville-baby-doll!"
Negative,"I really don't recommend this game for oceania players and asian player, this game only have two servers US and EU, not forget to mention that this game won't even launch always stuck at game launcher, so think carefully before buying this game"
Negative,"Love the game, hate the devs! You cannot play the game you payed for, unless you consent to be stripped of ALL your personal data."
Negative,"Game is very glitchy when running on steam, do NOT buy it here, goto the original ESO website and get it there, it will save a lot of stress! the game itself is fun 8/10, on steam however 0/10 because it crashes all the time."
Negative,"Adding to the pool,Under no circumstances should you buy this through steam.  There have been 8 outages for steam users since February - each of which essentially kills the game for the entire day for those users.  The game is currently priced the same on the official webiste, and will not require steam authentication to login.  Buy it there, please do not support whatever deal Steam shoehorned Zenimax into when they agreed to host the game on this platform."
Negative,"Pay to lag, pay to get a lot of stuff that you would like to have, pay to lag even more. Not recommended for people outside of EU or NA as the ping is very high and unstable. Although if you are a Skyrim fan like me you would end up paying to play even more content despite the lag and all the other hardships that would clearly be a no-no for you in any other game."
Negative,"Clearly the company has put a lot of love behind this game, atmospheric, lots of narrative, and looks good.  However the lack of any remote semblance of a challenge or ability to set game difficulty is a major turn off and negates all the good aspects of the game I mentioned. Why am I fighting monsters I feel absolutely no threat from? You can literally not take any action during combat and your health will barely budge... The excitement of loot is also non-existent, why do I need better gear when my starting gear is OP?"
Negative,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THROUGH STEAM.Highly recommend the game itself but do yourself a favour and buy it directly.Constant problems with access through steam.Its's cheaper or around the same price buying it directly:https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/store
Negative,"After 700+ hours of playing on and off again since 2018 I cannot play this game anymore after update 35 was the breaking point for me. I know this after update 36 but I still feel it matters. Here are the main points for me then a more personal reason see number 5.1. The developers/company do not listen to feedback. This is more prevalent in the PVP area then PVE but many people with long hours have suggested things and feedback especially on the PTS for multiple patches now and the developers ignore it. Take update 35 for example the feedback was overwhelming negative and there was no explanation for the changes other then we like them so deal with it. I have also see recently the developers attacking certain you tubers for criticism that is not healthy anyone should be allowed to criticize your game fairly without retribution. 2. The monetization is too much. Look I understand that it is a MMO and that it is a product and you need to make money. However games are a service when maintained and there is a balance between monetization and consumer friendly practice. However the prices are highly artificially inflated in this digital game. You are buying pixels why do i need to spend a 100$ to buy a grand digital pixel house. or spend 1,000's of dollars of which i don't but could on loot boxes for the chance at getting a Apex mount. (will get to endeavors). I look at money spent vs time played and enjoyment. Why are your cosmetics sets 50$ when i can buy factorio for 40$ and get 1,000's of hours out of it. To me that seems like your digital goods are hyper inflated. 3. Balance the meta changes massively every 3 months with massive changes for no the reason then we decided so. I am teacher I cannot keep up with that. Some can deal with this and that's great but should you not take care of to do small balances over massive balances that are much easier to mange. If you leave for six months and come back its a widely different game that is not helpful long term.4. Time Investment positive/negativea. Positive: If you take the time to invest in the world of eso and do all the quests and lore and collect things it is a very enjoyable experience and I am mostly a PvE player so that was the most enjoyable aspect of the game for me. I think its a great positive that you have a wonderful world to explore and quest in that can take days to do. b.Negative: What now takes away from the positive is the amount of dailies and the endeavor system. Now I have become so focused on doing these that I am pulled out of the narrative that is the world and reminded that this is a game and these tasks feels like a job now. Which is one the main reasons I quit ESO. Also a year and half is just ridiculous to get a apex mount. 5.Update 35 the main reason I quit. I bought High Isle for the sole purpose of using oaken soul as I have nerve damage in my hand. I have to play with a controller and because of that one bar builds were my saving grace. While oaken soul was powerful their are you tube videos pointing out that it still was not better then a two bar parse build but it got close enough that you could do vet trials. Oaken soul did not raise the ceiling it only raised the floor. Which meant I could finally do vet trials with my guild only the day after I got my oaken soul ring update 35 landed and all that work and excitement went down the drain. It was disheartening to say the least. I felt cheated I had pay for a product and got screwed instead. I was promised one thing and given another. 6. Which to make my third final point off number 5. They do not separate PvE and PvP nerfs and buffs its all one balance. When the two are fundamentally different. Oh believe me Oaken soul was completely broken in PvP no doubt. Which was their justification for the Nerf. Could they have not just Nerfed it for PvP. No they had to Nerf it both for PvP and PvE. I think this is a poor balance system overall if you cant separate the two it leads to radical balance changes which are not helpful for a long term game such as this. 7. My second final point that got me to quit. Crafting has become pointless. Not that it was strong to begun with but I am aPvE player I live for the dream of crafting ym Epic Gear then ghoing out and doing quests and using said gear. That fantasy is trendily broken when you make crafted gear the least powerful of all gear sets. I have this little inkling that I will always be lesser in equipment because of it. Crafting used to play a larger role now it is entrily time locked to cosmetics. Dont get me started on those master writs I don't have the time to upkeep on those as a teacher. 8. Performance a final last quick point. While I as a PvE player did not feel the performance hits to badly as I mostly stayed out of high populated zones. There is still a severe performance drop for PvP players and it sucks for them. Overall it was a fun game while it lasted. I think the game is becoming more focused on Monetization and huge changes. I would not recommended this game at this time. This review will be updated if things change for the better."
Negative,"This game is a cash grab. It should be either Pay once and you own the game or pay monthly, not both and that's only the start of it. One of the biggest problems with this game is you can't find out in plain English what your actually getting for your money so it's better to just not bother. Apart from that the combat is really quite boring. It feels like you never actually hit anything and sometimes i actually wonder if i am hitting or lagging as there is no feed back what so ever, the NPC's don't really react to attacks and apart from getting knocked over once and a while neither does the player character. Crafting is pointless unless you pay the sub which i will not as i will not be ripped off, i will not pay for a game and also pay monthly that's just insane. Graphics are really nice but even with an RTX2070 keeping 60+ FPS at ultra is not really possible and the game drops frames to try and keep up which makes me feel really sick so i had to play on high, there is not really any difference anyway. There are MANY other reasons why i do not recommend this game however it's pointless to list them anyway because the fan boys who wont see reason and will just downvote before even reading anyway so..."
Negative,Spend money on the game 2 days ago and it seems its unplayable during issues with login . It seems like nobody is fixing anything. havent have a chance to even try the game !Recommand not to buy it. to many issues.¤ i tried to refund and steam dont even let me refund the game! it said i played it more then 2 hours so i cant refund ! hahah what a joke 3 and half hours waiting for login and steam thinks i played over 2 hours ! really pissing me off ! great job steam !
Negative,"As a fan of the elder scrolls games, I did not enjoy this whatsoever.There is a video from development where the developers say that this is an MMO but it's meant to feel and act exactly the same as any other elder scrolls game. This was a lie. Its a decent MMO, but arent they all? They made sure that the game fit the standards (ugh) of the MMO genre. If you are unfamiliar, MMOS have developed these strict laws where you arent allowed to feel like your having an entertaining experience. This game is no exception. They really want you to know that your playing a game.Playing this game is basically like driving a car with broom handels from the back seat."
Negative,"When MMOs come to mind, I always imagine a row of cows happily lining up to be milked. Happily chewing their cud whilst having every last drop sucked out, before dumbly shambling back out to pasture to await the next milking. ESO hasn't changed that perspective in the least.I played ESO on a ""Free Week"". Which to be honest, is the only way I'd ever play it. I know it's just accepted these days, but microtransactions DO NOT belong in full priced games. Now for the gameplay. Typical boring, grindy, fetch questy mmorpg fare. Not bad, but not great either. I suppose if you're into MMO's, you'll probably enjoy ESO. BUT, if you're here because you like Skyrim, Oblivion, or for that matter, ANY of Bethesda's single player rpgs, you'd best hang on to your cash. Trying to play this game with any level of immersion is next to impossible. It's the equivalent of trying to enjoy an art museum with a gaggle of kids running around playing 10 different versions of tag at once.Graphics-wise the game is sub-par at best. Simple blocky textures and low detail character models is the standard, which seems to be a staple of the MMO genre. Performance is fine, (though considering the low graphical bar, that's not saying much.). Inventory management is tedious and un-intuitive, not to mention partially blocked by a paywall. Which is probably my main gripe. The player is constantly reminded that everything would be better if they just bought Crowns. The constant pitches laid into the game-play are intrusive and annoying, and sap what little immersion you can muster. I'm struggling to come up with a positive to include in this review, but I honestly can't. As a Bethesda fan, I thought it would at least amuse me. Not even a little. As of this review I've still got a few days left to the ""Free Week"", but I think I'll just free up that HDD space for something else. Cheers."
Negative,"Between playstation and pc I have spent well over 3300 hours on this game over about 7 years. Brought the chapters and subscribe to eso+, just like thousands of other people do. Yet with all this money, each time new content is added, they seem to lack the resources to make the game stable. That coupled with years of neglect for pvp as well as broken/false promises, somewhat of a disconnect to the reality of internal problems within the game and just out right lack of communication for ongoing issues has driven me to come to actually hate this game. 9 years these people have been working on this game and it runs worse than some games in beta that have had less than half the resources available, in a fraction of the time to develop. Constant crashes. Constant performance bugs that are quite literally game breaking meaning they affect integral game mechanics, you know, the things you NEED to be doing in order to play the game. At this point, the state of the game is quite beyond a joke. There really is no excuses for these issues and the lack of care that clearly happens before new content is released. I fully understand the difficulties of game development and the effort that goes into a game like this. HOWEVER, the constant issues, the same issues that keep coming back, the issues that have plagued this game for years and just the outright lack of care for certain aspects of the game such as pvp make it very clear, that this is due to either incompetence or indifference, not the difficulties of game development. Couple that with the community just being cold shouldered so often regarding many issues from crown crates not being giftable to just not acknowledging many of the issues, its very clear ZOS only cares about one thing at this point, and its beyond a meme at this point, and thats peoples willingness to continue giving them money for their mediocre product and service. I am one such fool that has spent close to 7 years on and off giving these people money. But now I'm done. This game is horrendously broken, and what do you do with things that are broken and beyond repair? You throw them in the trash..."
Negative,unaccaptable que times as a paying ESO+ customer.....imagine providing sufficient server cappacity
Negative,Game is good when it works... When indeed it works...its a nice game to sit and watch for 4hrs updating...its nice when you get stuck at Requesting Character Load.Its nice to get kicked back to main screen for a poor excuse of an error...actually im talking nonsence... ive had enough of this shit.
Negative,"Three years ago I would have given this game a thumbs up. But lately its just bogging me down.Poor monetization. Loot Box gated items, and some items in the crown store is worth as much as a DLC (It costs as much as 20$ to place an NPC to talk to in your house)PVP alliance war gets little attention, and is a performance mess to boot. The amount of content that comes with each expansion seems to be going down. Or anything worth noting is subpar. I'm barely hanging on only thanks to the awesome merchant guild I joined. But only just. I don't see myself staying much longer."
Negative,"Bought this game thinking, hey, why not give it a try.Let it download while I slept after a 12 hour shift.Decided to give it a whirl.---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cannot use my email address, apparently suffering from a ""improper email format"". It's the same email ive used for 20 years.- Cannot connect to any servers. Takes me 8 minutes alone just to bypass the main menu screen.- Get to the character creation, but first have to bypass a number of advertisements.- Go to make a character.- Realize I have to buy the DLC just to play as an IMPERIAL.Immediately refunded the game.Save your money."
Negative,"Pro:Fun, lots of thing to do, I love the elder scrolls lore.Cons:Skills are restricted to a 5 slot system, I literally have 30+ skils and can only use 5 at a time, 1 healing skill 4 attack skills. I opted to go dual weild/twohand for an additional 5 slots which require me to switch over from dual weild to two hand during combat.Game has the basic of trading, there is no auction house, makes it very difficult to sell your goods. You have to be in a guild to use there merchant system, and even then it's a hassle and often your items go unseen by all the potential buyers.I'm level 40 and I've yet to do a dungeon simply because I can't find a party.For me, the game has to be run outside of steam, for some reason it crashes if I launch from steam (which is why only 14hrs are recorded)More bad than there is good, this game is your typical MMO with elder scrolls lore, so don't go into this with the mindset of skyrim online, because that's not what it is."
Negative,Kind of annoying to be bombarded with the cash store and their subscription service all at once as you try to absorb the new player experience. Feels less satisfying to move and fight than Skyrim. Restrictive class system is hard to swallow too. Looks nice though I guess.
Negative,"it was free days for playing:* install 70 Gb* install 20 Gb more* press ""PLAY"" - nothing happened* register acount ? no, you have to buy game first* uninstall the game"
Negative,"The microtransactions are downright criminal. It would require over $90 worth of Crowns to obtain a single instanced ""home"" without furniture included, even more expensive with the small amount of furniture included. There are several of these Crown-exclusive 'homes' that are just as expensive."
Negative,"As player who has over 15 years experience in MMO games i really hate this game and i'm very suprised why ESO is so popular. PROS:- nice and smooth graphic- well optimized- base game + morrowind is just $10 on sale so WOW!- Elder Scrolls game- Awesome storylineCONS:- This is the most expensive game i've ever played! You need to buy EVERYTHING. You get base+morrowind for 10$? Cool, now spend 100$ on reast of DLCs or pay 15$ monthly. There are much better systems like in GW2 where you can buy premium currency from other player via market or LOTRO where you earn premium currency by playing (you farm quest for 1h to get 10cents it's still cool for poor players).- SERVERS - oh God.. For last 3 days had a few free hours to relax and i couldn't even login to game. Before i've bought that game i read negative comments about that but now i start understanding that angry old players. - Forcing players to accept TOS and settings every time you launch game. I waste like 40sec every time i launch game.. This is a joke- Inventory - this is biggest joke of this game. After a few first hours you gonna realize you need to buy ESO plus for $15 becouse materials and items that you collect takes lot of space and free 60 slots in inventory is enough just for first day of playing. Later you will need Material's Bag that is feature for paying players. It's impossible to play without it."
Negative,"Played in the beta. Was interesting and I wanted to play something Elderscrolls. However, this game isn't Elderscrolls. It is an MMORPG with pay to have fun features. I believe they even have a monthly sub for more benefits. One of them being a materials bag. Something that players themselves should be able to make in order to carry more or specific types of gear/materials. Game companies have been taking us, the players, for granted and sucking the life from us. As the saying goes; Time is money. We work and pay for a game in hopes to get some amusement out of it. Instead we get bull rushed by “microtransactions” that show us how crippling the game is. I believe this is also because they don’t allow the players to build. Ie storage bags, expansion slots and so on. Mind you there are items you can craft. However, from what I have seen in the crafting system it isn’t that great. Could be wrong as I didn’t have the time or space to carry the crafting materials in my inventory. That and your character starts out with like 80 slots. Then you get a bank with about the same. Seems like a ton of space. However, it isn’t when one considers each type of weapon, armor, or other has special stones for each race. I have been off and on with this game. They are just money grubbers pulling our life from us the players. Mainly because a good majority allow it and they don’t care. This would change if everyone stood together and said NO. However, that isn’t going to happen and I digress. I wouldn’t recommend this game to a friend. While the graphics, mechanics and other have improved the basics that make MMORPGs fun isn’t there. Again, this is my opinion. If you have a different outlook on this then by all means have fun with a game you love. I know I will be and by that I mean I won’t be downloading this game ever again."
Negative,"So today I bought ESO, finished the Slaver tutorial with 2 different characters in both EU and NA. Both times I got kicked to the Login screen after jumping from the burning ship. And after that, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't get past the character screen.I've tried doing the Addon.old and SavedVariables.old thing even though I have no addons. I've tried Repair via the launcher. I'm as green as you can get when it comes to this game and now I feel like I just wasted my money on this game just to play the tutorial which I may not have even gotten to finish AFAIK.Other people are also having the same issue since the 2/8/16 patch and have posted to the support forum and submitted tickets, with no reply from ZOS. While looking for a fix, I've seen that this problem occurs from time to time, from way back in 2014 till now, but I don't see a solution. I've tried everything suggested in my research, but no fix.My question is, does this type of issue ever get fixed or do people just walk away? Has anyone here ever had this issue and gotten it resolved?I'm still going to try a few things. If I can't get past the Load Character Request thing, I might just have to get a refund."
Negative,"Played for YEARS on xbox, sank A LOT of money into it, then started over again after moving to pc... and I have a terrible hate/love relationship with ESO, and with all things good and bad considered, overall I would not recommend ESO. It's almost impossible to play without ESO Plus and the extra storage space/crafting bag, some things are pretty much pay2win (such as pvp), everything has become a monotonous copy-paste-change-skins-and-colors mess, a new class will come out then be totally nerfed in later patches/updates, the in game economy is simply atrocious and coming by large amounts of gold is not so easy, zone chat is constantly FLOODED with Guild 'advertisements', new armor sets are pumped out and constantly replaced with new ones that make the older ones almost obsolete and they try to drain your pockets as much as they can...but if you can get past all of that and other shit, and can manage without ESO Plus, it is still an Elder Scrolls game and can be pretty enjoyable for a few hours at a time."
Negative,"I was so happy with the game, but suddenly i realize that every quest is super repetitive. Go to point A kill a lot of things, go B, repeat.Was not that bad tho, I kinda enjoy it anyway, but then they put this Queue thing and u know,being a suscriptor, pay a monthly fee and have to wait 25 min to log in... well, no.Yes for free, good game.a big NO if you want to pay."
Negative,"pay to play - donepay to get awesome armor/costume, mount, pet, or any other bundle - OKpay to enjoy the dlc content such as thief guild and dark brotherhood - Suck! its ok if we hav to pay for premium item or any goods that help our leveling, but to pay more for the game content is just ridiculous.. im done with you"
Negative,I bought the reduced price game during the free event as I love the creators. But the storage in the game makes it very difficult to play and enjoy. Many of the things I enjoy about this style of game seem gated behind a 15 dollar a month charge. Not bad to be fair but paying for a game you cant play past lvl 10 is off putting.
Negative,This game had great promise.  I enjoyed playing it.  A launcher issue started for me about 5 months ago.  They have no way to resolve it.  It is sad.  I have been a huge fan of the series.  I am not sure if I will invest in one of there games moving forward.  I do not have much trust in Zenimax.
Negative,"Bought this Game and installed it, I saw the launcher loading screen was taking a bit long so I left it for a few hours but nothing ... it keeps getting stuck on Launcher screen ... I haven't even seen my character creation screen yet. I have tried most fixes on the net and still I cant get past Launcher screen. For some strange reason Steam shows I have played the game for 9 hours? ... 9 hours of Loading screen Fun. YAY."
Negative,if you want an experience like SKyrim. this is not to game to buy.
Negative,wont even let me install
Negative,I don't like this.
Negative,"The only real positive thing about ESO is no subscription requirement. You buy it once and you play whenever you have some time to waste. I remember when fans wanted Skyrim in ESO, they said won't happen. But here we go, some time later they caved in and added it to the ESO. Yeah, yeah it's cool but shows how greedy lady Beth and Zeni really are. Character creator is pretty decent, with plenty of customization options. Is the game like Skyrim, not really, similar UI and lore but that's about it. ESO is basically for die hard Skyrim fans that wanted to co-op with buds. Visually dated, somewhat looking worse than Skyrim even without mods. If it was free, I'd recommend but you're better getting Skyrim with mods."
Negative,"Honestly, I really like this game, and I'm not usually a fan of MMORPGs.The game itself is beautiful and very fun to explore, with lots of diversity. The writing and quests are generally decent, though some areas are better written than others. Interacting with other players is optional, and unless you want to be meta you can do basically anything in terms of skills/equipment. A lot of stuff needs to be bought in addition, or you need to buy a subscription to access it. I wouldn't mind shelling out more money on this game if not for one thing. The Steam version has so many issues that non-steam players don't have.Nearly every patch, after server maintenance, many steam players are unable to log in for an extended period of time.  This is in addition to daily freezing loading screens and occasional lag, but those don't frustrate me as much. The login issues are reccurent, and the forums suggest that the only way to avoid these is to buy the game again, except not through steam. From what I've heard, non-steam players don't have this issue, so if you can, don't buy the game through steam. I just wish someone had warned me before I did."
Negative,"Since I love Elder Scroll series. I expect too much for this game..but..It's boring...I'm not major in MMORPG but I played Guildwar2, FF14 before and I think ESO can equal to those game..but this game fail me.Story: like pattern of MMO nothing much.. Skyrim is far more better than this one.Gameplay: I feels like I play single player, Boring combat, all you need to do is accept quest, run and talk..craft and skill system quite interesting but compare to Guild War2 or FF14 I think ESO worst than those game..Graphic: for me Skyrim is better....2/10 1 point for ""Elder"" and another for ""Scroll"" in title."
Negative,banned account on Mac Book Pro 15 inch m3
Negative,Every single time there is a update the download will not finish. it takes a day or so for them to sort it out before the game will play again. I'm not sure who is running this flea circus but he should find someone who knows what he is doing and have him do it.
Negative,"I've been heavily invested in this game for the past month, but after considering the pros & cons, I have to give it a thumbs down.What the game has going for it:  The world is beautiful, the voice acting is top notch & the ability to (in theory) fill any role regardless of the class you're playing is neat for a seasoned MMO player.However, there are many downsides.  The performance isn't great, to say the least, even on a high end PC.  Items offered in the in-game premium store are straight up P2W, use gambling mechanics and/or are ridiculously expensive for the value they provide.  A lot of these items/services are based on the concept of ""create the problem, sell the solution"".The difficulty scale of the content is whack too.  The overworld content difficulty is mostly a joke, bosses in normal mode dungeons are essentially glorified thrash mobs, veteran dungeons are barely different from the normal ones or exceptionally difficult for an uncoordinated party depending on the dungeon , while hardcore mode seems near impossible.This game prides itself on a clean UI & to be honest, I like that.  However, it forces you to run add-ons for basic features that are present in games way older than this, which is likely to make the UI worse & a confusing experience until you reach the sweet spot through a lot of trial, error & bugs.You may still have a good time, as this is a decent option if you're shopping for a new MMO, but beware: a lot of the shininess is only skin-deep.  If you still want to give it a go, buy it on sale, play without a sub for a bit, or if you do decide to get a sub, keep in mind it auto-renews unless you cancel it through Steam."
Negative,"Nah... This used to be my favorite MMO, now its just a microtransaction simulator. For real... the game has like 0 real rewards in game, it´s all in the cash shop... Just imagine grinding a dungeon and trying to get a trifecta run (no death speedrun on hardmode) just to get an emote... an goddam emote."
Negative,"Thousands of hours played, but I can't recommend this game to others because of the the cash grabs. In my opinion, it now has the lowest reward-to-effort ratio of the major MMORPGs, all in an apparent effort to drive players to the cash shop. While not pay-to-win, monetization is increasingly aggressive with a combination of pay-to-play, paid subscription, paid DLC, per-character paid items, loot crates, and cash store items that often cost more than entire AAA game titles.  You can't even really complete the recent paid subscription content until you buy expansion content separately, too. Almost every aspect of the game has an overt monetization aspect now, and it's just been getting worse.Every patch seems to be getting worse in terms of quality at release. The weeks of public test server activity seem to mean nothing, and numerous bugs make playing after patching difficult for weeks until hotfixes are available.  Play at your own risk, if you can even play at all.  Release issues include glaring oversights in cosmetics, typos, dialog mistakes, broken animations, nonfunctioning or bugged items, and game breaking issues with basic game features and functionality.  Long-time bugs go unfixed, and malfunctioning dungeon mechanics have negatively impacted achievements and progress for years now."
Negative,"SO, lets keep this short and sweet. This is a bias review from a point of authority, check my hours put in. if you like doing dull boring run around quests, its for you. If you like boring, unrewarding, and time consuming PvE, this is for you. If you like riding for 30 real-life mins with 20 idiots to fight another group 20 idiots in terrible server lag, this is for you. However, if you like skillful game play, a sense of just reward, PvP, patch changes that require more thought than a common rodent, then this game is not for you. Yes, its pretty, there are cool looking cosmetics you can buy with your hard earned money, you can be the coolest looking MFer around, You can RP with weird dudes over the internet. all in all, not worth my time. this game hasn't been good in over a year because they keep making stupid patch changes that make no sense. here's 2 stars for making a pretty looking game ZOS."
Negative,"morrowind is great, skyrim is fantastic, TES online...trash"
Negative,"Stop activism in gaming. Subscription cancelled, game uninstalled, and mourning process for Tamriel started."
Negative,THIS is the best game ever if only their server near my house
Negative,‘An unexpected Internal Error has occurred’
Negative,"I wanted to like this game, but I just...didn't.It just doesn't have a lot of good things going for it. Gameplay was bland, the stories were bland, crafting was bland, the quests were bland. I felt like I was running around for no good reason. I'd say it was on par with some of the free MMORPGs I've played in the past, and certainly not worth the $20 I paid for it.Skip this one and play Skyrim again."
Negative,"Great game when it's available but unfortunately there are just to many maintenance / login issues when accessing it through Steam. I want to be able to play the game at the time of my chosing, not when it happens to be available. On occassions it has been offline whole days.I am sorry to say that until this issues are resolved (follow the discussion forums for more on the Steam login issue, then I recommend you DO NOT buy the game through Steam, and that you DO NOT link it to your Steam account.DIsappointed!"
Negative,Do not buy this game. -Maintenance on Saturdays (9am - 3pm) for EU!-Frequent login problems if you buy the game over STEAM (a problem that has not been fixed since the game's release!)-Little or no communication from the game developers. Horrible support. DO NOT BUY!
Negative,"The games is NOT WORKING for the latest APPLE-MAC (M1 and M2) devices! Despite wrongly promoting it for macOS, STEAM will NOT REFUND. Avoid the game with Mac computers and rather buy it for the consolesUpdate: Still not launching despite following the troubleshooting steps recommended in the developer page. To create a further ticket, they ask you to create an account."
Negative,This game sells your personal info
Negative,"Crafting bag for unlimited storage, only with subscription of course. It sure is not a p2w :)"
Negative,One day you will understand that the game you hate the most is your favorite game.
Negative,"The game is trying to pander to a 'Modern Audience"". just why?"
Negative,"Thought I'd try this out for the free weekend. Downloaded it, started it up, got to the Bethesda logo, and crash to desktop. Same thing every time. Went through all the troubleshooting - no add-ons (new install), verified files, made sure drivers were up to date, etc.. nothing. Restarted computer and made sure only Steam was open. Nothing, same issue. Running a 5600, 3070, 32GB ram, and an SSD. So shouldn't be any issues to at least run it. I couldn't even find crash files where they say they are. Guess I'll go try something else."
Negative,"I wish I could say that the game is good, but unfortunately I CANT PLAY IT! The CD key provided when I bought the game was apparently invalid and both Steam and Bethesda's support teams refuse to help me and keep telling me to go to the other's support to get a new key. Not to mention that the game takes ungodly FOREVER to patch. I have a 100MB connection and yet it took hours to patch the game even when connected to the proper server. It should NEVER take 6 hours to patch a game nor should it count as game time! Now I'm stuck with a game that I can't even play despite how badly I would love to play it. Don't buy. Play Rift or Old Republic instead. At least there's no problems playing those and they're free."
Negative,"Bought the newest Collector's Edition thinking I would be getting all of the currently available content, only to find out that there's still quite a bit of DLC that I can't access without using ""Crowns,"" ESO monopoly money. For the humble price of more than $100, I could get this content, but that's far too steep a price. Especially when I can't say I'm overly impressed with the content I did play. Especially a frustratingly small inventory system that I have to imagine was designed to encourage you to part with even more cash to make the game enjoyable.Also, a lot of textures for NPC's clothing wouldn't properly load until I was halfway through a conversation with them."
Negative,"Don't buy. I have 500 hours in between PC and console. Overpriced everything. Copy and paste quests with zero meaning. Dungeons have little to no mechanics and those that do can be over come by over gearing. The crown store is a joke. Reskin over Reskin over Reskin for an over inflated price. Between this game and Fallout 76 we are witnessing the rise and fall of what I can safely say was one of our favorite gaming studios. RIP PVP is one of the only fun endeavors but rest assured the Devs will have you grind for armor sets a-z just to turn and nerf them to grind new ones because they test zero content before dropping it into their hammster wheel severs. Oh...bonus comment - game is full of people trying to sell gold for real money and scammers, if you manage to not run into those two - you will 100% find a toxic end game community that stand around holding each other's roosters in a little high-school clique.Definitely a don't buy in 2024 but that wont change for any other year to come. Hope this helps!!!"
Negative,"Trying to enjoy the game, but if you're in Australia, just be aware that their designated server shutdown period for maintenance is suited to North American time zones. so when they shutdown the servers from 4am to 7am over there (EDT), that means it is shut down from 6pm to 9pm for us (AEST), basically peak playing time. Hopefully they don't need to do too many, but I've not been able to play it the past 2 evenings. I've paid a lot for the game, I shouldn't be limited from playing it as much as I have been."
Negative,"Update #2:After hitting CP level 160, honestly, the dungeons are the most interesting thing in the gameplay loop. Before hitting max level battleground PvP was a lot of fun. After max level it’s rather painful. The queues are ridiculous, and then you’ll end up against players with wildly different gear…pretty unbearable.Anyway, i scratched that MMO itch for a month or so. Back to the waiting room i guess.Update:After two years off the game, i've returned to it. I re-rolled a brand new race and class that I hadn't tried before. I took my new Wood Elf Warden to Vulkhel Guard and started the main story quest line. In the past two weeks, i've been hopping on each day at least to do my daily dungeon and daily battleground. It's been fun and far from my previous experience with my original character (lvl 44 Mag Sorc). My current tactics is to simply ignore all side quests, which I believe was rabbit hole I fell into before I dropped the game the first time. When I get a resource or a bit of armor that I can't use immediately, I just sell it. I'm sitting at 27k gold on this one character, with plenty of bag space, because I just get rid of anything that I don't need immediately. I'm only lvl 38 at the moment, so I'm replacing gear pretty much every day. No need to hoard, and no need to pay for the crafting bag sub. I'll get to crafting after max level, and i'm not in a rush.Take it easy and I think you can scratch that MMORPG itch!-----Original Review:If you enjoy linear progression, cool level design, and plenty of things to keep you busy leveling or before endgame, you'll enjoy this.As an MMO veteran, it's pretty much just more of the same. There's some cool mechanics with profession progression, in that you can level all of the professions at once, and they have actual value in the endgame. The cosmetics system allows you to buy whatever mounts, companions, and housing items you want, without directly affecting your in game performance. Crafting and resource gathering is subscription-locked. You have to pay monthly to keep your bags from overflowing from random items that you may or may not need later on.There really isn't as much variety in the build system as you're told. There are good builds and not so good builds. For leveling, you'll want to use a proper build someone else made. For endgame progression, you'd better use an approved tried-and-true build or you're not going to have as smooth of an experience."

Negative,"Refunded once, gave it another chance and got stuck on a bugged quest at lvl.3Tried to contact the assistence about this, ""submit"" button for the ticket doesn't even work."
Negative,"This game won't even run.I've downloaded it twice and every time I'm getting errors during update.No fixes work, repair tool seems to damage the game even more.Zenimax and this game are garbage."
Negative,one of the most boring mmos ive ever played
Negative,7 years of neglect. invest your time and money into something else.
Negative,I installed and after 30 mins of playing. I remembered why I uninstalled it in the first place. Ping too high. No Aisa server. Please don't sell games that you cannot even supply the servers for.
Negative,"Came back and played for a few months, it's the same buggy release it was at the launch date. The game do have a lot of potential and good stuff in it, but the devs/lead are just completely ignoring a lot of game-breaking and immersive-breaking bugs. Do not waste your hard earned money on subscription to a poorly maintained product."
Negative,"At first this game was quite okay, I thought it was quite easy but figured it was just the beginning. But it turns out that it does not really get any harder. It does not matter what combination you do, if you spam a few buttons you will be fine. The quests are quite okay, but I did notice that some was lacking some polish (E.g. In Riften). I would come back to it if they made it harder. I’m not referring to more button smashing, but making the combat so that you have to be more strategic about what you use. I really doubt they would to such a big change, so for me this is not recommended."
Negative,"DO NOT buy this game via steam, no matter the price. It is NOT worth it. The game itself is great when you actually get to play it, but that is not very often via Steam. The connection reliability between ESO and Steam are horrendous.  I thought about purchasing premium but decided not to due just to the ongoing amount of technical problems the game has with Steam. It is pretty bad. I wish I had bought ESO through the original site but this was my first purchase with Steam, and it will be my last. So dissapointed that the game doesn't play with Steam. Zenimax and Bethesda would do well to just cancel their contract with Steam and pull all their Steam players to their original site. Better dependability means more money spent by consumers in the end. :("
Negative,"My friend and I bought this game 3 years ago for full price and spent 3 hours updating, it went on sale the next day so I tried to refund it so I could get the better price and low and behold I spent 3 hours playing apparently because updating counts as play time. I have since played around 2 legit hours and the game wasn't worth it. :("
Negative,Not working game. Access denied even when running as admin. Installed twice and same problem.
Negative,"Monetization is absolutely abysmal, if it wasn't as bad as it is I would recommend this game.  Story was pretty good and the graphics aren't bad, but good grief does this game attempt to mug you in a dark alley for your cash."
Negative,"ahhh yes the fetid, festering stench of world-renown cringe."
Negative,Gina Bruno is a monkey
Negative,"i think is time for something new,this online version seems older than Skirym.is time for TES6.I really want it,but now bethesda changed owner.....Wait 10 years doesn't mean i'll buy TES6 in a hurry.I can live very well even without play it,OK?!Sure they want money each month,and they will add 100 dlc i dont like this,and i hope they improved the ""open world""becouse in every Bethesda games,is Empty and Dead,my money is not garbage to waste Understand??!"
Negative,"Sadly, I did not get beyond the terms and conditions screens, the privacy section is a minefield and my refusal to agree prevented the game from loading. How many of us actually read all that small print and rush headlong into the game? Glad that I took advantage of the generous discount and only lost a fiver, a small price and a lucky escape."
Negative,"I feel like 'The Elder Scrolls' is just one of those series that shouldn't be online. All the other people running around, killing monsters that you try to sneak up on, it just ruins the immersion that I felt in the other games. In past games, you feel like the one true hero/ explorer. In this, everybody does what you do and you are no longer special. It feels closer to WoW than an Elder Scrolls game."
Negative,"Accidentally bought the blackwood upgrade thinking it was an equivalent upgrade to what was included in the blackwood game. I've enjoyed it, but the whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth. There needs to be a description in the listing of what is included in the upgrade besides the title. I've tried to get a refund so I can buy the blackwood game and get what I expected, but the game took a long in game download time so I technically have a night's worth of ""play time"" prompting an automatic steam refund rejection. Kind of annoying considering that it is still more economically efficient to buy the 60$ blackwood game than to buy the other expansions by themselves."
Negative,"This rating isn't against the game itself. I happen to think ESO is loads of fun and you should totally play it... but please don't buy it through steam, go through bethesda instead. I have barely been able to play because it's impossible to log into the game due to a connection error. The error itself is something on steams end and they need to resolve it, fast. Until they get their act together I don't recommend you buy this game through this platform."
Negative,"It's not often that I leave any sort of review or recommendations for games. And until recently I was kinda just. . . Eh on this game.I played it during the first closed beta times. Played a bit and enjoyed it. An MMO Elder Scrolls game was something I always wanted, and it actually delivered it pretty good. Then when it came out I sadly couldn't actually afford it, so I didn't play for a long time. When I did eventually buy a copy of the game, I was excited to play again. I launched up and noticed the. . . inflated stats on gears and attacks and everything.The One Tamriel update had happened, and I wasn't aware of it. And I LOATH that update. It took something vital away, in my opinion. The feeling of progress. You can go anywhere now, sure. But you'll never really be challenged. You can go into the highest level areas and kill enemies just as easily as the starter zones as a low level. And you can go as a level cap champion level whatever and have a *little* easier time killing the starter zone enemies.I WANT to be crushed by enemies way too strong for me. I WANT to go back and stomp on the weaklings that used to be field bosses in early zones. I want that power difference. A good example is at the end of the primary questline where you temporarily are stronger than everything ever. That was fun to mow down enemies that would kill me easily otherwise. Then? It's all back to normal. Everything poses about the same risk.But even with that, I was still just ""Eh"" about the game. Not weighing in on either side. The final straw was Bethesda's decision to pull from Geforce Now service. I don't have the best computer in the world. I can't play modern games at all. In fact, Doom'16 I was only able to play on the lowest resolution, lowest internal resolution, lowest settings all around. It's no way to play it. So when I signed up for Geforce Now, I was happy. I could play games I want and have them look GOOD for a change. Including this one, which is in a similar boat. I could play, but it would look like a PS2 era game at best. I played on Geforce Now for all of a couple weeks before they pulled. Now I have to go back to low fps low graphics. All in all: The game itself is. . . Okay at best. But I cannot in any way really recommend it."
Negative,"I pretty much just kind of sort of mostly mildly aimlessly ran aroundVery mediocre early game, would refund if I bought it"
Negative,"the arcanist is actually a stupid class and very unintuitive but that’s not even the reason i’ve got turned off of this game after being here since day 1, the fact they broke the set plaguebreak in pve because it helped kill adds “too fast,” and “we are addressing the crown crate gifting problem,” when in reality they are trying to squeeze more money out of their players was enough for me with this patch. i actually cannot understand how people can be this absolutely ignorant to their own game and the community"
Negative,"A lacking game. only thing it got  going for it is that it's in tamriel/The Elder Scrolls.confusing and cluttered menus.Boring charactersLackluster combatuninteresting questsetc. etc.i really want to like this game but i dont. its not bad, but its not good either. not worth your time in my opinion,"
Negative,"Basically, every zone is max-level, and your character scales to max-level. This means that a level 10 character with level 10 gear is MUCH stronger than a level 20 character with level 10 gear.Effectively, you get weaker every time you level. (until you pick up new gear) In the past, the different parts of the map had different levels (quest rewards would be tied to the level of the zone). Since your character didn't scale (except in PvP and DLC worlds, and some group instances) leveling up always meant getting stronger. Gear was still important, if you had low-level gear in a high-level area you wouldn't be that strong. But if you brought low-level gear to a low-level area, you would be fine. Also, you could see the level of an enemy by their healthbar (now they have no level).But under the current system, all areas (even intended low-level areas) are the same effective level, meaning a max-level character equipping low-level gear cannot even defeat the enemies in the starting zones.(EVERYTHING is the same level, EVERYTHING is flat, and leveling makes you weaker.)"
Negative,"Bought imperial edition on zenimax launcher before it was on steam for 80$+ , after it came to steam i contacted support to ask for a steam key while providing proof of purchase and details, they refused to do anything about it.So i bought it on steam just to figure out that i have to keep spending a full game price every time there is a new update/dlc not to mention the locked zones/playable characters behind them.I wont even talk about how the game is not available cross-platform in ""2020"" and other cons at this point.Do your self a solid and play any another MMORPG that would respect and appreciate you.Or wait for the upcoming released."
Negative,"It should be emphasized that if someone appreciates the diversity of classes this game is not for him ... Apparently there are several classes to choose from, but still in the course of the game about 90% of players are running around with magic rods in the build under magicke I personally found it very discouraging, no matter what class you choose under dps if you want to have a reasonably comfortable gameplay and not to stand out too much and so eventually you will become a mage...The game is PayToHave for some 99% of cosmetic things you have to pay with real money, including the best things are in crates with some percentage chance of dropping e.g. a cool mount in addition everything limited by time e.g. 2 weeks.In the same way events are very limited in time and to get everything you have to spend a lot of time in the sense that you can't make up something in one weekend because you have a limit of getting e.g. 12 tickets (currency in the event) per day so you have to log in every day. In general I DO NOT RECOMMEND wasted 1500H of life better to play for example in WoW."
Negative,"""We are aware that some Steam players are having issues logging into the North American and European PC/Mac megaservers. We are actively investigating and will let you know when we have an update. Thank you!""This message is what we have been seeing on the forums trying to figure out why we weren't able to login to the game at least once a week for past several weeks. If you wan't to experience it too buy it through steam, if noy DO NOT BUY THE GAME THROUGH STEAM.The game itself isn't bad, but this ""regular"" downtime for steam users only is a great turn off..."
Negative,"The support for this game is absolutely horrible. Thousands of people are having issues with logging in and they answer nothing except ""we're aware"", not even explaining the reason for it. And then they seem to fix it, and then the issue returns literally the next day, and stays for several hours to the whole day. There is not even a ""sorry"". No one receives any compensations, even ESO plus subscribers. If you like having that, sure, you're welcome to buy this game. Otherwise - avoid."
Negative,"This Intro for this Video Game is a Progress Bar Called 'Applying Patch', it is Manditory and it is Several Hours Long!!!My biggest problem with this game are the never ending updates. I have maybe played this game for a total of perhaps ten hours ( I am most likely being over generous with that number). Steam shows me having played this game for 40 hours, thats aproximately a total of 30 hours of waiting for the game to finish updating before I can play it. It is truely insaine!If you are going to play this game every day like a total addict then go for it, it is a pretty cool game ( from what little I have seen). My problem is that I have a life and that means that I can get a couple of hours from time to time and I think, ""maybe I'll play E.S.O"". Wrong!!!! What actualy happens is I load E.S.O and it tells me that it needs to update and then spends the next several hours doing just that. By the time it has finished updating I have to go and get back to real life without having gotten to play the game.I really would love to play this game, but that means heading home three hours earlier to turn on the computer, head back to work, and maybe it will be finished updating in time for me coming home and I might get to play it.This has been my experience every single time I have gone to play this game. It has gotten to the point where I regret buying it and see it as nothing more than a waste of money.If you want to experience this game without this level of pain and suffering I would advise not buying it unless you seriously plan on playing it every single day, that way the updates may, no guarantee, may not take so long.The other option for players like myself who will only have time to play it a couple of times a month is to plan several hours in advance.......there will be massive updates!Update. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I have just spent 15Hours trying to play this game and I am still looking at a Update Progress Bar!!!!!!! 15Hours. I am going to ask Steam for a refund as I have not been able to play this game in Years!!!!!!DO BOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!"
Negative,"I'll be concise as there are already lots of posts detailingit:Purchased this game at 40% discount, didnt come with 30days free so had to fork out an extra €13. you cant use it through steam, you have to register on a separate account.Nothing new. just your typical MMO. Would be ok as a free to play game, definitey not worth the bucks it costs"
Negative,"I've had ESO+ for years. Suddenly, like everyone else, I'm hit with a 30 minute queue every time I want to play. It's ridiculous. I'm giving it another day or two to resolve or I'm canceling and not looking back."
Negative,The game itself looks pretty good. If only I could login and play to review it.
Negative,"More woke crap, I'm out!"
Negative,"Have to pay for races ""DLC"", and you cant even play the game if you even wanted to anyways, haven't played in long time decided to play now, 5 try's to link my account said fail try again later, so waste of time and money."
Negative,"Before I made my first character I was asked to give them money (again) for an expansion, in game currency, character slots, paid classes, paid races, and a monthly sub. All before the game even starts. For some reason the class descriptions for all the classes say they are mage classes not explaining you don't need to use their mage skills and can use melee weapons. The healer class is also the tank class. None of this is explained in any way while picking your class. This game is a joke."
Negative,"None of your actions, skills, blocks etc. feels significant. Imagine: An amazing, powerful, legendary sword. Well now imagine it is made out of Play-doh. This basically describes how the combat system feels... but oh look... the dodges feel fluid so that's something. I genuinely tried getting invested in the story but i couldn't, every single task i did felt like a chore. And  don't even want to get you started on the skill lines. Honestly, you can mod Skyrim and it'll yield a far better combat system and more way more engaging Story content.My playtime isn't much but it was definitely enough to show me that this game isn't for me."
Negative,been subbed for eso+ for over a year now . purchased multiple expansion but for the latest current one . just canceled my sub due to the crazy sudden loin Que that everyone is getting . does not matter how good a game is if you cannot play it they probably gonna lose more subs than they will gain with the epic games crap. to many other good games out their to play and a good way to screw over their paying customers . thank you MIcroshaft !
Negative,This game is fantastic.  DO NOT BUY THROUGH STEAM!  Purchase this game directly from The Elder Scrolls Online website.  Steam linkage is incredibly buggy and causes hours of downtime while direct purchase has far fewer issues.
Negative,"was really enjoying this title until i went to login tonight it it failed. did some resesarch online found a forum post on bethsedas site from today, post is full of irate steam users. the users are irate as there is server login issues frequantley and these issues only effect the steam users. save your self the headache buy this game from another source, dont give steam your money.#elderscrollsoffline"
Negative,"You feel you've done the research on MMO's and discovered the best choice is ESO only to find after every update a bug or consistent unexpected disconnect during the most crucial moment that would result in the most amazing loot that you can never claim.  Wasted hours of play time and money.  Better yet, you have limited availability for inventory space when you start, they make you pay monthly for more space as a desperate money grab attempt to the weak minded.  Don't waste your time or effort, you deserve better.GLHF,Sunny"
Negative,Its just so outdated and boring.
Negative,"constant struggle with inventory and bank space (due to:)20$ trial/demo version, that tries BLACKMAILING you into monthly subscription, so that you can keep your loot, since at some point your bank will be filled. further, you should get tired from going to a bank for managing your inventory every 15-30 minutes.fundamentally, not a bad game at all tho! but extremely shady and sad business tricks that involve emotional blackmailing"
Negative,"One bar of skills able to perform the previous BiS gear/skills/rotation/buff dps has attracted a younger, impatient and immature crowd. PuG content is who can rush to the end or who knows how to avoid all the mobs. I subscribed and purchased crown crates often enough to have multiple concept alts. I play BiS healer with so many skill points I have some to spare, all skill lines finished, legendary gear enchanted properly, most trials/dungeons completed heroic. I've spent a large amount of time into one character. I'm not smart enough to know what happened, but I've played MMOs for years, and this feels decaying quickly."
Negative,"ESO is a great game, but DON'T buy it through steam. They have linked accounts in such a way that the only login credentials you have are provided automatically through steam. This means that if the steam login server has issues you have no way to play the game at all. Buy the gold edition license somewhere else, and if you want to subscribe to ESO+ do it directly through the developers. You can get great bargains just buying the game elsewhere. Seriously, buy it elsewhere.Additionally, steam randomly borks my install and decides it needs to download the entire game again (my ESO folder is currently over 80gb). I just tried to make a backup of the game files through steam. The backup fails, and steam downloads the entire game again. I have a copy of my install folder, however steam refuses to recognise the game files. I can launch the game directly, but as my login credentials are held by steam I have no way of logging in. It's a ridiculous situation and the developers seem unwilling to unlink accounts when the base game has been purchased through steam. Save yourself a huge headache and buy it elsewhere. I can't stress this enough. Don't end up in this situation with 1500+ hours already invested in an account."
Negative,"My two friends and I barely lasted a few hours in this game before we were bored and frustrated out of minds. Sharing quests is too difficult. Even when you group up and agonizingly share each individual quest with your group, each person has to accomplish each and every step in the quest, every line of dialog, every decision - which quickly resulted in confusion and chaos. One person would busy themselves completing quest dialog, while the others would be off fighting monsters, causing the quest to get stuck. On the other hand, if you play a decent game like Red Dead Online, completing a quest together as a group will reward all players the same, no need to run around completing useless dialog. What good is coop in a questing game if you can't complete quests together?"
Negative,"If I'm honest, there isn't anything wrong with the game from a technical perspective. The audio is fine, it runs fine, the story lines themselves aren't cliche.But the mechanics were just...dull? I don't know. This game didn't inspire me to log in and play 'just 5 more minutes'. It inspired me to go download Skyrim for a better single player RPG, and buy the latest WOW expansion for a better multiplayer RPG."
Negative,"The impressions of the game left conflicting impressions. On the one hand, this is an interesting MMORPG set in a VERY famous universe. On the other hand, the game is very dry and does not bring any unique gameplay.But if you have never tried this genre of the game - I advise you exactly ""TESO"". The graphics in the game are nice. The storyline is not the most interesting, but quite good for an MMORPGWhat I would like to add is that you cannot play without donation. Even if you buy the most expensive version of the game, you will in any case have to buy new add-ons that are more expensive than the game itself"
Negative,"This game was good but lots of stuff locked behind visa, decent experience untill you know more stuff are locked behind paywall,waste of money and potential.You might enjoy it a bit as elder scrolls fan but its not really worth, try other games and have fun."
Negative,"Seems like it could be good, but it's missing something. It feels really greedy with the mechanics punishing having alts, and and having ""buy me"" pop up on every logon. The main quests seem to be spread out as far as possible on these HUGE maps to ensure you're running almost always. Oh but you could buy faster mounts.. Normally large maps are great, but they just mainly fill these maps with running. Running that becomes quickly irritating. Pros:-The game looks very nice, all emotes are animated (And there's a lot!), and the maps are large with a lot of land to explore. -The game does an alright job feeling like an Elder Scrolls game. From the sounds being the same familiar ones we know,  to having the freedom to create whatever weird build you want to fight with. Unusual things like a sneaky warrior or a magic archer. The builds flex, but feel restricted.-The main story quests are entertaining enough. If you can put aside the running and judge the story alone. Though there is no replay value of these missions. The choices matter so little, it only changes one dialogue interaction usually. -If you buy the game late, you get all except the most recent ""expansion"" however if you bought the game before the expac release you get to buy both, and all future expacs. It's good for you if you're planning on buying it now. For all current players it sucks though. Cons:-The game feels like greedy corporate decisions are oozing at the seams. You can see a lot of decisions made for profit rather than for gaming.-The running... Holy shit the running. Make a large map feel boring and punishing by making 80% of activity on the map running from point A to point B.-Random events are repetitive.-New areas require REAL MONEY! There's a stupid amount of DLC and Expacs that make this feel like an EA title.- The main story is fun! But only on the first time through. Choices don't feel like they really matter, so it feels odd to have them inserted. Another thing that feels punishing to alts.-Crafting is expensive, especially considering the inventory space you need. But if you sub you don't have to worry about crafting inventory. Not only this but if you want to craft on an alt.. you either sub for that extra space, or you shift items annoyingly between alts using various storage units.- Your mount starts off really slow. Uselessly slow. In order to make it faster you have to logon every day and fork over 500 gold. Oh and if you wanted an alt, start them from scratch on the mount. (Or you know, pay real money for mount upgrades.)- The money you earn is directly tied to your level. That piece of junk might sell for 1 gold at level 3 but 50 gold at level 50. It might not sound awful, but it leaves you feeling punished for alting. You could be making more money on your main.-The classes and the builds feel restrictive and boring. There are too many similarities between classes, with a few actually punishing you changing your mind on build/playstyle. The sorcerer for example uses mostly Magicka skills, so if you decide you want a Stam build, you'll be very restricted in your class choices, or be spread too thin making you weak. Though in late game there seems to be enough skill points for what you want. -Loot in dungeons is shared. Fighting near a chest? Well prepare to have some asshat come take it and emote at you. -Which brings me to my final complaint, even though I have more. The community is ridiculously toxic. Worse than any other game I've seen. I've played games with very toxic communities, but this one is impossible. An MMORPG that you would rather play solo.Overall this game feels like a game that could have been good. Unless you're super into the Elder Scrolls, or roleplaying, or both, I would recommend against this game. It smells too much like bad corporate decisions, and feels really tiring to play. Every time I play this game personally, I kinda forget what I hated about it. Then I play again and feel angry without immediately knowing why. It's a shame, but not a game worth playing for its content alone."
Negative,"I didn't get to play the game much due to login issues, annoyingly, trying to login for hours last night counted as time ""played"" so unable to refund...DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FROM STEAM, get it from ESO's main website as you won't have login issues when the game is busy. The game looks good, and as its the same price on ESO's website and Steam there is no reason not to go direct. It took 17 hours yesterday to ""resolve"" the issue, and has happened 4 times the last 2 months going off their twitter. To sum up, don't buy the game on steam, buy direct and you won't miss out on days of play!"
Negative,doesnt work on mac os
Negative,Do not buy if you're from Australia and wan't to pvp
Negative,mid game tbh tried it when it was free for a bit but realized it was a massive fucking cash grab by bethesda
Negative,"Sucks the life out of me, questing is boring but the combat system is nice unlike any other MMO."
Negative,"Heavily monetised, this would be fine were it a free to play, but you buy the game, to have to buy more shit to play it, like their ""optional"" sub which grants you an inventory with infinite slots for mats, and you have to buy every new dlc, not to mention their horrible crown shop.Very displeased"
Negative,"I bought this game on Steam during the Christmas sale.  The game kept crashing at character creation, so I requested a refund and got my money back. Still during the sale, I decided to give it another try and purchased a key from Steam. I was able to create a character (cool) and play the game....for one day. The next day I received an email from Elder Scrolls Online saying I had purchased a fraudulent key and they invalidated my key so I could no longer play the game. I filed a ticket with both ESO and Steam. ESO never responded, and Steam replied with an automatic response saying it wasn't their problem. So basically, Steam is in the business of selling fake CD keys. Good job...."
Negative,"I played this game to check it out, and to see what some older gamer friends were up to with their time. I put the time in and got to level 50. I found a decent guild to join, and people have been very, very friendly. Love the people! I've maxed out most of the crafts, and am beginning to do my preferred end-game activities. There's a lot to do in the end game. A ton. No dailies required, folks. That's a win for me.The culture of the ESO players is positive and welcoming. I've never been around so many consistently positive people.However, the way in which the end game is structured makes this a poor game choice for a new player if they want to play for the end game. Because, yeah. Certain end game features are the ultimate draw to ESO: purchasing property and furnishing that property. There are some seriously cool places out there. Endless options. Animal Crossing eat your heart out. You craft most things in the game and can run all over the world finding recipes to make the furnishings. Grinding, but with real rewards for those who enjoy that sort of thing. Sometimes, that's me.But buying those larger houses? Goooooood luck. Making gold is excruciatingly difficult, and there is little information on how to do it. Because I was encouraged to try the game by people who played, I had insider knowledge. You need to join a trading guild to make money. However, finding a trading guild willing to take on a new player is difficult due to the way trading guilds function--they need members with money in order to make money off of those members. So, for more successful trading guilds--places where the money is--new players may find joining these communities difficult. Which means money woes for years. For me, it's a bit too real-life for an escapist activity.Figuring out how to navigate ESO game economics is difficult. There are sites to help, but nothing comprehensive. There are no reliable in-game apps either--not of the quality you get with WOW. All of this conspires to lend an air of mystery around money. For Veteran players too. Some people seem to have lots of gold, and others don't despite playing the same number of hours every week. Probably due to the trading guilds and their membership rolls. The rich get richer? Where's the puke button here?Many trading guilds have their members either volunteer multiple hours a week (every week, year after year, no 4-week skips without warning first. Random cullings warned of in guild rules and contracts) or a player can ante hefty gold dues to stay in the guild. WEEKLY. Guilds argue that this is in order to pay for where their guild gets to do business in the world. Some of these trading posts have very steep location costs.Okay, okay, okay. On the one hand, you don't want to pay a bunch of money to end up as the trading guild in that city where you have to complete THE ENTIRE ZONE before anyone ever sees your stuff. On the other hand...WHY? Why is this a game mechanic at all? Why not just have an auction house, and level the field? You can still have a mechanic where guilds earn from what goes on auction.If this is making you side-eye the game, yeah. It should. Some guilds seem to have turned this aspect of the game into a multi-level-marketing-scheme. Calling it like I see it here. My guild doesn't do this, and certainly not all guilds, but people interested in playing this game should beware. This is a real issue you will encounter once you get to the end game.For Dungeons and quests, I am a WOW Loremaster and played through all of their dungeons and most raids. The quests are hit or miss, and usually have you running all over the world, expending time without giving XP. Not a fan of that game mechanic. It took a stupid amount of time for me to reach Level 50 by doing quests. I am a Loremaster, okay. I like questing. It shouldn't have taken me a month to max out. You don't get XP for mining/herbs/fishing/cloth gathering, which was part of the challenge. So, it's easy to spend hours playing and barely move the XP bar. Boooooooo!For people who want to max out their characters and gear and go that route? Goooooood luck, friends. Don't quest. Grind, grind, grind. You can run between the same three bosses forever in several zone and constantly update your gear, but it's a fairy's curse. I ran it for two hours today, and it felt like someone was drilling into my head. No thanks. All the rumors say that a lot of Veteran dungeons are full of jerks, but I think we should be kind here. I'd be cranky too. I get really cranky when a game wants me to grind for my jollies.I've only played one random ESO public dungeon so far, and realized that I need to do homework first. No one knew how to defeat the bosses. It was hilarious--genuinely. The experience was a delight for all of us. Heals did on-the-fly research, communicated it out, and we finished the dungeon. I'm guessing quick Public Dungeon runs might not be a thing, so I need to reserve more time before exploring them. I'm committed to continuing to play--at least for a while. I want to see how long it takes to earn a house. However, the lack of ability to make $$$$ progress has put a damper on my desire to play, hence this thumbs down review. It's a bad sign if I'm bored after a couple months.It may be time to move on in my MMORPG tour. Where will I go next?"
Negative,"But yes.  It really depends how much money you have for entertainment purposes. Honestly used to love playing this game, but as it progresses, its always tailored toward new players and dragging people in and screw anyone who's paid $100's if not $1000's.   Everyone always panders to "" The devs need to make money"" and of course while I agree, there has to be a line in the sand.  Them changing race perks to the point you have to jump factions to be meta then making you pay more money to do so was astonishing and grotesque. Not even going to mention how much it decimated the original character design in the first place from early ES. There wasn't any balance issues at all with how the characters played they just decided to literally change everything about races one day.  So I say no to anyone returning who's paid any money into this game because its the most parasitic game on the market, no to any new player who wants a long term game, and yes to anyone with lots of money to burn and doesn't care if their character changes from day to day because they can afford $20 a tic every time they do despite having paid $15 per month for 2 years and buying every expansion at full price, the devs need their money right? Las tid bit, if you do invest and don't have a lot of money, wait a few months and everyone who paid full price will be QQ because they will give it away free with the next expansion as well as all the previous content you paid full price for and give you literally nothing but fan boys saying "" the devs need money"" . I think by here you get it. The devs need money. *EDIT 7/8/19*  HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF ONE UPDATE AND THIS ISN'T EVEN 1/4 THE CHANGES:Major Heroism: Fixed an issue where some sources of Major Heroism would stack with one another including Hanu’s Compassion and the Last Stand passive.Minor Lifesteal: The heal from this bonus will now use the activator’s highest Critical Strike chance, rather than only Spell Crit.DragonknightArdent FlameCombustion: Decreased the cooldown from this passive to 2 seconds from 5 seconds. This was done to help alleviate many of the duration-based ability cost increases, as well as helping this passive synergize with more build customization such as using the Charged trait.Fiery Breath:Increased the cost of this ability and its morphs to 2808 from 2700.Decreased the DoT damage per tick by approximately 15%.Lava Whip:Molten Whip (morph): Reduced the stacking Spell Damage bonus from this passive to 75 at Rank IV from 125.Searing Strike:Fixed an issue where the visual effects from this ability and its morphs would fail to apply if the target was blocking.Increased cost to 2160 from 1350.Increased the DoT damage by approximately 26% per tick.Earthen HeartAsh Cloud:Decreased the healing of this ability and its morphs by approximately 30%.Increased the cost of all morphs to 5670 from 4590.Cinder Storm (morph): This morph is now 50% stronger than the base ability, which will result in an approximate 1% heal reduction comparatively.Eruption (morph): Reduced the damage over time by approximately 30% per tick.Petrify:Increased the cost of this ability and its morphs to 4050 from 2970.This ability no longer ranks up in cost reduction, but instead ranks up in 1.1% damage per rank.Reduced the range of this ability and its morphs to 7 meters from 8 meters.Shattering Rocks (morph): Fixed an issue where the heal from this ability was missing a previous rank up, which will result in an approximate 3% increase in the healing.NightbladeAssassinationGrim Focus:Fixed an issue where the spectral bow from this ability and its morphs could consume all of your stacks even if you failed to fire the projectile.Reduced the amount of mitigation the stacking bonus of these abilities provides to 2% from 3%.Mark Target: This ability and the Reaper’s Mark ability are now considered 1 negative effect, instead of 3. Piercing Mark will count as 2, due to the Reveal aspect. The conditional “if the target dies” bonuses from this ability and its morphs will no longer proc when using on pets.Teleport Strike:Lotus Fan (morph): Decreased the damage per tick of the DoT by approximately 22%, and fixed an issue where the final tick was not being affected by Minor Vulnerability.ShadowConcealed Weapon: Fixed an issue where casting this ability from crouch would apply the stun to your target, but not animate the stun.Path of Darkness:Twisting Path (morph): Decreased the damage per tick of this ability by approximately 14%.Refreshing Path (morph):Fixed an issue where this ability could heal you twice per tick after the first heal applied.Increased the healing per tick by approximately 29%. Note the heal will be stronger than Twisting’s damage potential, because Twisting also gains increased area coverage.Shadow Cloak:Fixed an issue where this ability and the Shadowy Disguise morph could fail to cast if you had “Prevent Attacking Innocents” turned on.This ability and the Shadowy Disguise morph now last 3 seconds at base, but are no longer affected by the Dark Veil passive. This was done to help low level characters utilize the skill.Summon Shade: Increased the cost for this ability and its morphs to 4050 from 2700.Dark Shade (morph): Reduced the damage per hit of Corrosive Flurry by approximately 9%. The area attack, Corrosive Slash, now deals the same damage as the normal attack, instead of dealing 20% bonus damage.SiphoningDrain Power:Power Extraction (morph): This morph no longer increases the damage dealt of the attack, but instead reduces the Weapon Damage of enemies hit by 300 Weapon Damage for 8 seconds.Cripple: Decreased the cost of this ability and its morphs to 2970 from 3240, and increased the damage by approximately 17% per tick.Crippling Grasp (morph): Increased the initial hit damage by approximately 37%, and dtecreased the DoT damage by approximately 2%.SorcererDark MagicCrystal Shard: Decreased the base cost of this ability and its morphs to 2970 from 3510, and decreased the damage by approximately 10%.Crystal Blast (morph): The AoE portion of this ability now deals the same damage as the initial hit.Crystal Fragments (morph): Increased the bonus damage dealt of the proc from this ability to 33% from 20% to retain the damage of this proc.Daedric SummoningConjured Ward:Reduced the shield size of this ability and the Empowered Ward morph by approximately 18%, and increased the cost of this ability and the Hardened Ward morph to 4320 from 3510. These changes were done to make them more comparable to the damage shield / burst heal standard.Empowered Ward (morph): The final cost of this ability is now 3780, and it no longer gains 1.1% shield size per rank as it already has a cost reduction rank up.Hardened Ward (morph): Reduced the shield size of this ability by approximately 9%.Rebate: Fixed an issue where this passive would dismount you if it procced.Summon Unstable Familiar:Decreased the special ability of this summon and the Volatile Familiar morph to 2808 from 3510.Increased the damage per tick by approximately 8% of the base ability, but reduced the damage per tick of Volatile by approximately 3% since it was using the wrong rank up.Summon Unstable Clannfear (morph): Reduced the healing granted from the special activation of this ability by approximately 14% to ensure it’s in line with other burst heal abilities, such as Rushed Ceremony or Dragon’s Blood.Summon Winged Twilight:The Zap and Kick attack from the Twilight and its morphs will now do the same damage, to help reduce volatility in performance.Reduced the damage of the Winged Twilight and Twilight Matriarch by approximately 69% per hit.Summon Twilight Tormentor (morph): Reduced the damage dealt by the Twilight’s Zap and Kick by approximately 35%. These attacks will now rank up in 1.1% damage per rank, rather than 5%.Storm CallingBolt Escape: This ability and its morphs’ stuns can no longer be blocked."
Negative,"I have now played several thousand hours of this game and had plenty fun. If you are in for some solo RPG game with lots of quests and full voice over: yes, this game is right for you. It is fun, not too difficult and everything is somewhat fine.Why only somewhat? The thing this game is lacking is really good tutorials explaining the mechanics. If you want to learn about them, forget anything shown ingame and directly head to google and search for things like DPS or tanking in ESO. With the information available ingame you will never be able to reach the levels which you can see in other players.But the biggest problem is the development team. They are significantly breaking / changing game balance with almost every major update. In case you are working towards endgame raiding and trying to go for the highest level of achivements possible you have to be prepared to completely change your character class, gear and skill load out every 3 to 6 months if you want to be able to reach the so called ""trifectas"" (no death, speedrun, hardmode).Another problem is that with the latest update, U35, the dev team is alienating at least the end game community. Significant numbers of players (that are usually teaching newer players so that they can eventually join the raid parties!) are leaving the game, endgame raid groups are being disbanded. This is both due to the changes as well as the communication around them where the lead designer complains about a ""knee jerk reaction"" from the community based on the preview of the upcoming changes but once the changes went live the players testing it on the test server realized that it is even worse than expected.Oh, and not to forget: the server upgrades for EU are not due before March 2023. So in case you are looking for ""fun PVP with little to no lag"": look somewhere else. If you are playing on the US (northern america) server you should be better off since that was upgraded this year.TLDR: If you are just in for solo questing: go for this game, you will likely have fun. If you want to go for the raids on the highest levels: good luck finding the players helping you get there and later the groups running them!"
Negative,"If you want to be ignored by customer support and receive no compensation for down time even though the servers are perfectly up and running, buy this game ON STEAM. If you want NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS buy the game from the actual website. It hasn't been even one week since the first time i've encountered not being able to log into this game because steam login servers fail. And yes if you log in using the zenimax launcher ONLY IF YOU PURCHASED THE GAME BEFORE 2016 you will have NO ISSUES, anyone after that cannot login unless it's STEAM only."
Negative,"If you think constantly referencing 'The Lusty Argonian Maid' is the height of comedy, this is the game for you. I had this game installed for many years. I came back daily. I 100% explored maps, bought a small house, caught every single fish. The main drawbacks of the game were:- Tons and tons of FOMO. Everything comes around only once, like skins and mounts, and not just in the premium store, but in lootboxes too. When I stopped playing it was an actual relief to my psyche to not be bombarded by things I would miss out on. This game inflicts psychic damage. - Not only is there a premium shop, and lootboxes, there's also an optional subscription. I don't think it's worth paying for it, but several meaningful things are locked behind it. There's a sub-only bag just for crafting materials, without which you WILL run out of inventory space just picking up herbs in the world. Enjoy foraging in an MMO? Well you can't, you'll just ignore gathering nodes as you pass them by because you know you can't space inventory space. Any game that wanted you to actually have fun would have complimentary harvestable/craftable storage like Guild Wars 2 does. The housing decoration system is nicely implemented, but since being subbed doubles your decoration limit, you're always going to have a more drab, bare house than someone paying up. These aren't little convenience things; non-subbed players are denied a level of QOL that should be essential. - Of the hundreds of hours I've played, how many do I actually remember? Maybe five of them? The story is so forgettable. Nothing ever actually happens. Every game pack/expansion involves someone Ending The World and then you stop it. Every plot development is always reality coming apart or something likewise one-note. I learned NO Elder Scrolls lore during my time here. Daedra are Evil and you Stop Them doing Bad Things I guess? There are many well-known actors in the game whose characters show up, do a tutorial, and are never seen again. This game has no actual characters. Nobody has an arc or learns a lesson and everything always revolves around the player saving them. Each new release isn't a 'where will these characters develop next on their new adventure', it's a 'what random bull did they make up for me to have to save everyone from again'.- Exploring is awful. Your mount can't sprint at full speed (outside of Alliance War) because it'll trip over every pebble and tiny adjustment in ground height. Fully exploring a map requires completing multiplayer combat challenges, and there will never be anyone there. There are players in the towns but maps are barren and I went hours without seeing another person. Every underground cave (delve) is the exact same - one main boss, one quest, one skyshard and you're done. Every DLC has the same Collectables mission where you go get a bunch of historical gubbins and bring them back to display in a 'museum' over and over. I eventually gave up hope there would ever be any new content outside of their overused templates. - The creativity on display really is shockingly low, like, how many maps actually have anything resembling fantasy in them? Most of them are just a forest. Some fields. Craglorn has some stuff in it and Coldharbor looks neat, other than that, it's trees and dust. You know, from real life. Honestly, just save your money from the pressure of sub-only convenience and aggressively pushed lootboxes. Nothing interesting happens. Main things I liked about this game:- The lockpicking minigame is pretty good."
Negative,When is the installation issue going to be fixed??
Negative,Its pretty bad repetitive combat annoying quest pay money to get stuff :(
Negative,"Can't for the sake of it get this game to run anymore. Un- and reinstalled numerous times, followed guides, tried many many things and it just is not launching anymore. This is very annoying considering what I paid for the game and several expansions. Can not recommend.  Other than that the game is pretty awesome, although old and the community is very nice and willing to help new players out."
Negative,"i understand things happen, updates don't always go well..... i have over 2000 hours. today i'm told i no longer own it. steam support says piss off it's a bethesda problem....... i bought it from steam. i'd think you stinking cheese bags could offer something in the form of an answer, but you're also the rotten stench mongering asshats that no longer have an actual phone number, email only. really losing faith in steam........ at this point don't buy from steam. if you want it, it's an amazing game, go buy it from bethesda directly. steam has become worthless at 3rd party games.the game itself is great, steam sucks at 3rd party games. buy this one directly from bethesda. they have their own launcher. i'd like to look into transferring my account from a 3rd party to direct!"
Negative,"Game was once filled with potential but now the devs just make 4 big patchs a year with huge unbalanced sweeping changes with no attempt to balance them incrementally. They spew out cash shop microtransation stuff on the regular instead of fixing problems that have been in the game sense its very launch. The pvp population has been dying for a very long time and it is down to a minimal amount of people because of the terrible balance. The devs completely ignore the class rep program that they started. The game is not very alt friendly and they have taken things like skyshards, lorebooks, guilds, mount speed, that should have been account wide and instead made them character wide, very long grinds, but you can pay a premium price in the cash shop to get all these faster. If you want to get into crafting at all they you will NEED to be subbed. If you want to decorate your homes you need to be subbed (some of which can ONLY be bought with real money and can cost well over $100). Anything that you think looks cool like a mount they will want you to pay 10-15 bucks for rather then letting you unlock it in game. If you really want to get into this game be ready to sink your time and your wallet. To reach max cp will take you hundreds of repetitive hours of the same quest just reskinned over and over. The Dungeons are ridiculously easy as well as the overland content offers 0 difficulty or challenge what so ever.  The devs make no attempt to actually balance the game, they go from giant patch to giant patch in attempts to keep players remaking new characters to hopefully get you to invest in the grind shortcuts in the cash shop. This game has turned into a giant money scheme just rolling over players every patch with a new flavor of the month meta. Buyer Beware this game is no longer what it once was or could have been. The Cash Shop ""Crown Crates"" are a gigantic scam. The highest tier rewards usually have less then a 0.2 Drop rate and each crate is roughly 3-4$. As well as their is NO way to get these items outside of the crates. The game has taken steps in a pay to win direction by offering to let you buy entire skill lines fully from the start with money, as well as they have added a cosmetic pet that actually increases your inventory that you can ONLY buy with real money. The game is slowly been getting more and more money grubbing and less and less fun.  This game will SEEM like it is offering you tons to do and endless possibilities but after you really start to get into it you will find all of this is just the same souless, poorly written, 0 challenge content reskinned and repeated over and over. Dont even get me started on the performance issues this game has. It has had the same memory leak bug sense launch which will cause your FPS to drop constantly the longer you play and the only way to fix it is to close out and relaunch the game completely. They break game mechanics such as the Queue finder so often it is embarrassing.  When this game was launching they promised that for as long as you were a Sub all DLC would be free, they then decided to rename 1 of the 4 dlc patchs every year into a ""chapter"" which is effectivly just a DLC with a different name. Even if you are subbed you still have to buy this $30+ dollar ""chapter"" every year. They have strait lied. This game has done a terrible job adhering to the Lore set fourth by the previous Elder Scrolls Titles. This game has broken so much lore that most players I know do not even consider this game to be cannon. In development the map they used to create the in game map was actually a poorly made Fan Made Map from google images. It is filled with all sorts of flaws and idiocy. If you are a Lover of Tes games beware THIS IS NOT A TES GAME. Its a MMO that has SOME tes elements. If you are a lover of Tes Lore then beware, this game is going to break lore and contradict it at every. single. turn.BUYER BEWARE if you want to play this game have your bucket of money ready cause it is going to ask for it every time you turn the corner. I have 3700 hours in this game currently and I have been subbed for most of that time. So I will let you in on a little fact, if you dont sub and buy the new chapters their is only so far you can really go."
Negative,"I think the game is very playable, and have had enjoyable moments of play over time. The graphics are really nice. My issues are with how the game is ran or implemented. Example inventory space seems to be a huge issue, that you must keep buying or pay extra to have more space, and the game throws tons of items at you during play but you already paid for the game go figure but you cant store your items. Huge ""cash grab mentality"" I would not have bought this game if I knew it was going to be this way. The other issue is the patching system. It takes for ever like 48 hours to patch every single update, every single time they decide to roll one out. I dont have this issue with any other game - so its not my side. They need to change how their game patches when I click play I want to play not wait to play 2 days, and I dont allow patching while playing other games while I wait. While I support patching in games its So not worth playing in how its currently implemented. Im not leaving my computer on for 2 days while I go off to work thats a fire hazzard. They really need to change how they issue out pathces or upgrade how its done. Just not worth the membership fee of $15 per month which is over priced since your most of game features are bought in the store or through a cash shop. Then you need to buy the expansions which are sold for the price of a full game. I wouldnt mind this if there was no monthly sub. So after buying the base game you have to pay to sub in order to play and get first class features for a game you already paid full price for. GTFOH :)"
Negative,"Combat is pretty lame and there are way too many in game purchases... After having paid $90AU for all DLC to find that you have to unlock parts of the DLC with in game crown purchases? Gaming isn't a licence to print money and game developers need to know this. Also if the full game and inventory use (craft bag etc.) is subscription based, make the base game free at least, money grabbing Bethesda don't deserve anything. 5/7 would not play again."
Negative,"Not good first impressions, I tried a bow and it's absolutely awful combat gameplay.Lots of stuff to loot around the place at least, but then inventory is slot-limited not weight-limited.The stats are insane, you start with around 22000 hp, seems like the game had some power creep over the years?If you're looking for an experience similar to the singleplayer games you likely won't find it here, depending on what you're after. This is heavily influenced by games like WoW."
Negative,"I hate crown crates. My money and mental health is all gone because of them. The only redeeming quality of this game is the decoration possibilities, which is the only reason I still play this. The gameplay is bland at best, and the stories are all mediocre."
Negative,"jogo bom porem mal otimizado demais, terá sorte se conseguir logar ao invéz de ficar no limbo da tela de loading."
Negative,"Don't accidentally press back at the character screen, the game will lock you out for an hour."
Negative,"I just understand that MMORPGs are meant to me grindy, but at least most of them are you awarding you in some way but this game just does not do it.Levelling up does not give you any movement up because everything is scaled to your level and that means that they don't make any sense because you can be almost all the time same enemies at low level and at high level.Optimisation of the game is a separate topic actually need another down vote.You cannot return this game just because it has a launcher, that will count into your play time so you gonna be over 2 hours before you gonna update the game.overall score: 3/10"
Negative,"The community is tiny, end-game material is lacking, and classes (and skill trees) have huge balance issues in PvP.Many known persistant bugs.Generally, not worth the time."
Negative,doesnt even launch
Negative,"DISCLAIMER! This is a truly fantastic game but please buy it direct from ZOS and NOT from Steam. They have an on-going problem were logging in via the Steam launcher fails. This is now happening at least once a week with no detailed comment or explanation from ZOS and no comment at all from Steam.It's a crying shame as this game's rapidly going from a positive approval to mixed and will be heading into negative very soon if nothing's done.TLDR: My 'No, don't reccomend' rating is for the Steam purchased version, the actual non-Steam version is phenominal!"
Negative,"Do not BUY its a trap. First there are weekly maintenance for only 6 to 16 hours. and not from 00;00 to 16:00 so u can play when its done in Europe, no its from 9:00 to 01:00 makes sense.Second there is A login queue ? that takes as long as it takes.Lastly u would think there would a sorry for the inconvenience here are the rewards u mist because of us,and a little extra for waiting. Yeah i'm regretting my purchase going for my money back.""update"" replies to developer response are disabled. but not mine woop woop.Bethesda_T********* [developer] Posted: 29 Jul @ 10:22pmGreetings,We are sorry to hear that you have recently experienced some server and performance issues.For an update on Game Performance Improvements, please see our forum posts here: https:// //beth.games /2DdSQ8P and here: https:// //beth.games/ 309OHLQ We hope this provides you with information on why these issues occurred and what is being done to ensure that the issues are resolved.Thank you for your review and we hope you'll give ESO another chance.So reply.its not about some server and performance issues. its about the weekly server maintenance, that should be from 00:00 to 06/08:00 standard time for the world. how hard can that be? when it takes as long as 16 hours and people miss rewards should get them.greetings me"
Negative,"A decent looking and fun MMO completely spoiled by the absolute ineptitude of the server maintenance process, roughly once a week the servers will go down for a few hours maintenance which turns into 12hours+ followed by a several hours of login issues. if players are lucky there will be an inane post from one of admins about how they are looking into it, if they are unlucky nothing and several hours will be wasted trying to login - Avoid!"
Negative,60gigabytes download for another program to start another download that doesn't work. Then tells you to get another installer. Soooo I don't think its worth buying at all.Also tried Signing in Thru Steam at the Elderscrollsonline site and it tells to Purchase the game First....
Negative,i wanted to play it......but after downloaded 80GB it told me i had to download another 80GB so noif  this didnt happen it would i guess probably be a good game as most of the elder scrolls are really good
Negative,Game is down every holiday.   It's down again on July 4th.  Why am I spending an extra $15/mo on a game that's only online when i'm at work?
Negative,"Fantastic art, world building, sometimes. Often good writing. Graphically, nothing special.Immersion good if it's supposed to be a single player ES game.It feels like watching someone play a game because there's either a dirth of challenge or even worse none at all.PVE groups are a laughably pointless endeavor other than decent art design. PVP is some sort of console designed combat with classes that are somewhat hidden until you recognize a more unique looking spell; then the class could have like capabilities as the next class anyway. 5 abilities slotted that are instant or 20s CD. There's mana attacks and endurance attacks. I wear heavy armor with good defensive stats that also makes me take additional damage from magic sources. So there's rock paper scissors with armor. I damage, buff myself, heal myself. Imagine every player is similar.I don't care too much about the fighting, just objectives. Mostly because it's pretty hack and slash, maybe interrupt when they get low.You log in and play for 30 minutes to do daily upgrades and group plus battleground. You PVP an hour and get bored or two and you get quite bored. You only slightly improve abilities over time, everything else is pretty static and universal throughout the playerbase. Soloing in the world offers little advancement and little to be proud of.I don't think there's very much meaning to be found in the game as an MMO. Relatively, I think it's going to be super difficult to stand out whatsoever, no matter who you are."
Negative,"its decent.IF YOU IGNORE that you bought a big advert, and the game shoves it in your face what you do not own yet despite having purchased the product proper. you can, for the most part, ignore this, so i did, proudly. games like these... they just fail to convince me to buy their micro tranny penises. though a feeling will eventually creep up on you that you did still buy an expensive dlc, and the game needles you to buy the base game in chunks anyway. *rude*while you may succeed in ignoring this in-game advertisement, it will dawn on you that the content of the game is still not worth the price. as in overall. its a mixture of genuine creativity, ideas and an overly genuine laziness and incompetence with those ideas, with the latter flooding your brain very rapidly. the text and lines have abandoned any ancient touch or medieval feel to them, too quirky/witty or modern, yet still remains in its seriously autistic bethesda writing. i dont know how they did that. its boring at best. the animations feels barely professional, and the lines are highly inadequate and the responses you make are severely autistic. ""go get the book of black magic from the dank elves in that room to the left."" ""i will go get the book of black magic from the dank elves in that room to the left."" ""good. im glad you are an autis- that i can count on you and i appreciate your loyalty and i dont take advantage of you. you are so naiv- i mean brave. good luck"" bet this what you cashsnitchers thought about me all along before you even got me in it, indeed? well played ya fleecing bastards.elder scrolls combat has never been good. its okay. the execution in this game is alike, and the old mmo combat style feels decent enough. you could argue its lazy that they didnt even try to improve the old bethesda style, and you could argue that too many years have passed and its still the same simplified hit and dont be hit bs. you could also pretend like its nothing. there is after all enough already to complain about. so whats the point. give in to the stockholm syndrome. keep your filthy mouth shut. you gave me your money, now take up my offers. you want more dont you? you know i own you now dog. you asked for this, now eat up our candy crown store. eat it up you filthy customer, i say eat it. stupid dogno matter how many expansions you stuff into it, i dont think you can buy this game into something more fun. i dont think thats how it works. though the game tries to make you think so, its very lazily and greedily accomplished. price tagging the tenth race. selling each land worth a base game. loot you cant make use of until you bought this or that addon. please spare me. oh and dont buy that horse for real money for the sake of traveling please. your money deserves better. show some respect for your cash, because this game will not do it for you, it will pee on it.i got the game on sale worth an indie, yet i somehow still feel ripped off. i put money into advertisement aimed at myself, not entertainment. minimum fun. one cannot wrap their head around how anyone in the studio falls asleep content at night. i would feel like a piece of pineapple pizza if i were them. someone in their crew is narcissistic, no respect for customers needs. eats terrible food and no respect for the value of entertainment. but somehow got put in the position of managing sales. why, they must all be lizards devoid of love and life. screw your cold hearts and your soaked pineapples. my big glorious ever-beating heart goes out to those unfortunate that bought it on its release, thinking it was worth the big aaa price, and then got jammed into a thieving monthly pay too. their avarice is reigning supreme, devoid of understanding and compassion. oh the aching. these stupid hoes think aaa is measured in graphics, aint it right stupid hoe? this monopoly is oh so sorrowful. the graphics are undoubtedly not that impressive either. now. did anyone want to buy that rusty dagger i have on sale? i know. it looks like a branch. but thats part of the lethality.do excuse me while i go clean off the newly settled grease on the pages of my dictionary"
Negative,"ESO was essentially the game to PLAY when it first came out, with an outright amazing PVP system. Which unfortunately, overtime became one of the most unbalanced broken pieces of trash in any game i've played. Given that anyone that's not maxed prestige, will get outright SMACKED around by higher level players with no chance at all. Just one maxed player can take on groups by themselves, just because they can. So if you take any kind of break from eso, and not continue to level up constantly. You will have no chance at PVP, and for me that would be the end game content. Therefore, i refuse to play it and have no eagerness to return."
Negative,"This isn't a bad game (you can guess from hours spent on it), but I can't recommend a game that locks out a good portion of steam users for hours after each server maintenance. For months. Without any meaningful comment on the matter or a fix. Doing long maintenance on Saturday morning with typical issues for the rest of the day during in-game event was the last straw. (The fact that literally everyone knew that event itself will be frustrating due to another longstanding bug, is kinda par for the course for this game as well).Yep, still going to play, because I'm addicted and there *are* fun part in it, but this sort of mess can't be ignored."
Negative,"Well, I sort of do, and don't and here's why:!!! BUYER BEWARE !!!If you buy this game through Steam YOU WILL BE LOCKED OUT FOR A DAY OR TWO at least once a month. The reasons are unknown to us, players, as neither Steam nor Zenimax Online is at the top of their game when it comes to Customer Service...Tamriel awaits, but you'll do yourself a favour if you buy from the official store and leave the Steam version well alone. (the difference is the price mainly as well as the fact that if you buy into the Steam version, you will HAVE TO log in through Steam, which, as mentioned above, breaks after literally every small update, while for non-Steam users the launcher works just fine)Otherwise good little game and massive map! Quite enjoyable, even for a non-MMO player like myself and most people I meet and chat with are really nice, there's a proper community."
Negative,this game is trash scaming buying everything dlc expensive to get good gear and make fk rule themself and they neft every fking time the set even when you upgrade to max quality and neft class to fking weak dont buy this game
Negative,"Can't say I strongly recommend it. Feels like any class requires spells (Not skills, but spells) ruining my warrior roleplay! If you enjoy the Elder Scrolls lore you could probably get a lot out of it, but I can't really say, as a player of TES since Morrowind, that it lived up to my expectations in terms of gameplay or difficulty"
Negative,"I do recommend this game to anyone but don't buy it through steam unless you want to potentially have issues with playing the game. My experience has been that I got about 2 hours play time in total and then got hit with the issue where you can't log in (tried for next hour or so to log in) similar to other users. I got a refund and purchased it directly through them.Fond out, as of April 7, 2023 the problem still persists for people. May not affect everyone but YMMV."
Negative,i can't even login i don't get access code fuck this game
Negative,I like how you made it free for 2 days then added in a long maintenance during the 2 days
Negative,"Don't buy this game on steam, it has frequently login issues for steam users. So if you want to buy the game buy it directly from Esos site not from here."
Negative,"I have this in my steam library only because i keep forgetting why i refunded it, then re-buying it; Not my type of MMO really."
Negative,"I can't overstate how disappointing this game is.  Now, its true I didn't keep playing it, so maybe it gets better.  I got out of the towe and in town and then just couldn't keep going.  Its also $15 a month.  Really?  I wouldn't buy this again just for the base price."
Negative,"tl:dr: No, if I was a new player now, I would not purchase this game and I cannot recommend it to anyone at this time who wants to do end game raiding eventually. This game is exhausting and the devs do not understand how to balance or fix their own game. At this time I cannot recommend this game to anyone who wants to do end game group content (now or in the future). While I generally enjoy the game, the dev team cannot seem to make up their mind and have no idea how to balance a game. Every 3 months, how this game works drastically changes, making it difficult for new players to adapt and learn how to play the game. They are rapidly coming out with harder and harder end game content that only the very top player base can clear even a year after being out, but they are planning to lower damage, healing and completely change how many skills work. Elder Scrolls Online heavily relies on its player base to guide new players through it's content since the games lacks any real tutorial or skill developing assistance so these changes are not only hard on players who have just bought the game, but wear out the older, more experienced player base, driving valuable teaching resources away from the game.  Let me be clear, I am not a top end raider but it has been difficult to see players who were very invested in teaching mechanics, getting people new clears (be it a trifecta or their first vet trial clear) and just generally helping people learn how to play the game leave over the past few patches because the dev team doesn't seem to be listening to the end game players about how the end game experience actually is. And on the other side, I have also seen players newly interested in end game content get discouraged when one patch they seem to be figuring things out; how to weave, how to play a class, finally getting somewhere on the trial dummy and in raid content only for the game to completely change and their damage nerfed because ""damage is too high."" As someone who does try to help new tanks, dps and healers learn new trials on both vet and normal, the new players generally feel better and are more willing to keep trying when overall damage is high even if they spend a lot of time dying. I cannot recommend this game to anyone when I feel like the dev team nerfs damage because a couple groups being able to clear their latest Hard Mode content means damage is too high. What would be more effective at getting newer players into content would be fixing bugs in their game and optimizing how the game uses your cpu. It's really hard and frustrating to respond to mechanics you can't see/respond to in time."
Negative,"As a game it's about what you can expect from an MMORPG. I don't think it has much appeal for someone not already familiar with the universe. As to those who are familiar with the universe, it heavily abuses established lore, and can feel silly at times. In addition, whenever maintenance is done, you won't be able to access the game at all for at least three hours. Today I first tried to log in twelve hours ago, and am still unable to do so. This is far from a rare occurence, and shows what can only be described as a total disregard for the player base.Even were it acceptable to have the game inaccessible for so long, when no other MMORPG will be offline for the same duration, ESO has two servers, one in North America and one in Europe. You, player, are able to have separate characters on each one, and it would be easy for them to run maintenance on one server at a time. They do not. Instead, they consistently do their maintenance at what is the middle of the night for North America but peak time for Europe."
Negative,"The craft bag should be a free feature available to anyone. Seeing that I hate subscription models and committing every day to the game in order to get my money's worth, I consider it unacceptable and scummy, considering other MMOs offer such a basic feature completely free of charge. Can't commit into crafting whatsoever without my inventory becoming full every five damn minutes.Then there's the constant adding of store items that are unreasonably expensive and often don't fit into the game at all, being incredibly flashy and edgy (and then you're forced to watch half the players run around in it, further ruining what's left of immersion, which feels like this game's last saving grace), useless exploitative lootcrate system that hardly drops anything of any value.And as of now, the servers for EU steam users have been down for two days, when all I want to do is login for the daily reward progress in order to get the Murkmire addon for free near the end of the month. Guess that's their way of denying us that little bit of free content.I return to it once in a while hoping things changed for the better, but so far they never did."
Negative,"ESO is off to a very shaky start with me. Considering because it's not instanced, and things re-spawn very quickly, you can't stop and look around to figure out where you need to go and what you need to be doing, so the very first sequence of things you needed to do in Coldharbor was almost incomprehensible. Finally get to Tamriel, and, bluntly, things didn't get any better. I died twice inside of two minutes because of how quickly things respawn and start attacking you when you respawn. More to come later, and I hope it gets better, because if it doesn't, this is a wasted $30, and yet another MMO that expresses the very essence of why I typically despise the things."
Negative,"This game is genuinely boring, i've played skyrim and a bit of oblivion and enjoyed both games, but this game, ha. this game is something else, its in a world of it own, and by that i mean it is boring, so fucking boring, i've played 4 hours but i feel like i've had to play hundred, this game has ruined my life, not even a joke, 4 hours i will never get back, if you are on the fence for buying this game and maybe you'd even like to get it to play with friends, dont, stay clear of this game, truly the worst fucking game ever. point a to b to c and then kill someone and then point a to b to c again, the most boring and repetitive gameplay ever. playing this game and ever 4 hours of playing this game i was in a constant rage, constant. as in not once enjoying the game, shit game. dont play this game,m if you hjave ANY respect for yourself and your time dont play it. i genuinely cannot think of a positive thing to say anout this game. combat is shit story uninsteresting and unimmersive the game looks like shit and like shitty skyrim mod, fuck this game and fuck all this propaganda pushing retards who are rating this game positively fuck all of you"
Negative,"The skills feel bland, like if they were constraint. Your chosen class feels like an apprentice of what the real one should be.For example, Warden plays just like a mage or smth.What’s the point of having “animal companion” skill tree, if none of them use companions? There’re just spells with animal names. Yeah, you can have a Bear, and that’s it! Your gameplay is 100% the same of a generic mage. How boring is that?You can only have a couple of active skills, and to use more, you need to switch weapons mid-fight. The game forces you to have 2 weapons no matter what. Oh, but you’re a Dragonknight and wants to use only two-handed swords? Nice, go and have 2 fkng swords equipped, so you can switch and use more than 5 skills. How dumb is this?The switch weapon thing would be great IF your active skills weren’t so limited, and IF that wasn’t an obligatory thing. Just to visualize what I’m talking about, look at POE (different game I know, but just visualize the mechanic, ok?). They have just a couple of active skills as well, and you can switch your weapon mid-fight to use the skills on that weapon. Now, you can have +2 bars of skills pressing Ctrl or Shift, and you don’t NEED to use another weapon if you don’t want too, cuz the game doesn’t want to limit your options, even if it wants you to have 5 main active skills. There’s a lot of passive skills, many unlocked by quests and joining guilds… but also locked behind expansions. Yeah, that’s right, you bought the game, and found that’s a cOoL one that would be fun to have… now go and pay for a whole expansion (:Every skill can be upgraded to one of two options. Sounds great, more customization and changes to your gameplay. But, you forgot we are following a logic here:Your skills use two things: stamina or magicka. When you upgrade a skill, it will usually benefit of ONE of these two. Got it? If you’re adding stamina, you will benefit from stamina skills, they will consume it or have more damage based on that. So, are you doing stamina or a magicka build? There I go, with my half-baked customization of a character, using my bland class skills and switching weapons to use more than just a couple of them. The game can be great in lore, environmentalization, quests and such, but if you’re fking breaking my legs I will not suffer walking around for too long. Cheers."
Negative,unplayable because of ping issue in NewZealand
Negative,Awesome game but DON'T BUY on STEAM - constant login Issues!
Negative,"nekupujte tuto hru , olupia vas NPCčka"
Negative,Terrible ping for SE Asia region. The lag has gotten even worse lately until unplayable.
Negative,"Stunning game, high amount of detail and touches.So I decided to come back and give all this another try - its free and worth playing for a while.  The combat system takes a while to get used to and basically normal attacks are pointless and abilities get reset after a while or perhaps an update."
Negative,"I can't recommend buying it through Steam. I've owned it for a few weeks now and had nothing but issues when logging in through Steam.A quick google of ESO Steam login issues or a look at the BethesdaSupport twitter will show you what i mean.The game itself is awesome. A solid MMO thats surprisingly solo friendly for 90% of its content. So if you are interested, make sure to buy it from Zenimax directly and use their launcher, as the steam setup is thoroughly broken."
Negative,"It's a fairly decent MMO, just my only issue is why make people pay for the Imperial race, that seems just unfair to me. Same for some of the DLC that should be already in the game in the first place like the Thieves Guild, the Dark Brotherhood and Cyrodiil. At least make some of the DLC super cheap or free, it's kinda unfair and annoying. The combat is a bit.. meh, it could use some work and the quests are okay. Depending on what faction you start in, you could end up with a toxic player community or a very friendly one, so far Dominion has been the friendliest to me. Also, after the new update, grinding, leveling and such do not really matter anymore due to level scaling, the only thing leveling does matter for is basically PvP. Honestly, I wish they'd go back to where level scaling were only in the dungeons and DLC. I am not a fan of PvP so... I have no reason to play this game or level, Zenimax and Bethesda has made it very obvious that they're not meant to make and manage MMOs since they've put in SO MANY god damn terrible ideas into the game like I mentioned before, the DLC and the level scaling. The Level scaling makes leveling feel like there's no need to level as everything just scales down to your level (if you attack a mob). The housing is okay, but houses should be cheaper. (at least the small ones) ESO is still okay in my book, I've seen worse MMOs, but this is nowhere near my top 10 list of MMOs. Level 1-50 are the worst of the game as well and the Champion (Veteran) Level cap is just god damn ridiculous, no one wants to spend months on end leveling to 600 with no reward what-so-ever.If you like PvP, then this game is for you, if you don't (like me) then it is not.Now I DO like ESO, but it was better 2 years ago, now it's just meh or decent. Honestly, I think Zenimax AND Bethesda should hand ESO over to a company that knows what they're doing when it comes to MMOs."
Negative,"How can this game still be so shit when it comes to its servers. Like come on, surely with all the eso plus subscriptions, you could afford to improve your servers, instead of having dog shit, out of date servers. Don't even get me started on the PVP servers. They are the worst servers I have ever played on, nothing even comes in at a close 2nd. For a game that is built around skill rotation, you can't sit back and say the servers are fine. Skills don't go off, instant cast skills feel like they have cast timers, bar swapping doesn't register half the time, stun break doesn't register half the time. If you won't upgrade your servers, at least fix the issues causing the lag. The pvp bug (stuck in combat so you cant change any skills or armor) has been plaguing the pvp for years, and its still a thing in 2023. Just fix ya fkn servers and most of your issues will be fixed, you make enough money from the Eso Plus scam, the least you owe the community is to fix the issues of server performance."
Negative,"Honestly, the game is pretty boring. The story's fine, but the combat is bad, the enemies are never unique, and overall its just way too simple compared to other mmo's. Seriously think about buying before doing so. And if you do, wait for a sale or something."
Negative,"I was banned for exploiting/cheating because one of my friends who was Lv286 gave me 5,000,000 gold via the in game mailing system and i bought a 340k gold house and a horse totaling (390k) and gave 2m to my other friend."
Negative,"***Dont buy this game on steam***It is available for a fraction of the price at other stores, one store was selling it for £10 including £8 worth of crowns to spend in game, that makes it £2 while steam sell it for 15 times that! I just wish i'd checked first"
Negative,"Lore and story is good.Combat blows hardno auction house, so making cash is fairly tough.Leveling system is overly complex and not really that intuitive.but yeah, combat (a core game mechanic)  is awful, feels bad, and makes me not want to play."
Negative,"horrible pvp performance.edit 1: its still horrible performance even the servers are changed...if you think about starting this game for PVP, DO NOT DO THAT.edit 2: year 2023, thanks for streak block bug nice game. March 2023edit 3: break free bug is online again. lets gooo. May 2023edit 4: the game is free now and it comes with the problem of huge lag because of the servers are not capable to handle with this much player but who cares right? August 2023.edit 5: I guess the developer who answered my review is one of the developer who does not play the game ofc since %95 of them do not play. He does not know that this game is unplayable without ESO+ and you need to buy every episode to be able to farm the new items which they make overpowered first to sell episode and then nerf. You have to buy ESO+ and you have to buy chapters. I do not care the furnishing or outfit things in crown store.edit 6: Login error bug is online. You can not login game whenever you want, you can login when the game let you. ahahahah horrible... August 2023edit 7: You can kicked by server anytime and you get unexpected internal error which means you have to stop playing ESO untill the game let you to log back to the game. September 2023. I really do not know why I pay every month for this game...edit 8: I am writing from June 2024, game is now became mega pay to win. mega mega pay to win.There are bugs for all the time, delays, performance issues, broken skills (I dont mean op skills, mentioning about the skills which do not work lol) and pay to win things in pvp and there will be for all the time in future.If you want to play a pve game, go for it.it is not bad as pve.but for pvp, megabad."
Negative,"To be honest, this game was a disappointment. It feels very little like the previous games, and more like a typical cookie cutter MMORPG. What I was expecting was an open world MMO game that would be unique like the previous elder scrolls games (not including the lore), with encounters being very random, and quite a bit of freedom to do as I please, and my biggest two pet peevs, the magic/skill system, and the inventory problems that struggle with constantly to an extent I become enraged and depressed simultaneously.To elaborate on the skill system, when I first saw it and unlocked more abilities, it was overwhelmingly unexciting and almost demeaning with an extreme lack in variety, personalization, and effectiveness, unlike the previous games, however Skyrim had a lacking magic system compared to Oblivion, so it seemed to be declining in that aspect already.So, in my opinion, this game is not really worth playing for fulfilment and a all around good time simply due to the poor game mechanics. There is also some problems with quests as well feeling monotonous after a bit, but that was somewhat of a side note, but does contribute to the lack of playibility none the less.Overall, I give the game about a 2.5/10."
Negative,"I know not even 3 hours...well I could not handle another fetch quest or run to point A to run to point B to run back to A then to C then back To B then back to A.........There is no depth, no epic...ness?? My fiance and I tried so hard to like this as we loved all the Elder Scroll games and wow...so disappointing, for us anyway.  The quests seem so bland, the fighting is so boring, you can just mash buttons and never get hurt, there is no challenge, no point in blocking, just stand there and hit 1,2,3,4 and some mouse clicks...next.I don't see what there is too like here.  Just my thoughts.EDIT: I thought about it and the main reason it's probably so crappy to me is probably the combat when theres no challenge I don't care what comes next...when your playing and you have a huge fight that you barely survived it's exciting and you can't wait to do the next thing but here it's just nothing, pretty to look at no substance."
Negative,"LOl , i just cant believe my eyes! I am a veteran player - stopped playing ESO right before Morrowind. And i am soooo disapointed of what I am seeing now. I have to pay around 10 k crows to acquire Summerset, Morrowind and  Clockwork , which is arround 70 euros . Come on! This is a robbery. ZeniMax is robbing players. Every 3-6 months new content comes out and you should pay for it in order to play. Jesus, just release the fu***ng game all at once and put a normal price on it. So sad that gaming industry looks only to make profit, not better games and content. I cant say that ESO's content is worth so much.Dont buy it if you are not prepared to pay constantly and periodically in the following years."
Negative,"As someone who invested 12k+ hours into this game (including pre-steam time) I cannot seriously recommend this game to anyone.- Constant performance issues, things that could have easily been fixed have yet to be fixed- Obnoxious amount of monetization; no incentive to do content in the game for rewards because most of them end up in the premium shop anyway- Combat and Gameplay team constantly catering to the lowest common denominator; No reason to learn the mechanics/content of the game because they change everything around every 3 months, and have outright said they prefer for people to not master the game so they don't make new players look bad.If you want an Elder Scrolls fix, this'll do if you play sporadically. If you're looking for a game to invest your time in, walk away, it's not worth the hassle."
Negative,"Love hate this game.Love hate relationship with this game, for an MMO its stability is abysmal, but if you wanna play solo, plenty of content to satisfy you and generally no issues. That however shouldn't be the norm for a MMO.*edit:What I meant as stability for an MMO is that the game is not stable. Widespread problem of people crashing, disconnection or desyncing. But yeah im sure someone with 6000+ hours just needs to 'check the guides' *roll eyes*"
Negative,have hardly played the game because apparently i have to pay more to be a necromancer and it has the most painful name creation with zero feed back on why the names won't accept i have ever endured. very poor character creation experience and clearly pay to play elements jammed into my face after having already payed for the game.
Negative,game bad dont play!!!!!!! nerfed my characters after hours of play
Negative,The servers and queue system is really ♥♥♥♥ed up
Negative,Awful combat and business practices
Negative,"Never, ever, ever buy or subscribe through Steam unless you want to constantly be going back and forth with the most useless support in gaming and get nowhere."
Negative,"I've spent hundreds of hours on this game, but I don't remember why. Compared to Skyrim, this was a bore that lost all authenticity. Nothing feels as special as the original astonishment Skyrim brought. Exploring ancient dungeons that have been lost for ages, and revealing their secrets as 'the dragonborn', 'the chosen one', 'the main character', is a joke when that dungeon feels like it's been turned into a summerparty vacation destination with the amount of 'other chosen ones' already there. The bosses are repetitive, nearly identical, and all feel like speed runs."
Negative,"A pretty fun game, but if you have plans to start on one server then join someone on another server(na to eu or viseversa) then enjoy making a new character and having to repurchase everything you bought with real money. Its just a money grab."
Negative,"After many many hours of enjoying this game, it pretty much came to an end after I leveled an entire roster to level cap. The endgame just wasn't done well enough. The end game PvE is stale, not very challenging at all. You find yourself enjoying early-mid game PvP and I used that mostly to level up all of my characters. It was fun, challenging, and mostly balanced throughout all of the matches. Once you reach level cap though, it's a one-sided steamroll every time and suddenly you're dying in one hit no matter what kind of gear you have on. Overall just a huge disappointment for the end game."
Negative,"Not providing SEA server its a big deal of a problem, not just high latency within PVP mode, in PVE mode also i need to wait up 3 seconds for every dialogue with one NPC. This game have a good concept, mech, and very fun gameplay. its just my other ""Trove"" game"
Negative,"Sad to see paid mods in Skyrim as well. Had to wait a week of ""maintenance"" just for all my mods to break. Fuck Bethesda for endlessly milking a 12 year old game. I won't be surprised if Skyrim just gets more oppressive updates instead of TES6 being worked on."
Negative,"I bought this game to be able to see more of tamriel and that's cool, I guess. The game itself is repetitive boring quests that have me skip all of the dialog. The combat can be fun and there's more to do than Skyrim ever had. Still it never felt like I got anywhere and not a good use of time."
Negative,It's too boring.
Negative,Is free but is not
Negative,"Game has great systems and is pretty innovative on how things are implemented. With that being said, pretty fucking boring."
Negative,"Geting permanently banned for a character name instead of leting me change it , not cool game"
Negative,"Every single dungeon and even the class I wanted to play are locked behind paywalls... On top of this, the combat felt clunky. (Ez refund)"
Negative,have to restart the game almost everytime im doing a new mission because it wont load properly
Negative,launcher stuck on loading. cant even get to a point where i have the option to launch the game.
Negative,"Not friendly to new players. Yeah most games are not really newbie-friendly but I've played for 15 hours still wondering ""what the heck am I doing?"" Overrated. Not bad as a game but still overrated. Regret buying this."
Negative,"Youre a passive observer that kills mindless baddies. No choice making. No story. No paarthurnax dilemma. theres no roleplay in this mmorpg. Yeah its cool, but the majority of any real fun youll have will come from your friends, not the actual content itself."
Negative,"I can solve the horrendous inventory issues with a premium subscription, why can't I solve for the 25 quest limit with the same subscription? Honestly I frequently just stop playing this game simply because of the UI:- 25 quest limit- Terrible inventory with massive inventory bloat only solved with a premium subscription- Maps that where never designed with anything in mind: legibility, immersion or functionalityUI minimalism is not what is going on here at all, it's simply embarrassing UI design.Look Elder Scrolls is already a lot of alien landscapes that aren't very intuitive with difficult terrain. I don't mind wandering around but sometimes I would like to scratch some shit off of the 3k+ quests list you guys are rolling with. You have dailies, guild quests, story quests, side quests, prologue quests, PVP quests, event quests... give me a break having to re write the journal every time I decide I want a break from one location to the next (especially post max level when I can go anywhere in the world).The game has great writing and quests besides the navigational issues and sometimes thematically repetitive quest-lines... and way too much watch the ghosts tell a story and ye olde faire type stuf... Honestly any complaints about the quests can all be countered with: but they are all voice acted.Graphics are good especially considering some of the quirky original design choices require some creativity to make them feel like fully developed cultural aesthetics without turning them too much into real world mirrors. They were designed, after all, to be rendered in graphics from another time. Sometimes improving the resolution on that requires some refinement of the aesthetic and its all pretty good.Combat mechanics are acceptable. It's trying to be as classless as it can and honestly it's brave and mostly works. That said there are classes, which is confusing...It's well done enough, if sometimes maybe not feeling as spectacular and impactful as a fully themed class based game. Maybe that's why in the end they still have classes, to try and add some of that impact back in, but the classes that are there sort of just frame the magic for you. I guess that makes the thematics they decided to associate with those frames feel out of place and slapped on. It's a hedged bet that mostly works though I can't help but feel they could have just lumped some thematic magic groups together and gave them synergistic passives that make you want to use them together (a mechanic they already use in the classes), though perhaps I am expecting to much of the players.There I said some nice things now stop fucking torturing me with a 25 quest journal limit. No there are not add-ons that fix this. I have to go in and drop quests then go refind those quests then pick them back up. Doing a zone with a friend and want to switch when he logs off? Tough shit. Went to PvP zone and want to hold on to some quests you picked up when going  back to a dungeon? No have to drop them.I don't need an anti-hoarding life lesson or for a game to treat quests like chores that ruin my fun if I don't finish, I just want to roam around and not have to figure out which quests I can drop that inconvenience me the least when some a-hole runs out of a bush screaming about cannibal elves eating his neighbors and he needs my help... or needs me to fetch a daedric tablecloth from a nearby tomb for his daughter's quinceañera... or watch that same quinceañera from the first era played out by ghosts but the tablecloth eats the daughter and I have to find her bones by smoking giant lice keratin or whatever its going to be."
Negative,"A macrotransaction mall with a game attached, some of which is ""free"" with purchase."
Negative,"TL;DR great game that felt into casualization, pandering to new players while ignoring the older ones, dead PVP, hardcore moderation against any criticism (Even banning people on Twitch for simply typing the words PVP) and monetization is scammy at best.This MMO used to be one of the best out there... emphasis on ""used to"". The game is great if you´re new and have all the content to explore, the game is terribly boring and unchallenging for anyone who has play it for some years, since I´m the latter, I´ll review it from that perspective.After more than 4 years playing this game ignoring the performance issues is just impossible, and off course you have the ""fanbois"" to defend it saying all MMOs guet maintenance, but how many do have it every week, sometimes several on the same week and 3/5 times it breaks the game which result in further maintenance? That would be entry point into TESO problems, and if it was just that it will be beareable, but sadly is not.PVP was already kind of dying when I started playing 4 years ago, and after many many patches and performance adressing updates nowadays is... worst. It would be great if it worked even if it´s not the best PVP out there, but there´s a reason they have to force a PVP event every 5 months so the entire PVP side doesn´t die out... didn´t matter, died out regardless since when the event starts the servers explode, they have to add more but you will still have to wait hours to queque into Cyrodill (another word that could get you banned on twitch recently).But what about pve? well, how much do you like to fall sleep on ""veteran hardcore HM full speed/no death run""? Because that´s what will happen, and it doesn´t matter if you are low level because the game boost low levels so they can do content with high end players; in fact, level 10 players tend to have better raw attributes than level 50 players if you remove sets from both. This casualization has reached all faccets of PVE in this game, from the regular overland to trials. Back in 2018 at least we had veteran trials, but since plenty of bad players complained they were unable to complete this content and there´s a furniture/titles/mounts and what not hidden under those in-game achievements, they started removing mecs, being very open to allow addons that will telegraph every single thing happening so you don´t have to learn it or even do it since there´s also addons to lightweaving correctly, macros, tell you when to drop which skill... and even then, who would need that when right now there´s people doing Vet Maelstorm on a ""one bar/ one skill"" and clearing it?? That´s right, the most hardcore content to solo when I started playing 4 years ago, nowadays you can complete from CP700 onwards with a single button, just spamming the same skill and allowing passives from skill lines, class and sets to do the rest of the work.And none of this is due to leveling up, like a said CP700 is enough, but you would take years to become CP700 right? not really, most newer players get to CP1200 in 3 months tops, it used to be really hard to level up, but even that had to become more casual. And even then, why even do it? There´s an important CP cap that makes keep leveling up pointless. So, no value in leveling up, low level character stronger than higher level, and content being able to be cleared with one button.But off course that´s not all. PVP is dead, PVE is for kids... but what about the community? Well, just give yourself a tour around the steam forums where everyone insult each other and only those critical with the game get banned and their threads deletead. And at least you can see some spice in here, because official forums shut down accounts in their entirety the moment someone goes ""well I don´t know about this new system..."". The funny thing, is they don´t even need to that, because fanboyism for this game hits hard, no wonder considering the price, people have to obviously simp for the product is base game, an in game house and 2 DLCs can cost you 90€.Oh yeah, did I forgot to mention how disgusting the monetization for this game is? You know in mobile games those ""time saver"" items so you can open a chest faster? Change chest for research and you have those in here. But is not the only thing, besides the subscription that you will need (because playing without it is pure pain past certain level, get ready to create 8 more characters just to hold all your trash), this game launches one ""big DLC"" each year, it cost as much as a triple A new game and provides around 6 hours of pretty much the same tone and resolution type of narrative; but that´s not all, no sir, you hve to also buy the 2 dungeons that open up the story for 2,000 crowns. How much is a crown? well there´s a steam pack with 3,000 that cost around 30€, and this game has NPCs for your house for 5K crown and in game houses with no real value other than decorating for 19k crowns. So you do the maths.But is there something salvable? Yes, housing. THis game has the best and most complet decorating system in gaming, that can´t be denied... except it´s a gold sink in game, has no real value and like I said they expect you to pay 100€ for the best in-game houses. Not even kidding, there´s actual in-game purchases that oten to over 100€... and Microsft said they are not a monetization heavy company, yeah right, either that´s a lie or ZOS are really good at keeping anyone at MCS out of their bussiness.This game won´t die so easily, it´s being near it several times, but every time they manage to get new players and save themselves from actually imprrving the game for all, not just those new players. Funny thing is that even that weights on the product, as they have never deleted a single account created which consumes server data and that affects to the many many performance problems. You´ll get a lot of comments from people saying none of this matter, that is the best MMO out there and those who don´t see it are stupid, but you can look at my hours played versus those players or do a quick look around the net to see what´s the oppinion on any of these issues I just mention outside of official forums or Steam forums (which are controlled by selected moderators by the developers and therefor they control as well). Just going to reddit and searching for TESO ban provides already a pretty fun read about ZOS thinks of players the moment they make even the slightliest criticism. Again, people getting banned from saying ""pvp"" ""cyrodill"" or ""cyro"" on twitch, look it up and have fun.I rate this game 0 GBs of quality out of the 135GBs in total that the complete installation requieres; plus the 100% GPU usage the game does since 2 months ago when yet another update aim at improving performance only did it worst, and it´s only like the 157th time that happens so you know, trully a work in progress on providing over priced garbage."
Negative,"Launcher open, makes me happy. Play button ""works"" and give me hope. I see nothing but a black. ""ESO has stopped responding"".10/10 - reminds me of the love from my family. Nice but VERY abrupt."
Negative,"Incredibly boring gameplay and story. Nothing seems to have any proper effects in combat, including PvP.Unless you're a huge fan of the world and story just skip this game."
Negative,"Such a beautiful game. Unless you play MMO's because you like to craft.Let me say this. If you like to adventure, explore, do quests, this game is really nice.In my opinion, the leveling system is a mess. As you level, so do the monsters. I guess that means you are not really leveling. Sure you get skills to increase you damage, etc but is that really leveling. The same wolf you killed at level 3 with 3 attacks now takes 5 attacks. It can hardly hurt you but everything starts taking soooo much longer. Unless you invest every skill point in combat.Which brings me back to why you can't play this game as a crafter. As you spend skill points on crafting skills the monsters get better and better. Eventually that same wolf is now a challenge and you find it very hard to survive against quality foes. I just can't understand how MMO's are going to this new non-leveling system.  I started hunting sky shards to get more skill points and now the game is no longer fun.What a shame for such a beautiful world."
Negative,"can't even refund it because i had to update the game while it is running, and i tried for 4 hours to fix triangles on the terrain and missing water textures. Everything else looked fine, but it was just the terrain and water textures messing up."
Negative,had 16k hours on ps4 and above 1k on pc tottaly enjoyed all the dlcs and all the changes in eso pve was hard at first but got new player friendly with the new updates pvp is fun once you tottaly understand how to build a great build it has all a mmo needs. i tottaly rate it highly and it's time rewarding u cant accept to be good in couple hours at allso here i am not recommending the game WHY? i spent over 16k hours in this game? i was a console peasant who had almost 16k hours on ps4? spent my whole pocket on this game it was a amazing experience when i first tried it out in 2015 areas were not scaled me and my buds got stuck on first dungeon due to difficulty it was banished cells progressing seemed meaningful because you couldint get into certain areas until you did quests but zos had to ruin it to scale all enemies and open the whole world and call it a freedom removed the very core of progressing made everything easier raised everyone hp back then when u start as a lvl 1 u would have 8k hp and 6k stam mag look rn u start with that much u snowball to endgame content WAIT theres no endgame its a joke its easy and no mounts rewards everything is pay to win cosmetics in store is way better then obtainable in game no good rewards from missions overland bosses are a joke dev team is predatory with their prices they ignore the community  ignore pve and pvp and i officially quit the game long ago it's sad to leave a game i gave my time and money for to see it like this hopefully i see a similar game but better and upgraded then eso... edited : the game became casual harbor if ur looking for a place to root urself to eso is not the place. overland enemies are too easy to the point it bores u out theres hardly any challenge and only dlc dungeons are challenging.
Negative,"Servers are crap, downtime is horrendous, and they cant even give a timeframe for beeing able to login again... otherwise its a DLC fest with many things you cant do unless you shell out the big bucks.What happend to you bethesda..."
Negative,"Great Game but horrible business model. Their loot box system, I.e. ""Crown crates"" hold all the aesthetically best cosmetics which all have a less than 1% chance per loot box. As someone who both bought the game and is paying a monthly subscription, i'd expect everything in the game to be obtainable through gameplay and not behind a paywall. Devs need to stop spending so much time on paywall blocked cosmetic shit and spend that time on improving the game instead."
Negative,great game. but login issues... and infinite loading screens... very frustrating. :(
Negative,Don't buy through steam. Please.
Negative,"Buy it, but do not buy it on Steam. There has been an ongoing problem with Steam/ESO that prevents users who purchased via Steam after a certain date from logging in. The problem has occured 3 or 4 times I have been trying to play since I purchased a few weeks back. I finally gave up and just bought the standard edition from the Elder Scrolls Online website. Luckily all of my characters and purchases from the cash shop transferred. That being said, it's a pretty fun MMO and the monthly membership fee of $14.99 is optional but does provide you with a ""crafting bag"" that allows you to store infinite materials for crafting and also gives you access to the majority of content that has been added after release (excluding the newest expansion ""Summerset""). It's a nice blend of questing and open world PvE content with dungeons that are mostly combat focused with some nice gear drops to keep your character stylish and effective up to level 50. Tons of dialogue, all voiced it appears, helps engage you in the quest lines. Luckily the majority of which are not simple fetch quests."
Negative,"16 Mar, 2018Servers sucksupdate 17 Jul, 2020 : servers still sucks it took me whole day to finish downloading an update lolupdate 2 June 2021 : Servers still sucks the download has been on for so long by now and still 24% download I only wanted to give this game a try because WoW sucks currentlyJust finished downloading and the ping is still high tooupdate 23 Nov 2022: at this point why would I even download the game? well I don't know but the servers are still garbage. Literally go play Final Fantasy xiv or WoW. Hell you will have a better experience in minesweeper on Windows XP"
Negative,U35 ruined the game
Negative,Best game i ever played!
Negative,"It gets better, but only if you're willing to spend the first 500 hours grinding it and hating it. Buying ESO+ as well as other paid content is almost necessary for early stages of the game in order to unlock most if not all things for your main character.Also, there is virtually no cosmetic rewards for playing the game. Nothing to grind for and nothing to achieve. Everything is in the store. Behind lootboxes."
Negative,i like the crafting the friends the open world don't like npc shops give nothing for gold on drops and buying thing is killing me in game repars needed ya but what about a tradin for better or same ammer if it cant be repared they still have some bugs like the logout erre whin you are playing that takes you bake to the log pagedon't like how they changed the start of the game i miss the old starthave to change it from like to they are killing the game play with all the dlc
Negative,"They don't know how to fix servers. But if you are from NA, it's ok.Edit: Correction. They are just cheap b***** and don't upgrade the server to the demand of the active players, but they can sell you a lot of loot boxes. Aaall the loot boxes.Edit 2: They have talked about getting performance increase and stability after the whole mess in the previous year. The EU megaserver still has the same issues as last year atm. It's just talk. Nothing was improved server wise."
Negative,"This game is simply too buggy to recommend. When I describe ""buggy"" I don't mean momentary server issues, but bugs that have plagued the game for months (possibly years -- but I've only played a few months). Here are a few examples of things you can look forward to almost every time you sit down to play:- Hard crash to desktop issues (especially during zone changes)- Game gets stuck on loading screen (especially during zone changes)- Login errors that prevent you from signing in (especially bad with Steam customers)- Getting ""lost"" in the dungeon finder queue and never being connected with other players- Getting ""instance if full"" error messages when you try to connect with a dungeon finder group- Targeting issues due to poor physics implementation- Jumping and character issues due to poor physics implementation- 3D game engine issues (e.g. invisible walls and objects)- Stealth and detection bugs when playing a thief- Bodies are not lootable- Getting ""stuck"" in combat and not being able to engage with any world objects; requires hard restart- Major usability issues (e.g. no way to exit a dungeon)- Insanely long load times for the game (FYI: my machine is new 2018 and a beast)- Yet another console port with horrific PC controlsIf you haven't already purchased the game, there are far better options out there with less issues. If you find yourself attracted to the Elder Scrolls world due to games like Skyrim, you're likely to be disappointed in that area as well because outside of the lore, it shares nothing in common gameplay-wise.The player churn alone should be a warning to most players: we started a guild and a month later, at 65 members, over half our players were already inactive because they stopped playing the game. I'm used to having to complete with other guilds for members, not trying to stop players from quitting the game due to all the bugs and poor usability.It's too bad the product and engineering team can't get their stuff together and remedy these issues -- I REALLY want to like this game."
Negative,They put the dlc quest markers in the base game .  After returning to play and getting a few dlc required quests I just quit.
Negative,Couldnt login so i'm gonna refund and buy the non-steam version
Negative,"It's an OK game. I'd argue that immersion is always harder in MMOs, so accounting for that, I don't think it went that far off the mark of, ""Skyrim online"", give or take the winter wonderland graphics. Most quests seem to be, ""go to X, kill what you find on the way,"" so it's not the game for a sober night (unless you RP instead of questing, I guess). It's not horrible; but it's not great either, and so my playing sort of petered out halfway into the second faction's storyline. I'd still have given a thumbs up as even just playing one faction out of the three gives you a lot of material for your money, except for this:　— First, as a casual player, every time I return, all my mods are incompatible. If I have an hour or two, and the first 45 minutes of that is fixing mods, I just can't be arsed. Just keep the damn APIs stable already, it's not rocket science! :(　— Second, while I was away, the system was changed, and I'd have to learn it all over, figure out what the good builds are, and then make one. Again, as a casual player, I just want to sometimes get on and play. If I have two hours, I want to play for two hours, not worry over the spreadsheets of theorycraft.　— Third, I bought vampire when you couldn't get a free bite at every street corner. That came with RP opportunities, some nice mechanics in favor, and (depending on what build you ran / what RP you wanted) the necessity to leave your group every one or two hours to feed for five minutes. Now that all regions scale to your level, feeding takes longer and is much more of a chore than it used to be, essentially devaluing something I paid real $$$ for, so, not sure how trustworthy I find Zenimax at this point.　These are of course three examples of the same problem, ""I wish they'd leave well enough alone, so I could spend more of my play-time actually playing."""
Negative,honestly lots of wasted potential. can't help but quit for months after bursts of 10-15 hours
Negative,"In regards to Morrowind: great graphics and music. The main quest dungeons should've been solo like the base game main quest, right now there is an army of level 3 wardens everywhere and thanks to One Tamriel they're killing the same mobs I am with my 600+ levels, which makes me wonder why I got them. Basicly its the base game reskinned and a different story line. Should've been priced $ 15 cheaper. Also signs of pay to win started with this expansion. I spend over a year trying to get all the crafting lines completed but now you can just buy your way to master crafter. The new 'Battleground' PvP is very bugged, I got a random penalty and most of the time the Battleground group finder wasn't working at all. Feels like it was released too soon"
Negative,"One of the only mmo's i've played and really enjoyed it for a long time.  I guess i would recommend this game to rich people that don't have to work and still can make money.  cuz if you want to get anywhere in this mmo you are going to have to live in it for real and not have a life anywhere else.The biggest gripe i have with this game is more of my own fault, but i put in so much work on the ps4 and worked hard as heck towards many relationships like Master Crafters that could provide me with the gear if I gave materials and such.  So having to buy all the game and dlc content over twice really sucks considering the hundreds of dollars i spent on items cosmetic and such on console.  then also not having the gear that took so long to get, just didn't motivate me to continue.  cuz once u have the top tier gear you want you can use it across any of your characters.  so if you want to live in a digital realm and put all your efforts and focus into it to have someone like you enough to help you go ahead and spend a monthly membership for an essential crafting bag of infinite size that probably will get full before you have enough material to make a terd."
Negative,"I want to like this game, but I just find that it is way too easy. There is no challenge at all, and I'm not someone who has even played very many MMOs. Players within the community say that the end-game content is better and more challenging, but I do not want to have to play for hours on end before I even START to have fun."
Negative,"i'd love to give a review, however since purchasing the game 10 hours ago I have not been able to play once due to the inability to log in. Upon further review of forums and discussion boards, this has been a problem since the intial release of the game..."
Negative,"After nearly 3 years, thousands of hours, invested time and money, I'm at the unpleasant position to say, that I'm tired of troubleshooting. Every new update/patch brings in more issues and most of them are login issues, of the most known. One day everything is fine and on the next you need to apply all troubleshooting ""protocols""."
Negative,"They do the same shit every year, recycled ideas, cheap improvements and an expensive chapter upgrade in addition to a sub that gets you all the DLC minus the new chapters. Pros: Great theory crafting system, pvp mechanics, and pve group content (which is alway updates) the sub isnt that unreasonable for what you get. Houses are good if you like that. Lifeskills are meh, but required for QOL in gear crafting. Cons: the game is near unplayable without a sub, its an inventory nightmare. PVP content hasnt added anything unique in quite sometime. Their servers are unreliable and they don't prioritize fixing the servers. The content overall feels repetitive, pirates, vampires, zombies, dragons, daedra, repeat. The chapters aren't really cumulative, its just splurge in one of those directions so you don't get a story feel like you would out of GW2. In addition, the devs don't really have a strong sense of what the community wants or they don't appear to care. They monetize through gambling loot crates so in game currency is gambling for the really cool skins, unlike BDO where you can just buy the skins - which are way better.  A few years ago they really started loading up the game with all kinds of cheese builds and easy play mechanics that frustrate people that spent years honing their skill. It feels cheap. My main gripe is that of all the MMOs I have played, ESO has the most gratifying PVP mechanics, its really balanced and played out and anyone can do it. There's a skill lock out, not a grind to win, not a pay to win. But PVP is so unsupported, there is no GvG setup to host tournaments, there is only about 4 games of actual Arena play which have been on only a few maps since time immemorial and if the player community even had the freedom to do GvG in guild halls they would be able to create content. The game is stale. Enjoy"
Negative,"Like any other MMORPG, you have to chose between gaming or living. You can't do both."
Negative,"Dont buy this on steam, u can never log in... i played like 3 hours in total but the rest is launcher hours, its so nice and now i cant refund.0/10"
Negative,"Lore wise the game is FANTASTICEach zone offers its own unique vibe with quests relating to the zones history and current conflict which is presented in a wonderful way.Gameplay wise, specifically end-game, the game falls apart.When i used to play, classes and roles were satured to few specific sets and minor skill differences between classes. By minor skill differences i mean literally 1-3 skills out of 10 (12 if you include ultimates.) that is absolutely awful design.With recent updates the devs even further saturated combat to the point where you're doing yourself harm for wanting to use anything but a fire staff for magicka, won't speak on stamina as i mainly played tanks and mag dd's.Outside of end-game the combat is okay, quite literally any setup will do its job, more optimized ones will allow you to solo EVERYTHING outside of Group dungeons/trials.Graphics are by far the best when it comes to any TES title, and music is on par with other enteries.I recommend giving ESO a shot IF:A. You just want to learn more TES loreB. Just play something for fun and pass timeC. Don't get easily invested.If the game hooks you, you'll have to suffer through awful end-game content, which is the main reason to play outside of loreRIP 3k hours."
Negative,"Game won't start after 2 hours trying to do everything I've ready online to get passed the launcher when hitting play. It just does absolutely nothing! I haven't even logged into the game as it' won't launch, the 2 hours was spent with the launcher stuck trying to figure out why it won't load???? WTF??? This is too bad as I use to play this game when it first released years ago and i'd love to try out the new content and DLC's... but i'm at my wits end... this is just lazy and bad programming. I have a 2023 high end Asus Rog Strix Gaming laptop. All drivers are up to date, no services that should conflict are running, virus software and firewall is set to off. Files verified, run as administrator, etc. etc. etc. I've done every single thing that people have suggested online to get this game to run, watch YouTube videos and it just won't run. ALSO it won't run on my high end desktop either. So two computers... same issue... this game should be removed from steam. Shame on you Bethesda!"
Negative,I tried but I cant get into it. Ill come back to it in the future and maybe my review will change.
Negative,"Very good game if you can immerse yourself into it with ESO plus. Both PVP and PVE are fun. Some of the stories are actually quite good, and I like how almost all the zones look so different.I will never give this game a positive unless it has Oceania server, or they reduce ESO plus price significantly for Oceania. It feels unfair to pay full price for a laggy game, and I can never play properly in PVP."
Negative,"Tried to like it, but it just isn't for me. I just went back to FFXIV and BDO.edit: tried to get into it THREE times already. i think this just isnt for me, i'd still prefer XIV and GW2 over this. sidenote: fuck BDO as well"
Negative,"It's actually good that I could try the game for free on these weekends.Too bad. It's far from what I've been expecting from The Elder Scrolls Saga itself.Not really that many players are around. That makes it really boring.tfw no friends ;_;So conclusion, I just give it 6/10.I didn't recommend because the regular prices and DLCs"
Negative,"The devs of this game have decided to double down on their brain dead overland content, and forgettable story encounters, hollowing out pvp, and neglecting dungeons and trials. So really, only play this game if you are looking for faceroll forgettable content."
Negative,they added DEI
Negative,- Took 3 days to download.- Error login.- Crash every 5mn- Couldn't finish my character creation.Conclusion: Not worth it.-Uninstall.
Negative,"Just bought the game, mouse and keyboard are not working when selecting initial settings.......Dissapointing....I can't play the game"
Negative,"Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will ""sell"" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really.Now in (January 27, 2023) They just want to milk their player base so that they can move to their next game and start milking again."
Negative,"WTF?? I just bought the game only to find out that the COMMON crash on startup error wont be fixed until Nov 14th?? I've tried every fix action in every forum and nothing is working, the only suggestion left from the devs is to wait until the next update? WTF..."
Negative,"Overall Elder Scrolls Online is a pretty standard MMO. There are daily tasks, group only dungeons, and a simple crafting system with leveled materials. The Elder Scrolls setting adds a lot of flavour and is the best part of the game. Some of the areas look brilliant, most notably the orc homeland of Orsinium and various parts of Morrowind. The quests can vary a lot between being very lore heavy and thematic for the Elder Scrolls universe, and being incredibly generic. Anything involving the Daedra (demons) or the undead seems to have been hit the hardest in this regard and frequently feature a 2D uninteresting villain with threadbare connections to the wider Elder Scrolls world.If you are a fan of MMOs it's not bad and you'll get some fun out of it. If you're a huge fan of the Elder Scolls you may also enjoy simply touring parts of the world that have never featured in a game before. For average players however, there are better things to spend your time on."
Negative,"It was a good game one year ago. But after few updates, it is crap now...pvp balance is crap. the game is also so lag (not only I have this issue. If you go to eso forum, you will see lots of player make the same comment)Always some connection problem issue after weekly update.No reaction even you push the skill buttons for several times....Too many problems now. There are so many good game. Why you choose this one to bother yourself?Please, don't buy their new edition... It is not worth it and the attitude of its developer is also not worth to spend your money in.THEY FKING DONT CARE ABOUT THE COMPLAIN FROＭ THE PLAYER.Bye Bye crap game"
Negative,"I love ESO but, If you want something that works when you get time to play it then this is probably not gonna be it for you.. I do not know wtf Zenimax does these days... But, they will prolly send me a message to this review to a support team that takes days to get into touch with.. I just came back too and this crap although, I love the game is just atrocious.. I have NEVER  in a very very very long time seen an MMO that just does not work when you want to play as much as this game.. Endless loading in just to the game.. Not to mention que times, broken grouping, broken dungeon finder ques and on and on.. And, what is sad is the MMO is quite good... It is too bad it almost feels like Zenimax does not want you to play it.. Wish I could leave a Meh review but, till they fix this crap its a thumbs down more then up at this point.."
Negative,I see another scam happening! You have a new content/chapter - High Isle with all the other chapters (including blackwood) and yet still you still offer Blackwood only on your page!  Why are you still selling Blackwood when you have High Isle with all the other chapters? You know that confuses people. I bought Greymoor when Blackwood with all the other chapter was out. You wouldn't give me a refund! I am not gonna give you my money so goodbye and good luck!
Negative,"Day 1: You will spend more time trying to connect to this game than playing the game itself. Would NOT recommend this game to anyone. I almost gave it a good review but it honestly cannot be played. Do not get this game unless you really like to stare at the character select screen. Every loading screen causes anxiety. 9/10 times I see a loading screen I get disconnected. Day 2: I don't know why I came back. Foolish hope perhaps. 2/17 attempts to log into the game this morning were successful. The other 15 attempts booted me right back out to the log in screen. Those two times I was able to connect, I was promptly kicked back to the log in screen as soon as I went to open a door to load a new building. This game is UNPLAYABLE!!!! I tried again today simply because, if these connection issues didn't exist, the game could be fun to play. I suppose I will never know. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!Day 3: I finally reinstall the game to my C drive after removing it from my D drive in a vain hope that this may possibly fix the problem. WRONG. NO CHANGE AT ALL! This game is UNPLAYABLE! The amount of effort I have put in just to LOAD INTO the game is unacceptable. I wouldn't even recommend this game to somebody I didn't like."
Negative,"I'm editing my review to not a reccomendation after playing a bit more. The customer service is non existent I have had the same problem for literally months I submitted a ticket with a list of all the fixes I had tried to which they said ""did you try reloading your ui? which was the first thing I listed and is completely obvious. and when I said yes I didn't get a response to my ticket.there these things called ""Champion Points"" which you get at max level that carry over to lowerlevel characters making them considerably more op as in your damage in dungeon is crap and you'll get oneshotted in pvp. my friend has a tank character and did 70% of the groups dungeon damage on a character lower level than me and a tank.Large paywall items you can't get without dlc basically pay to win.the interface was hard to get used to but it works when you get the hang of it.It's very laggy if you are east coast because all the servers are central/west coast. my ping stays around 100 constantly."
Negative,"Just tried this game again after a long break only to find out that its still awful to try to play it without ESO + even while a free to play event is taking place! lol (this is a sort of subscription method that gives you access to all DLC[otherwise you can't go to any of the released DLC zones or access any DLC content, unless you pay separatedly for it] and a personal material bank, all of these things are a NECESSITY, its not optional, try playing it with no ESO + and you are gonna have an annoyingly boring time consuming play through while you look at your bank full of crap and resources and wonder really hard about why the material bank is not INCLUDED in the base game! are you guys trying to drive people away from the game on purpose? way to take out the fun and make paying ""optional"", on top of that, the price for anything in their shop along with the subscription(eso+) is ridiculously priced in my country(COL). I would probably pay for it if it didn't feel so mandatory, right now it feels like filthy greed to me and so i would just rather uninstall AGAIN."
Negative,"game and launcher broke for me and even when I uninstalled it, steam still says I was playing it so I got 9 hours of ""playtime"" when in reality I never got passed the launcher FIX YOUR FUCKING GAME bc I cant refund"
Negative,Fun game. Dont get if from Australia 360-390 MS all the time. Almost impossible to play
Negative,"Servers have constant downtime during peak hours in Europe. ""Maintenance"". Daily, really?Good game, but the daily maintenance bulls*** has got me looking for another MMO"
Negative,this game can eat my butthole clean
Negative,"Pretty visuals - but dull.I wish the PvE solo experience offered any sort of skill whatsoever, but as it is not you only mash your set combination of buttons like three times, and you won. This makes questing just a matter of wall clock time."
Negative,"Well since it hangs on launcher and I tried all the fixes, this results in down voting because Bethesda/Zenimax doesn't seem to overly care about fixing launcher issues. I tried to install from both Steam and from ESO website, I hope that they get things fixed soon! I'd love to patch and play again. I will rescind my recommendation of playing the game once it's playable again."
Negative,"Constant random load screens in PvP, maybe 30 or more in an hour. I play with a controller so use the gamepadUI which is broken and they know it's broken but don't want to fix it. Play this game only if you like to throw your money away!"
Negative,"Since the latest update and addition of the DLC ""Blackwood"" the game crashes on launch.  Can't even play it anymore.  Looked on the forums, and this is an issue for a while now with other people, and they don't answer tickets or address the problem.  Would love to play again, and if you ever fix your game and I can get past the launcher I may change this review, until then I warn everyone to not spend a dime on a game that you can never play."
Negative,Can't play it anymore as it was removed from geforce now. :/
Negative,Junk. Will not install the latest edition. Gets stuck on repair at 86%. Now I remember why I did not buy this back in 2018.
Negative,"I really liked this game, i really did, i had lots of fun met fun people so on so forth. but holy fuhhhhhk is zos a horribly dumb company that doesnt know jack squat about making their game even remotely better."
Negative,"Game is Toxic , Too many guilds and too many attitudeds of hate.  If your new to MMORG this is not the community of support you would expect.  Be cautious.  Toxic Community now."
Negative,"Take all the ES games and put them into one, with their guts all over the place. Graphics look nice, but the game play is not very immersive. Hardcore TES fans might enjoy."
Negative,The steam launcher for this game is faulty.  It crashed instead of downloading the patch.  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game as well as the recommended fix from the forums.  You are better off buying directly from the Elder Scrolls Online website.
Negative,"it's not pay to play. it's just a demo without subscription.i bought game years ago, played about 500 hours. they sell base game with some expansions now, but giving nothing to old accounts. you have to keep paying every month to (really) play game."
Negative,"There is a big problem with their patch distribution system. Some players will not be able to  update the game and play through their launcher, and Zenimax seems unwilling to fix it. You could take the time read the log file and download the patch that the launcher crashes on or you could save yourself 30mins and play something else."
Negative,I am done playing this game. I am done paying 15$ A month just so I can have a craft bag to hold the absurdly large ammount's of resources just to level alchemy enchanting and provisioning. I am tired of getting patheticly low ammount's of inventory and bank space despite the vast ammounts of items in the game.
Negative,"Honestly, this was through and through, an MMO. So i didn't really enjoy it at all, it didn't remind me of skyrim in the slightest and just didn't have a good elderscrolls vibe to it, tried playing it with a friend and we tried hard but just couldn't really get into the game and seem to enjoy it, everything ran good though, my new pc let me see this game run in ultra high graphic settings and it looked fantastic, it just wasn't enjoyable."
Negative,"I just couldnt get into it, skyrim is prol my all time favorite game ever made. But ESO is just not my thing"
Negative,This is the thing. This game is past it's time and is looking to make as much money with little investment possible. Prepare for disappointment now.
Negative,Skyrim is much better
Negative,"Game is good but common, paying / subscribing for inventory ? nah"
Negative,"So you just bought the game, nice! Did you get all the DLC? Oh, what DLC you asked? The multiple packs of DLC that you'll notice by the shadowed icons on the map, imploring you to consider either a subscription for access to bonuses and DLC (that will change your game experience, there is no question about this) or to outright buy the DLC (with a quickroute to the crowns tab!).This is disgusting and I'm glad I can't get into this game. What a cash grab. :-("
Negative,"Did not play any games this weekend because reserving the connection to DL, was planning to buy this for my gf once she sees I am playing it, if she likes it and when I started the game..... POOOF 8 times changing from NA to EU server all timed out ... WOW.... So I wasted all that for this? So does this mean with all the comments herre that I bought a game that does not work? how to ask a refund?"
Negative,"DO NOT BUY this game on steam, it might be cheaper but each time they adding a dlc or doing a server maintenancen (each week sometimes two maintenance per week) you won't be able to play for hours (sometimes days) you might spend a few more bucks on the official eso website but at least you can play when you want this is really bad we have spend money for the game and cannot play it when we want this is the first time i see something like this, i dont want my money back i just want zos to stop selling it on steam since they can't take care of it !"
Negative,"2024: 10 Year Anniversary Update : Enjoy the party, the newest loot box's and in game advertisements. You can also feel good that at least most of the money that ESO made did not get stolen, sorry I meant borrowed, by Todd ""16 X the paid mods"" Howard to funnel into Starfield.--------------------2022 Update : Since Microsoft bought Bethesda its like Bethesda has been once again forced to make more money on the same old players. So its no surprise that ESO is still milking the players with full price ""high quality content"" DLC instead of fixing some old time bugs. Its the price gamers have to pay to play games like this now a days. --------------------Nov 2020 : Update, No i haven't come back to play ESO. I decided to go see what a circle jerk Fallout 76 was like. Anyways, moving on, this is what a ""dev"" replies for a review that says the price gouging for content is out of control now.""bethesda_murcielago  [developer] Posted: 3 Nov @ 8:55amGreetings,We are happy to hear that you are enjoying The Elder Scrolls Online.We know that some players are wary of the Crown Store and Crown Crates but we believe that in-game transactions in ESO fall into two categories: convenience and customization. No purchases are required for optimal game play and we like it that way. You can read more about it here: Thank you for your review. We hope you stick with ESO.Sincerely,The Elder Scrolls Online Team"" I don't think this dev has played ESO, at least not the same ESO i played. Does he know about the magic Bag of Holding they stole borrowed from D&D for the pay walled ESO bag of infinite crafting mats? This shows a complete disregard for players concerns. Nice job Bethesda, ""It Just Works"" eh?---------------------------- ESO is just a cash grab now, just look at the newest ""DLC""; true ""High Quality Content"".---------------------------- ESO is my LAST predatory micro-trans game. Bugthe$da's ESO & Todd 'Lying-Man' Howard 's Fallout 76 tried to hook me.I used the Elder Scrolls game in the 90's Daggerfall to quit drugs ;go figure i got addicted to games.These triple AAA's are trying become my newest ""drug dealers"". This does NOT change how much fun i had playing ESO. It does change how i feel while playing it though. The in game adds for ""free stuff"" , the cash shop, the offers of free loot box's if you go watch a sponsored live stream video and the must have Crafting Mats 'Bag of Unlimited Holding"" for a monthly sub. Welp, my fault for wanting to play some Elder Scrolls that wasn't Modded Skyrim with paid mods on top of that. sigh. ----------------------------Joined ESO early 2019: No Down Load or update Problems. No lag or stutter in game.Lots to learn, but its pretty easy and forgiving. Great community barring the asshats.I don't like the DLC policy and paywalling content but the story is ok and its all voiced.The FULL version & the ESO+ sub makes for a good time but its NOT cheap.  Final score is only a 7/10 though due to costs and corporate BS. lol WARNING : if you only buy the base game the GRIND is INSANE to buy crowns with gold. May as well get a real job."
Negative,"Originally one of my favorite games but the devs have showcased a complete dismissal of the current state of the game, and I don't think I should invest any more time in this unless things take a drastic turn for positive changes.I can say without a doubt that I feel very disappointed at what's going on with this game, between the tone deaf development, random back and forth balance changes with no sense of any kind, a complete inability for the devs to communicate things like any dev would, the sheer lack of difficulty across the game, the endless power creep with no reason to progress, the fact the devs seem to be very scared of pushing weaker players into learning how to play the game, massive instability issues, bugs that go months or even years to get fixed, highly variable quality of content or even cosmetics... The list goes on and on.Going into each point:The developers make changes that the community rabidly disapproves of and they push it to release with as little as a tiny tweak, while they also completely ignore popular requests that benefit everyone in the playerbase in a safe manner. ZOS may be one of the most tone deaf devs out there, not mentioning other similarly insane devs just to not deviate from the point. Balance changes happen all the time in a way that just doesn't make any sense, like the weakest class in the game (warden) getting nerfs, or the strongest (dragon knight) getting multiple buffs. One could think they have preferences but quite honestly, they seem to just do whatever all the time.Dev communication is hilariously bad. They only ever communicate things via the forums, and often times it's just singular posts by the current PR guy in the forums, dug deep into random threads as a rare reply to some discussion. They don't make big announcements for anything other than scheduling ingame event re-runs, which have become extremely stale, and ""test phases"", which are borderline pointless as nothing seems to come out of them until 2 whole years pass since those tests (and the improvements are negligible).This game is so easy it's impressive in that regard. Never before have I seen a game this easy that isn't specifically made for kids learning about videogames, it's so easy I can replace my gear for lvl 1 armor and weapons, remove all my passives and minimize damage boosts as much as possible, get still absolutely sweep the overland content, going as far as the public dungeons, which are intended to be done with proper gear or just with another player. And guess what? A sizeable chunk of the playerbase believes this is not true, and that basic minibosses across the overland are too difficult and they demand changes to make it that much easier, like being given a crutch that lets them do hard mode raids at a fraction of the effort other players may apply. It's a disaster. And the devs seem terrified of making any changes related to difficulty, because something as small as a 2% damage change is seen as absolutely catastrophic.Bugs are very common in this game. It feels like it's being made by indie devs that just don't have the manpower or resources to fix these things in time. But it's a gigantic company (ZOS) covered by another gigantic company (Bethesda), which is now covered by one of the biggest corporations in the world (Microsoft). It's hilarious and pathetic. Bugs can take anywhere from a month to an entire YEAR to be fixed. Some bugs have been around for over 2 years. There is absolutely no excuse to this, specially not when they stated that this year (2023) would be all about improving the current state of the game at the expense of less content in the year. How'd that turn out? Well, take a look at the recent year retrospective dev letter and maybe read inbetween the lines a little, it's full of lies. This was one of the worst years for ESO in quite some time and nothing they claim will change that. Racking up shills via an Epic Games Store giveaway doesn't count. The quality of this game's content has taken a massive downhill turn ever since the previous expansion, High Isle. It's very clear it might have been a cancelled expansion that was then salvaged so as to not have to make bigger expenses on damage control, but it still left us with a really low quality expansion, and if you're a huge TES fan like what this game singlehandedly turned me into in 2018, you might be incredibly disappointed by it. It's an expansion about bretons, with an absolutely fantastic start (look at the High Isle trailer, it's some hardcore cinematics), the introductory dungeon DLC is good too, but then when you play the expansion it's incredibly lackluster and there is a massive LOTR influence in it (see: ZOS showcased having hired Pippin's VA but as a really unfitting bosmer, there's a LITERAL ""the one ring"" kind of legendary item, and the general theme feels too much like LOTR), and even though it's meant to be about the bretons, it leads to some things that are just VERY unlike TES. For those that said ESO was noncanon all the way from the start or even to morrowind/summerset, that was definitely wrong, as ESO has some insanely good lore up until the content released BEFORE High Isle. High Isle and everything after it feels so out of touch that it might be the actual ""non canon"" content. I refuse to believe any of this was properly thought out to fit in, specially since the old loremaster that ensured ESO's lore connectivity is no longer working on this and has since then been replaced by a new guy. I really don't want to be rude here, but I highly dislike what has come out of this change. There is so much more I want to get out here but it's an endless rant that could probably span multiple high school essays, and there will always be more to point about this game's current flaws.To sum things up, the devs are very tone deaf and simply do whatever they want, quality is rapidly degrading, the playerbase limits itself and doesn't want the game to improve, buggy as hell and fixes don't come until several months pass, and a lot more.Just in trying to write this review I got increasingly more upset about the game. It's just outright stressful to look for any information regarding the game right now and seeing ZOS ninja announce/delay things recently has made me lose a LOT of my interest in playing any further. Not to mention the recent dev letter dismissed every issue which only marks a grim future for the game.I have a whopping 4k hours, man. Depending on what the next expansion looks like, I may just wave off my top trading guild and quit for a year or so.It's gotten bad. Real bad.EDIT (Expansion release): It's all pointless. This game is nigh unplayable without feeling cheated. It almost feels like ZOS is rugpulling this game by making it as bad as possible to be a long time player. They fucking nerfed trading, of all things. There's drastically less content in this expansion than in all previous releases. The lore is pathetic and is all just a big fanfic by someone that does not understand TES in the slightest (the bosmer are not this important, stop). There's no real changes outside of adding a pointless power creep feature in a game that inherently becomes *easier* to play every year.There's nothing for anyone here. It's a disaster. Good god I want my 4k hours back. I'm fucking done.TLDR ratings: 4/10 if it comes to general gameplay. If you're only here for the story then that could be a 7/10 experience but it's just not worth it imo. Don't play any expansion released after High Isle.-----------OLD review link for posterity: https://pastebin.com/y5mC1c4X (mid 2023)"
Negative,"NO dedicated OCE Servers? Even after selling the game and expecting people to pay just for lag. It makes me sick that this game was sold to australians, in australian stores.Not setting a good example for mmorpgs.Wasted a day of download to log into latency hell."
Negative,Only buy on sale
Negative,"I used to be an adventurer like you, and then I took an arrow to my bank account."
Negative,Despite the 85 GB system requirements listed below you will be asked for an additional 85 GB free space during the installation process. If you have a smaller hard drive don't bother trying.
Negative,"If you want to do anything fun then they make you pay for it, as though I didn't already buy the game. Gameplay not as good as Skyrim"
Negative,"I got this on sale, but it's been very fun. It definitely has some MMO stupidity, but I LOVE wandering around Vvardenfell... blast from my Morrowind past. And there are lots of neat new places I've never experienced in any of the games before.EDIT:I'm going to update since I've played over 50 hours at this point. It's gotten very repetitive and the MMO stupidity is getting old. The only reason I would keep playing is to scratch the Elder Scrolls itch... kinda. There are very few quests that make me excited to play, and those that do are pretty cool. But the rest of the quests are just so dang generic."
Negative,"Pros:-beautiful scenery-tons of content-great voice acting-Elder Scrolls universeCons:-gameplay and especially combat feels repetitive. Lots of fetch quests.-after paying $20 for the game, I found that the vast majority of the content was behind another ""ESO Plus"" paywall. This game also includes microtransactions.With a little more effort on the gameplay and a little less focus on squeezing money out of the player at every opportunity, I think this game could've been amazing. As it is, I would not recommend this game."
Negative,In this review it says I have played for 8 hours.6 hours+ is for downloading and patching the game and actually only spend about 2 hours in game.Only have 2 servers (EU and NA) so I have high ping ranging ~280 - 999+ since I'm playing in Australia.Some people here can tolerate the lag and play PvE but still some areas and PvP the lag is just unbearable.I guess I'm kinda at fault as well for not doing enough research prior purchasing the game.Hoping for new server that playable for Australian.
Negative,"Everyone who plays this game should get candy in game (irl) in game.EU-Server maintenance loves to start from 10 am (CEST) to whenever they want to start up the servers again.Best ping you can get, even when you are playing with NASA connection is 50 at best. AT BEST btw. Including you live right next to the servers.Infested with wannabe disabled ppl doing either roleplay, questing (literally should get terminal diseases just for that (in game (with disease glyph enchant and infused 2h weapon ofc))) or hanging out in dungeon queue as fake dd's light attacking just so i can watch them taking (unironically) 10-15 minutes for the easiest boss on the easiest mode.Meanwhile social guilds want you to be 30+ to join while having to most copy pasta-ed descriptions I have ever seen in my entire disgusting life: ""we have a guild house with this n that, no matter if you are new or a veteran, you can join our discord, doing raids and dungeons with newcomers etc""If you didn't know yet, the average age of eso players is at around 70+, otherwise I can't explain the apm and brain capacity most players have other than actually having crooked fingers (in game (with polymorph ofc)).Strongest classes look balanced when devs or wannabe pvers play it.(Won't discuss balancing, if I just have to rethink what happened in all those years I really just want to have the ability to either teleport myself to the devs or them to me, i just want to talk to them and give them a firm handshake for being such great people and how they do their job so great its unimaginable (in game (with arcanist teleport ability)).PvP doesn't exist (It does exist but if you really think you want to try ESO because of it's PvP I'll personally come to your house and give you a bomb for having such a great idea (in game ofc, by teleporting to your house, using the magicka detonation spell and giving you a suprise bomb with useful items for pvp (irl)(INGAME(in game ofc))))Insane prices in the Crown store (100€+ just for a house with so much space that you can't fill it even when you use the biggest furniture you have ever witnessed in a game, it's still going to look empty while having no more free slots to put any more furniture)The earliest time gamebreaking bugs get fixed, such as infinite loading screens/bar swap bug/block bug get fixed in 2 weeks. Until then you can have fun looking at what's new in the crown store. If it didn't sink in yet, EARLIEST fix in 2 weeks. But always depends on if they want to fix it, also happened that the ""fix"" made it worse (I'm not joking, I've never been more serious in my entire disgusting life.) and had to wait another 2 weeks until it maybe gets fixed at some point.If the crownstore goes down for barely 10 seconds, out of a sudden 800 people are working on a fix.90-95% of the community is delusional (in game with taunt ability ofc) while having the ""degeneration""(in game ability ofc) debuff permanently on them in game, which deals DAMAGE over time btw (in game) in game).There are sets that make you a Dark Souls boss while ignoring whole game mechanics (must be mentally challenging (in game)) if that isn't proof enough.I'll keep on playing ESO and complaining because I'am addicted.Or how can you not love a game with the majority being hospitalized (in game ofc in zones with alot of npc zombies ofc)"
Negative,"edit: 4/2/22 new update for ""performance purposes"" and yet the game doesn't allow you to log in to characters, you can't load into dungeons without the game timing out, you can't raid, you literally can not play the game. dungeon finder doesn't work. you can't play this game. zenimax is all about pr and micro transactions. their store still works but the game itself does not. they make free to play games look like they aren't greedy enough. if anyone else in the world was this incompetent they would lose their jobs. this game is a worthless pile of flaming dog doo doo. i guess for starters it shouldn't be surprising as zos owns bethesda. they are cheap as heck. they gut the game because they make changes they don't even understand themselves. they do not play their own game and it is painfully obvious everytime they make changes and then revert them after they do exactly what the community told them it would do to the game. it's like trying to raise a child that thinks they know better than everyone else in existence. they ignore you then screw up everything apologize and try to go back on their mistake and pretend nothing happened. they monetize the every living hell out of the game. you want specific classes? shell out more money? you want specific skill lines that are currently the most powerful? more money. the game may not be pay to win but the amount of money you have to shill out just to compete in the first place is ridiculous. you cant trait jewelry unless you buy a specific dlc. excuse me? that matters. traits are a part of the power system and you now lack three more than other players. you are gimping yourself. that same dlc provides a skill line that is currently necessary to run a lot of content.you want to pvp? well first you have to get over rubberbanding, servers that make me bdso servers look like heaven, and not even being able to cast skills. then you have to get over the community. they all complain about 80v1s but not a single one of them wont do the same. you in a 1v1? expect his friends to come bail him out. or 20 random gankers to drop ults on you then turn around and cry on the forums about how everyone is overly tanky and heals are too strong... as if there is any other choice when you go out of your way to bm players with 20 man gank zergs just because you're terrible at the game.battlegrounds are fun now that they stopped the team q garbage. it does suck for friends that wanted to play together but the amount of people using pre mades to attack solo q players was out of control and now that they can't do that. much more pleasant experience than it's original concept however it still falls victim to skills not going off and all the other plights of terrible servers. instead of fixing servers zos guts the game and blames players and how we play but they literally market the game as ""play how you want"". the issue is players have not changed how they play the game. the changes over the years of spaghetti string code are catching up to them and they would rather continue on this path than upgrade servers, or fix their code. this game is a cesspool. if you are on the fence; do not buy. wait for new mmos coming soon.edit: response to you murcielago:One of the major concerns of your game is the end game players leaving en mass. Why are they leaving? Well, you said it in your response to me. ""...neither of which are reuqired for optimal gameplay"" - you don't play your own game nor understand it in the slightest. necromancer is required in a raid for end game play. elemental catalyst set - required for optimal gameplay.Next on the list, changes to the meta not because it's bad but because some players lack the want or desire to run optimized setups. So you nerf the end game community for these casual players. Pen is useless and you're giving the nightblade pen right now because it's useful in groups that don't optimize. so you punish the players that work together to overcome faults in classes because dumb players refuse to work together? genius xD""Convenience or customization"" this is possibly the biggest joke of all time. you know what would be convenient? how about not making me level up mount speed, carrying, and stamina for every toon. it's a punishment to have multiple toons. oh but you'll offer me the chance to pay you to make that go by faster. costs $300 dollars to upgrade a mount? that's robbery and the fact you even tried to justify it shows you're delusional and a greedy p.o.s.""we care about performance"" bull. flat out bull. 3 years of hearing this garbage line. you blame players and how they play for this issue. hence the cooldown tests. PLAYERS HAVENT CHANGED YOUR GARBAGE GAME HAS. how can you possibly blame how players play the game while saying ""pLaY hOw YoU wAnT""? waiting for the genius explanation for that xD.how about block actually register for tanks in trials? nope players are spamming aoes too much in cyrodiil so oh well suck it up. xDhey, have you guys figured out the magcrow blastbones morph is useless yet? it does more damage based on how long it chases a target before leaping. well it leaps instantly. no bonus damage. been 3 patches. yall still cant fix that? oh but trust us we know what we doing right? lmfao.like i said earlier, you own bethesda so everything you say is just plain bullshit. they listen to daddy. they copy daddy. zos proves with every move they will do anything to screw you over for a buck. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME"
Negative,"Summary: Typical MMO turned FTP with cash shop. Played in open Beta and passed on buying. Played during free Steam weekend and will pass again.Pros: Beautiful landscapes, Nicely optimized to run on lower end computers. Looks great on my laptop.Cons: Run of the mill quests. Horrible UI.  If having all the latest flashy doo dads is important to you, be prepared to keep pumping money into the game via monthly subscriptions or cash shop.A sale price of $9 is probably fair if you are still interested after the free weekend trial."
Negative,Not that great. Requries too much disk space #1. #2 people say its not pay to win but its like still highly encouraged that you like buy everything.
Negative,Rather die of a heatstroke then play this pile of dog s**t
Negative,"Rediscovered my love for ESO, played for more than a month. Their servers always have latency and lag spike issues, and NO it is not your connection, it is the ESO servers. You will not feel it when doing quests and exploring. You will start to experience the server issues when doing dungeons although it is bearable. Unless you are geographically near the NA and EU servers, battlegrounds/cyrodiil or any form of pvp will give you a crippling handicap due to latency and ever frequent lag spike issues. if you want to play through the quests and play this game as single player, buy this game. If you want to play this for the multiplayer aspect outside of NA and EU? DO NOT even touch this game unless you want to play on constant 200-300 ping with frequent lag spikes.it is clear that publisher of this game DOES NOT CATER to players outside of NA and EU. Do not suffer a game that does not cater to your region. Go play GW2, better latency and smoother multiplayer."
Negative,"This is why I do not recommend this game (via Steam):""Please know that since your crowns pack purchases are made through Steam, that we are unable to offer any possible refund on this. Now if you wish to request a refund on the purchase you have made for 5,500 crowns. Then from here you will need to get into contact with Xsolla Support, I am so very sorry for any possible inconvenience that this may cause you.""If you are unsatisfied with a purchase. Too bad.Steam says check with Zenimax for refund.Zenimax says check with Xsolla.Its like going to a store and the only payment option is Visa. So you pay with Visa. The product is crap so you go to the store and say I want to return it and get a refund..... they tell you to go talk to Visa.Update from Xsolla:"" Elly (Xsolla)Oct 26, 9:17 AM YEKTHello,we are sorry to hear about your issues with your payment. Unfortunately for this service all payments are final and there are no cancellations. Thank you for understanding.Customer Service Supervisor"""
Negative,not worth in current state if you're anything but a quester. Don't do it to yourself it's not worth the effort and time.
Negative,SUCH A WASTE OF TIME. ITS JUST TRASH. I WOULD RATHER DRAG MY BALLS THROUGH BROKEN GLASS DOWNHILL FROM A MOUNTAIN THEN PLAY THIS GAME.
Negative,We dont need no more torchbugs
Negative,"Like any MMO, the more you play, the less it respects your time and money. Your accomplishments in-game are trivialized by the player riding by with superior gear, and the initiative to explore like in older Elder Scrolls games is now replaced with the driving requirement to max level and grind. May appeal to MMO players who are looking for breaks from their 'main' MMO, but it does not feel like a true Elder Scrolls game to those who have enjoyed the series."
Negative,"They recently disabled the ability to queue for PvP with your friends. This is an MMO. What the fuck? Zenimax is smoking crack I think. If premades are stomping you, get some friends. The only reason me and my SO play this is to do BGs together because we enjoy PvP in WoW and are trying a new MMO. This change killed our interest in the game."
Negative,"ESO was a great game 3 months ago. I was really enjoying creating characters, levelling up, following the stories, etc. Even PVP was fun sometimes, specially when they removed the ridiculously powerful proc sets from use in the PVP war region (they're back now, as well as unbelievable lag).However, in the past month and a half, ESO became ridiculous. Servers are shut down for hours almost every day and developers don't even care that some people pay for a MONTHLY subscription service to be able to access and play the game whenever they want. Ignoring the fact that ESO's dev team can't ever fix anything quickly and need to have more and more maintenance periods, the most disgusting thing is that Beteshda and Zos don't even have the shame to compensate ESO Plus subscribers for the time they can't access what they're paying for. I'm not talking about refunds, but if I pay for a month's playing time and I can't play for extended periods of times, it's only a question of elementary justice that the downtime is added to my playing period. Well, it would be, if they weren't greedy and inconsiderate to the people who keep this game viable.Don't bother paying for ESO plus. You won't be able to play when you want. Just money out of the window. Regarding the rest, if you really like MMOs, wait for a sale where you can buy all expansions and the game for like 8 quid. It's not worth more than that now. A once great game, destroyed by greed and shamelessness."
Negative,It's just not for me.
Negative,"My launcher stuck at ""Updating"" screen of launcher. I does not start updating and stucks at 0%. No useful solution for this in google or steam forums. The Zenimax shit has a problem."
Negative,it's kind of boring tbh
Negative,"I do like the game, i don´t like all the microtransactions though, they want you to pay for everything, every little piece of anything remotely different from the vanilla version, dungeons, outfits, pets, inventory space; it´s a shame."
Negative,The game looks really amazing and i would have loved to play it but i bought it just to sit in queue for 2 hours and still never got in despite it saying that i would only have to wait for 14 minutes. Until the queue is removed for fixed I don't recommend you buy this game.
Negative,"Needs Oceania/Asia serversI have played this game on and off since the launch. I have loved every part of this game except one: server locations. Whilst this might not be a problem for the majority of playerbase in NA and EU for other parts of the world, especially people like me, in Australia, it makes it very difficult to play the game. Constant 250+ ping to either server and considerable packet loss make it impossible to play PvP, which is my favourite part of the game. It's also pretty damn hard to play PvE too, when weapon swapping, animation cancelling or even just casting abilities is extremely inconsistent (to the point sometimes of about half the inputs) and makes nearly all the rotations I can think of nearly useless. My other problem is with PvP, I love the PvP because it feels more quick paced and action packed, which is favourite thing about most the games I play, but combined with the lag, both battlegrounds and cyrodil are extremely difficult to get into as someone who has on just reached the point in the game where I can do trials. Without cp levels or minmaxed builds I consider myself lucky to get a kill, or even survive (when support) to help my group before I get stomped by an invincible dk or nuke sorc. This of course wouldn't be a problem if they allow the option to search for your own cp range, or even add servers in reasonable parts of the globe for other countries so you could at least help your team, run away etc. But I haven't heard anything of the sort over the past few years and it has really killed the game for me, if ever it does happen I know I'd sink a few thousand hours into this game in no time.I know I'm not alone in this, many of my friends in the Oceania region have the same opinion as me, especially about the servers and lag, and would much like it to change."
Negative,"While the game is a good game and lots of fun, buying it through steam comes with a load of problems, from connectivity issues to zenimax not allowing steam sign-ins and more. In my case the only option I had was to re purchase ESO from zenimax site. I would like to give the game a positive review but the fact that i had to re purchase it is unacceptable."
Negative,"Huge time-sink. Only play if you are willing to watch youtube videos about getting gud, especially if you want to pvp. Decent community compared to other mmos. No servers in oceanic iirc which sucked for me and I had to play on europe servers with high ping (so no pvp). Also, the whole buy the game and never pay again is a lie (sort of). ESO plus membership is absolutely needed, else you will need to create several other characters as mules and have to keep transferring items between them and your main due to VERY limited inventory space. None of the DLCs are free unless you have the ESO plus subscription which means you will most likely miss out on all the cool new dungeons and story arcs. Imo the crafting bag should be in the base game but the devs are greedy assholes, and the player base is too nice to complain."
Negative,"Although the subscription-model is way too expensive (who pays 13€ a month for an mmo, which is more than netflix or music streaming for a whole family?), the game itself is fine. Revisiting Morrowind was amazing, it's very rich in lore. However the login servers are frequently unreachable for users who bought the game in Steam, with outages of 15 hours several times a week, going back months. That's obviously unacceptable, and the missing response in that kind of timeframe shows an absolute lack of respect for the customer. So if you're gonna buy this game, please, BUY IT FROM ANOTHER PLATFORM like GOG or directly from Bethesda - because those users don't have these kind of issues."
Negative,"Would be nice if Bethesda used an installer that actually works or ditched the needless launcher no one asked for or if their support could actually give support outside of ""This is what google old me"""
Negative,"Probably the most boring MMO I've played, not going to lie."
Negative,No Australian servers. Game is literally unplayable.
Negative,"I was pushed through the floor and ended up under the public dungeon. I used /stuck and got returned to the entrance. 20 minutes later, I got stuck in a fucking rock. I used /stuck. It said ""lmao 40 minutes left on the cooldown bitch"".Fuck ESO. It's your technical fuckup. What the fuck?"
Negative,"Got it as a gift from my brother. I was planning to play to CP 160 to test if i like the game. I do like the base game but i hate crafting. Combat is sluggish as a player in the asian region and there were bugs all over the game. Quest was pretty good and interesting though. Its like playing an online skyrim. But the houses system sucks, it feels like a whole empty house with no neighbours and limitations to the purchase of houses. There is no specific limited lots to the houses like in final fantasy 14. After i finish playing the quests in summerset i will quit this game."
Negative,"A main story quest in the newest DLC is broken to the point where I have seen dozens of players, myself included, unable to progress the quest. This is a MAIN STORY QUEST for the MAIN NEW DLC. I play this game for the story. I paid 60 fucking dollars for this dlc, only for it to be literally broken. I've tried literally everything to fix it, from reloading the ui, leaving the area, relogging, and abandoning the quest. There are way too many players experiencing the same exact problem I am to even remotely believe that NOBODY found this infuriatingly obstructive glitch during testing. Save your money. Don't buy this busted mess they call the Necrom DLC unless you hear that the quest Conclave of Fate has been fixed."
Negative,"Installed it played for a while, after a bit it just becomes a grind of the same stuff over and over and over and over over and over and over and over over and over and over and over over and over and over and over over and over and over and over over and over and over and over again...so i thought ""hey it's just the base game maybe they do this on purpose to get ya to buy upgrades....i sure would like to be able to craft the jewelry also."" so i figured i'd buy the Greymoore upgrade everywhere i look it says Summerset comes with Greymoore...well i spend the extra and guess what....no Summerset.....and no place on Steam to even buy Summerset, they want ya to buy the crowns first then ya can spend the crowns on Summerset, and there is no way to buy just the amount of crowns ya need for summerset ya gotta buy extra  and the crwons cost as much as i paid for the base game, this is just a money pit."
Negative,"the game is okay, but the launcher is shit, i cannot express how much the launcher sucks, it is full of bugs (the launcher, not the game) and is experience breaking, of my 22 hours of playtime, 12 of them are me trying to repair the launcher, i tried all kinds of fixes i found online and in the faqs, nothing works, realy i cannot stress enough how bad is the launcher, although again, the game itself is quite good"
Negative,"I'd like a mixed feelings button, but I'll be quick and get straight to the point.Pros:-Beautiful world.-Everything's voice acted (although you'll hear the same 5 voice actors for every other character).-Great lore.-Massive amounts of content and places to explore.-Shrine teleportation system makes travel a breeze.-Well optimized and good ping. Doesn't break the server if there are 100 people in the same place. Cons:-It's a single player game, not an MMO. You don't need to interact with anyone for 95% of the content. You can even disable all of your chat. -Everyone looks exactly the same, regardless of what race they play or gear they wear. The only ones you can tell apart are the Cats and Lizards because they have tails. -Armor sets and weapons all blend into the environment, which doesn't help to differentiate between races and classes. -The subscription is mandatory if you want to craft because it unlocks the bottomless material bag. Without it, everything will go into your limited main bag and you will have to choose what you want to loot every time. Who likes manual looting? Bag upgrades don't help much, either. -Lack of gear progression throughout the expansions. Once you hit level 50 and grind 160 Champion Points, all the gear that you loot will have the exact same stats, aside from veteran Trials. But once you obtain gear from there, it will be the same as that from a newer expansion. The only difference are set bonuses, most of which don't even make much of a difference. It all depends on the meta and what they decide to buff or nerf. So essentially you aren't compelled to compete and grind for gear. At all. Ever. -The common pool abilities break immersion and reduce the differences and uniqueness of the classes. Do you play a melee class? You will use a bow regardless of what your melee weapon will be. You will use Poison Injection on the bow, maybe even Snipe and Arrow Spray. Everyone does this. EVERYONE. Same goes for the weapon of your choice (DW, 2H, 1H&Shield). You will always use some ability from the common pool. At least half of them, in fact. -Remember Skyrim? You can use any weapon and armor you want in this game. Yes, you can play a mage in heavy armor with a 2h sword and use the abilities from the common pool. You will be gimping yourself, but the fact that you can do it COMPLETELY RUINS immersion. -PvP Cyrodiil is basically Planetside (dead game, btw). Battlegrounds are 4v4v4, and in my opinion, they're pure RNG chaos. This very cheap system is used to simplify balancing issues, because once 2 teams start fighting, the 3rd will eventually join the fray and change the tide of battle. Repeat after respawning. -The constant need to reapply 20-40 second buffs, especially when you have to use 3-5 of them. -The endgame is cosmetics. Unless you like playing The Sims, furnishing your house, getting all of the pointless sparkly things, you won't enjoy this."
Negative,"As someone who has spent over 4k Hours in the game let me tell you: this game is great but with real world trading being allowed after taking a break for a couple years to see how inflated many things have gotten is a bit sad. The mount system is shit, you either hunt for pieces or open loot boxes. and it ends up being the same 9 species over and over and over with very little variations (sometimes some special effects) the game has that amazing story telling you'd want from elder scrolls and it genuinely used to be great but the developers would rather sell you a solution than just give you the solution and thats when i stopped playing. (skyshards in crown store)"
Negative,"I had high hopes for this game, i really wanted it to be fun, but it simply wasnt.After coughing up $40 during a sale, i expected an intence elder scrolls MMO, but it wasnt an MMO, it feels more like a watered down, single player elder scrolls where theres a bunch of people running around stealing resources, farming bosses (you have to at least hurt the boss to count as you killing it, meaning if a lot of people are there, a quest might be unbeatable), and stealing all the loot. Only a few countrys are avalible, in fact, only one is compleate, and its extremly dull and looks the same as the rest of the country. Oh but dont worry, they'll get around to finishing the other lands, just cough up another $60 please!"
Negative,game is awesome but comes with lots of bugs / stuff that doesn't work properly
Negative,"Got up to level 16, this was an immensely boring experience. Clanky combat, boring world."
Negative,There's no servers in APAC
Negative,to much content to pay for cant even craft storage without 2000 crowns
Negative,After years of not playing this finally decided to play again however I couldn't get the game to boot despite around 15 hours of trouble shooting so Im just going to give up and hopefully get my refund truly unfortunate
Negative,Do not buy if youre going to play hardcore on steamdeck. 120 hrs 200 crashes. Imagine being in a trial or dungeon lol dont even think abt jumping on pvp.
Negative,"How do you compete with Steam, a platform that dominates PC gaming? Easy. Release your game on Steam, and artificially create problems for users logging in from Steam, to build consumer dissatisfaction towards Steam. Since your users are all idiots, they will think the problem is Steam and not the game (despite the fact that Steam has tons of other games using Steamworks for auth that have no such issues). Once anger reaches critical mass, provide a way for users to migrate from Steam to your platform. You'll look like the hero. Start selling third party games on your platform and eventually overtake Steam.  ggez."
Negative,"BASIC OVERVIEW> Cash-grab. Waste of money, graphics comparable to Skyrim though it came out several years later. Skyrim Together is better, would rather wait for the next actual Elder Scrolls title. Have 100+ hours on this game, and spent roughly $100 trying my best to actually enjoy the experience alone & with friends (not on Steam obviously) here's some info.- Limited storage quantity, gets filled up incredibly fast. Loot is very meh, the amount that you can hold and the bank slots can get filled up in your first day or two of adventuring, not a problem but there's no room for a smart player to hold onto any sets of armor or weapons or any of his cool stuff if he wants room in his inventory for the future.- Money making schemes such as highly overpriced DLC's & microtransactions make up a big portion of your screen time when you're just trying to play, the answer for the subscription is great if it wasn't priced at the cost of Humble Monthly.- It isn't a very lived in world, it's quite empty and very few things are actually pick-up-able. Older TES titles were very lived in and you could in front of your own eyes remove every last piece of armor off of most foes bodies. You could pick up almost anything in the world and random items were just lying around waiting for you to explore them, not here.- The map is overly big. Fast traveling costs money and its too ugly and empty to keep sprinting out of stamina in any direction to get quests done. Again in older games like Skyrim although fast traveling was free, you wanted to run around because the map was jam packed full of interactivity like the real world and it wasn't ridiculously large (weird complaint I know but size has to be done right, I think No Man's Sky proved that).- Characters don't feel alive or worthwhile. There's not much interesting dialogue, movement, backstory, anything really to 90%+ of NPC's in this game. I appreciate that there's so many, but would have preferred half as many if they were done like in older games.- Combat system, PVP, boss battles & loot. I'm not writing a book, just do the free weekend and try it out. It's kind of a cool system with mechanics slightly improved from Skyrim but the very strange instant health regen is whack AF for trying to Dark Souls your way through like we've all done in older TES titles every once in a while.- Money (in game currency) is very hard to come by. Every thing in this game is about coming back everyday day after day for daily freebies, day after day for horse upgrades etc. It's not about playing and experiencing in the now, it's about planning for hundreds of hours and weeks/months ahead instead of enjoying it today and working at it today.- Graphics are awful. I get it, it's an MMO. But how is it literally uglier than their older titles? It doesn't have the TES feel to it, and the textures are garbage. I played at 4K Ultra settings so don't bring me that settings garbage. The game is mad ugly for what it costs, keeps trying to get you to pay, and for what it succeeds.- Very very grindy. If you want a cool build you'll spend 90% of your time grinding and studying and pushing to make your gameplay and your character perfect. I already have finals coming up, I don't want another exam here, I'm not here to study and to grind like I do at my job, I'm here to relax and enjoy a game, something that was promised to be a TES title of all games. You don't get to enjoy stuff and stop to see the sights and slowly walk around like you do in the older TES titles.There's more but I don't feel like typing more, if you don't get my point by now then just buy the game and enjoy yourself.I guess, buyer beware."

Negative,I have put forward the same problem several times I order coin Crown coins I’m charged but I never received them last time. I received one for 750. I was charged for three others. I will be sending along my bank statements to that but I haven’t received it yet.
Negative,"I enjoyed this game a lot! It may be a bit more restrictive than a traditional Elder Scrolls game due to being an MMO, but it's still quite enjoyable to get to explore parts of Tamriel that had always been separated between games otherwise. Unfortunately, I'm placing a lot of emphasis on the past-tense ""enjoyed"" because the latest update broke the game for a lot of people, support tickets aren't being responded to, and none of the ""fixes"" floating around that seem to work for the person posting them seem to work for anyone else. Looks like I won't be playing or paying for a subscription any more until it's patched, and even if the base game is free I can't recommend it to anyone as long as there's such a strong chance it might not be playable for them either."
Negative,"130GB download, 20GB installer, 98GB updates....still wont run."
Negative,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE NOT LIVING NEAR OR IN EU OR NA. LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE IN SEA.如果你不在北美或欧洲千万别买这个游戏卡得半死。
Negative,Would've loved to play but it wouldn't even launch. tried all the articles I could find but nothing worked.
Negative,"Honestly, really kinda dissapointed, I pre-ordered the collectors edition for the next expansion and everything. The community in this game is absolutely terrible, I've had to file multiple reports on a weekly basis of playing, the PvP is a gimmick and really just sort of a joke, I would not recommend this game unless someone is already a long time fan of the Elder Scrolls franchise, because interacting with the community in this game is tiresome."
Negative,"Couldn't sign in in game. Opened a ticket on their support website, no help, they just closed my ticket after some dumb automated response. Refunding this garbage. The game might be good, but the ""support"" is absolutely terrible. ZeniMax sucks."
Negative,"I got carrot sticked by friends to play this game.  First it was get level 50 then CP 160 then 300 and so on before I could compete in PVP and do difficult group content.Well 175 hrs later and the PVP is still miserable and the PVE group content is for the most part just a roll fest zerg. If you are solo the activity finder struggles to find groups if you aren't a tank/healer.The game is very blocked and content restricted if you do not pay the subscription cost in order to access all the story content as well as the material bag for deconstructing gear (Without this your inventory would be just full all the time).I'm just kind of conflicted on this game in general, it just feels underwhelming all around."
Negative,"10 hours in (3 spent on realising i probably wont get the premium currency i paid for) and i get this sinking feeling that visuals and lore is the only incentive to keep exploring. The numbers makes it feel like you start at max level and further progression is meaningless unless you are looking to be sweaty with the hardcore players.For me its a deal breaker when i feel like i cant *build* something and is just handed everything without some kind of suspense. Im sure this is fine for many people and the world of elder scrolls is indeed intriguing, but the gameplay does not feel rewarding enough to make me endure all the way to endgame."
Negative,"Fun game, but both companies that are behind this one are scum bags. Money, money money. That's it. they will even sell you info for a couple extra bucks. I first had this game on Xbox and spent at least a couple hundred on all the different DLC's and packs. Then I switched to PC. I lost everything. That is one thing I will give Fallout 76 credit for. At least they didn't out and out take my money and run. I logged in to my PC version of the game and got all the stuff that I paid for. Crazy idea right? It kinda makes me sad that Bethesda used to be my favourite developer. I will play what I paid for, but I will never buy that No Man's Sky rip off they made, or any of their future games."
Negative,"Absolute joke of a company, got banned because I had steam refund a ESO+ purchase I didn't authorize after I had cancelled a month prior. Zenimax support is a complete joke and just gives cookie cutter responses no real humans after months of trying to talk to a real person. go play something else."
Negative,"Amazing MMO with so much to do. I have played since release. Love it. However the crown store was bad enough, when they added in crown crates it was too much for me. You will spend hundreds of dollars to get a single mount you want because the rng is horrible. You can earn a currency to purchase things in the crown store but you are capped on how much of that currency you can earn a week and it is a VERY small amount. You will spend MONTHS farming it to get a single item from the crown store. TLDR: in game purchases are some of the most greedy i have ever seen. However the game itself is amazing. You will spend a lot of time catching up without ingame purchases."

Negative,"Bad controler support, cant start without mouse, half the time it doesnt respect my settings and sometimes it doesnt work at allIm just not gonna play and im def not buying anything, terrible accessibility if it breaks randomly and takes hours to fix"
Negative,"This is a really great gameIt has a lot of quests, some are fillers that add to the world, some of them are really well written, and some go deep into the lore of the elder scrolls (like the clockwork city ones). Both PVE and PVP are really good and require you to get your spell rotations right, and also the main way to progress on gear. There are a lot of materials and crafting related resources, great way to min-max your gear and to level up champion levels, which then helps on the overall power progression.For PC there are a lot of useful addons that introduce QoL changes, like icons on the minimap for already visited resource nodes, a complete list for motif style parts you have already unlocked, or the same for crafting traits.And it has a gigantic world, it just feels alive, it's a joy to wander around and explore, you can really spend hours just walking, discovering waypoints, seeing the bosses, moving to different portions of the continent, its akin to playing Skyrim for the first time, but on a bigger scale.There is a LOT to do on this game, thousands of hours of enjoyable content, but only if you have the crafting bag, which comes with ESO+, the monthly subscription. Otherwise, it's a chore.Everything you do, doing a dungeon, wandering to collect resources, getting a quest that involves moving to a place with lootables, even exploring a place that you can steal from, everything pollutes your inventory. Every activity forces you to do a mini-game of inventory rearrangement. It gets old, really fast. Its even worse if you want to do the crafting dailies/writs, you have to commit to premaking lots of objects, discarding all non-necessary items and deciding to do one or two types of crafting.This does not happen with the subscription, with ESO+ you get the crafting bag, which is essentially infinite storage for materials, accessible on all crafting stations. You can play for hours before needing to drop by the storage, instead of once every 10 minutes. It is a game changer, by design. You get your inventory polluted by design so you have to buy the subscription in order to make progress at a steady pace.TL DR: great game, amazing exploration, can't recommend it because inventory management is borderline prohibitive without the monthly subscription, which means that without it your character progression becomes slow."
Negative,"as an mmo - 3/10as an rpg - 2/10one thumb up if you're an elder scrolls fan (like me), then you'll get couple of extra hours of fun. dont even think to waste your money for all-inclusive bundles, wait for the sale for the base game. final grade: pointless activities and console-aimed f0cking everything"

Negative,"It's hard to believe this game has been around for ten years!  The quality is better than some of the games that released just this year.  There's a tremendous amount of content, as well.  I'd hazard to say, even more content than World of Warcraft!  This is an MMO worth exploring if you're looking for something new.UPDATE:Now that I've had a few months of experience playing (1,300 hours at this point) I thought I'd provide some additional thoughts.  I've been playing this genre of game since the days of EverQuest and Dark Age of Camelot.  My preferred role is to tank.  My wife only plays healers.  We've made a highly sought after duo for groups and raids.  We were main raid tank and healer for guilds in both WoW and EQ2.  I provide this background to give context to my observations on ESO.The ESO developers love their DPS.  So much, tanks and healers are really entirely irrelevant.  My wife has literally been ridiculed by other players for her low DPS while she occupied the role of group healer.  I've personally stopped building my character to tank and started focusing on DPS.Apparently, the dream the ESO developers have for the game is for everyone to run around shooting green rays and tentacles at everything, and burning it down as quickly as possible... and that's sad.  There's really a lot of depth this game could offer, but not with the current direction they're taking it.DPS needs a nerf.  IMHO they should take significantly more damage.  Tanks need to be provided the ability to AoE taunt, to offset that extra damage the DPS needs to be taking.  While DPS is dying rapidly and tanks are soaking all that damage, healers will become critical.I have a feeling this isn't going to happen and at some point I'm going to succumb to the dreams of the developers and I too will be playing an Arcanist... just like everyone else."

Negative,game nhu cac
Negative,"After 4 hours the game failed randomly, and now it wont let me back in because of some ""login error 307"". The error happens automatically upon game launch. Additionally, I'm unable to play this game with my official Microsoft controller. The help page says to navigate to a menu that doesn't exist. This is very frustrating and disappointing. I love the Elder Scroll series, but this game is already so buggy right from the start."
Negative,"If you're like me and have been extremely skeptical about ESO because it's a known cashgrab from Bethesda, well, I understand, but I risked it because of nostalgia for Oblivion and Morrowind, and I gotta tell ya, I'm not entirely disappointed, it's a new experience in that it's an Elder Scrolls game, but online, I've played Black Desert and World of Warcraft, but this is different, and dare I say better, why? Because you get to experience it from First Person perspective! I started my adventure in Morrowind, of course and so far I can say that I like the game, but, for once very, very terrible reason, I simply cannot recommend it. Reason being, the typical cashgrab from Bethesda, forcing the player to buy ESO Plus membership in order to get unlimited inventory space :) I mean, I might get it, because I don't have a lot going on in life between video games and being passed out on painkillers, but am I happy to pay 13€ for it? absolutely not. To a westerner that may be a small sum, but in my neck of the woods it's a fortune, and it is my educated opinion that the price should be 7x less in my region, for obvious reasons, as all things are. But since it's not, thumbs down.Edit: Trying out ESO+ right now, although it is convenient, the exp bonus, the crowns and the storage access are simply not worth that much, because that's a problem they created on purpose, if it was somewhere around 5 euro a month, I wouldn't complain, but this way I have to eat sh*t for a week just so I can afford to play a god damn game. It's time to put regionally adjusted pricing on this, it's too much."
Negative,"I absolutely love Elder Scrolls, but this game turned me off of MMORPG's for life."
Negative,"Getting error 206 every update Why not fix it.. Players have to fix it themselves, it's a waste of time."

Negative,"It keeps booting me from the game while in the US server and giving error messages to contact support. You should not have to pay for this game, at least with the amount of cash these leeches are making you can afford a healthy server or set up alternative options."
Negative,"Not for casual players.ESO stops being fun when it feels like a second job. The problem with ESO is the same with any other MMO. New players need to spend 100+ hours to be able to play with the rest of the community. The grind up to CP 160 is just the beginning as then you need to spend hours farming decent gear sets just to be able to farm the meta gear sets. PvP without CP is ... ok. The only pvp servers that have a large player base are battlegrounds and Champion point enabled servers. Which is impossible to be competitive on without significant champion points and viable gear sets. Some people enjoy gear and level based pvp. If that's you then go for it. There is a lot of options for you to grind out the perfect build and gear set for you. However, if you don't like gear and level based PVP then look elsewhere. For anyone wondering how to cancel ESO subscriptions just go to steam<account settings<Subscriptions and you can cancel from there. Zenimax is a greedy and predatory company that tries to scam people out of an extra month of sub fees or even more from  those who don't pay attention to their accounts. They also have a virtual casino to further exploit their players. TLDR: If you want to invest alot of time and energy into a single game then this is for you. If you are a more casual player then this game is not for you."
Negative,"Used to be a good game, but it has slowly increased so much in lag it no longer tries to pretend they care about you playing it, unless you have a monster of a computer, which I already do. Aside from that it's slowly joining the thousands of games that try to force you into paying the subscription even if it affect their gameplay. My bud was thinking otherwise, until we realized exactly how imperative items are and how impossible it is to keep a tidy bag with all the kinds of ingredients and items you need for playing it (and the items they force into your bag regardless). And you can't even play the 1st player story right anymore. You can't appropiately co-op it, aside from some very flavorless 4 player dungeons. If you can play the subscription, I reccomend you do. But if you're like me and want some cool game to co-op with your brother, that capacity is practically a myth. I mean, sure, you technically can, but there's no effort from the game to pretend they cared about the co-op experience.Shame no developer is ever content of being part of something good. They all gotta plunge their finger into the soup spoiling it."
Negative,"Its an action combat mmo but feels lackluster compared to its competitors, might just boil down to personal preference but it feels slow and clunky to me. In order to reach the full potential of your characters in terms of power is to buy the DLC's which is pretty scummy imo. If you have a friend and youre just looking for something casual with a interesting story this is pretty neat, but anything meta related you gotta bust out that wallet."
Negative,"As the most important member to experience the serious price increase is no longer affordable for my age group, I am sorry to say goodbye to the ESO who has accompanied me for a long time. While I understand that zos wants to make money, I have to leave with a bad review from a player's perspective."
Negative,"Cannot recommend this game until they fix the random disconnects, literally unplayable"
Negative,"doesn't run! After I bought the game, it told me to buy another dlc about $59 so it can synchronize????"
Negative,10 hours of gameplay and maybe half of that didnt suffer from lag or constant crashing. not impressed with the experience.
Negative,"It's got some cool stuff, but actually playing the game sucks."
Negative,Leaver penalties are not harsh enough.
Negative,"Redownload the game to give it a try after a decent length break. Hit Play on the launcher and nothing happens. Been trying for the last 45 minutes and I just get a black screen when launching. Drivers up to date, game allowed through firewall, run as administrator, etc, etc. Why download a game when you can't even play it? Things going back into the uninstalled section of my library."
Negative,"It's boring and seems addictive even, like a bunch of different games. I usually have a hard time playing mmorpgs so this is like some others I've played, no offense. The developers were nice in the response though which is nice, seems like they really care about their game, good on them."
Negative,"I’ve been playing 350 hours farming and leveling my character. The progress is very slow, the experience gained through missions insignificant. I’ve stopped eso plus 12 eur/month. Last but not less important, no Italian Language."
Negative,"Instant bans you for even a fraction of the violation of the CoC, despite it not being extensive or large scale remotely.Bethesda is headed into the gutter in terms of moderation. You want another example, go check out the moderation team for fallout 76, their work there is nothing short of embarassing.300USD+ spent, all down the tube in just a few months, remarkable marketing by bethesda.Edit: before I made this review, I attempted for an appeal on the same day of the ban and was met with something among the lines of ""we took our time for this and was not made lightly"" even though the decision was made to ban the account in under 12 hours. When moderation even lies to you in this game its fairly embarrassing and disgusting."
Negative,Kinda boring unless you really like TES Just saying I regret buying it...at least it was on sale
Negative,"Diz que funciona pra windows e mac, não funciona pra mac, bem mentira essa descrição."
Negative,"Really would love to play the game and offer feedback. Unfortunately the login says ""connection timed out"" when I try to login. No tech support help other than ""restart"" that doesn't work."
Negative,"I love the game. It's awesome. Shame on Steam that they couldn't manage the account transfers.You can't login. It's an issue.Advice: download the pc version, do not buy this on Steam"
Negative,crashs everytime. i play many many different gamesd on my pc but this game always crashs me .
Negative,"Made an account, went well. Tried to log into said account more than 12 times and it didn't work when the game was supposed to start, it was saying it ""timed out"". Can't play the game because of this."
Negative,Tried to come back to this game. bombarded with crown store ads as soon as  you log in. soured me from the start.
Negative,They are ruining the Trading community buy killing off prices of items making everything common and cheap in the game it has destroyed the market-FIX THE MARKET-Make people use more mats by changing meta gear.Remove the stupid Infinte archive bags that give Rare items as they drop too often its dumb.Keep adding events that gives materials for free its just not good.making more materials more common when the market has crashed pretty much is just insanity.most common items have had their prices cut in half in under a few months when it used to be stable for years is just crazy.
Negative,it would nice if all dlc came with   it would be nice  when u pay 4 a game that u get all  that the  game comes with  instead of paying out of pocket  .if this is how company's r going to start doing   then give me game 4 free  and make me pay 4  dlc   so what ur not rich en   yet
Negative,So glad I never purchased this game as I spent almost 2 hours trying to troubleshoot a connectivity error that won't even let me login but has somehow been a problem since 2017. What a joke.
Negative,"ZOS doesn't care enough to fix bugs, so I won't care enough to put more hours in or buy more crowns."
Negative,"I've been attempting to get past the load screen for the last 4 days and have thus far been unsuccessful. I've tried following a video online to troubleshoot it, so I'm not entirely sure what's up or where to go from here."
Negative,"at this point they just should go F2Pif, you like the game, you will end up buying the membership of the game anyways"
Negative,Warning to Mac users:Zenimax dropped support for ARM Macs (any Mac post-2020) a while back despite ESO showing as Mac-compatible. Game doesn't launch and it night never be able to on 14in M2 Pro MBP.
Negative,"downloaded 120 GB of the gamethen the launcher asked for another 20 GBafter that, the launcher said that the files are damaged, scanned all files and downloaded another 10 GBafter all i try to log into the game and i keep getting an error10\10"
Negative,classic mmo grind forever mechanics but with a simulation of the elder scroll's lore and world-building. boring! makes the same 10 questlines from skyrim seem exhilarating. can achieve nothing without spending years of your life or part of your wages. made me very very depressed
Negative,"The game is fun for the most part. The thing that really kills it for me is how everything is the paywalls. I understand the studio needs to make cash but these in store items are super greedy. Yes, you can play without buying anything I suppose but the amount of time you would be putting in would be god like."
Negative,"used to love this game, before i figured out it was pay to play and you're not welcome if you're not woke ... (im independent btw, not republican) know i shouldn't be referencing politics when reviewing a game, but then again, they shouldn't be shoving far left wing politics down your throat to play it either ... the entire cast is essentially a representation of the far left. all in  a game based on medieval culture and combat, go figure ... i understand it's a fantasy world, i do ... but aren't you supposed to try and appeal to EVERYONE??? gee, i wonder why they had to make the monthly sub optional and go to a pay to play model where you either buy crowns and advance quickly, or refuse and go VERY SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY grind everything out the free way ... really? 180 days just to get to max riding levels? or 18000 crowns??? seriously ...??? maybe ... JUST MAYBE ... if they worried about fixing the THOUSANDS Of little problems that hurt game play, and create storylines that are actually compelling and not reflections of modern day woke left talking points, then maybe the game would be as successful as it could/should be??? the whole world is a quagmire of let me hide behind my computer screen and see who i can make mad nonsense ... this game is a perfect reflection of that. im not allowing comments on this, but for anyone just dying to write a nasty response while HIDING BEHIND YOUR PC SCREEN, let me just say this. i stand in the middle, and i think EVERYONE on the far left and right is nuts!!! when i (and so many others) have to even comment on how woke a game is, you know it's in trouble!!! just look at what ""wokeness"" did to the last of us 2!!! what could've been one of the greatest video game franchises EVER was turned into a pile of dog p00 (pun intended you naughty dogs ...) as the creators unnecessarily pushed ellie to be a lesbian while jam packing in as much woke nonsense as they could, but only after they killed the strong white male lead, joel! that's not allowed anymore!!! really ...??? why not??? these are video games, STOP trying to program people (especially kids) with your woke far left BS! it's unnecessary and a surefire way to cut your audience in half overnight!!! if you're a far left wing loon or a gay person looking for a game themed to pander to you or an angry woman who wants to feel strong, then yeah, this might be a game for you. if you're a normal person, male/female, straight/gay/other, white/black/whatever, who wants nothing to do with the far right or left and just want to actually have fun playing a game without any politics being shoved in your face every few seconds (you know, the MAIN POINT TO PLAY GAMES TO BEGIN WITH!!!), prob wanna look elsewhere ... me, im about to go give baldur's gate 3 a shot now that it's 10% off! think im done with mmo's in general, especially this one. thx for reading.EDIT* it asked me if my opinion has changed of the game after playing a certain amount of more hours, and my answer is yes, it has, it's worse than when i first posted this review. each expansion has actually gotten worse, not better. it's gotten to the point where im questioning my own sanity for continuing to play. you can only blade of woe so many npc's and do so many wriits to get gold to trade for crowns to buy useless nonsense then rinse and repeat. the game is AWFUL! don't be fooled by the hours i foolishly played. almost all those hours were spent on thievery and/or assassination romps or playing dungeons or playing the original content, with 20 different characters. i had to keep making new ones cause i hate 90% of the game and its more fun to make a new character to play the 10% i loved then keep doing the same thing with the same toon. in short, i should be committed for WASTING this many hours playing a game i haven't really enjoyed in probably 6 or 7 years. it's gotten to just be a habit! a habit i have broken. won't be playing or signing on anymore, and absolutely do not recommend the game for anyone else. i actually feel quite ripped off, despite spending minimal real world money. the devs have no respect for the player and care nothing for what the player outside their core base (homsexuals, angry women, and angry women who are homosexuals mainly) wants or cares about. yes, some aspects of the game are fun, but they get old fast and it turns almost into a job signing on everyday to do dailies and writs. thats why i quit wow 10 years ago!!! so wth am i doing repeating the same mistake with a game thats not even half as good as wow is? i swear there's something wrong with me ... that's my updated review. thanks for reading.one more followup. i actually let my kids take over this account and play, and both of them are already sick of it too! the loot tables are garbage (last night my son killed 24 coldharbour world bosses in a row on 4 different toons and got 23 pairs of blessed greaves before the stygian pants finally dropped he wanted on the 24 th try ... then today he goes into crimson cove for spinner gear and kills all seven bosses, and only 2 actually drop loot, the rest just give gold! i had to laugh because thats the same nonsense i was going through with this game nearly a decade ago!!!!) he handed me the control and told me i could delete the account, he doesnt want to play anymore! im gonna let my daughter give it a shot! i give it about an hour before she's either bored or disgusted and quits too!!! and mind you, know now (for those of you who havent played yet and are thinking about trying out the game for the first time) the devs WILL NOT listen to you! this game is not profitable enough for them to do anything other than what they're doing! they sell you nonsense in the crown store. thats it. thats ALL they care about. no matter how much you complain, or what you're complaining about, they WILL ignore you!!!! they DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE PLAYERS!!!! they've targeted their far left audience and keep sucking blood out of the morons through their crown store and THATS IT!!!! when sales drop enough in that crown store they will abandon this game. i guarantee it. it's already happening, VERY slowly ... but it is happening. just look at the reviews for the gold coast ""expansion!"" look at the great reveal they just had releasing two new companions, BUT ... you have to buy them from the crown store!!! they aren't part of the extremely overpriced terrible xp!!!! if you bought the xp OR either companion, you're the reson eso ignores everyone and keeps serving huge piles of doo doo to everyone! at this point, everyone would be far better off if they turned off the servers for this incredibly bad pile of yuck. just had to add that seeing my son take all of about 50 hours of gameplay time to decide it wasn't worth playing! glad he figured it out a lot quicker than i did! thx for reading."
Negative,"Edit: I bought the game again and have finally solved the issue thanks to a thread in the ESO Steam discussions.The solution was to change my UserID. Such a weird thing to be causing it. Especially because I changed my UserID back afterwards and it still works. After linking my existing ESO account to my Steam account using their website, I got into an endless loading screen when I tried to log in to the game. Then I tried unlinking my Steam account and tried linking it through the game itself. That didn't work either, just got a ""connection timeout"" error message every time.Then I contacted Bethesda support, explaining all the different things I had tried and how none of them worked. They replied telling me that they were aware of the problem and that in the mean time, I should unlink my account through their website and link it in-game instead. That was the first thing I mentioned having already tried in my initial message.I replied that I wouldn't bother when no one would even read my message in the first place and went and requested a refund on Steam.They replied next day with another clearly automated message.So at no point did anyone read my messages. I'm just getting automated responses and the worst part is that both of the responses start off like this: ""Thank you for contacting The Elder Scrolls Online Team. My name is ""insert name"" and we will be discussing this matter with you.""I get that automated messages can make sense in some cases, but lying and disguising them as messages from real people is just super scummy."
Negative,"I can't recommend anyone to ever spend a dime on this game. Very exploitative of a community that wants badly to enjoy an Elder Scrolls experience in an open world full of strangers and friends.I don't mind spending a bit more money than something is actually worth, but I can't help but feel like a complete sucker afterwards when I spend money here.I regularly have to re-do quests that have been bugged since at least 2014. After a while you really get the sense this game wasn't originally designed with Elder Scrolls in mind at all. It feels like an after-thought, even though that is the primary motivation for players to spend their time/money on this game."
Negative,"It's fun and I'm hooked and maybe this is the broke **** in me talking, but frankly playing without ESO+ is kinda asking to have a rougher time starting out. The crafting bag should really be a base game thing, especially with the pitiful amount of inventory and storage space you get at the beginning and the steep prices to increase that space, so it kinda makes the game's business very bloodsucker-y to paywall a pretty integral feature if you want to not fuss with your inventory every five minutes and actually advance with crafting at a reasonable pace. I've only been playing for a couple weeks though so maybe I've just gotta ""git gud""."
Negative,"you donot have enough inventory to claim item-you donot have enough inventory to claim item-you donot have enough inventory to claim item-you donot have enough inventory to claim item-you donot have enough inventory to claim item-you donot have enough inventory to claim item-Goddamn it do I really have to pay for eso+ to get more space?paying for game wasnt enough?i mean okay, the game is cool and fun but why would u make a 70 space inventory. dovakhim could have get more space. seriously, make this right for the love of God.edit:after 700 hours, and also after submitting report for inventory increase, they didn't care about it, i increased my inventory to 200 and theres no further plus i increased my bank space to max its not enough in this game. missions are so weak made. only good thing made me continuing this game was getting werewolf from another player other things are weak made in missions. good luck"
Negative,"Coming from older titles this one looked promising, instead you find:- Shitty megaservers, if the server has the smallest of crashes and logs you out, it won't let you back in for at least 30 minutes, complete waste of time.- Aggressive market - Poorly written quests with obvious plots- Poorly designed zones, makes exploring boring immediately.- PvP...oh boy, first pay 2 win, 2nd favours long time players through fully unlocked sets that take time to get, 3rd bugs and exploits such as infinite debuffs and use of desyncs, 4rth mention that in a stream, instant ban from stream...- Only things that get balanced are the ones that do not need balancing.- Toxic and discriminative community in higher rank activities (veteran activities)"
Negative,"The Elder Scrolls Online is one of those game that is on cruise control after years of relative success. I tried it years ago and I stopped after 50+ hours and I forgot why I did. I decided to write myself a reminder note on why I quit this time (and probably last time too).What I dislike:-Uninspiring and clunky (at times) combat mechanics that favour you being a tank. If you wanted another role, good luck especially for mid to end-game content. I’ve seen some, but it was a dungeon-specific set-up with a clan.-Graphics are ok but show their age. Visuals are quite lacklustre.-The ennemies refresh rate is ridiculously fast at times. You’ll kill that one enemy, walk 20 meters away, and go back on your track ‘cause you forgot your stove was on in your house and you don’t want it to burn to the ground. The house is not far away so, instead of teleporting, you walk there. The same dude you just killed is back after 17 seconds of downtime. I mean, really? -The world levels up with you. Great for players that just want to “clear” an entire section of the game without ever being confronted with an opposition that require you to think, but it gets boring fast. You work hard to level up and the enemies just chill and they level up? Unfair :)-The quest system is finicky. Let's say that you need to get ship parts that the NPCs could not be bothered to find 15 meters away from them or whatever. Then, sadly, you press the quest rotation key or talk to an NPC that has a quest for you and you’re done looking for the boat parts. Can I choose to refuse a quest for now or store it without disturbing my current quest? No, you can’t. It switches it up immediately. It would not be as bad as it is if the main quest menu was better. I don’t want to have to cycle through millions of side quests to find my boat part objective again. It’s just eating away slowly at my patience.-The menu is one of the worst I’ve seen in the genre (not that I’m trying to find a worse one which I’m certain exist). It’s dark in a bad way, hard to read, and organized in a way that promotes buying instead of ease of navigation, and the sorting options could be much better.My biggest pet peeve:-I’m an adventurer and I am not rewarded for adventuring. The exploration rewards are simply not worth it unless you’re doing a quest. This quest-based system is fun for some, but it takes the freedom away from the players. It’s a step-by-step, hold your hand until you can run approach and it drives me into darkness and despair (I’m a bit dramatic, but you see the point future me).What I’d like to know:-The game barely changed in like… 5 years. Where is the money going? Not in graphic or gameplay improvements, that’s for sure.What I like:-Crafting mechanics are good and fun. Grindy but fun.-Dialogues are good enough and all acted.-World is big and there are lots of things to do.So many good games out there and many of them are similar enough to Elder Scrolls Online, which make this playing experience more painful than it needs to be.5/10"
Negative,What's good: The Elder Scrolls lore.What's bad: The rest of it.
Negative,it makes you feel like an alzheimers patient the way enemies respawn the second u look away from them. also everything is floaty.
Negative,"It's a good game, but it runs really bad"
Negative,"Brought the game when necromancer came out, spend a hour to find out i could not summon skeletons as a F*CKing necromancer and refund the game. saw it on sale for 5-20 bucks wanted to give it another shot, remembered the crafting bag is stuck in ESO+ got .hack G.U. instead..hack G.U. 10/10"
Negative,"If you're just looking to play this as a casual low effort after work experience then it's a pretty good choice. If you want to play it for its endgame then I wouldn't consider buying it. The devs proved again and again that they don't care about the endgame community. Loads of choices against the interested of the endgame community, gamebreaking bugs that didn't/don't get fixed after months of being in the game, ignored feedback, etc, etc. The latest big patch was bad enough that a mass exodus of the endgame community happened. The majority of the raid-discords and many friendslists are empty now. People left a game they played for years, their heavily invested accounts, and their communities/friends because it just got too bad and there is no sign that it'll get better."
Negative,look. i love this game. but the awful transphobic work environment that its development company is deeply upsetting. and the aggressive monetization of this game is also pretty terrible. i don't think these things are entirely escapeable; i think most triple a videogame companies suffer these issues. but god how i wish it would change
Negative,"Game is interesting when i'm able to log in. There's a lot to learn up front and looking into some guides to get started is definitely something i'd recommend. If you're hoping for something that's got the same exploration and atmosphere of the single player Elder Scrolls games, this really isn't that, but it can be fun on its own.Unfortunately, every few times i'd try to play, there's an infinite loading screen right after logging in that never had the same fix twice. There's only so many times someone can be recommended to reinstall all 100+ GB of this game again before it isn't worth it anymore. When the game would login and load, graphical and performance issues were definitely more rare, but still present.The game isn't exactly inexpensive to get started with either. There sure seems to be a lot of technical issues for the amount of money and time they ask for up front. And even AFTER paying full price for new expansions, there's a lot of additional content that will be locked behind premium currency. Live service MMOs need paid content to keep things running, but there's a lot you can/have to pay for in ESO and the more of it i see, the less i'm convinced the cost was worth it for me. Before you buy anything, i'd really recommend looking into how much it'll cost to get the things you're interested in so you can decide if the money spent will be worth the investment to you. Between all the technical issues and cost for the new content, it's mostly just left me kind of bitter about the whole thing. I'm definitely craving more Elder Scrolls worldbuilding, but not enough for dealing with all that."
Negative,p2w cost to fucking play the game even thought you bought it $2100 because why the fuck not
Negative,"Not sure what happened but the game no longer works with my PC. Shame, I actually wanted to play some more but the launcher is absolutely broken now"
Negative,"Game has a frustrating bug where it crashes on launch. I have tried EVERY SINGLE SOLUTION to try and fix this, it is not my system, I have gone through everything that I could find but the game is just absolutely broken. I love this game to death but this is just unacceptable. Played it on console and then PC but it seems they can't get it together to fix their biggest bug."
Negative,"For premium subscribers only; all others need not apply.  You bought the game and think you're entitled to a fun time?  Screw you, here's crippling inventory issues.  You paid money for the extra chapters?  Screw you, there's still packages that cost premium currency.  You want top-tier gear by grinding instead of by paying $$ for it?  Screw you, we have real-cash gacha boxes and you can roll the dice on a useless fancy hat like everyone else.I'm angry at myself for giving this a try after resisting for so long and I'm angry at Bethesda for not being clearer about how much money I should expect to pay to really enjoy this game.Edit to add: I entered a ticket through the system as the dev rep listed below, but I honestly don't know why they said to do that.  This had to be a deliberate choice on the developers' part.  Acting like they had no idea this was happening is just embarrassing for both of us."
Negative,"Error 209PatchManifestError_VersionFailI tried every ""solution"" out there, but i am still unable to pass the login screen.You can keep it.*UinstalledEdit to add :I can start it and access the game, so it is not a downloading issue, and referring to a site that deal with generic downloading issues is not helpful..At all.The problem is when i come to the login page, then i get the 209, it says i am missing a patch. A patch i have downloaded and installed more than once on a limited line.There are currently 193 000 results if you search for "" Error 209 PatchManifestError_VersionFail ESO""And granted i have not gone trough them all, but i have been trough enough of them to see that the standard reply is ""help"" like this, so the game is uninstalled and refunded."
Negative,"Ok with this game, It's not bad but it's not great either. I played with a group for a decent amount of time and we did tons together like doing the hard dungeons and getting the skins and altered movements and we had played all the way up until the Skyrim expansion. Then we found a different MMO and it was personally one that I find to be better. Comparing the 2 from the time I have put in them showed a bit, ESO when I played had problems that would go unfixed for a good lengthy amount of time, Instead they just kept pushing out unnecessary loot boxes and other unwanted stuff. When the switch to the other MMO was made I noticed many things, If there was a problem with something it was fixed pretty quick, They listened to their community and are thriving to the point the latest expansion drop broke the servers until recently. Only thing this game has over the other MMO is you don't have to pay to play it with a Subscription but in a way you do if you want access to the games better stuff, ESO plus is kind of a need if you have any intention of sticking with this game tbh. Otherwise it's kinda bland, But again it isn't bad but not great."
Negative,"After 1900 hours in this game I can no longer recommend it, did you know you can even get banned for this gem for teabaging? wtf righ what a bunch of kitty cats. this game is no longer fun and update after update we get less content and more paid items and features from the crown store. sadly id say if you havent played it dont waste ur time here and if you have less then 300 hours run away fast. zos killed the game."
Negative,"lost a entire day installing and patching the game 179 gb when all said and done. ONLY TO GET KICKED OFF THE SEVER FOR ""inactivity"" WHILE STUCK WAITING FOR CHARACTER CREATION NEVER GOT TO PLAY THE ACTUAL GAME. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, NOT EVEN FOR THE 60% DISCOUNT"
Negative,terrible balance 1 bar builds are stronger than anything and pvp is so unabalnced people group up and click 1 button and cant kill anything because devs put cross healing back in. do not reccomend for pvp but if you enjoy pve then maybe check it out.
Negative,tod hauerde jebem ti mater u picki 16 puta
Negative,optimise the file size please
Negative,"The combat just ain't fun, feels very clunky"
Negative,"It is clear from the proposed changes for update 35 that the developers do not care about the community of this game. They seem to be actively working to drive away the entire endgame community by pushing through extremely unpopular changes without regard for the universally negative feedback they receive about them. Constant, massive, ill-considered changes to the combat system that drive away the end-game community, ignoring the concerns of the middle-tier who are still leaning how to do content making their job actively more difficult, completely ignoring (and in fact, actively insulting) the PVP community. Frankly this game is dying, the developers are killing it as fast as they can . Some of them, particularly the ones in charge of combat need to be fired before this game is over."
Negative,"it's ""ok"" wouldn't rec it over other rpgs tho, get it on sale, Wait for ES:6 or play ES:5. Highly Rec you Play FF14 if you want a more modern mmo that keeps your attention with a good story and fun gameplayby ""OK"" I mean it's not as free in terms of the choices of things u can do, lot's of quest's feel very like a fetch quest, which is a shame, because the elder scrolls franchise was good at making fetch quests not feel like blatant obvious fetch quests, I get this is a mmo, and mmos all have fetch quests to level you up early on, however the way they have been designed in the early game areas are boring and uninspiring for a ES title. combat is mid, feels like a weird mix of oblivion and skyrim, it's ok, just not good. you're not as free in the choices you're aloud to make early on whatsoever, unlike past installments in terms of things ur aloud to do or get away with- the only positive note I can add is the fact u ARE able to design ur own class freely, with what weapons, skills etc, as you level, HOWEVER do keep in mind, it's a mmo, there is a metaNegativity aside, TLDR; game has a lot of early game issues, The sub isn't required unlike other big mmos, buy it on sale, don't bother with full price"
Negative,The game was awesome with friends.......  EDITED :1.09.2023ZOS TOOK AWAY GIFTING TO FRIENDS.. It means i cant gift a funny hat to a friend to make fun of him.. DOnt buy it.. its literaly PAY TO PLAY  and full of microtransactions. MONETYZING EVerything.  IF you think of buying then no.. Everything is now behind a paywall.
Negative,"The game is a somewhat fun MMO with quite an immersive environment. If you come from other Elder Scrolls games and media, this might sustain your interest in the lore. Without elaborating (for now), this game has the potential to be great. WARNING VERY LONG RAMBLING So with that opinion, why wouldn't I recommend this game? Well, here are my issues:By the time of writing this review, the game costs almost $19. The base game content is definitely worth the price. That is my only positive comment on all the monetization and pricing in this game. The first thing I think is just scandalous is the premium user subscription system. Of course, you might hear ""subscription and the Crown Store are just quality-of-life and vanity items. You don't have to get them."" which is somewhat true. But let's put some of those benefits of premium into a Skyrim (of course) setting. Can't access the Brotherhood, the Thieves Guild, and the Werewolf/Vampire quests, skills, and items.All alchemy, blacksmithing, enchanting, and cooking ingredients weigh as much as the heavy deadric armor ( ESO doesn't have a weight system, it just has a space limit for your inventory, so one Nirnroot = Steal two-handed sword )In front of some caves, there is an invisible wall, and if you touch it, you get a ""f*ck you, pay me"" prompt in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.You gain XP slower and gain less goldYour chests have a space limit, and that limit is smaller without premium. That's not all of it, of course. Those were the features that bother me the most. There are more rewards for inputting your card info into the game, but let's say you don't want the premium. Well, I mentioned the Crown Store. That's the shop where you can spend your special currency. You can buy most of the DLC content (if you got premium, you can access content from those DLCs while you have an active premium subscription), vanity items, and some consumable items there, which are not really that mandatory. Well, at least if you're satiated with repeating the same dailies and same 6 dungeons. A lot of content that isn't considered ""beginner"" by the community is hidden by payable DLC (and some dungeons by the premium subscription), so if you look through recommendations for some builds and gears for your hero, you might keep hitting the ""shit, I don't wanna spend $10 just for one set of armor"" wall.I don't mind grind games. I quite like mindless/not so mindless grinding. But I like the type of grinding, where I can decide on my own how much I spend on grinding. Sometimes, maybe I wanna spend 6 hours in front of my pc just listening to music and doing nothing but the same quest over and over. Sometimes, maybe I just want to do one run to test my luck, and then do something productive instead. In ESO the game tells you how much you can spend your time. And it usually depends on how much your actions will affect them in the game market. If you want a piece of armor from a dungeon? Go ahead. Do it. The dungeon items can be only traded between players you did the dungeon with, so nothing bad really can happen. But let's say you want a special look for your shoes (Just change how they look. Not the stats. Not the enchantment. Just a change of the items model on your character.). F*ck you. You get one try a day to even get a CHANCE to get one of the armor pieces of that style. We don't want you to get the possibility to change the model of your shoes so easily. But maybe go to the player market, maybe there will be an offer below 100k gold. This game, in this matter, is an enigma to me. Monster Hunter World (2018 year of release) with worse fps is more enjoyable performance-wise than this 2014-year-old game. Why? Well, loading screens of course. For the first time in my entire life, I had to lower the graphic settings not because of a poor fps count. Instead the game just kept throwing loading screens at me. Midway through a dungeon? Loading screen. Fighting enemies (Let's not mention that you're lucky if you can even see the enemies)? Loading screen. Running in the city to the crafting district? Loading screen. You're in the crafting district? Wait 40 seconds for each crafting station to load in. Or do you want to sell something? Yeah, wait another 40 seconds for the NPC to load in, and then another 40 seconds for the interaction animation to load in (no, you can't avoid it. You have to initiate it to open the dialog window). (Before you comment on this topic: I had in-game stable 60 fps and over 100fps on loading screens. No, I won't install this game on an SSD. That is not a solution. That's the same as saying ""you've got kidney issues? Just buy a dialysis machine, dummy"". No, I don't have MHW on SSD. They are on the same HDD drive. )So the biggest strike immediately from me. The ""new person = bad"" mindset is present in this game. If you join a new dungeon with random veteran players, the only act of kindness you'll ever receive from them is them silently waiting for you for 30 seconds before running off for the next boss. You'll be blamed if you don't immediately say ""guys wait, I have to wait for the quest objective"", someone might quit because they just rather start a new dungeon queue instead. Sometimes even you will be blamed for not rushing the whole dungeon, and only killing the bosses. Because of course, you're a ""bad player"" and a "" stupid *choose your slur here*"" for even thinking of going as one  group  in a  group quest . Then we have the ""majority of the community plays DPS characters -> only DPS are valuable team members"", "" healers are just health pumps, we don't care if the army of enemies/boss is focusing on them, it's their fault, they should just kill the enemies AND heal me"", "" I can be a tank *chooses a tank role in the group queue with a DPS set equipped*"". Of course all of this is partially blamable on the fact, that the dev team is TERRIFIED of adding new wildly aviable free content. So all those dungeons might as well have been accessible for the last eight years.If you are reading this, swell job. Thanks for reading my slightly organized angry ramblings. There are still some points I have, that aren't as important but still add to this pile of a mess. Wanna dispute or discuss any points I've brought up? Give this review a comment. Then agian, I'm writing this more of as a way to just share my anger with some people (and potentially getting an automated response from the PR team as a funny). Please keep in mind, this is all about a game. Everyone can like whatever they want, and in the end, I might still add hours to this game's hour count."
Negative,"(Bought Blackwood CE + ESO plus.)(Final edit, probably, now that ESO plus lapsed and I got to experience the problems that come with that.)(Final final edit to remove speculation and to emphasize clown-ass dev response.)(Oops more edits, because my dumb ass decided to play it some more! Sorry it reads like ass, it's been edited carelessly several times now lol)I'm in it for story only at this point, which is actually good. Sometimes a bit weird (NPCs talking about your race as if you aren't whatever race, doing zones out of order, and doing quests WITHIN THE SAME ZONE out of order), but still good.The good things.- Story. There's a lot, and it's good.- Houses are nice, and being able to place things so specifically is great. lol nvm, furniture capacity without ESO plus leaves them very underwhelming.The gameplay is pretty scuffed.- Animation cancelling/""Weaving"" between every ability for high end PVE and all PVP.- Dodging doesn't truly move you until the animation is over, so an AOE can kill you while you are visibly outside of it but not fully finished dodging.- Non-consumable buffs need constant refreshing, and a decent setup will usually have lots of this.- Theft system and guards kinda blow. Guards are invincible, but very easy to escape from. They just end up being annoying. Run away, return. 1 minute. It's very easy but not fun. Let us kill guards. They serve no purpose outside of the theft system. There is no need for them to be invincible. Also theft loot is kinda shit.- I can't tell what the purpose of levels are. Everything scales. It just gates you from getting Champion Points if you aren't max level, which seem to be the actually important thing. Just remove levels entirely.- Bag/bank space, even after upgrades, is pretty oppressive.- Bizarre leashing behavior. It seems that when an enemy has escaped their leash range, they will continue to attack until you either move toward or attack them. This makes a common annoyance; when you complete a dungeon and rush back through to the exit, you may have to wait a moment to tickle the mobs chasing you because they will interrupt your exit and will continuously do so until you trigger them to leash.- Public dungeons/delves means waiting around for bosses to respawn, or accidentally missing bosses entirely because they're dead and it's not apparent a boss should be there.- Some quest markers are absolutely useless. One that comes to mind is for the public dungeon in The Rift. For one of the quests here, the marker points you up the cliff face very close to the entrance. You actually have to go through the whole place, and then through a cave which finally leads to that spot.- No matter what, you are a spellcaster.- Auction house? Nah, hundreds of guild trader locations that guilds must bid on, often resulting in monthly fees for its members. You will need to use a third party website to actually find the items you want to buy, and then you will have to get to the location and buy it before someone else.(There's a lot more that I didn't include. There are a million small and not-so-small issues that really add up, and this is getting long enough.)-TIME GATING. You better be on the ball with your equipment research. That shit takes a long time, maybe months.This is also just way too monetized.- It's a paid game with an ""optional"" subscription which is required if you don't want to be miserable. My sub lapsed, and my fully upgraded bank and bag were filled in under half an hour of playing. Everything is much slower now, because I have to selectively loot but the game throws so much garbage at you.- Expansions come in two pieces, the first piece alone costing more than a full game while delivering so little.- GAMBLING CRATES LOL.- LIMITED TIME GAMBLING CRATES LMAO- LIMITED TIME ALL-KINDS-OF-STUFF- $100+ ingame houses- Better be subscribed if you want to make full use of your $100+ house, because furniture limitations!- The better cosmetics are from microtransactions, some only having a limited release. I'm not counting endeavors, because they were only added to appease Microsoft's microtransaction policy in what seems like the bare minimum way. It takes about a year of doing endeavors (daily + weekly tasks) for a single radiant apex reward.- There are almost 100 mounts in the game, however all but a handful of them are from the crown store. Without the crown store, your options are limited to a few regular horses, and a few others. I recently got two free promo/event/whatever mounts. Guess what? More basic ass horses.- Do you want multiple gear sets, maybe for your stam build, magic build, and PVP build? Without ESO+ your already limiting bag/bank space says fuck you. (PVP is important to progression btw)I thought I paid for a game, not an admission fee for a store. Oopsies. Everything about this game incorporates microtransactions one way or another. Scummy ZOS.To the dev response; I am not (too) stupid. I know MMOs need to make money. That does not mean it needs to include almost every form of monetization. As for paying for ""customization"", sure. That's mostly fine, if it weren't for the fact that everything paid looks miles flashier than everything else. Earning fancy things is part of the fun in MMOs. Now when I see something cool, I just think ""Oh, cash shop. /spit""Also worth repeating, apparently, GAMBLING CRATES LOL, LIMITED TIME GAMBLING CRATES LMAO, $100+ ingame houses which still need a sub to make full use of.This game is incredibly disrespectful, and as long as it is around, we will not see a good Elder Scrolls MMO. What a waste."
Negative,if you're interested in pvp don't bother. devs have zero intention of balancing in regards to pvp and ignore that it exists. everyone has infinite healing and survivability and you're more likely to die to lag than another player. nerf dks
Negative,"*frustrated about connection to launcher reveiw alert* took damn long to load the launcher even thou i already re download like 3 f-ng time, im return player, and found out that morrowind now free, and the connection to the game for me took forever even just getting in to the launcher it self"
Negative,"The game is nearly unplayable. My computer bluescreened 9 times in 24 hours. I will be submitting a refund request and, until the devs fix the issues with crashing and BSODs, I will not be playing this title."
Negative,Cant backup the game after taking 6 days to download. Then it wants to download more on launcher. Uninstalled entire game.
Negative,"Game is very boring, even when playing with a friend."
Negative,"couldn't even play the game, when i got to the app and i clicked play it did nothing, i tried several things and nothing worked..."
Negative,"I am 30 years old and nearsighted, but not that much; even with the UI set to the biggest the font is too small and narrow to play comfortably. Supposedly there are workarounds, but I tested three and none of them worked. Serious failure on the accessibility front."
Negative,buys games game wont load spont 2 hours tryen to fix it sucks i realy wanted to play it agin i have it on xbox thought pc would be better nope wont even load just keeps loading then says error bs any one know what to do besided uninstalling it
Negative,"the game is dead, group finding for trials is non existing....well time to move onyou put stuff from your inventory in your chests that you own inside your houseyou log in the next day and the stuff is goneyou write a ticket to the supportthey demand an confirmation that it is an issueyou give them screenshots and listings of what is missing , since when it is missing and you waitbut the support dosnt give a shit about itwell fuck the customer i guess, as long as you pay why would someone care about it right?also wont allowe friends from eastern countrys to buy dlc, thats some fucked up shit right there"
Negative,"My account was wrongfully banned by this company after 400 hours of play.  I received an email stating I was using a third party software - which is flat out false.  Apparently a few months they also wrongfully banned a higher profile player and issued a public apology for it.   Whatever algorithm they are using to determine ""cheating"" is clearly wrong and if you play this game you are at risk of having your account banned for no reason whatsoever.   I've submitted an appeal and requested an apology as well but I am leaving this review so other people are aware that this company can and does wrongfully ban people so buyer beware."
Negative,"Not as fun as it should be. The Crown store is bankrupcy at it's finest. The Quest marker is all types of buggy, It points me across the map for a quest when there is a teleporter close by for me to get there faster, sometimes it points me to quests that I did not target so I end up following the wrong ACTIVE target... It's an old mmorpg that is way outdated and needs a touch-up. But please, for the love of god don't do what SEGA did to PSO!"
Negative,"Everything other than the basics costs real money.Non-subscribers have multiple limitations: inventory and bank capacities are halved, there is less XP gain, no access to paid content (well, yeah), and most essentially, they do not have access to the CRAFTING BAG, a tool that can hold unlimited amounts of crafting materials that otherwise will be difficult for a non-subscriber to accrue in order to be a lucrative or even proficient crafter or trader, since your inventory slots are halved and each of the hundreds of crafting components requires a slot and will only stack up to a certain limit.Now, part of your monthly ESO+ subscription converts into their premium currency, Crowns.That is, we are paying for a pack of digital currency to spend in their cash shop, as well as benefits and improvements that only improve artificially hampered aspects of the free player's experience. Cool.I will not even mention loot boxes in detail, as they are another evil in and of themselves. ESO Casino Simulator.Here is the catch:For a new player, it all seems reasonable and justifiable, because you still have no frame of reference and the game looks good. It is after a few years have passed and your ESO+ subscription has expired, you will realise how unfair every little restriction they have painstakingly imposed in their game really is.I'm not going to lie; I had some fun over the years, mostly due to guilds and other elements not directly related to the issues raised in this review.Now it's time to rest my staff, bow, sword, shield, dagger, mace, and hammer—but not my crafting bag, which ZOS already took away :`)"
Negative,"So, I've not played for a long time, but there is something I need to warn people about. Me and 3 of my friends bought this game a few days ago and so far 2 of us are stuck with an error that makes the game unplayable. After creating your Character the game says ''Requesting Character Load"" and then proceeds to load into the game (same process after your character is created). If you are one of the unlucky few, your game will be stuck on this ''Requesting Character Load'' screen and then throw out an error. After some research I can conclude that the developers are aware of this problem, but hasn't fixed it yet, because this has been a problem since 2017 it seems. Looks like a VPN is your only chance if you get this problem, because uninstalling and reinstalling didn't work (100 GB is a gross amount), the ""official"" help also didn't work, so just keep this in mind :)"
Negative,"First my review was good now its bad, they create inconveniences then sell the solution...The heavily use fomo , to urge players into buying content , without your credit card the game becomes unrewarding...........extremally sad, and the ppl who defend it are horrible , just plain rude in defense of predatory practice's  They just removed the only feature mitigating that , and even with that feature it was still hell to get things , i love the franchise so much , so i only play solo story's now when they come out....none of my friends i made over these last 7 years want to play........THEY ABSOLUTLEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR PLAYERS AT ALL...... :("
Negative,"I really want to like this game, but I just don't. It has great graphics, you can run around and kill enemies, even do some crafting or quests, sure. All of these things are centered around combat which normally isn't an issue... but the combat is just god awfully bland. You either left click or you block. Sure there is skills, but none of which really feel significant... They give the sort of bonuses that equal to two left clicks instead of one. 2,500 weapon damage might sound great, but default left click you do like 1,200, So skills really don't feel like they're doing anything other than wasting stamina or mana. It just doesn't feel fun to run around and have to manually click everything 20 times till it dies."
Negative,Good game that has come along way from where it was at launch. This being said you wont have fun unless you're paying $15 a month on top of whatever the game costs which is why I would not recommend to a friend.
Negative,"I paid a lot for this... and I regret it. I have not played it in some time, but I do remember just not enjoying this at all. I bought it for myself and a few friends and within a few days, none of us played it anymore."
Negative,"The game is nice, but the worstest support i've ever seen. If you ever need help, you won't get any an answer from developers."
Negative,"please make an Asia server, the lag is really really bad. The game is very good and I would very much like to keep playing, but the lag is too much, can't even light attack without a 2-second delay, it hurts the experience too much. Will definitely come back when the game has a server that I can play on with decent ping, even starting from scratch. And I know a lot of people who would do the same."
Negative,not like skyrim but i like itbut there some thing made me vary angry in this shity way to steal from player the dlc isnt clear i want to buy them but many player complain about blackwood and other upgrades cant be bought from them
Negative,"If I had to pick one thing that prevent me from recommending this game, It would be how easy, mindless and boring the combat is, and when you actually get to do hard content like veteran dungeons you will realize that the game didn't prepare you for this type of content."
Negative,"As an Elder Scrolls game, ESO is incredibly disappointing.  If you can play it without trying to draw parallels between the game play and dynamics of other ES games and ESO, it's simply another generic MMORPG.  The skill trees, skill progression, and even thievery are sorely lacking when compared to Oblivion and Skyrim."
Negative,It is just a bit meh
Negative,garbage DLC mechanics. had to sell my kidney to play the full game.
Negative,i wish i played it for one less hour so i could get a refund but no i had to give it another hours of a chance and honestly it felt like i played it for 5 just play the 10th version of skyrim or sumn
Negative,"I couldn't even play the intro.A bug that has occurred since launch, and has never been fixed, accelerates the mouse every 5 seconds to unplayable speeds. I hope to get my refund. Bethesda is a disgrace!"
Negative,"This is more of a neutral review. This game is ~100 GB. My SSD is 500 GB. It's not so fun that I have the urge to play it all the time. There are other games I enjoy that don't even take a quarter of ESO's size. You see the problem ?With that said, if you love Elder Scrolls lore and MMOs to death then this is alright. The blatant monetization and time-walling can be annoying and insulting though."
Negative,"Boring combat, story taken straight from Oblivion, dialogue is nothing interesting. This MMO really does nothing different from other MMOs, the only good part is it doesn't have a subscription fee. Unless you really really like the Elder Scrolls, it's a skip."
Negative,"So, went to launch the game today. Launches fine until the character select screen. My GPU jumps from 70 degrees F, to 130-140 degrees F in a very short time period. I thought maybe it was an issue with my card or my fans. That said, I can run any other game, max graphics for extended periods without ever getting over 90, yet on an IDLE character screen for ESO, i'm spiking for some reason. I did some googling, and I found that although this issue seems to be common, EVERYONE seems to blame the persons computer. I can play AC odyessy at max graphics without issues, but a game 10 years old overheats my GPU? I see people saying ""A game can't break your GPU"". I beg to differ.Running GTX 1070 8gb and 32 gb ram. My point, is that sitting on the log in screen should not jump my GPU 40-90 degrees in a matter of a minute to 130+ degrees, when I can actually PLAY farcry 5 and AC odyessy on max graphics without passing 105 (with my fans at 60% mind you). I had to re install the game and turn my fans to 90% to keep it at 111-115. The game is poorly optimized and absolute hell on your hardware. There's absolutely no reason for it, for a game this old. PERIOD.I attempted to post on the steam boards about it, got trolled for my countries method of measurements, and blamed hardware as usual. I can put my computer through graphical hell on newer games and get lower temps than IDLING ON THE *%*%ING LOGIN SCREEN. My response to them was as follows.Take your condescending, rude, and baiting remarks about my countries choice of measurement of temperature (like i have any choice or sway on that regard, lol #LOGIC) and fold them up in a neat little square and cra...... Nvm. Wasting my breath at this point. I'll just uninstall and give it a negative review.EDIT. Played Farcry 6 for about 3 hours last night and had lower temps than idling on the login screen of ESO. Theres no reason, a 7 year old game, with laughable graphics should be more demanding than a Next Gen title. Lame trolls are cracking me up trying to justify and call this normal? I shouldn't have to keep my hardwares fans slammed to 90-100% to stop overheating ESPECIALLY when i can play new age games that are 10x better, with literally 0 issue. This game can get rekd.SECOND EDIT: Instead of actually addressing the issue, they silenced and banned me from the community forums. Glad to see this is how you treat paying customers having issues with your product."
Negative,"Sadly, I can't recommend this game anymore. Due to changes of Update 35 and the incapability to listen to player feedback and calling it ""knee jerk reactions"" (Rich Lambert seems to be really liking his playerbase) I lost all motivation to continue anytime soon. This is not the first but definitely the strongest step into the wrong direction, that serves the game more towards people that stay for a month or two and dump some money into the game before leaving forever. A lot of people, including me, don't even see how the latest updates serve the more 'casual' players since a lot of it is self-contradictory and doesn't make sense.I really hope to see changes into the right direction in the future, if this continues this game won't last many more years."
Negative,"Super unhappy with Mac OS performance. Game crashes frequently when trying to do fast travel. Sometimes getting stuck in location. Booooo. Why is this game available on Mac, it shouldn't be. I cannot finish some quest because of that. Macbook Pro M1, Big Sur"
Negative,Pretty fun game.. reason for dislike is the patch times always takes days or gets stuck
Negative,ping jumps above 200 when i see more than 10 player on PVP
Negative,my game wont start and i try to fix it for hours
Negative,there's no S--Lab Framework for this game
Negative,The Elder Scrolls Online: The Hailcinder Mount Pack ends up being a scam as they charge you money but never provide the coins. Seems like a common and known issue but the problem is not being resolved by developer
Negative,"Why are the basic guilds DLC? Massive cashgrab. But overall with friends, it's fun."
Negative,With the privacy changes cannot in good faith recommend this game anymore.
Negative,"Played for 12 hours, and made little to no progress. This is normal, and I'm ok with it. The moment i realised I didn't want to play though, was when I understood how pay-walled the zones are. This game Could be great fun but I'm appalled by the cashgrab world design."
Negative,"download 120 gb with steam client, including dozens of gb's of unnecessary voice packs for languages i dont speak and can be removed afterwards, download updates via the game launcher (launchers are L)buy every single dlc pack and chapters or you cant compete with others.pvp is fine, you can ezly take down 80% of the players if you know what you're doing, bc they dont."
Negative,"This game always crashes when I use fast travel. It's impossible to follow my friends to dungeons, for example.I've looked online and seen that many people are having the same issue as I with no way to solve it. I also tried all the solutions proposed by Zenimax and nothing worked.After all this trouble and waste of time, I ask Steam for a refund and they didn't accept my request because I played this game for 20h. However, as they should know, 20h in an MMORPG is like nothing at all. Moreover, that was when I had the first opportunity to dungeon dive with my friends, which is for me, is the most important aspect of an MMORPG.If the game doesn't work well on Mac, just be honest and don't sell it.I have bought many games on Steam over the years and never had any complaints. The first time I had one, they flatly refuse to consider my rightful request (the game is unplayable).As a customer, I feel frustrated and betrayed by a company that I used to admire and made thousands of dollars on my back.Congratulations Steam. You saved 25 bucks and will never see a penny of mine, again."
Negative,"Im sad to have to switch my review negative, as you see from my hours played i have alot of experience of the game and i used to love it. Due to the changes made its not the case anymore.Devs only care about its microtransaction store and its casual playerbase, if you are a pvp player your servers lag to the point its unplayable and you literally never get content outside of gamebreaking op sets that get nerfed after a few weeks. The pvp community is almost dead due to this on PC/EU. If you are an endgame player well guess what, the devs ruin the combat for you and its endgame playerbase is dying rapidly on PC/EU server. Dont get into the game if you care about those things, its an remnant of a awesome game ruined by its developers trying to milk every last penny of it before it dies."
Negative,Not newbie friendly. I'm trying to progress but it feels like i'm not getting stronger since the monsters scale with you on low levels?? . wished there was  reset and change char after sometime.
Negative,this games just not for me the style the combat the way quests work seems i run out of to much to do. pvp is just a zerg of people button spamming anyways
Negative,Game devs would rather apparently protect grifers than the ones actually trying to enjoy the game. wish I could get my money back.
Negative,Gonna cry me a river? Go ahead. Maybe you can float out of Craglorn.
Negative,"yeah i spent 50 hours + grinding for one staff, i felt like giving up a lot, but continued out of pure spite, after getting staff countless runs later, i did one dungeon with said staff and uninstalled game. 10/10 best mmo ive played- edit: they have a core mechanic of this game broken, and has been for patches. How do you not prioritise this as a fix and get it solved ASAP. Stupid excuse for a video game. Its been almost a year that some form or antoehr of a block bug is in it. Sort your shit out"
Negative,"It is a great game and so much things to do in ESO. But if you live in southeast asia as I live in Myanmar, you gonna get high ping problem which is getting worst month by month. That high ping can make things much more difficult in veteran dungeons and PvP area. [27/7/2022 ping HIGH, me Sadddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd][14/1/2024 ping Higher than ever. I kinda accept it]"
Negative,"The game's too slow-paced for my liking, but I understand why people would want to continue playing it.5/10"
Negative,No server in Asia.300+ ping in areas with less players.999+ ping in areas with many players.
Negative,"haven't palyed in 4 years . logged on, character gone? thats ok. expansion dlc camel mount and assorted clothes and pets are gone? that i paid money for? fuck that."
Negative,"servers on fire, pvp balance in the dumpster, only thing that hasnt exploded yet is the ingame store that attempts to pillage your wallet."
Negative,"this game should put more server for AE,SEA AND MANY MORE. IT MAKE ME FKING STRESS COZ ALWAYS FKING DC ALL THE TIMES. WHEN GO DUNGEON ENTRY THE DOOR DC HAIYAAA UNCLE ROGER CAN MAKE THIS BETTER"
Negative,"ngl this game is ass. all the cool shit locked behind a paywall, a mf with a credit card 2 minutes into the game can easily look better than a loser with 5k hours not to mention the game's difficulty is brain dead, you finish one zone and move on the next with the same shit different stories this is not an mmo it's just an rpg that happens to be an mmo it's unbelievable. there's no cool earnable shit like mounts you gotta go gamble it all away to these lootboxes or this game calls it ""crown crates"". oh yeah crafting you can't do shit without the subscription not only do you buy the game you HAVE to get the subscription or you won't get the ""craft bag"" it's basically a infinite inventory for your materials to craft stuff. anyway this game is terrible don't play it"
Negative,"I bought this game in the hopes of being able to play something similar to Skyrim (that I had on console) but with friends online. I was sorely disappointed.Although I am able to run alongside in-game friends, the gameplay itself is stopped time and time again by ""pay for more!"" Have you filled up your inventory? Pay for more. Have you just unlocked your first home? Pay for furnishings and decor. Looking for a useful, accessible place to store all your loot? Pay for it.I doubt I'll be playing this much in the future, if at all. Why waste my time grinding on a game when all they want from me ismore real money spent in a virtual space (when in previous games it came without much issue)? I'll just go back to playing Skyrim and be done with it all."
Negative,"EDITED positive review to negative: Read belowAfter 900+ hours i decided to quit this game.Reason? As a PvP Player im not satisfied anymore, i reached goal where i dominated close all BG´s PvP with always 15+ kills with under 5 deaths and most damage done, but....I wanted to play Cyrodill and other stuff and its completely unplayble even i own really good gaming PC.I can run all new games at Ultra 1440p with 80+ fpsIn ESO cyrodiill with 1080p and low detials you get huge drops under 30fps and it makes me feel sick, and i dont even talk about latency, where you have 2-3s delay time when you cast spell.For PvE its maybe fun, but im PvP player and i dont want to play only BG´s with few maps and few objectives and sometimes 10-20 wait time till you get into BG.Maybe i will come back after optimization, but now its unplayable in big PvP zones.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OLD REVIEW:To be honest, im into MMORPGs like 15 years and i never played game as good as ESO is.Yea since new patch came in we have some bugs, crashes and all those annoying things, but that still doesnt change my opinion that this game is brilliant.PvE content, to be sure, im not PvE player and in all games i just played PvE bcause i must (lvl up, gear etc) in ESO i just love to play HM vet Dungs, Trials and all those really great created dungeons with sometimes freaky hard mechanics.PvP in this game is awesome and its something i never experienced before. Block, dodge, roll, interrupt, sneak and all those things in PvP are just awesome, and ofc i dont talk about how many gear/skill options you have.If you are looking for game with extreme big world, endless content and questing, that ESO is for you.For all those cyring about bugs, all games has bugs and im pretty sure that soon will be all back in normal :)CheersDreamChaser1(czech player, so sorry for my english) :)"
Negative,"The game itself is quite fun, but I am frustrated by having to subscribe for inventory space.Also endgame content locked behind huge scale clan fights is annoying. Being forced to be part of a clan is my least favorite thing about MMOsBecause of these problems I can’t give a positive review"
Negative,Don't waste your time or money.
Negative,"DISCLAIMER: English isn't my mother tongue so I'm sorry if there are grammatically errors in my review.I really having fun exploring Tamriel and learn more about Elder Scrolls Universe lore. Skill, Leveling, Crafting system and a lot more are really great. But as a SEA player who always have to play with 260+ ping. I honestly can't recommend this game (for those who aren't living in NA/EU region). PVE content is kinda playable for me. I'm not sure about late game PVE content tho since I'm only level 18 Templar when writing this review. One more downside is I think that the attacking animation is pretty bad.I really wish there will be a ASIA/SEA server available in future."
Negative,"It's 2020 and a programmer tells to another:A: ""Hey!  I worked on a game!  Gosh, programming is so hard!""B: ""Really?  Like the networking code?""A: ""No, not that""B: ""The rendering pipeline?""A: ""No!""B: ""The game state? The A.I.?""A: ""No!  Moving the camera when the mouse moves… it's so hard to do this right.  I read somewhere on SO that I need to access the OS's DLL or kernel just to know when the mouse moves.... it's so hard""B: ""……… I don't think you're in the right profession if 'accessing' the mouse is a problem for you""I have many other games and NONE *require* any sort of security permission *JUST* to access how the f*cking mouse moves so as to NOT make the camera spin wildly out of control when the mouse moves one millimetre to the right.I've also encountered, in the past, an error code which lead me to a ""fix"" (from Bethesda) and the fix essentially tells me to 1) backup the 100GB comprising of the game files and 2) make sure I have the correct C++ Redistributable?  I'm the f*cking player!!… not one of your lackeys you call 'programmer'.  NO player should EVER be required to even know WHAT C++ is…   (helpDOTelderscrollsonlineDOTcom/app/answers/detail/a_id/22414)Pure h*rsesh*t."
Negative,cotton picking simulator
Negative,Not worth at all.
Negative,I'm putting as much effort into writing this review as ZOS has put into fixing game-breaking bugs and server performance issues that have plagued the game for several years.
Negative,"You're buying half a game.If you buy this, you're paying for a game, but if you want to actually play, you'll be paying more for DLCs or the monthly subscription. Features that used to be included, like the Thieves Guild and the Dark Brotherhood, are now paid DLC. Without the monthly subscribtion, this game really isn't worth it."
Negative,"Having known this series from playing Oblivion ages ago, I had high hopes for this game, but it unfortunately hasn't delivered. Quests and combat are incredibly dull, even though it has some nice dodging and parry mechanics that feel a bit souls-like. When it comes to the RPG combat part of it, it is just lack luster. Combat consists in mashing buttons brainlessly until your bar of magica or stamina runs out. No spell or skill I've seen so far feels nice. Level progression feels unrewarding and adds very little to the gameplay. Everything is extremely grindy. The mechanics are designed to make you login and do the basic chores everyday. Login, get your login daily reward, do team dungeon quest, do team pvp, get one out of 300 horse upgrades, and if you're not bored out of your mind yet, progress the boring story a little bit. Every now and then you get to do a boss fight, which can actually be fun (it's one of the few challenging events), if it doesn't turn into a snooze fest, due to the bosses' gigantic health bar.Anyways, TLDR:Positives+ gigantic world+ pretty graphics and landscapes+ occasional challenging event+ nice dodging and parrying mechanicsNegatives- grindy-est game of all time- in the overwhelming part of the time, boring, repetitive, nearly-brainless combat- unrewarding level progression- laggy servers- community feels like a bunch of npcsI do not recommend this game for an adult audience as it may find it fairly unengaging, but I reckon younger audiences may find joy in its exploration aspect and value its extremely forgiving game mechanics."
Negative,"Is this game Buy to Play ? NO.Is this game Monthly-Subscription based ? NO.Is this game like Buy the base game and buy ""optional"" DLC's ? NO.IT IS ALL AT THE SAME TIME INSTEAD THE DLC'S ARE NOT-SO-OPTIONAL.If you like story-based single player games, with an immersive world and good story; this game is for you. But it's titled as an MMORPG so if you want to play an MMORPG, this game is outclassed by many other MMORPG's including free and payed ones. First of all, this game seems like a buy to play title at first sight. But to be remotely useful in anything; you also have to pay the monthly subscription and the dlc's and then there is the crown store which gives you loads of ""advantages"". And these are not advantages which you can achive by just grinding more. Many things are behind a pay wall which you can't earn any other way.   The base systems that are considered basic features for other games.(like crafting.) Needs you to not only have the base-game but you also have to have ESO+ (which is the monthly subscription) , AND you should log-in the game and start ""Researches"" for every kinds of items. And those researches will take you 1 day at first and go increasingly higher until it takes you 30 days to research. So to craft anything valuable you have to either play the game as a FarmVille prototype and get on everyday to start your researches and wait for months to get somewhere, or you can use the Crown Store of course to make it so much faster.    This game doesn't have a marketplace, you have to have a trading guild and dedicate yourself to trading to be able to sell anything. So you can't just farm mobs and sell the staff on the marketplace. (Also, you can't find things to buy as well because everything is crafted at end-game level of gear so if you didn't dump all your money into the game most of your journey will happen with low level worthless gear.)   If you are remotely INTERESTED IN PVP; DO NOT PLAY this game. PvP is so laggy that it's basically unplayable. Well, there might be a lot of P2W aspects in the game, and you might think that ""Well I have money, so I can have fun with the game"", but you'd be wrong because even if you pay for some crown store advantages after paying for dlc's or ESO+(every month) after paying for the base game; you will get into the PvP map cyrodiil and find out that the game is dead and the only people who are playing is people who already payed so much more to this game than you did, cuz they've been paying money to this company for years, and you will find out that their character builds and items are made to work even if it's laggy. And if yours doesn't work when there is a lot of lag, well, you're sh*t out of luck my friend.TL;DR If you pay for the base-game and then the monthly-subscription(or pay for the dlc's) and then a little bit more to the crown store; and you are definitely not interested in pvp. Play this game. But even then, why play this game over some other game that has good story ? Laggy-pvp, doesn't have most of the features that are fundamental to mmorpg's(like crafting and marketplace),  first game I have ever seen which is Buy to play, P2W, Monthly-Subscription and makes you buy DLC's ALL AT THE SAME TIME +A Micro-Transaction Store which has a lot more than Cosmetics."
Negative,"After Guild Wars 2, i give a chance to play this game. At first (in 1 hour) it looked like a good game however when you play a bit longer it got really mess, quest everywhere, no idea what to do. I literally lost in the game and that irritiate me. I immideatly refund the game.Edit1: i gave a chance for 40 hours, it was nice and enjoyable, the lore is great, every sub mission feels like real. however, the ""running"" and mission locations are too far away that you have to run like forever, and teleport 3-4 times to get there. i hate that. even the story so great i can not resist that all running..."
Negative,Subscriptions and loot boxes after already paying for the base game and DLCs. Zenimax can't keep there hand out of your pocket. AAA game developers are pushing themselves out of the industry and can't even see it.
Negative,too buggy! guild trader bug cost my friend 120 million gold and customer support told them tough luck go pound sand.
Negative,dosent even fucking run lmao
Negative,"Resumido primero.LO BUENO:El funcionamiento, Zenimax Online hizo un muy buen trabajoEs mas casual que otros MMORPGs, esto puede ser buenoBuena exploración del Lore de Elder Scrolls, si te gusta la saga vas a encontrar muchas conexiones a toda la saga.HousingBuena acción-combateEl rol del tanque, es un poco mas interesante que en otros MMORPGs.Servers muuuy pobladosTransacciones de moneda del juego por moneda premium entre jugadoresLO MALO:Prefiero otros MMORpgs antes que este (Guild Wars 2 , Black Desert o WOW)Las builds no me gustaron para nada, la meta te obliga a adaptarte o a perderte el contenido con mayor dificultad.Mucho One Hit Kill Boss, táctica barata para aparentar dificultadLa primera persona no se usa para NADA, es contraproducente.Guild Wars 2 hace un mejor trabajo en combateClases y razas restrictivas también sujetas a la meta.La libertad de armar tu personaje se va al tacho cuando empezas a jugar dungeons veteranos.Poca variedad de armasEn definitiva no es malo el juego, pero no tiene nada que hacer junto a otras experiencias que jugué. Haber pagado 180 pesos argentinos fue definitivamente la razon para comprarlo, me dio 2 meses de buena diversion pero me esta costando mucho continuarlo. La estructura e historia de cada mapa es muy interesante como todo se conecta para una historia final, lastima que es un camino de misiones miscelaneas que ya jugamos miles de veces."
Negative,"The game is very good but the lack of some features like cross-save, cross play puts me off."
Negative,"Ugly armors that mostly look all the same. Ugly buildings that look all the same.The rest looks like plastic, but is more acceptable.Oh, and from Classic Fantasy you're turning TES into the colorful magic in everything kind of RPGs like WoW. A downgrade, imo. Just look at those ridiculous mounts. Now you can mount anything, plus make it look like a Carnival parade. It makes me cringe"
Negative,"After years of being available as a finished product, the game still has the developers saying: ""there are some bugs beyond our control"". Well, it is your game, get them fixed because nobody else will. And the worst thing - performance. It is saddening that after 8 years ESO still has a massive issue with lags, especially in PvP. Mind, that this is in conditions of dwindling playerbase because the lag has persisted in Cyrodiil PvP zone both when it was a lively battlezone and now when it is just a shade of its former glory with but a hundred players actually PvPing in prime time.  Lags persist in smaller zones like 4v4v4 battlegrounds as well. The team has continuously tried to feed the community with empty assurances that it will be ok but it hasn't been ok for quite a while. And honestly, we are tired of being fed new lootboxes with inconsequential cosmetics instead of actually looking at the game state. PvP has been abandoned as well with nothing added to it for years and nothing looming over the horizon. For me as for a player who got the game because of advertised large scale open world PvP battles that is very disappointing. There is no endgame for me save for PvP so I guess I will be bouncing the game should ZOS not at least fix its performance. And I do not suggest getting it for anyone interested in PvP. Surely, PvE is nice and neat but not as deep as Bethesda's single player projects. So if you want a nice PvE adventure, better re-play Morrowind, Oblivion, or Skyrim."
Negative,"I love Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim. but this... this is something from an alternate dimension. repetive auto mash game with a non interactive respawning static boredome world made for endless grinding. its made for kids, a toy puppetshow. merry goround at the slowest speed. and the endless buy to win items. yuck. its a brown bannana pudding. a turd with a golden shimmer at best. theres already ideas from Daggerfall endless size. you would have 1 player in each city,players could kill and loot everyone if they wanted and still there will be plenty more civilians and more to hunt even with a 30 day respawn time. Its a shame when you have something good and decide to make a turd of it.... ESO is just that. boring warcraft wannabe game.1.1.22 still the same boring stuff..this game sux huge black pearls-------No matter how much story, graphic and content you put into this it will never be anywhere near an elders scroll game. a blend boring mmo with little interacting teleporting npcs. The fighting is all button mashing auto aim boredom. From the game launched i have tried to like this game many times, but its missing all the basics from all other elders scrolls. This game will always be boring.. this game is a lost cause and a waste of time."
Negative,"do not buy this game on steam. it has a serious lag problem and it will regularly not allow you to log into the game due to issues with the game communicating with steam. when you put in a ticket, you will receive an email saying something to the effect of ""not our problem, buy more micro transactions while you wait"" or ""if we dont hear back from you in a couple days bc this went to your spam folder we will ignore that our game has issues and continue to withdraw your sub fee"""
Negative,"I've played this game for years. Since 2016 to be exact, and I can not recommend this game to any of my friends right now, mainly due to concerns with PvP. ESO had one of the best PvP experiences known to MMOs, but that is becoming a faded memory. To those thinking of purchasing, there were glaring server issues with Cyrodiil/Conquest (PVP), and instead of handling this in a software sense, they have gone after the core gameplay. I am a software engineer for work - instead of blaming TCP (which RUDP is easily an acceptable standard for this), lost packets, and overwhelming community distaste, the management at ZOS has instead decided to gimp PvP beyond recognition. We're not stupid - we know that ZOS has capped server costs, and management would prefer to ship more gambling for mounts than actually improving the game, as the investor gains off of the 1% of spenders.Instead of keeping the fast paced, skill based PVP, Zenimax has decided to shove two months of ""tests"" off of the PTS, and make PvP a dread to play. The reward we get from this? Permanent global cooldowns, increased cost, and decreased regeneration with a nonsensical 3 second timer. An AOE timer is fine, maybe even preferable, but it should depend on group size, not ""fixing lag"". Of the five classes, three are completely screwed by this.I've gone back and forth with my reviews, but this one is by far my most thought out. I do not blame the software engineers at ZOS, however I blame the ignorance of management of handling actual server issues by disabling the ability to play the game. Maybe Microsoft can actually throw you a bone with scaling Azure servers, but for now, it looks like a long and dark tunnel."
Negative,va rupe pc urile. bag jocu in bara si nu mai merge nimic1060 6gb sta 100%
Negative,took 4 days to install and as soon as i closed it after playing i needed to re install it
Negative,no guud gam
Negative,fun game untill steam takes your ability to play away by removing the play button and turning it into a purchase button
Negative,"""The Elder Scrolls Offline""Prepare for hours in login queue, then some more hours in character loading screen, IF you can get online, do not change maps, you ARE gonna get disconnected lmao. What a waste of money."
Negative,Game used to be really fun when you could que with your mates for battle grounds. but they screwed that up. now you can only solo que.
Negative,"According to their last privacy agreement update on 01-Jan-2021 , it states they will ""sell"" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really."
Negative,"I really wanted to try this game before I buy and I am so glad I have a chance to try this game for free first; this game just isn't for me. the pace is way too slow, alots of running around without a clear quest direction. the graphic is horrible even for a game released 5 years ago. How is this game one of the best rating mmorpg on steam? Do not bother with this game unless you have way too much time on your hand."
Negative,"this game is fun but this bugs and problems it has is not worth it. i had to reinstall it, my friend had to go though and do a 2 step install on the update and the loading screens can take form anywhere from 1 min to half and hour"
Negative,Servers maintenance and lag issues make this excellent game practically unplayable.
Negative,cant trade crown items. wacc
Negative,"Game for absolute smooth brain fags, had the login error for 16 hours straight, did everything that has been said on the forums nothing worked. Absolute cringe game for 5heads that can force the game to log in."
Negative,Delayed Connection issues. Its just have NA and EU. :( please add SEA. Thanks
Negative,The invatory system is very weird the combat is very bland and im trying to refund it
Negative,"Character/class customization is pretty good compared to other games in the genre, and there's plenty of PvE content. Unfortunately, combat is so tedious and boring, experiencing what the game has on offer is rather painful."
Negative,"way too much ingame stuff to buy, a chair for your ingame house is 10-20 dollars its insane too many features are hidden behind a paywall, and the ingame currency is very badly managed.;"
Negative,"Listen, I've been a religious MMORPG gamer since I'm a kid. Played dozens of them. You could say, the golden age of MMORPG is long gone. The genre in general is less occupied nowadays. I decided to try another MMORPG so i grabbed ESO on a steam sale for around 30 MYR (7 USD) without any of the DLCs. The game hooked me right into it. I'm not a professional game analyst but the combat and story telling of different quests are fun enough to keep me playing (for a while).I regret I didn't do enough research on this game before pulling the trigger. I live in Malaysia located in Southeast Asia and I'm telling you, at times, the game is LITERALLY unplayable. You don't need good ping for MMORPGs. If the ping stays on 300ms constantly, I'm fine with it. But the thing is it constantly spikes to 1k ping and that made the game unplayable for me. The lack of a dedicated Asia server could be one of the weakest point of ESO."
Negative,removed all DLC and accessable from in-game with topup?? meh~ :v
Negative,Really dead community besides the few people on at peak times. Over the years its really dried up from a lively player-base (back when Summerset/Year of the Dragon were new) now its maybe a sixth of that. In the end its just a pay to enjoy experience that isn't anything worth its price or time invested. Oh and the devs can't even manage their in game economy. Its like South American countries where it costs thousands for a meal and you see people with bags of money getting a loaf of bread.
Negative,"Another day, another server down. Why would they fix it, when they can add more expensive crown shit and DLC with full game's price and 1/100 game's content."
Negative,good game but think they money whores so i'd give it 4/10 they are using us nerds for money
Negative,free to play mobile economic modele for a paid mmo on pc and console. Ty bethesda but Zenimax ruined your game. frustrating at every corner to make you pay...
Negative,Game's terrible and not in it's prime anymore
Negative,"this game is full of bugs, absolutely unplayable, and devs dont care to fix them, game should be marked as early access"
Negative,"Waaaaaay too many content walled behind payed DLCs, microtransactions.... all they care about si crown crates, crown shop, paid dlcs which come almost every 3months so good luck gearingEDIT: would you like to edit or change rating on this review, yes i would..... 54 GB updateIts a NO, still"
Negative,"Bought this game on 2015/16. It was a good game until you play PVP and WvW. And, the developers do not seems to care about players at Asia. The ping is high and its known issue. The servers only available at EU and NA. I dont recommend anyone to purchase if not in NA or EU region. I am hoping TESO to refund my money as I feel cheated to buy this game. Its very laggy when PVP. Played more hours and I will still stick to my review.After new Markarth update, the game started to lag worse when US day time. Night time still playable. When the event started 11/12/2020, the lag become worse and the game not playable at all any time especially during weekends. Even log into the game and after few minutes, it will DC. The support team only provide typical troubleshooting tips without knowing the real reason. I am not playing only TESO, but i do play DOTA,CS and other games that has no lagging at all. My friends in ASIA using NA servers reported the same issues. I am playing at NA and EU server. EU server the lag is less and stable than NA server. Since, i bought few DLC at NA and developed my characters almost CP810, not planning to abandon for now. It is very time consuming to build a character and change servers. Also, the money used to buy the DLC also will be wasted. This only making the experience to play this game worse. Get an ASIA server for us!*Please take note that NA server gives ~300 ping and EU ~250 ping for players at Asia. Other than this problems, after recent patches, the ping unstable and shoot up till 999****. Atleast a stable 200-300 ping still playable. Tested the game in Malaysia & Singapore.- Update as of 7th Feb 2021"
Negative,"THE GAME IS BEST BUT AS ASIA USER, WE NEED AN ASIA SERVER. THE PING IS TOO DAMN HIGH. CONSTANT 300 - 400? WTF NEED TO USE MUDFISH VPN TO LOWER THE LATENCY.(USE MORE MONEY) . IN THE END I CANT ENJOY THE GAME  BECUZ OF LAG. ENTERING NORMAL DUNGEON IS OKAY, BUT BIGGER DUNGEON IS LAGGING AS FK THE SAME AS PVP, WHERE NORMAL PEOPLE IS MUCH MORE FASTER THAN YOU, YOU ARE 3-5 SEC LAG BEHIND."
Negative,"It can be fun, but with all the limited content, its more of a pay-to-play game.  It costs $25 to get enough crowns to buy the morrowind dlc if you bought the game when it came out (when it didn't include the morrowind dlc), and the base game with the morrowind dlc is $20.  Complete rip-off."
Negative,"The game systems are horribly designed. The new player experience has apparently been completely trashed by something called ""One Tamriel"". The UI/UX is terrible. The equipment system is horrible. So many QoL issues. More closely resembles a sandbox than it does a structured game. Weapon swapping seems to be required - even if you are swapping between two identically crafted weapons - simply to get more actions on your minuscule 5 item hot bar. Terrible overall system design.EDIT: As I looked more into weapon swapping, I found out about another thing: animation canceling. This started out as a bug in their combat system and, instead of fixing it, they cowered to the 1%, left it in, and have since scaled end-game content to expect (read as: require) this ludicrous mechanic. To me, this reads as: we are too inept to fix our broken system and provide a proper, deep, rewarding, combat system; but, hey, this seems to add a layer of difficulty, so we'll keep it. Good enough.""Good enough."" - Probably the most spoken phrase during development of this game."
Negative,I couldn't enter world so i uninstalled it.
Negative,nerf sorc more
Negative,"Conveluted menus and bindings, unintuitive UI, uninteressting gameplay, I'd rather just play skyrim again, and stick to wow mmo-wise."
Negative,cant even login to play...no asia server...only eu and na
Negative,"I swear to god the only reason i play this game is because we(the game and I )  have a stockholm syndrome type relationship. I was kidnapped, and forced into believing i loved this game, when in reality, after the changes they've made, its shit, its been shit and its going to be even more shit after their newest update goes through."
Negative,"A lot of content but also a lot of hard drive bloat over 110GB. The game became bad. The sub model was always bad. The cash shop and craft bag are just terrible. Limiting storage space for those who like to craft or collect is just disgusting game design and a way to extort your player base with a well overpriced cash shop. What the game excels at are questing, dailies, and voice acting, but now everything else has gone downhill. The pricing for the game, dlcs, and add-ons can be very rough. No real amazing rewards or achievements, just overpriced and pushing you to the crown store and crates to gamble..... gross. I am now giving this a thumbs down since the latest ToS not allowing you to seek legal action and allow ZOS to sell your data.... WTF really? After returning from over a year off the MEGA server and overall online performance has improved slightly, but PVP lag is terrible, for me at least but this is also 10 years after launch so, way too late anymore. This was my first MMORPG online, I am pretty much solo, but found a fun and nice guild and discord. If it wasn't for that recently I would of stopped at 500hrs. Community is nice and welcoming.I do not recommend its nothing like Skyrim or other Elder Scrolls games. Big issues are the every 3-4 months with re-balances from devs who can't separate PVE and PVP stale content and mechanics, dated combat, and pay to win armor behind DLCs. I haven't played FF14 but I am familiar with both game worlds and would easily say go with FF14. FF14 may be the more affordable option in the long run, but I liked the Tamerial game world.... Now is the time to do better like FF14, but no. Half assed development DLCs and trash rebalance that no one wants. 5/10 for me now....Not worth renewing my sub after this expiration. Doesn't respect your time anymore and never respected your wallet terrible predatory practices. New chapter new class to grind out again a little late in the game for that. Not increasing storage space ever but adding in so so many items this game needs more storage space FFS, this is the time to be and do better Zeni/Beth/Microsoft. There is a reason why Skyrim daily has more players. Unless you enjoy the Elder Scrolls world I cannot recommend for serious MMO players combat is too soft. I have uninstalled this for good."
Negative,"ESO isn't a horrible game, I wish was something to choose between yes or no for recommending.  I also desperately want to be able to recommend this game. I've been following and playing ESO on and off since beta. While ESO is one of the few MMOs that makes me forget I'm playing an MMO (The quests and voice acting are great). There are several things that end up ruining the experience for me and make me move to other games like FFXIV and GW2.    The greed on display by Zenimax in this game is borderline criminal. From the cost of crowns to the cost of everything in the crown shop, to the little things like capping event tickets so that if a player doesn't visit the vendor every four days they lose there chance at a limited time mount (that is unless you spend $50 in the crown shop), and there are sooooo many more examples of greed I could use.  However on top of the blatant greed and lack of caring about players there are design decisions that also tend to ruin this game for me. WHY THE F*** CAN'T THERE JUST BE A SERVER WIDE AUCTION HOUSE!!!! The current trade/merchant design is awful in my opinion. I also hate the five guild side effect of this terrible trade system. I much prefer single guild games. That feeling of loyalty and friendship with your guild and guild mates is the whole point of an MMO. Yet with the current system if you want to make money then you pick your guild based on there vendor locations. I have continued to check in on this game every expansion in the hopes that Zenimax would finally turn it around but as of 2020, ESO remains a game with a ton of potential that is held back by greed, a lack of caring about the players, and terrible design decisions."
Negative,"Keep in mind the length time i've played isn't to much this is just a small look at the game from 2020. I would say this game isn't worth it unless it had a huge discount or better still you download it free in the free trial weekends in order discover if it's worth it which i did, didn't buy game though. Pros: theirs a lot of content quests,crafting,locations, It's stable with the frame rate/ping in certain areas i.e non high traffic areas, caves/dungeons. All the Npc have voice actors and not the same set of voice actors from what i could see. Oh theirs also alot of customisation with most if not all abilities been able be upgradeable in two routes as you progress with them.Cons: PvP the frame rate/ping isn't very stable most of the time. Combat rotation is pretty repetitive as you would expect from an MMORPG this does improve later on when you have more abilities later on the same could be said.  Also some of the abilities are rather bad with no real use unless it's passive. I should mention this is pay to win in the later stages so if you do get expect to be trading a lot or buying ""crowns"" to get equipment or simply a rather long grind for items."
Negative,"You spend $60, and get the base game plus like 3 expansions. You have to buy crowns and unlock DLC to get access to the other 85% of the game. I appreciate what Bethesda has done here in bringing the entire series together, but Jesus F'ing Christ.It's like playing a neutered, less fun version of Skyrim with the vanilla graphics and ""online multiplayer"" though the other players aren't there to enhance your gameplay in any way, they are just there to be annoying."
Negative,ping is higher than the Mount Everest for a ch*ng chong like me
Negative,"Boring. NPCs level with you, you can access all areas when you just started the game. If you're looking for a challenge don't buy this one, first time I get tired of a game after 30h gameplay."
Negative,I tried to like this guys but the single players were much more immersive and this game is just meh. It's boring asf.
Negative,The game crashed 3 times before I could even create a character.
Negative,The lag spike is horrible. Please FIX IT!
Negative,"The skill gap is ridiculous, its a fun game and the mechanics are pretty sound and its fairly balanced, but its so hard to be worth anything. this game is not for casual players, it is more-so than like WOW or other MMO games like that but lets be honest that doesn't say much. If you like spending thousands of hours on a game min-maxing your build then by all means play this game, but if you are like me and you think that games like that feel like a chore then its not for you."
Negative,"game is absolute CHEEKSco-op is crappy and sharing quests system is bad, there's really nothing that ties one's progress in the quest to their groupmates. it's pathetic. it also just plays like shit in general, combat is boring as hell and remarkably janky."
Negative,"[review edited]Coming from a time before there were MMO's, playing pen and paper RPGs, and in a small town where it's more than just a little difficult to find folks to game with, my first forays into online gaming were text based MUD's and MUSE's followed by Diabolo 1 and 2. Those were great for what they offered, and free to play. So I struggled a bit with the idea of a monthly fee for a game I had already bought and paid for, when Everquest and Dark Age of Camelot came along. But once I gave it a try, I never doubted it was worth the monthly fee to keep the content coming. It was also pertinent that while I was a paying customer, in a large enough group the opinions of my friends and I carried a certain amount of weight. Keep your customers happy or they're likely to take their money elsewhere.I much prefer a game with a subscription model over just f2p with micro transactions. I'd prefer to have no micro transactions at all, because I'm one of those who sees the new stuff you have to spend Crowns for, and I start planning on how and if I can afford to do so. However if you're someone who can properly manage your resources in game, a monthly stipend of 1,650 Crowns adds up over time and you can buy whatever you want. Note that that 1,650 Crowns is MORE than what $15.00 buys you in crowns alone. Also, in addition to the 1,650 Crowns you get each month for the $15.00 subscription price, you get the benefits of ESO plus. Double bank space, unlimited space bag for crafting materials and access to literally every DLC pack. Yea, I count that a worthwhile return on my monthly investment. Oh, but wait there's more... they also offer special deals on micro transactions if you have ESO plus, discounted items in the Crown Store, and at times free items from the Store, if you have ESO plus.As to whether or not the major expansions along the way (which you get full access to all that have come before, when you buy the game) are worth the cost, having played through them I certainly feel they were. Each of the big expansions, Morrowind, Summerset, Elsweyr (and I have no doubts about the soon to be released Greymoor), includes a large multi area region to explore, with an overarching story line which continues the main story of ESO but also sub quests which take you throughout the region, and then innumerable side quests along the way to keep you busy/distracted.As with any MMO, in my experience the game improves dramatically once you find a guild of other people to play with. Other players whose experience and game knowledge you can draw from when making skill choices and equipment choices. So find a guild and start spending time with folks doing dungeons and questing together. You can still experience plenty of content solo if that's your thing as well. However you can join up to five guilds at once. Generally some are for crafting, some for playing through content or role playing, some for merchant purposes or pvp, but you're free to join up to five different guilds for whatever purposes suit your playstyle.Even if you're not willing to go for the monthly subscription fee, I still feel the base game is worth the price. A ton of content to be experienced with three seperate factions having their own version of the story and events. I have just over 1,000 hours logged on this game as of this review (4,137 as of this edit). I'm not expecting that to top out, any time soon.[editing this review 2/10/2024]I've been a bit bored with ESO for a while now, and while I still think the game is fun and recommend it for that, the direction ZOS (the developer and parent company of Bethesda, both of which are now owned by Microsoft) - the direction ZOS has been going with development and balance for ESO has been decidedly unenjoyable for me over the past year.  A lot of balancing changes, collectively known as 'hybridization' have resulted in you can play any character at all as Magic, or Stamina, or Tank, and all of them have the tools to play with a specific set of gear to do the same thing, whatever it is you want to do with them. They've successfully blurred the lines between the play styles to make each of them less important or fun to play, overall the combat is simpler to understand (which would be a good thing) but more boring to engage with (which is where the simpler aspect becomes a problem). ZOS has shown no sign that they recognize this as a problem, in fact they tout it as one of the 'great updates to the game in the past several years'. Agree to disagree I suppose. Even still I've maintained my subscription and continued to play and support the game. I still believed my sub was worth while for the various bonuses it gives me in game and I don't have a problem paying a monthly fee for an MMO I play. Which brings us to the upcoming Gold Road expansion and the introduction of a ""Lost Daedric Prince"" - Supposedly Hermaeous Mora, the prince of knowing all things, helped this mysterious prince to disappear ages ago and even wiped their existence from his own memory to facilitate that vanishing act. My problem with that is, if this prince were revealed in the setting that ESO takes place in, several hundred years before the occurences in Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim, then how is this ""Lost Prince"" ... still an unknown in those times? Does Mora perform his memory wipe on the entire world, and again erase the ""Lost Prince"" from existence? I could wait and play through the story to find out, however, the very idea of it stinks of lazy writing and some schmucks desire to create and add their own thing to an existing IP and setting. This is something our entertainment industry has had far too much of recently, most notably in the IPs related to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. Don't get me wrong, I don't advocate for leaving these IPs alone to grow stale, but stay with the spirit and truth, the facts of what's already come along with the story. This doesn't matter if you're new to working in the setting or the original author. Making changes in new content/stories that betray what you've output previously which fans loved and thus catapulted you to some form of success, is despicable. And as I mentioned, a product of laziness.  - but as I said, agree to disagree, right? tl;dr, I'm going to disagree by taking my money and going elseweyr, perhaps if enough of us do this, ZOS and companies like them will wake up and take notice. Either way, my money will be going to some other avenues of entertainment that don't stink of betrayal and laziness."
Negative,"Doing group content in this game is pure horror because of constant disconnentions and crashes. Single player is OK (when you are able to login).UPDATE: now, I'm not even able to play more than 10 minutes even in overland questing after 21:00 CET time because of constant disconnections. The only time you can play is when you usually go to work :).So, for NOW, stay away from this game, check also official forums - https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en."
Negative,I got swindled by this game. The store give you the impression you can buy the base game and Elswier seperatly instead of bundled for an extra $10. They mislead you into thinking you get the Summerset chapters as well like the bundle. I have to now spend over $60 more in order to get the Elsweir and Summset campains. Ripped off
Negative,"This game was supposed to be a temporary time waster for me when I was bored or had no single player games to play. It is so much more than that, after 1000 hours of pve and pvp, the incredible storyline, the community that is friendlier than most of its online contempories and for the most part a fun game that is true to the Elder Scrolls Lore. You can earn the vast majority of the in game items and the crown store is purely optional. Give the game a try because it is better than WOW is at the moment.Addendum: Don't waste your time playing this game on PC EU in 2022 if you love PVP, the server is old, constantly lagging and your player skills hardly ever work. Go look Elsewhere for PVP."
Negative,This game is a major money trap because ; -At first it looks like its playable without paying stupid amounts of subscription fees and not at all a pay to play game but its a lie... %90 of the zones in the game are sold as speperate dlcs and if you want to buy all of them its insanely expensive but thanks GOD there is plus ''membership'' which is a cover up name for subscripton.You might say ''oh jsut have a refund then'' I would love to have a refund but half of this stupid game downloads after you open the launcher and guess what... all the hours you spend in the launcher downloading this shit game are counted as play hours so that you can t refund because of the ''game must be played less than 3 hours'' rule.
Negative,that was not sqaw
Negative,Down Time is out of control and fixes don't resolve age old problems
Negative,"Entirely too monetized all around. After the entire time I've played almost every mount I've received has been through anything except actual gameplay. I'd rather pay a sub than have everything locked behind ESO+ which has never been great to begin with, the crafting bag is predatory at the least with how you're absolutely bombarded with ingredients almost immediately and all throughout your time playing."
Negative,"Looks very promising, yet it's been that way since it was first announced. I started playing again and for some reason there was about 300GB+ worth of updates. I probably would've been better off deleting it and reinstalling. There's also still only NA & EU servers so in asia on fibre optics I'm getting 390 - 400 ping stable.Great game though, but the moment they release an asia server instant thumbs up from me."
Negative,"Despite the fact that the core gameplay is satisfying, and the world is interesting and fun to explore, I can't in good conscience recommend this game to anyone. Considering the fact that this is sold as a full price game, currently priced at £50, the cash shop and microtransactions are out of control. Not only that but they're constantly dangled in front of your face as you play. While you may want to feel like a Nord or a High Elf, running around Tamriel, you will actually feel like a giant open wallet, constantly in danger of having your contents snatched away.The possibilities for spending are endless. Want a scroll that speeds up your experience? Sure, come here and buy one my friend. Want a potion for extra damage? We have you covered. Want to speed up your horse? Buy one of my lootboxes with a small chance to get some riding stamina. Want more inventory space? Roll up, roll up. But it's not like you'll just spend once and get all the extra stuff you need. You'll spend, spend, spend, until the end of time, since that's the way they've set it up. Is your inventory filling up mighty fast? Well that's because you don't have a crafting bag my friend. That'll hold all that sweet jute and maple. Except, unlike normal inventory slots, you can't just buy that from the store. You can only rent it, by paying a subscription for ESO Plus every month. Not only that but they have the nerve to add small 'DLC' packages, in the form of short questlines that you can purchase for crown gems. Want to join the Thieves Guild, like in any other Elder Scrolls title? Well that's not part of the base game. That's a 'DLC', that'll cost you 2000 crowns. The equivalent of about £13. So between your base game, your 'DLC' quests, your lootboxes, your ESO Plus membership, and a hundred other things that don't have time to mention, you'll be constantly having things that you can't have waved in front of your face, until you eventually either buy them, or get annoyed with being treated like a bag of money and leave to play another MMO."
Negative,"Thumbs down on this game but only for the macOS client.  The client for macOS has crashes in the underlying vulkan engine at specific locations on the game map that have not been fixed in over a year despite bug reports and a prominent thread on their main forums.   If you plan on playing through windows,  thumbs up."
Negative,not my kind of game
Negative,"Gets old very quick.. If you are considering getting this in 2021, don't. Its not like other Elder scrolls games. The combat is janky and slow and will make you depressed. Save yourself now. click the ""back"" button."
Negative,Too much grind. Too much real money needed for a healthy character development.
Negative,"9/4/23: Remembered I left this review, went back and changed to ""do not recommend"" because I cannot in good conscience recommend this or any MMORPG because of how they are designed to exploit one's addictive tendencies.Look at how many hours I had in this game. Many of them were due to just leaving the game launcher open while I wasn't playing, but I still devoted a hideously excessive number of hours to this game for over three years—and for what? I wish all those hours would have been spent experiencing something more worthwhile instead.You can still read the original text of my review below, though I no longer agree with it—this is what I felt about ESO while it had its hooks in me, and my life would be better today had I never given it the opportunity. Do not play this game.----------Despite having played this game for over three years now, this remains a difficult game for me to review, but I'll take a stab at it anyway.  ESO is the only Elder Scrolls game I've really been able to get into, and (aside from playing LotRO for a few months over a decade ago) the only MMO I've really been able to get into, which I think gives me a unique perspective that will be of use to almost nobody who reads this.Why do I enjoy ESO more than Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim?  Well, the combat doesn't suck, for one thing.  Where even Skyrim felt awkward and sloppy, the combat in ESO feels tight and responsive, and my first impression of the game was that I was playing Dark Souls Lite.  ESO feels GREAT to play on a gamepad, and it genuinely feels that skilled play makes a difference, instead of it all coming down to stats and equipment.  You can have 5 skills on a skill bar (+ 1 ""ultimate"" skill) and unlock the ability to swap to a second weapon (and second skill bar) at level 15.  While juggling weapons to access the skills I needed felt awkward at first, I quickly found it to be interesting, strategic, and fun.   (If you're playing on a gamepad, I HIGHLY recommend remapping weapon swap to a face button instead of left d-pad, though.)Also, in regard to Skyrim in particular, I found the setting unappealing.  While the Nord lands are represented here in all their drab wintery glory, there's an incredible variety of environments spread over a massive game world, and with stat scaling for all characters under level 50, you can as a new player start out basically anywhere in the game world that appeals to you, pick up some quests, and start having fun exploring.  And the exploring in itself is rewarding, with items such as skyshards (every 3 grant you an attribute point) and lorebooks (give experience in the Mages' Guild skill line) around everywhere, often cleverly hidden.  If that sounds like a bother and you'd rather just have stuff as quickly as possible, there are mods that just mark all this on your map too.Why does ESO appeal to me more than other MMOs?  The extremely flexible class system is one reason.  Each class has its own distinct personality and strengths, but there are a variety of weapon and guild skill lines that make up for the deficiencies in any class's skills, as well as a variety of equipment sets to meet your specific needs, with the result that you can excel as DPS, healer, or tank with ANY class, although some take more work than others for certain roles.The most important reason for me, though, is that you have a huge amount of control over your character's appearance.  Fat, thin, old, young, beautiful, hideous, whatever you have in mind, you can probably make them.  Yes, something like Black Desert Online offers you a bit more fine control over your appearance, but can you be a cat or lizard person?  I can be a boring human or elf in anything, and if a game gives me the option to be a lizard, I am absolutely going to be.  And unlike Soul Calibur VI, I'm not even sacrificing any customization options by doing this!  I decided that my first character was going to be reptilian Ziggy Stardust, and I was able to get at least half the way there without any appearance customization beyond what was offered in the initial character creation.  I ended up making a lot of alts, and you know what?  They're all lizards, and they all look distinctly different from each other.  The wonderful outfit system they added lets you essentially create your own costumes out of pieces of different clothing and weapon styles you learn, and you can look like whatever you want regardless of what you're actually wearing.  This can all be done in game without spending one additional cent of real money.And that brings me to the topic of monetization.  Is this game pay to win?  Definitely not.  Is it pay to have fun?  To an extent.  There's a lot of fun nonessential cosmetic stuff, there's loot crates, there's fun nonessential cosmetic stuff only found in loot crates... but you get plenty of Crowns with a subscription (the same amount you would if you paid for the Crowns alone), and as long as you don't care about epic mounts, huge mansions, and most skins, you can get ENOUGH without paying for more than what you get with your subscription.  Personally, I do throw a bit more money at the game than I need to, but I didn't start doing it until long after it got its hooks in me.My biggest complaint about ESO is that once you hit max level, there's very little solo content that provides a challenge anymore, and while I do have fun going all Dark Souls on some world bosses and group dungeons, that wouldn't be enough to hold my interest.  Endgame group content is available on normal and veteran difficulty levels, and it's only in trials (raids) or the hardest veteran group dungeons that you might feel out of your element if you're not a hardcore player.  I sympathize with the players who gripe about the fluctuations in game balance, and do some griping myself, but to be perfectly honest, they're almost meaningless at the level I play at, which is advanced, but not hardcore advanced.Ultimately, ESO provides an engaging game world that I enjoy inhabiting with characters that I feel are truly my own, and there's more than enough fun group content to keep me busy.  I maintain that the most fun you can possibly have with ESO is if you have three other IRL friends to play with.  And until you start getting into the DLC, or heavily into crafting or housing, it's not hard to do it without a subscription either."
Negative,"Games a lot of fun, I'm sure people will find some fault in it but a MMORPG that doesn't require a monthly fee with a good community where you don't constantly grief newbs is a lot of fun. <<<This was 2020Now in 2024 I can't recommend the game. From broken servers crossing over to test servers, to having issues with user names 6 years old. To support being completely robotic, and if the responses I was given were from humans God help us all.In a game where you have Molag Bal the Lord of Brutality the King of R*pe. The word ""Genocide"" (or maybe Reaper is also offensive I wouldn't know they never answered my question) in your username that is 6 years old suddenly warrants a ban, without warning. Cool, perhaps it's an algorithm issue, send 2 messages without a single human response.  I think after 10 years the game has fallen under the same overly sensitive crowd, offended by their own shadow. The same people that even if they reviewed your case couldn't discern or explain the very policies they're enforcing. Therefore I can't recommend the game, because at a whim they'll just up and decide you're a problem and ban you no matter how much money or time you've spent. There's no reason to waste your time and money on illogical practices in a game where exploits are rampant and the people that exploited the beta server crossover probably got in less trouble funneling trillions of gold to their normal accounts than you for having a username some NPC or algorithm was offended by."
Negative,"Stupid game, everything's behind a paywall. And it wants you to pay monthly. Just greedy DLC culture. Regret the waste of money on this crap."
Negative,"Don't wanna seem stupid, but as a new player to the Elder Scrolls series the game doesn't really give you a lot to work with I mean I can barely understand what I'm supposed to do half the time and the tutorials for this game are 4 hours... Still even after I watched the video (not the full 4 hours) I didn't really know wtf I'm supposed to do...I'd love to play with someone who could help me get the basics or just play with someone in general because this game legitimately looks really good and I would love to enjoy it the way other people do."
Negative,"Anything more intensive than grinding levels or getting skill points causes extreme lag.  You do all this work to get ready for end-game content and then find out it's so laggy that you routinely die from stuff you never see, skills not firing, potions not working, etc."
Negative,"Would probably be a great game if you have a ton of free time. The amount of stats, professions, skills, passives, stones and in general trying to figure out how the hell to ""make a good build"" was too much. Felt like a second job and not relaxing or laid back at all. If you have no wife or gf, no kids, and don't work a lot of hours and are willing to read hours upon hours of guides then have at it."
Negative,"I personally liked the style of PVP combat that was offered based on the skills and that's what kept me going playing this game. That being said, I only played dragonknight class as a tank and am currently in the early 30s in terms of level. Unfortunately, below level 50 battlegrounds I noticed that the battleground matching is not very balanced in at least half the matches I played, one team would have a couple of level 40s and others would have mostly level 20- which is stupid. You would just see one team completely dominate the battleground; this is most observable with deathmatch.Warning about downloading and installing: I spent 6 Hours downloading 80 GB game and collectively about 1.5 hours to do some final setup and apply patches while steam is showing my self as ""In game"" This is not very reasonable. The download / update system should be redesigned to rectify this inconvenience.If you do consider purchasing this product I would ensure that you have completely made up your mind that you want it before doing this. If you do not have a high end download speed you will not have a chance to refund if you don't like the game.Beyond that, I like the game so far however being early into the game I don't think my review means much."
Negative,Toxic community even worst than bdo
Negative,Don't believe anyone that tells you can play this game without a subscription. YOU CAN'T.
Negative,The game would not launch i am getting a refund.
Negative,"It's a fantastic game for the little time I played. Thing is, I felt preyed on constantly by their events/""cash shop""/ daily rewards, etc. I'd highly suggest subscribing to it if you intend it to be your ""main"" game.The game is not very respectful of your time, I can easily say that half my time played was from managing inventory/bank/chest place.It's a great game, but the game really hates you. It has great side quests, fun combat, compelling characters, good voice acting for the most part. But the mmo side of it keeps getting into your way (lack of inventory space that you can increase with in-game ressources or real cash; pressure of doing dailies, managing your mount's stat, etc.) If you have no issue ""resisting"" doing dailies and stuff, then yeah, it's an amazing elder scroll game."
Negative,"I played for a few hours during a free play weekend.  First off, it is Gorgeous.  I could spend days just roaming and looking, but sightseeing isn't really the primary function of a game.  After playing so much Skyrim, I might just be Elder Scrolled out.  Skyrim was vast, but the radiant fetch and sell quests just became a blur.  Once you've been in one dwemer hall or nord tomb, ....  After only a couple of hours of ESO, I felt it coming down to the same old grind.....literally.  The combat and spells aren't as good as skyrim.  You gain spells through skill trees now... and even that was like a plastic knock off of Skyrim.  On top of that, nickel and dime... well, fiver and tenner micro-transactions...  Monthly subscription....  Nah, that's okay."
Negative,TOO MUCH FOCUS ON THE 'STORE'
Negative,"The setting is very visually pleasing. The rest was very uninteresting: bland quests, poor writing, bad combat, no physics, no cooperation with other players. Everything feels just weightless and pointless, other people feel like a distraction and nuisance. Microtransaction points (crowns) are annoying."
Negative,"Compared to Skyrim. Alot better as far as graphics and no bugs. Game engine runs smooth. However, the micro transactions and the monthly subscription fees to speed up progression is a huge turn off for me. Grind is terrible if you dont pay for sub. There are no cool finishing moves like in Skyrim. Not that i saw anyway, and if there are you prolly gotta pay money for them... One last thing is the game takes over a 100 gigs on hard drive, half of which is probably just for micro transactions UI's. So its a hard no on this game."
Negative,"Tried to register from Serbia - mission impossible. Country doesn't exist in list of offered countries and even if I try to register with some other one it returns an error ""Invalid email format"".Uninstalled after 12 hours of downloading these 100+ GB. Didn't even pass the login screen."
Negative,"At first I thought it was ultra-cool to offer us a week-long ""free weekend"" to try it out. The ultimate reason they are giving you a week is that it takes 3 days of 100% computer consumption to install it. my 11 hours of gameplay is just installing 20GB of the 65GB patch and it is still at 9% installed. my internet is not slow. so if you are thinking of trying this out, make sure you have a new, souped-up computer. Mine is middle of the road and doesn't like it, and it completely obliterates potatoes."
Negative,"80 GB update right after downloading 80 GB installation? Not funny Bethesda. I didn't even get to play the game, just busted my data limit and uninstalled the game."
Negative,"game is fun, would play it more if they fixed the lag.UpdateThe game is still very fun, and lag is not as bad as it used to be but still unbearable."
Negative,"87GB download, another 20 GB patch to play on the free week. Finally get into game. Simply put I can't recommend. I got stuck on a loading screen when playing the first tutorial mission - The part you jumping off the boat, literally more then 20 minutes hung on the loading screen. Had to close down the game manually and now can't log back into my character. When trying to do so it again sticks on a loading screen 'Requesting character load...' Almost 15 minutes later I gave up trying to play. Glad I did not buy this as I would be really annoyed if I had as wouldn't of been able to refund."
Negative,"I really can't recommend this game because:    The game is repeatedly reminding of missing DLC,problems that could be solved with (not too little) $$ and Lootboxes.    The combat is horribly dull,with the main stratagy just being light attacks and whaterver spells you have in your arsenal.    The Quest are coockie  cutter basic.    Crafting feels wierd with its ridiculusly long research times,its components and the bag limits    Due to level scaling progress feels nonexistent.    Progression is sometimes unclear    The Basic gold economy is early on pretty ridiculus.    This game has very little with Elder Scrolls to do,Mainly the Races,flavor Text and some generall overworld settings.    Oh yeah, this game is 80+ Gigabytes in download and still giant on your Harddrive!"
Negative,"Well, even with an Elder Scrolls licence, I still don't like MMO's.Firstly, I had to do 9 hours worth of updates before I could actually play the game, after which there was no sound. So then I refreshed the game files which took another hour. And once I was finally able to play the game I had constant frame rate issues and lag. Half the enemies I defeated I couldn't loot because they would glitch out. The only type of quests I ever seemed to receive were fetch quests or ""go to this place and talk to this NPC for information about something"" type quests. Graphics and character models somehow look worse than Skyrim, a game which is 3 years older. And to top it all off, high level players kept walking past me and killing everything in sight which meant I couldn't even gain XP to level up. ESO just feels like a really lackluster version of Skyrim with multiplayer added on. Should've saved my £20."
Negative,"I took the time to install it and now it wont let me login. Saying there's an internal error. So far, not worth it."
Negative,"This game is not very unfriendly to the asian players.If i can enter the game instead of waiting and being informed of so-called timing out, I will consider recommending this game"
Negative,"i guess my biggest problem with this game is how stupid the ""One Tamriel"" update made the game. Tons and tons of mindless fanboys defend this idiotic decision, but in my opinion it really hurts the game. You can have a level 1 character and go anywhere and take on pretty much anything you want. I have a level 325 character and I still have to fight the same stupid mobs I was fighting while level 1. They just take a few less hits. and so then what's the point? I join a dungeon and there I am with a level 30 player and a level 810 and the level 30 player can hang with the highest levels no problem........"
Negative,"Great game, definitely a favorite :)Edit: The game itself is great but after repeated instances of Bethesda and ZOS not correcting year+ old bug and instead focusing on micro-transactions, this game is becoming nearly unplayable--especially for PVP. If you can tolerate your skills not executing when you press the button and dying repeatedly because of this, then have at it. This isn't an internet service provider issue, nor faulty computer software. This is Bethesda/ZOS refusing to fix errors that the players have been asking to be fixed for years. This is why veteran players are leaving in droves; as soon as New World gets released I don't think I'll ever return to this game. Too many issues with the game that has turned something amazing into utter garbage."
Negative,DON'T BUY ON STEAM. VERY PROBLEMATIC LOG IN. BUY AT THE ESO SITE. I'M REQUESTING FOR A REFUND.
Negative,I'm thoroughly impressed....that it somehow manages to have worse combat than Skyrim. Seriously. That's an achievement.
Negative,"It’s nice to be playing an mmo again.The quests are great, probably my favorite way of leveling.The dungeons are numerous, everything from tank and spank to some cool mechanical fights.Crafting is great, you can make some great gear ( not BIS but still viable) and it’s complex enough that it’s almost a mini game on its own.I’ve had a great time playing this game....then one day i go to log on and find out that my account has been banned, tried to go through customer service and find out what the heck is going on... no response, no reason why my account was banned, nothing.I guess I should of known better, I mean this is Bethesda after all....so I cancelled my ESO Plus membership and will never be playing another Bethesda or ZoS game ever again....So for those of you who want to play this game, its buggy but still pretty fun....just be wary... you never know what companies like this will do :("
Negative,"love it but it get bored pretty fast, lot of flexibility in endgame does not tight player down to 1 path for endgame grinding for gears, u can actually get it from multiple sources like -Crafting, we have lot of world crafting station for lot of set which does not lose to dungeon/raid set that much-Delving(mini dungeon on map which most can solo) and world boss(group activity of cause)-PVP , battleground 3 team 4 ppl fighting each other in various mode (que time is instant or a min and so), or big pvp like faction war ( Cyrodill ,last bout a month)-Dungeon (que time are longer for dps if u are que-ing alone, for me its around 1h or so), and trial/raidother than that side activity like fishing, questing, stealing, murdering, gathering and profession leveling are all quite acceptable especially with eso+ membership subscribe (it will give u access to all the dlc when its active duration and give u a gathering bag so u wont have bag slot  problem)Cons i would say its kind of laggy sometime and the loading screen take forever when u login from another character that all i have to write :) hope it help"
Negative,COMEPLETE GARBGE.spent 2 days installing and only for me to not be able to launch the god damn game from steam .. launch it from the bethesda launcher and yes game starts but cant play cuz i cant log in to my steam account therefor the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game thinks i have to repurchase the f%%n thing .. spent the whole day trying to get this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to start and never happend .. did every single trick every single update and nothing ever worked now im stuck redownloading this god damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game over again .. for what? only to be stuck with the same motherf%%in problem? what a waste of money and time....This is on another account and pc that it is working on .. i bought 2 copies on the game to play with my gf and cant write a review with her account because i only have 1 min played on it and it says you need at least 5 min of play time to write a review..... FUNNY ENOUGH  cant even get the shit game to start ... love the way shit works around here
Negative,"Great game...if you subscribe to ESO+ and get the crafting bag with it. Unless you intend to play this casually, you will need to spend additional money. Greedy Publishers"
Negative,"- Game has Mobile Game paid solutions- RNG boxes- Witheld development of characters in-game to present paid solutions (Mount Speed,Staming,Capacity)- Full microtransaction shop (Boosts to XP, Crafting)- Lacking graphical fidelity for 2023"
Negative,A 2014 game that looks and feels like a 2011 game. Feels even worse to play in 2019. Five years later and the game still looks like a visual bugs galore noticeable at the very first hour of gameplay. Did I forget to mention that this game doesn't have a single Asian server? I'm not a big fan of MMORPGs and Elder Scrolls Online definitely didn't help change that.
Negative,"honestly... here is what it bothers me about elder scrolls online after years playing it all these guilds requiring everyone to be active for 7 days or you get kicked out of the guild is a really useless requirement. people don't realize that they have a job, that they go on a holiday, that they have to take care of their sick grandma/grandpa or that they take care of their kids... let people stay in their guild?? wtf is the point of a mmo? i tried wow, guild wars, runescape, ffxiv and they all are awful. eso is full of poor written dialogue and the story dlcs ive been getting is like a copy-and-paste story expansion and it always feels the same.. wow..i tried to get into wow and their movement felt really slow as hell and their questing was really getting tiring after hours of playing wow.. ffxiv felt really uncomfortable to play with everyone because how these characters are designed as, yikes! guild wars 2 just sucks because it has poor working camera controls i cant be arsed to learn how it works.what happened to mmos? it has become useless and it is a constant copy and paste story expansion. the combat used to be so easy and fun but everything gets nerfed to death and it throws me off. the bosses were fun and easy to fight with and now it feels pointless to have these exact or specific gear items you gotta wear to fight these bosses to win rewards. the quests are boring with poor written dialogue and all the voice lines feels like monotonous and i keep hearing the same freaking voice actor/actress all the time... it lacks of diverse voices and it lacks of having a very good written story.. at this point, i feel like giving up on mmos and i just want a mmo that feels smooth and fast to enjoy and that it doesn't depend on the combat difficulty and that it doesn't depend on rewards people won't be able to get it in their lives... and that the combat system doesn't get nerfed to hell. im just giving this mmo and the whole idea of a mmo game a negative review. sorry but i cant help it and i completely lost interest in the mmo stuff. it just sucks."
Negative,"for a game series that has always strived for amazing feeling combat, this game sure misses the mark"
Negative,"The patcher is broken, they offer no help to fix it. Would not reccomend purchasing, save your money."
Negative,a lot of nope.
Negative,"Spent 3 hours trying to make the play button work and every single fix I found on steams support, zenimax support and pretty much every other site with a potential fix on it didn't work and I'm actually getting mad at this, I've bought this game a while ago and recently decided to give it a try because I finally had a few hours free of work and they were all wasted trying to launch a broken game."
Negative,"I do not recommend that you buy this game through Steam. The developer has serious issues with in game bugs related to dungeon finder and related to the launch of unfinished DLC's. When patches launch the game is offline for maintenance (most recently from 9am untill 5/6pm on a Saturday (GMT), Maintenance is an acceptable part of any rolling game, primetime maintenance less so, however as a Steam user you will feel treated as a second class citizen and you will not be able to log on at the same time as other users who do not launch the game through Steam. The developer is always 'lookign into it' when it happens but it happens often, too often for there to not be a fix. Play the game. Enjoy the game and its countless hours of solo and multi player content but for the love of god...do not buy it here!!!!"
Negative,"The elder scrolls online is an mmo set in the elder scrolls world.Unlike Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim, the mechanics are very different.pro:- great graphics- wonderfull soundtrack- faithfull recreation of the regions of tamriel (started playing morrowind and felt like coming home)- has a good mix of combat and non-combat quests (with some minor puzzles thrown in between)- level scaling makes it possible to quest with other people regardless of level- some great mold breaking dungeon rooms, like the great chamber in Nchuleft in Vardenfell, which features lots of verticality in a large chamber with multiple routes- player housing can be decorated to your liking with a multitude of furnishings crafted and found all over the world- a wonderfull mixture of stories being told via a multitude of quests, ranging from sad to humorous- the ability to visit many regions of tamriel within the same game- many dungeons are circular or have secret exit on the end, minimizing the backtracking requiredcon:- grindy leveling and crafting systems (ok, got to admit I've got to level 38 (of 50) in ~2 weeks. there are games which are worse resp. more grindy.)- reliant on the servers being up- limited inventory space (expandable via grinding gold or buying for real money)- some features (e.g. jewelry crafting) are locked behind DLC purchases- every other mob has a snare ability (an abillity to slow you down or root you in place). Except for the mobs which have ranged snares.- unlike the other titles in the elder scrolls series, many quests have only one solution (which unfortunably often turns out to be fighting some boss mob in a tight corridor)- level scaling reduces the feeling of progress, e.g. a simple mudcrab still takes multiple hits to kill whether lvl1 or lvl20- the stealth skill line is hidden behind DLC (thieves guild) and default stealth is not very good- the lockpicking minigame is on a very tight timer- jump mechanics take a while to get used to and have a tendency to randomly propell you away from vertical surfaces- explorative freedom isn't. Bethesda games have always suffered from 'themepark' syndrome when it comes to landscape layout (e.g. this valley with this enemy type next to that valley with that enemy type) and ESO is no exception (although there are places where this is barely noticeable). There are many places where that one chokepoint is the only way to get up a cliff. There are many cliffs. If you fall down or get pushed down by an enemy, enjoy walking all the way around the hill until that one chokepoint where you can get back up.- in some areas, enemy spawns are located right next to each other, making it unavoidable to bump into one or the other enemy. Enemies also respawn when they respawn, regardless of if that's right on top of you.- ranged enemies can keep you targeted as long as you're in range and even shoot through trees, solid stone pillars and other solid obstacles. Meanwhile, the player needs to keep enemies targeted (there's no autotargeting), a fact the ai exploits shamelessly by moving around and obscuring each other once their health reaches a certain treshhold.- the game has a day/night rythm with a rather long night. Enemies which are hard to see become impossible to spot (and avoid) during night. That some quest locations force rainy weather before they're cleared makes the experience somewhat depressing.- if enemies think the fight is over or you can not be reached (because the same enemy just knockback'd you down a cliff), the enemy gets a free health refill. Enjoy grinding down the health on that boss again.- the 'step height' is too small. Gettting stuck on rocks and other small objects which should be trivial to step over is a common occurrence.- followers are near useless- some enemies are just giant health sponges. Standing in front of an enemy and grinding down their health just doesn't make for engaging encounters.- enemies are not affected by traps- in other elder scrolls titles, you can fix most quests by using the ingame console. ESO forces you to abandon the quest and do it all over again.- some items, like crafting research scrolls, are unnessesarily character bound instead of account bound- crafting research times are measured in days and weeks- some dungeons are extremely linear, almost a corridor with a boss at the end- many quests have one solution: the one the devs intended. And they use invisible walls, ledges which are just a fraction of a unit too high to jump over, conveniently placed inconvenient props and all kinds of other dirty tricks to force you to follow the intended solution. The reduction in player agency is unbearable at times.- the enemy placement must have been implemented by a braindead: on every objective, doorway and chokepoint, there camps a group of enemies. You won't be able to manevuer around because you need to be carefull not to trigger the next group of enemies a few steps further.- some bosses have ""rocks fall people die"" style instant-ohk mechanics, which have been bad game design back in the 80s and still aren't good nowadays.- on of the hallmarks of the elder scrolls series is the stealth, which got completely screwed up. Enemy placement (directly in chokepoints and on quest objectives), enemy behaviour (just standing around, only few short patrol routes), lack of alternative routes and buggy implementation of hiding mechanics (e.g. visibility through solid objects) along with unimaginative dungeon design combine to make it impossible to sneak around. Unless you play the nightblade class, which can use a skill and just avoid all enemies as long as the mana lasts.I can not say much about PvP yet except that it is a mixed PvE and PvP mode where players try to capture enemy outposts, keeps and elder scrolls while protecting their own. You can also capture villages, which enables PvE quests in that village.Update: don't bother with PvP until well after level 50 (or until you've got 810cp) and you've got the required equipment sets. It's mostly played by the veterans who have not much else left in the game - anyone else is just fodder. Unless you join the zerg, but then it becomes PvE 'capture the keeps' because no enemy will bother to try and defend against the zerg.Unexpected server downtimes (e.g. EU server was down for the whole day after a maintenance), the questionable microtransaction model (pay2storage?) and no way to play offline are the major negative points about the game. Usually, games are designed to be enjoyable and to provide a fair challenge. ESO feels at times like it has been designed with the goal of making the player feel miserable.On the other hand, the amount and quality of content you get (currently the base game and the morrowind chapter) is well worth the price tag. After two weeks of playing I'm almost through the quests in morrowind and 3 of the main territories of my alliance. And there's still the smaller isles, territories of the other alliances, coldharbour and cyrodil.I'd give this game a 'meh' if such an option was available. Definately the best part of the elder scrolls series in terms of story telling (can't beat morrowind though), but the worst part in terms of mechanics, especially combat.Still, while the experience is quite enjoyable most of the time, it leaves much room for improvement and the bad AI makes certain playstyles completely non-viable.TL;DR:The devs spend years to craft a beautiful world just to spay the diarrhea that is the combat mechanics all over it. Get Skyrim/Oblivion/Morrowind instead.(do note: this review is based on experiences from base game and morrowind, murkmire and summerset expansions)Unexpected downtimes experienced so far (wd = whole day):03.11.2018 (wd), 01.12.2018 (wd)"
Negative,"It's almost unbelievable that a gaming company would push content creation over play-ability, sell content rather than fix already existing content, let broken game mechanics continue rather than fixing, make graphics pretty rather than functional but in Elder Scrolls Online they have and my hours playing attest to it, it's sad but I guess in a world where it's more important to produce something to throw at the public, rather than make a quality product, I hereby introduce you too Elder Scrolls Online... A game that could be so much better if whosoever in charge would give a damn. Thank you for reading"
Negative,"dead game, thanks zos"
Negative,too many server issues here and stop playing the game now
Negative,this game has done horrible things to people i love
Negative,"I'm sure it'd be a great game, if I could actually play it."
Negative,The Elder Scrolls Offline
Negative,"Will not work, will not launch, the damn steam login will not update.  wasted 4 hours of my life and can't get a refund for a game I can't even launch.  don't waste your time, if you want it get it direct.  Beyond mad at the lack of support from steam for this as they won't even offer a refund."
Negative,"Don't buy this game on Steam. Downloading and installing it through Steam doesn't work for me no matter how many times I reinstall it.This 'bad' review is more for steams vending rather than the game. It is a good MMORPG.Buy this game through Bethesda/Zenmimax themselves, as their installation actually works.NOTE: Buying this game through Steam can still be installed through Bethesda's website; just note, none of the steam features like overlay and casting won't be avialable. My Issue with Steams vending: I have no idea why the launcher won't work for Steam install, just that it doesn't. Droves and troves and rows of online forums and threads have people with the similar launcher will infinitly load problem. Some speculate Steam is vending broken digital game keys. I don't know the cause, just far warning that this problem can happen to you."
Negative,"This game is too dead to do daily's quickly, you'll be waiting at daily sites for hours for people to show up and the developer has no interest in making bosses and storms doable alone. I wouldn't recommend this game anymore."
Negative,Constant login issues. Literally unplayable. Day after day with the same issue and no fixes. Login works for a few hours and then goes down again. Nice job!!
Negative,Can I play please ?
Negative,The Elder Scrolls Offline
Negative,"ESO is a great game, but there are so many login issues recently. Don't pay for a game you cannot play."
Negative,Amazing game but for the love of god don't buy this on steam. According to my wise friend never buy any MMO on steam.Should have known better.
Negative,"This is a great and fun game to play but don't buy it here, go to the official ESO site and buy there.Since Summerset hit there have been constant login errors only for Steam players (mostly just EU).Edit: Looks like the login problem is fixed, but I still recomend buying it on the official site.Edit2: Nope, again Steam users cannot login to the servers. Again, I highly recommend this game just not via Steam."
Negative,"I have to agree with the other unsatisfied customers about Steam handling this game.I wish I'd of never bought it from Steam. Like an idiot I have purchased all the DLC to this game from Steam as well. As mentioned by others, logins are a BIG pain in the ass.Personally I've found it more prevalent after an update patch to the game.Really though, it's a coin toss, you never know when you'll be able to log in or not.I've made 10 attempts today without any luck.I'd hate to have to uninstall and reinstall this monster!I have friends that have bought hard copies of the game and have 0 problems logging in.I truly love this game but have to give it a thumbs down due to Steam's lack of interest in fixing this issue.Get the game,,, just not here."
Negative,"5k+ hours in this game and I can tell you some stuff about this game:Im playing in this broken game for 4 years. Every patch breaks game more and more. Many lags, in pvp and pve zones it's almost unplayable on primetime (EU server). Support responds only by templates, they will not help you at all.More and more friends and guildmates are leaving because of the lags, a lot of ppl stop paying for this game and just wait other games or lag fixes.Its really sad to see what this game has became.Lies of ZOS from last years showed that if you want working game, better to look for something else...Advise for ZOS: please hire good developers or your game will die."
Negative,"First of all a technical warning - do not buy the game through Steam.This is unrelated to the game itself - if you want this game go directly to Zenimax since Steam players have, throught time, experienced problems logging in. Recently there haven't been many cases but the issue was rather major after release of Summerset and knowing this game and ZOS it will most likely resurface at some point. Either way better safe then sorry,Now for the game itself - I love it, but I can't really rcommend it fully.First, the storyline - it's great. I'm not kidding you here, this MMO in my opinion has better plot then Skyrim (did Skyrim have plot?). Main plot is quite nice but, truth be told, it's not where the best quests are. You will stumble upon cerain zone quests or some completely minor sidequests and go ""oh"" as you play. Now it is only my opinion but since I do a lot of singleplayer type playing in MMORPG I find it quite important that the plot overall is really enjoyable.For the gameplay. I'm not an expert at online games - like not at all, so this, again will be just my personal experience (personal experience not including PvP since I've only had brief and rather disastrous encounters with it, getting quickly massacred). It's not the most balanced game (and it's an understatement) since for each class/role combo there is pretty much 1-3 meta builds if you want to min max all your stats. If you don't care for that, it's fun (still, some class/role combos can be absolutely tedious to play). The overland content does get quite easy with levels (though after cent updates some of DLC world bossess are not soloable anymore - for most people at least) but you always have dungeons, DLC dungeons (believe me, difficulty there is another category) and trials. Overall combat is a bit of a mess that gets random abilities nerfed once in a while (so I wouldn't be getting attached to your build) but despite its many, many fault I still find it really enjoyable.Community-wise I think eso is fairly friendly - you will get a rude or nasty person once in a while but mostly I've had overwhelmingly positive experiece (and I usually do dungeons and trials with completely random people so).Honestly I enjoyed it very much. Put hundreds of hours into the game and I will put many many more. But I can't really recommend it fully to new players - the game has many issues, bugs and communication problems with the devs (EU PC server says hi with their reacurring log in problems that have been ""investigated"" and never solved in the last 2 years at least)."
Negative,This game is honestly one of my favourite games I own and i would totally recommend it to anyone.BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T BUY THE STEAM VERSIONIT SUFFERS FROM REGULAR LOGIN ISSUES AND YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU CAN'T PLAY IT QUITE OFTEN. If Zenimax actually fixes this problem or if things improve then I would definitely change this review.EDIT: Seems like everything is working now so I'm going to recommend the steam version.EDIT: Nevermind its fucked again
Negative,"ESO is a lovable mess beset by a dev team that seems wholly overwhelmed. Paid items and content are pumped out like clockwork, but simple bug fixes and balancing work are almost entirely neglected. The world is cool. It provides a great experience for the first 20 hours of gameplay; however, ESO is an MMO that requires a subscription to fully enjoy. As a result, I believe it is totally fair to expect quality of life and bug fixes to remain a priority. They are not.The issues that plague the game become more and more noticable at endgame (PvE but moreso PvP). A cluncky combat system that requires visually unappealing animation cancelling to achieve high DPS parses. A goofy trade economy that rewards gathering and disensentivizes crafting. A series of very dull guild grinds to obtain useful combat skills. An an almost entirely neglected open world PVP system in which endless loading screens, mass d/c's, and bugged mechanics turn what should be a thrilling experience into a muddled mess. Stack on top of all these issues the persistent problems ZOS and Steam are having providing paying subscribers access to the game (4X multi-hour login failures this months alone), and the constant stream of near-fullscreen pop up advertisements for ZOS's cash shop while in world, and I cannot recommend ESO in its current state."
Negative,"Bought this expecting that the """"optional"""" sub fee wouldnt be that good, that I could play as a F2P player with only spending money on buying the game and thats it. But I was wrong. The OP crafting bag is too good, the grind is too real. I hoped that would have changed back when I tried the game in open beta. Sure the leveling is improved but the other grind in everything else is still so damn high. Not to even mention the shallow and boring combat. 5 skills is just so boring and casual (you cant use the ultimate 6th skill as often as the other 5, might as well be non-existant). Its just... Idk. Not for me. So much reading too... Too much... At some point I decided to skip all dialogue because it was SOOOOOO much.Elder scrolls game online... Sounds like a cool idea, but this one certainly is not cool, its boring and grindy. Try again with your next game and make it have way less reading plz. Also add more skills like at least 8-10 but dont go overboard like WoW.Too bad that MMORPG's are hard to judge in 2 hours so I could get my refund. Sadly I have played more than 2 so no refund for me...edit: Oh great now I cannot even login anymore... F*** this im asking for a refund anyway, lets hope Steam is merciful..."
Negative,DO NOT BUY THE GAME FROM STEAM
Negative,"Steam users can't log in on a regular basis while non-steam users can, dont buy the game here until the devs fix it!"
Negative,Server problems 3 out of 3 days.
Negative,DON'T BUY IT ON STEAM!
Negative,"I love the game, but there's always some trouble. Once a steam, once the server, once the maintance, and everytime, I have some freetime, and could play, something is happening, and I can't,  every single time. And the most annoying is that I pay for it (I mean premium). And now it's just a waste of my money, and there is no compensation, so it's like, they rob me. I'm very angry, and I won't recommend a game, for those who might want to buy it via steam. Please don't, because there is always some issue, but just in the eu server, and in steam. My I ask why, and why can't I get my money back?"
Negative,So this the famous login simulator 2018.I was excited when it was on sale.And I m really hyped about playing it.Imagine a whole day loging on waiting to login get denied repeat.Best 10 euro ever spent I m really w8ing for the new expansion login simulator w8 for a change
Negative,"Its a good game with very accessible mechanics, world sync make it easy and fun to play with others regardless of level and you dont have to pay for sub to enjoy the game. BUY ONLY FROM OFFICIAL STORE. STEAM ""VERSION"" IS CONSTANTLY DOWN"
Negative,"Excellent game. A must get, especially if a fan of the elder scrolls series and the lore.however, DO NOT PURCHASE THROUGH STEAM.So many issues with logging in. Purchase the game through the website instead.Unfortunately this is an ongoing issue that has been happening for a concerningly long time and it doesnt look as if they will fix any time soon.Do not purchase if you are expecting skyrim online. This is an MMORPG. Many of the bad reviews are due to naive purchases expecting another typical TES game but with co-op."
Negative,"very boring, the combat is stale and feels weird, the combat and AI are worse than oblivions. they just stand there while you kick the crap out of them making it incredibly easy to win even 4v1s. this game is BORING"
Negative,"Game is not bad. When its playable.Sadly, Steam aspires to destroy your chance to play. #eosoffline"
Negative,"I do not buy this game through Steam. Buy it off their website. Tons of login issue with Steam and you can't 'unlink' your account. The game itself is fine, but the login issues involving Steam really kill it"
Negative,"Don't purchase steam version of the game, it frequently drops connection to the game sever and doesn't let steam users log in. Purchase the game directly from Zenimax instead."
Negative,"This game is suffering from major ""steam only"" connection issues.  Although I do like this game, not being able to log on because my ESO is through steam is going to get me to cancel my ESO+ subscription and refund my recenently purchased summerset addon.  This is frequent and annoying."
Negative,This is not a knock on the game itself but buying it via Steam. There has been numerous instances over the couple weeks I've owned the game where logging in has been impossible due to issues with Steam authentication/communicating with the game servers.  These issues do not popup for users who purchased outside of Steam. Extremely frustrating.Definitely just buy directly from Bethesda if you're interested in the game.
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM!There is login issues almost weekly where people that bought the game through steam cannot log in, these last for almost 8hours normally with no updates or comunication from zenimax support or steam.Aside from that I've got over 1800 hours in this game, and i love the game but it is just BS that I lose 8 hours on the weekends that i could have spent playing the game due to weekly login issues with ZERO communication on if they are ever going to be fixed for the future."
Negative,"Woo, 2nd time I purchased and this time it LAUNCHED omg. This time after attempting to load the update and actually Launched the game ((omg)) I started a timer and played 6 minutes in game w partial rush tutorial. Says I played 108 minutes. I call bull."
Negative,"Despite having beautiful graphics and running very smooth, a huge abundance of voice acting and tonnes of questing and zones to explore, the whole game is literally crippled by the insufferable UI and questing interface.Quest zones are designed to be completed in certain orders for the story to make sense, the player has no way of knowing this because they have scaled everything to the players level (rendering progression pointless). You will have no way of knowing if you have completed all the quests in a zone or have more to do because you can only find them randomly.When you go to a city, there will be stupid miscellaneous quests everywhere completely indistinguishable from all of the story quests meaning that finding quests in a city is a frustrating game of forensic investigation every single time.The only AddOns that can help to address this are out of date and cant distinguish between accessable and inaccessable quests to your character.In summary, if you're happy to randomly run around like a handy man doing quests here and there all over the place with zero immersion and zero sense of progression and skipping thousands of hours of pointless voice acting this is the game for you."
Negative,"RIGHT....this is a whole new rev...after spending THREE DAYS on downtime. the game has only been playable for a total of about three hours.... I have invested hundreds into the game literally, including actual purchase.I advise you just avoid the game until they at least sort the situation out."
Negative,Legit braindead developers GG
Negative,I could have mastered Mandarin.and Cantonese...
Negative,Has serious technical issues affecting gameplay. ZOS has changed game to cater to filthy casuals. PVP is left for dead. Past its peak downhill from here on out.
Negative,"Love to know if this game is any good but after spending two night downloading it via steam just to find out that the launcher also wants to download the entier 60+ gig again I have given up trying. Its ok for people with super fast unlimited broadband but if like me you live somewhere that dosen't have such a connection you will be waiting a long time to download it. The technical boffins behind this game are fucking morons who cant even set up the download systme to work so I doubt the game is as good as the reviews make out, how can it be if thay can't even make the downloads work? Also I cant submit a ticket to ESO because I cant get to the point of making an account as you need to log into the game. This is not a good start to my time in a new game (for me) and has left a bitter taste in my mouth."
Negative,"I'm pretty sure I got more mileage out of a free Shaiya server than this steaming hot pile of ...You bought the base version? Well good luck finding any players, because everyone's in the DLC. After lvl 20 everything gets repetitive. There are like 4 dungeons that you have to grind over and over to get slightly better gear, and in the end, you'll still be killed by a lvl 25er because the skills scale up with micro amounts of damage. I've killed lvl 150 players with my lvl 19 account and shitty armor. You think that's great? Yeah, now spend 3 months reaching lvl 150 only to get beated by some no body. The world is bland, nothing like Skyrim/the elder scrolls series.It's not very co op friendly. Like, a lot of stuff both players have to do, like 50/50. Gather 4 thingies? Well, both players have to do it... You also have to share quests, instead of them automatically being shared when you're in a group. Like that's the stupidest thing ever. If I get a quest, my friend won't, I have to share it to him..."
Negative,"""What do you do all day?""""I play ESO all day.""""What do you do when the server is down?""""I play Hearthstone.""""So you play Hearthstone all day?""""Yes.""Also, these wankers charge 14k Crowns for a single in-game private location that the players can decorate. You know how much 14k Crowns is in real money? £74,99. These assholes are trying to set the standard that they can charge £74,99 for an in-game personal space. Think about it. Think about it real hard. On this basis, I do not recommend giving them your money. Other than that, it is a solid enough game if you like roleplaying."
Negative,"Launchers start button doesnt work, tried all kinds of fixes, nothing changed."
Negative,It's really fun grinding for new gear every 3 months because the devs decided to nerf everything to hell just for fun
Negative,This was (and still is) my WoW Killer. 11/2017Edit: It took 3 years to realize how meta heavy this game is and how fragile the ESO community has become. The skill lines have been so horribly nerfed (probably by recommendations from the casual community) to basically be a one trick build type leaving you not using about 70% of the skills in the game. The market is monopolized by a few guilds and don't even try to PUG any dungeon content because everyone is so toxic. In the same way it was my WoW killer it is now my WoW enabler.
Negative,"edit: This game just made to sell pricy expension packs.This is a great game but had to quit because i couldn't afford rest of the expansion packsthey just keep making pricy exp packs, this is really going a bad way in all of games."
Negative,"Game unplayable - servers are more time OFF than ON everyday, quests broken in new DLC , wasted money for ESO+ that nobody give me back This was very good game - some time ago"
Negative,Shitiest support deaf and blind devs broken game
Negative,"Do not buy!For the love of god, do not buy.This game looks good, sounds good and knows how to hype itself and sell itself but then you play it and it's UNPLAYABLE. The performance is beyond jacked. Every player knows this, 800 ping, low FPS, input lag, desyncs. You're thinking to yourself right now 'Must be this guy's PC or internet, probably not that bad'. It is 100% as bad as I'm telling you. Google videos showing off the hilariously horrible performance this game has. There's literally Dragonball fights were people teleport like it's anime, just because the server can't handle it.And what's worse? This has been a downward trend for the last three years. We used to laugh when a charge move landed you inside a rock, or a desync caused five arrows to hit you at once. Now that's the everyday experience. And the developer doesn't give a fuuuuuck, they say performance has improved. Outright lies to placate people who all experience reality every day. The recent X-pack launch locked people in their houses, gave the X-pack to people who didn't buy it, locked it for those who did and had a massive queue you could sit in for 45 minutes, unless you logged out, tried again and got in right away, only to look at 1k ping before being kicked out again.This game is headed nowhere fast. Their marketing is strong but it's Fallout 76 all over. Same corporation too.Avoid it, avoid at all costs!"
Negative,"Okay, here's my first negative review of a game probably ever in my 25 years of life. Purchased the game 4 days ago, since then the only things I've done are: 1) Waited 12 hour for 80 GB download2) Installing error - looked for fix for additional hours, fixed3) Login error - looked for hours again for a fix, okay fixed.4) Played the game for less than an hour with a test character to just f*ing get into the game once, works, okay so I can play properly tomorrow.5) Next day, started launcher, steam says the game needs to be installed again (wtf??), spent the day downloading 80 GB again6) Downloading done. Started game, server is unresponsive due to internal issues.Can't ask for refund 'cause the game counted download/install time as gameplay time, which exceeds 2 hours. Forums DO SAY steam version ESO sucks and that we should take the cd key from steam and download from ESO official website. BUT WELL, steam has stopped giving cd keys for their games recently.I thought purchasing games through steam would mean no hassle easy installs and plays, but this just opened my eyes. Never buying any game from steam again.All in all a very messed up experience, 4 days in after purchase still can't get started with the game. I realise this is more of a Steam version ESO review I gave, but that's my point, the game sucks if youget it through steam.End note: If you've got a limited data limit to your downloads, I wouldn't recommend downloading through steam because of a re-download process on every problem that occurs. also don't click the 'Verify files' button in case you get a problem with this, it's gonna re-download the whole 80 GB again. BAD BAD experience.Regards,Harshit"

Negative,"It's like everyone in Tamrial is playing a scavenger hunt. All the running and jumping around really takes away the beauty all other TES games had and just could not get into it. I really wanted to like this but MMO's are just not for me. Oh, don't get me started with trying to get the thing running right when I first got it."
Negative,the Elder Scrolls Online is not what it used to be. The devs have heavily fallen out of favor and trust with their community. Their reputation in the endgame community has tanked in recent years and they fail to build upon it year on year. Used to approve of the game but I resend that now.
Negative,"Each and every day I try to play - I have 'connection timeout' and similar errors when I try to login for an hour.Everything else works fine, including SWTOR, which has far less retarded 'quests' than ESO have.Combat is extremely unimpactful, want to know how to do it better - play Black desert. ESO simply does everything on bethesda level of laziness, in single player games they leave game completion to modders, but with MMO it won't work."
Negative,"Disclaimer: I know it says I have 6.4 hours on record, but I didn't launch this game via Steam. I actually have 2 years experience with it.If you enjoy PVE you'll probably have a lot of fun with ESO.If you're buying it for the PVP, don't. Balance sucks, PVP content is a riding simulator, the PVP servers are hosted on toasters in the Zenimax Online Studios kitchen because performance is atrocious.The PVPers of this game have been crying out for a very long time, but it seems that it has mostly been abandoned. Why work on that aspect of the game when they make more money from PVE?Granted Battlegrounds are coming, but what fun will they be when the classes and abilities are still not balanced?The sad truth is, they had the PVP right over a year ago. It was the most fun I'd ever had, but with each passing update it gets worse and worse.I quit playing this game over a month ago and my blood pressure has finally returned to normal."
Negative,Good Job dev's you broke it.Update: So the que system has now been broken for over 3 months as soon as peak time comes around you WILL NOT be able to que for a dungeon or battleground. As I can only play at peak time I will be unsubing. Only play this game if you do not plan on playing at peak time or if you just like to quest.More Update: So its now almost a year later and the cue system is still broken. Every Peak time and event you cannot cue anything at all. What a sad joke.
Negative,Recharged for a full year subscription after I thought it was a one time transaction. Not even sure how you're supposed to cancel. KInda shady
Negative,This game sucks. Go play tetris.
Negative,this game SUCKS they should add PORN to it so its good
Negative,DLC packages are a ripoff.
Negative,"Whenever I think about playing this game, I log on, play a few quests or do a dungeon then immediately get bored. The game is more fun when you're levelling up a non champion character especially with friends but after hitting level 50 again the fun just goes away immediately.Unless you're in a dedicated guild or with active friends who play the game more than a full time worker's hours with overtime, playing this game for a long duration at a time is a difficulty. That may be my opinion, however that thought keeps getting proven overtime.Oh yeah, and the crown store is awful most of the time as well."
Negative,"I've hopped back into ESO many times trying to give it a chance, but everytime I end up super disappointed.  Where to start... The quests aren't great, with most of them following the same formula of ""go here, talk to this person, go to this place, kill this thing, return"", which honestly its very similar to what most MMORPGs do, so take that as you will.  Next is the combat, probably the worst part of the game. Its boring, stale, and uninspired. Attacks don't have any ""oomph"" to them, so they end up feeling extremely unsatisfying. You're also extremely limited to what spells/ abilities you can have, and the spell variety's also pretty limited. Next is the story, which is super forgettable (I don't remember a single character or why they matter, or hell why I as a protagonist matter , or what my role in this whole thing is).  Considering the graphics aren't anything groundbreaking, I found the game chugging when it came to certain areas and in towns. This should not happen, especially with my PC that's no low-end budget build. For comparison, Final Fantasy XIV not only looks a lot better and much more detailed, but it never goes under 60fps, and that's while I'm also running it at 4K mind you. Then there's the DLC, the Crown store, and the monthly subscription. Oh boy, do I have a tooth to pick with this one. Not only is this a full-priced game, they also add in a monthly subscription (which seems to be pretty essential if you want to fully enjoy the game) and an in-game microtransaction store. The DLC seems to be way overpriced, and over double what the base game costs, unacceptable. Due to my morals, this is one of the main reasons I'm not recommending this to anyone.  Oh, another thing. Remember the Thieves Guild? Yeah, you have to buy a DLC to join it. Clearly just chugged out quickly to make a profit. It feels like zero love and passion went into this, and BOY does it show. Don't support these people, they don't deserve it."
Negative,"Over the 1000 hours I've played this game, I can say the playing experience is deteriorating rather quickly.The game will die soon because the devs simply don't care enough to keep it alive. Major issues with the game go unfixed for years, for example the pvp of the game has gone virtually untouched ever since the devs realised it won't make them any money. Instead, they pump out half-assed expansions with little to no actual content worth playing, or shiny new cosmetics that will ultimately fix none of the issues with the game. I can't recommend the game to anyone in its current state."
Negative,"50 GB game update? [(Edit: 75 GB UPDATE) + 75 GB]A new update has arrived. And the size of it is ""50gb""? They must be kidding. Is there such a high-dimensional update?Update: It's just a joke now. The update size 75 GB now. Update2: I really hate it. It's over 75 GB and started downloading a further 75 Gb. So why? It would be easier if I wiped it away."
Negative,"After downloading the game twice, at 50gb each, and capping my monthly data, the game refuses to even open a window. I checked the folder, and it's 111mb. What the heck did I download then? Does it delete everything on launch? This is a total rip off."
Negative,Big-Ben bizi carrye götür.
Negative,Worst game Ever I seen in the world
Negative,"I hate the update,endless download,update..."
Negative,"I can't play the game due to a well-known memory leak.  Spent my ""three hours of gametime"" patching the game every time a patch came out hoping that they would fix it.  Alas, the memory leak still makes this game unplayable.  Tried every fix I could find on Google.  Tried to get a refund, but Steam won't refund it.  Haven't made it out of the tutorial zone because the game crashes every five minutes."
Negative,"I strongly recommend this game. Reasons below;- Very variable character options.- You can be whatever you want.- Rich people can't dominate neither economic equilibrium nor battlefield.- So many quests and stuff.- Trials,arenas,dungeons,delves and dolmens are fun.- Extremely wide item,skill and tactic combination.- Not a P2W game.- Great PVP. Makes it feel much more realistic than any other this kind of games.- Unlimited customization options for your character.- Great graphics.- Strong AI.- Extremely Wide World.and some other reasons too..If you want be yourself, this game is for you. You don't have to be just a warrior or something. You can create your own clothes,weapons,character class and style. So yes, buying this game worths until the last cent. Don't hesitate,buy it.My only negative comment will be about crafting system. Master crafters like me are not allowed to craft all item sets and variations. Sets that we can craft are limited. They should add more item sets for us to create or they should allow us to create other item sets such as those we get from dungeons etc. aswell. Otherwise being a master on crafting is not really worth to long time that we spend to be a master crafter.Update on 10.08.2022Plus membership prices are skyrocketing. Way too expensive for me now. World is in economic crisis and people are trying to lower their expenses. A little raise wouldn't be unfair but raising the prices 3 TIMES ? Sorry, i won't be able to give that money therefore you have lost one of your oldest and most loyal players.Update 21.11.2023Probably my last update. Since our economy is in decline i won't be able to play this game. Without a plus membership there is no craftbag and without your craft bag you can't play the game properly. Fare thee well ESO. I was here here since beta but not anymore unfortunately. I can't pay 450 TRY every month. It is way too much. :/"
Negative,"I'm afraid I am going to have to change my review, I will leave the original below the updated version. No. I do not recommend this game, I recommend you actively avoid this game. The devs have proven time and time again that they do not care about making their game better, they do not care about their players and the only thing that they do care about is money. With the introduction of crown crates days away, this game is just continually going downhill. They have left ridiculously overpowered sets in the game for weeks now with no change, they haven't added any really good content since Orsinium. Orsinium was the only DLC that I really enjoyed, the Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood DLC's were a HUGE step down from Orsinium, they were sold at the same price yet had less than half the content that Orsinium had. And now Crown Crates. Crown Crates are basically lottery boxes, except people on the Public Test Server (PTS) have tested the drop rate for the good items, and its incredibly low. You would have to spend hundreds of dollars worth of crowns (the ingame currency bought with real money) just to get ONE mount. They do not listen to their customers and they have recently hired someone who has been responsible for, at least in part, the death sentence's of multiple MMO's, and she is doing the exact same thing to ESO that she did to those now dead or dying games. This makes me sad and disappointed that a game that I used to love has gone so downhill, it's just more evidence of the fact that game companies these days do not care about making a good game or making their games better or even about their customers, they only care about profits. If I didn't have so much time invested into this game, I would just uninstall it and get a refund if it was still within the time limit, but I still have an attachment to this game despite what it is becoming and I purchased it over a year ago. TL;DR Do NOT buy this game, greedy, money hungry devs who do not care about their game nor their customers and the game is already starting to die.Original Review:Surprisingly fun, a lot of things need work but the removal of subscription fee definitely made this game worth it's price and to be honest it's one of my favourite games currently. As I said it is missing quite a few features such as character customization AFTER character creation, you better like your character because if you don't you've gotta live with it or start again. Another thing is more classes, there are only 4 classes right now but they can all be played multiple ways by being able to use any weapon & any armour on any class, it doesn't quite make up for the lack of more classes but it's better than nothing. Another thing I think is kind of an issue is the fact that most people join ebonheart pact, I know theres not a way to fix that as it's just what people prefer but it definitely influenced my decision to join the pact despite being a High Elf because it just felt lonely playing in the Aldmeri Dominion lands as there weren't that many people compared to the Ebonheart Pact lands."
Negative,"This game is not fun. In my opinion, this disapoints me the most out of all the games I've played. (Except for Sonic, but this is not relevant) This took long to load, I could respect that, as this is an Elder Scrolls game, and that Skyrim took 4 hours and it was awesome. But, the install process was a bit complex, so, I started the game once it finished. I stopped playing after merely 45 minutes (I think), why? The story was a mess, the art doesn't impress me as much as Skyrim's, especially because everything is so CONFUSING. Most importantly, the game didn't make you feel ""important"" as much as skyrim, as the game is in multiplayer, and this is a concern for that, as you no longer feel more powerful than everybody else.In conclusion, I do not recomend the game, go get Skyrim instead of this, it's much simpler, and it's a great classic. If I can rate this out of ten, then I rate this game a 5/10. It's not the best, or the worst, it's just dispointing.Edit: The other 1.25 hours is just an attempt to try to run the game, because it frustrated me."
Negative,"No longer able to recommend this game due to the upcoming sweeping combat changes. In spite of supposedly being a push for accessibility to lower skill levels, all of the data has shown that this is a significant nerf across all levels of skill and makes some content in the game literally impossible. In fact, low-skill players are disproportionately affected. Developer responses have been dismissive of the community's concerns and some have acted as if they are being treated unfairly by the community because of the negative response.The combat designers do not know what they are doing and are seemingly adjusting random knobs and dials to see what sticks, and to say that they don't seem to play their own game is not an exaggeration. Stay away if you have any hopes of raiding or completing endgame content."
Negative,I leveled up fairly quickly because I was ESO plus member perhaps I was looking forward to the DLC as being a member entitles you to the DLC I was never prompted for the download and when I wasn't a member anymore I can't play it! I was a plus member for a long time and paid  a lot for than the game is worth. It's pretty much pay to level up at a decent rate or else you are gonna be a level or two than lower than you should be if you want to progress with quests.
Negative,"After a thousand hours, it is with a heavy heart that I can not recommend this game.The game certainly meets all the elements of a popular MMO:- The community is vibrant, & very much alive, with robust player populations & community activities such as trading, dungeons & guilds.- The music, lore, & freedom of experience are well-intertwined with the core Elder Scrolls games.- The game receives frequent patches & expansions.- The primary P2P service, ESO Plus, is well worth every cent, while ridiculously affordable. It opens up the breadth of your experience by a large margin, and even if you don't subscribe, you'll still be enjoying so very much, because the base game encompasses 80% of the full game.- The game is very dedicated to making combat & mechanics friendly for new players, and encourages fairness of gameplay.So... what seems to be the issue?- The developers of the game do not allocate attention to the long-term veteran community, and the feeling of permanence has been completely eroded. Imagine you have finally grasped the basics of the game after well over a hundred hours. You've found a set for your character that fits your intended gameplay. Maybe it is expensive to craft or purchase. So you spend a long time grinding and saving for it. Just when you have purchased it, a new patch arrives. Congratulations... it has been nerfed to the ground. As a newbie, you don't think much and you rinse and repeat. After 1,000 hours I can safely assure you that this happens EVERY patch, to the point that if you ask a veteran player, they would tell you that they don't bother keeping up with the next patch anymore, because it is just a waste of time and money to invest in something that will be taken away the next patch.- The developers do not pay close attention to community concerns. They have a bunch of players they work with on a test server, that they communicate with before and after every update. Outside of that, the major community has to kick and scream due to senseless nerfs and buffs introduced with each patch, & ultimately suck it up. And when I say senseless, I mean that they can fix A by deleting B, but instead they delete C & D then introduce E & F.- The game prioritises its in-game P2P store over everything else. You'll see that the 'Crown' Store is always patched and updated with new cosmetics every week, yet glaring bugs & gameplay issues can take months or years to be addressed. And the worst part is, they will nerf the dominant sets of the current patch just ahead of a future expansion, and make THAT expansion's sets strong instead, so that you will have to buy it.- Lastly, the game tries too hard to be fair. If you have played any of the elder scrolls games, you will know that each race is very much distinct from another. For a singleplayer game, it doesn't matter much. But for an MMO, the importance of your choices becomes paramount. That's what makes an MMO competitive for the community. Knowing your character can't do everything, and you have to use another with a different build. But with their fair for all ideology, every race and build rarely feels challenged because you can basically use anything for everything & complete everything with ease. It also hurts the Roleplayers because you can basically see redguards running around as necromancers (redguards abhor necromancy).Overall, this game is a great game for casual MMO players/ES lovers. If you want to explore the lore and enjoy a multiplayer experience in the familiar ES setting, this game is honestly breathtaking. But if you are the type that likes to be driven so that you can come out on top at the endgame, and you enjoying the sense of permanence that makes legendary MMOs great, this game will not give you that sense of achievement. You will inevitably join the other veteran players in drifting about."
Negative,"I no longer recommend this game.  Apparently there was a loud group asking for every enemy in the game to scale off of your current level.  ESO eventually obliged, and now the game is tremendously boring.  Every enemy you encounter will take 3 minutes to kill, roughly (depends if you blew your ult on the last trash mob to finish that one quicker) so resource gathering, or even just walking around, is infuriating.  This ruined the crafting trade prices (because you wanted to slog for an hour fighting fifteen trash mobs for some alchemy ingredients), and made crafting simply not worth the time investment.  Any time you leave the city, you either try to dodge mobs or get cc'd by them.What started as a lot of fun (for an ES buff like myself) turned into hot shit in one patch.  Even if you LOVE mmo combat with the skill bars & cooldowns, it becomes very tedious, very quickly.  My entire clan quit within a week after that patch.  Tried to play it again recently, and it's still tediously frustrating.You never become stronger, despite your numbers always increasing.  Super depressing for me personally, as I was an alpha tester for them.  Sad trombone.Original Review: The bugs are real, and can very quickly pull you away from the immersion of running around Tamriel. Best questing system I've seen in an MMO (none of the kill 25 monsters, and come turn it in bullshit), with an epic PvP system to boot. Impressively deep crafting system. B2P handled very well; cosmetic fluff available only. If you're looking at getting this, I'd take the plunge."
Negative,Releasing op items to sell then nerfing them 2 months later is kinda disrespectful to the playerbase.
Negative,Not recommended for players who are new to this series
Negative,I now remember why I didn't play the game for long when it first got released.Combat is clunky and repetitive. Graphics aren't that great. The story is alright. I'm bored even thinking about this game.
Negative,"Boring. Mind numbingly boring. Go here kill this, collect this, fetch this.Janky too."
Negative,"The game is definitely beautiful, but that's about it for the positives. If you're purely a fan of Elder Scrolls games and are curious, my advice would be to pass. It feels like they took all of the good parts of the Elder Scrolls series out in order to make it massively multiplayer and added in a long leveling grind and boring quest system. It's basically another WoW clone with an Elder Scrolls skin."
Negative,"I gave this game 50 hours of play, probably way longer than I should have. After a while I realized I was just repeating myself over and over again. There is no life to the quests, nothing interesting that draws me into the game. I kept wanting it to be Skyrim, which is why I gave it too much of a chance. I feel like the game is boring me.  I played Skyrim to death and was ready to move on to new content. I kept thinking, maybe the game play or story will get better. Even the land is kind of bland. While the scenery changes somewhat, it doesn't have distinct characteristics that make the lands memorable. I'm just map hopping and the color scheme changes, and some of the plants.Not a huge deal, there are other games out there."
Negative,"Such a waste. This game has so much potential to be a great mmo, but instead devs seems to put all their efforts into agressive monetization. It just makes me sad because i've invested this game and met a unique and great player community just to watch it slowly turn into an empty shell of unplayable content, *very* aggressive monetization and straight up disrespectful communication and direction. Player base has for quite some time expressed their feelings and proposed many solutions to the game current issues, and it would be a fair and easy step to listen to them and start to adress all these issues with players wellfare in mind, but clearly we won't see any of this anytime soon if we base our hopes on recent devellopments. I joined ESO as a 50/50 PvEvP player and while group content was really fun for a while, it starts to show some limits. As for PVP, that's a major dissapointment. While the fast-paced action combat system would have been really fun to play, the PVP system is SO broken that it's virtually unplayable and I have'nt been able to have much fun at all. ESO does a pretty bad job at offering end-game progression, as there's pretty much no horizontal progression and the champion's points system is just there to deliver classic skill-like number-based ""perks"" that only differ in that you will have to spend 50 champion points to unlock instead of 1 skill point. I also joined ESO as a crafter / gold maker, an aspect I enjoy quite a lot in any game and particulary in MMO's. And there again I am dissapointed. Crafting offers no real challenge nor skill if not for Master Inventory Manager™ if you don't have plus subsciption ( which you will if you want to craft, believe me ). There's some interesting mechanics like item traits, but it feels rushed and unexploited, and the time it takes to research them looks like it's intentionally long to mask the lack of content and progression in crafting overall. In endgame there is just no interest in crafting at all, except for the daily crafting writs that feels like incredibly painful choirs especially if you want to do them on every single one of your characters - crafting writs being, by the way, the only way you can actually make gold with crafting since pretty much everything you can craft is useless and can't be sold. Finally, something that has been a huge turn down for many and more players is the attitude of Zeni towards their clients. It's just inexcusable attitude to answer with such disdain, disregard, and disrespect as they have. Sometimes directly attacking specific players or posting disdainful tweets.I'm so tired of this "" like it or leave it "" attitude that i'm actually leaving it. As for today i'm cancelling my Plus subscribtion and won't play the game unless there's a serious change in the game direction. Again, it makes me sad because this game has many beautiful features and design, but that's how it is. Hope i'll come back to it someday in more cheerful times."
Negative,"Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle. I have put 70 hrs into this game in the past two weeks (work from home). And I can honestly say I'm rather disappointed with how it is. Constantly being shown the crown store every time I log in, with endless cosmetics and pay for convenience (p2w) items. As well as tons of mounts, when there is such a small amount of ones that are earnable in-game (Less than 10). On top of at least a dozen+ dailies, crafting not being useful until endgame. Which is such a poor decision, and with motifs and mats being so tedious to get. Makes it abhorrent to make the gear I want/need for my character. Healers are more like hybrids and aren't needed for most of the content. Which makes them pointless 99% of the time. All Stam/Magicka dps classes feel the same to play, constantly having to weave and have optimal rotations to be fun. The upscaling of lvls and damage make every class feel so damn weak until you hit cp 200-300. Even then if you don't have constant food/drink buffs, you're screwed. This game felt good in the first few zones, but every quest starts feeling the same, blending together faster than I can spam the ""next' button. Because I'm sick of gold-painted turds called kill and fetch quests. I wanted to like this game, I really did. But in the end, it just feels like a new flavour of the year for Wow. Not even it's own game, just another soulless husk of a promising mmo. that went so damn money hungry and only focusing on player retention. That it forgot how to be original, fun and most important of all. Learning how to respect my damn time, instead of constantly feeling like I'm missing out. Constantly beating me down with more and more heavy-handed, addictive rng mechanics. that always seem to favour the house. The awful level scaling, that makes it so you never really feel you're powerful enough to do anything. Crafting that's useless until end game, gear that only looks different with motifs. No visual progression at all. Next to no good-looking mounts, costumes or armour that comes from completing end-game content. And overall just abysmally predatory crown store prices, exp scrolls, paying for skyshards, etc. This game had potential, but just focuses on getting whales to buy things. And doesn't really care about it's players, past the point of milking them dry for every spare cent they have. I heard so many good things about this game, how solo friendly it was. And I've come to find out that's just nostalgic people huffing severe amounts of copium. This is by far the worst mmo leveling and grind experience I've had since playing Lost Ark, BDO and WOW. Congratulations, Zenimax. Here's to 10 years of constant poor decisions and increasingly scummy practices. You can take those crown crafting motifs for like 4-50 Dollars a pop, and shove it."
Negative,"Meh.  Doesn't matter what level.  Doesn't matter what class.  Doesn't matter what opponent.  It takes the same amount of time to kill all the enemies.  You'll never feel like you're actually making any progress.  It's feels like you'll always have a wet noodle to fight with.  Crafting is so complicated it's impractical.  Stores only sell the exact same crap the world over.  Just a unfulfilling experience.  Had nothing better to play, until a bug forced me to download everything again.  50 Gigabytes....  Not worth it."
Negative,"It's less of a bad review and more of a 'meh' review. ESO is pretty, and the lore is brilliant so if you play it for the various zone stories, you'll probably get your moneys worth. The community's sound - I didn't run in to any greifers or the like.The problem arises with ESO plus and all the microtransactions that come with it. Want a crafter character? Then get out your wallet as the unlimited craft bag is locked behind a pay wall along with about 50% of the games content. ESO plus is a must, really - and its not too expensive so if you can afford it then the games okay. If you can't then you're probably going to experience the game at its worst. I got it on sale with all the released DLC zones, and I've rinsed it for about 60 hours before boredom kicked in (with one month of ESO plus to do the dark brotherhood) , so I've had my fun with it and may dip back in from time to time. All in all, it's an okay game that can keep your hands busy while you listen to a podcast or two."
Negative,"Apparently if you bought this game from Steam, you will encounter log in issues. By Issues, I mean that you wont be able to log in at all. This seems to be a common problem that people are very upset with and the company behind ESO is aware but takes too long to fix. Even when they do fix it, the problem usually comes back within a week. I am very sad that I have paid money for a game that does not allow me to log in. When I click the ""log in button"", it loads for about 2 minutes before showing me an error that reads ""Connection to server timed out"".I strongly suggest buying the game through the official website and not steam unless you want to wait days to be able to log in and play. Gameplay was awesome though for the few hours I got to play."
Negative,"Spent MANY hours in this game, and finally I've had enough of the misdeeds of ZOS. Patches on patches that just breaks the game. Instead of FIXING IT they decide to focus on other things that don't matter. The game is literally broken for 3 months, until they fix it before a patch and then it breaks again. Also, don't even bother making an account with any GOOD names. They'll ban you for it. Also, they'll ban you if another player reports you because they're salty. Literally CANNOT do anything because they're communists. I got banned once for 3 days, and then they made me change all my character names. Flash forward another month, they make me change ALL of my character names AND my account name. They are literally out to get me and I've done nothing wrong. They can go and make up all these stupid rules AND THEN TURN AROUND AND CONTRADICT THEMSELVES AND PUT IT IN THE GAME. Pretty much do as I say not as I do. TRASH. Don't bother wasting your money on this crap. You'll just get mad and leave like MOST of the community. And just fyi, JUST LIKE COMMUNISTS, you can't ""defame ZOS or any of their property"". Literally ZERO freedom of speech. If they ACTUALLY made a good game and didn't have TRASH CONTRADICTORY MODERATORS, they wouldn't have to worry about people defaming them. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. THIS IS WHY YOUR GAME HAS BEEN STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE. GET REKT."
Negative,"Lifeless and boring. I regret every hour I put into this game. Thankfully, at least half are from leaving the game on overnight."
Negative,it's not fun
Negative,The Physics...WHACK!The Gameplay...WHACK!The Co-Op...WHACK!The Graphics...WHACK!The Way you WHACK an enemy and he doesn't even move...WHACK!The Game...WHACK!
Negative,"Bugs are rampant and seldom get fixed, classes are never balanced to a reasonable degree and endgame content is lacking in every way"
Negative,"Overall game seems to have a good player base, and lots of activities/world environments/content to do even for solo players some things I wish destiny 2 had. Amazing add-on like mods to enhance the experience, something that other MMOs should think about incorporating. However, the combat needs some work (maybe whole lot of work) and I hate how fake the trailers making the action seem epic when its really not. They should take those trailers and make a hbo series out of them instead of false marketing like this is how the game will play like."
Negative,"To the regular person? No.I like this game, but to be honest with you, you kind of need an ESO PLUS membership, it's a big deal, otherwise your inventory management/capacity will really suffer.Now,why do I like this game? Well, I'm a sucker for LORE, so if you're like me and been around since the days of Morrowind/Oblivion and love the worldbuilding more than the games themselves (I for one believe selling Skyrim for every platform for the past 12 years instead of updating their shameful Gamebryo engine is revolting), so this game might make you happy. For a while. Also, only if you have someone to play with.Also, there's a bunch of expansions and Paid DLCs and stuff in general so it's Bethesda's business practices which might also deter people from getting this. I'm not THAT idealistic, and have no issue to pay for a few dozen hours of fun and curiosity, since the worldbuilding is still great and builds on what we already have and the lore of The Elder Scrolls is as solid as foundation as something like the lore of DND's Sword Coast for example (RPG Nerd Talk)So yeah, if you're that much of a Nerd, not that protective with your wallet, and can afford paying a monthly fee to make your experience valuable, go for it. I was never a big fan of MMORPGs but this one is as good as they can be, it's in a way like playing Skyrim forever.Bethesda is still shameful. Dump your 25 year old engine and use Unreal Engine or something like a proper adult ffs..."
Negative,"How bad does this game suck.  Let me tell you.  It plays worse than Skyrim.  Has graphics worse than Skyrim.  Has a skills system worse than Skyrim.  The character interface is again worse than Skyrim and that was pretty bad but at least you could mod the lazy developers interface.  AND FINALLY a box to hold your loot (with limited slots) costs 2000 gold from the store, which equates to $20 USD...."
Negative,"i dont know if anyone else had this but, each time i hit play and the launcher opens, if i try and play it loads on a black screen then instantly crashes... Everytime!"
Negative,They went DEI
Negative,Useraccounts linked with Steam is a bit buggy. According to steam have played 6 hours. Trying to get this to work for my girlfriend. Unfortunately in reality we have been trying to download+download+install+patch+login+reinstall+reinstall on other device for 3 days. Can't get past the user login error while launching with Steam. Login in browser works.
Negative,"How can a top studio with lots of money for development fail so completely and utterly when it comes to make a functional installer ???Apparently a problem that has persisted for years and is still marring an otherwise (probably) good game, which I will now never play."
Negative,"This is my first time playing such an outrageous game and I bought all the dlc. Before completing the novice tutorial, I was maliciously permanently banned. Then I sent countless appeals and no one responded. I also called my friends to play together, but I couldn’t log in the next day. I’m such a big fool. I have bought so many games on steam and this is the most outrageous thing I have ever seen. You really don’t want Chinese players to play it, right? If you don’t want Chinese players to play it, don’t sell it. I'm really drunk. If I can unblock it, I will change the comment, but there is a high probability that there is no hope, because I complained for 2 days and no one answered me!I just completed a few tasks. My level is only level 4. How can I buy and sell gold coins? How can I chat with others and post ads? How can I use plug-in scripts? I can provide all the information screenshots and payment screenshots, but no one reads them, and I cannot reply to official emails with my qq email, nor cant send official emails with google emails. I can only submit a complaint on the work order, but there is no way to post a screenshot of the work order, and no one is handling the work order. What is the operation?Of course, you can actually check whether there is cheating or malicious behavior. You can check it even if I don’t provide screenshots. So I believe that the official ban is just random or permanent ban! So sloppy! I also used to be a game designer, and I have never seen such outrageous banning behavior!Do not recommend buying. Do not recommend buying. Do not recommend buying.Because you don’t have any channels to protect your rights, you can only be a lamb to be slaughtered!Originally, I wanted to play this game for a long, long time. When I saw the Simplified Chinese version, I quickly bought one. I didn’t expect it to be such a disappointment!"
Negative,"I received Elder Scrolls online as a Christmas gift. I was super excited to play this game, seeing as I have always been a big fan of Elder Scrolls. Oblivion was by far my favourite. Since December it has been impossible to log in and play the game without getting a error message that I was unable to log into the game. I did manage at one point to log in and try playing a bit. I got another error message when I entered a cathedral to continue with a mission. This was super frustrating. I always allow Steam to update my games, but it seems that wasn't the issue. I am highly disappointed in Elder Scrolls online. I would not suggest buying this game for yourself or as a gift to a loved one, especially if they are a fan of Elder Scrolls.Elder Scrolls Online was NOT what I expected!"
Negative,"Unable to launch on mac and pc. I cant even installed it on my mac. The ""multiple launches of this installer is not allow"" message  always pops up and terminates the installing of the launcher. It was better on my PC as I was able to install the launcher but unable to play. No response. Do not download ESO on steam. I will give it a try on the regular nonsteam ESO when there is a sale but until then I will quietly wait for my refund."
Negative,"I barely play this game anymore because the focus has shifted to micro transactions more than a free to play games. I am a hardcore ES games fan, i play since beta ( 6,275.2 hrs on record) , i even pay for eso + (will stop doing that) . It saddens me to see ESO become this way.So here's how it is:You get to end game, you get your bis items, all gold, you make a tank, a heal, all bis, easy peasy... aaaand then you feel like there is nothing else to do other than farm dungeons or trial for completion and what do you get for completing those after hours of failing , even days? A freaking title! I don't even use titles, i had the same one since the beginning.You might get a nice skin and even a mount (the mounts are the hardest and i think there are only 3 to get)EVERYTHING ELSE, everything nice, cool, appealing is in the crown store and not only that, it's in the crown crates (just like a pay to win free to play games). Yes! it true that it's only aesthetic but aesthetics are the only thing enjoyable in the game after endgame as  loot because there is no other nice loot to enjoy (there are some but it's 10 % of what is in the crown store). There are tons of sets to use, 90% of them nobody uses. So yeah, for a game where there is nothing else to get but aesthetic items at the end game this game is:A PAY TO WIN GAME!"
Negative,"In the 48 or so hours since I registered my first character it's been totally offline for over a quarter of that, which considering the fact it's a game designed to be played for hundreds of hours isn't exactly enticing me to spend more in it. To make matters worse it isn't the actual servers that are the issue either, they're fine, it's on Steams end the breakdown occurs, and while you can technically launch the game outside of Steam if you bought the game via Steam you can't log in without it. So you're basically left unable to play a game that's actually working fine, and are essentially being punished for your choice of store.The actual game is fine, runs well on my r5 1600/1080 maxed out at 1440p, and there's loads of quests to help you get a general hold on the game. There's a skill advisor too to help ensure your newly formed warrior doesn't end up hopeless, and it's stupidly helpful because that tech tree is bloody obscene. Like I said i'm still new to the game so can't offer any input as to how it'll be after 50/500/5000 hours, but as it stands with the unnacceptable connectivity issues I absolutely recommend you buy the game direct from Bethesda and ignore this version."
Negative,"bought the game, downloaded the game in 3 hours, installed it. I go to play the game and its bugged and would black screen immediately. 5 hours of troubleshooting and choosing the repair option (which did nothing but waste time), at 2 in the morning i finally get this game going by adding some strings in the UserSettings.txt file which was originally missing when i installed. Game starts, nice cut-scene, first level doesnt load and im kicked for inactivity. Terribly done. Will never buy from zenimax again but i will keep trying to play the game and if i dont manage to, i will refund and buy a working game."
Negative,"It's a really good and unique MMORPG with A LOT of uniquely in-depth mechanics. The quests are awesome and they give you Elder Scroll vibes. It just feels like an online version of The Elder Scrolls to me as the name implies even though people always said this is SO different and you can't relate it to any TES game.ALSO every class can fit into any role. This is just so cool honestly! I love it!So those were the pros but some of the cons are really annoying and can make you go nuts at times.1. ESO Plus, while at first glance it might not seem P2W, it pretty much is. You will have a hard time organising your inventory without it as there are millions of crafting materials everywhere and crafting materials are the main thing that will fill up your inventory. With ESO Plus you get an infinite craft bag where you can store mats to your heart's content. You will never have to look around for materials around just to make a stupid gear to level up your crafting skills with ESO Plus because you will probably have everything in your craft bag.10% exp boost is not much and not game breaking enough to call it P2W but it's still something.You get ""Free"" Crowns on renewal of your ESO Plus which is pretty nice but still not game breaking enough to be called P2W.So the craft bag is really the only aspect of ESO Plus to make it P2W and somewhat the access to DLC you haven't bought while the other perks also help out on the P2W aspect.2. Crown Crates are basically loot boxes and can make you addicted and you'll probably waste a lot of money on them. Unless you're poor like me and even if you want to you just can't lol.Loot boxes are cancer either way.3. Really sh*tty servers. Like just awful. You'll have a very high fluctuation of latency, it can even go up to 500ms sometimes for no reason and overall higher latency than other F2P games that I've tried even without counting the stupid fluctuations. And this is all while you can't AFK in-game! It will log you out after 10-20 mins (I'm not sure but it's something in between those) I don't mind the automatic logout but you'd imagine it'd help to have a good latency and no fluctuations but apparently their servers are so bad that they need that feature just to keep the servers up and running! You'd imagine being such a big company with all that money that they get for the Base Game, DLCs, ESO Plus and Crown Crates, they would offer at least decent servers!4. MAIN-F*CKING-TENANCE. This is by far the most annoying thing about the game! Imagine having 6+ hours (can go up to 12 hrs sometimes) of weekly maintenance where they do nothing special but only reset theie servers or something! U WOT M8?The sh*tty servers and the very absurd long maintenance are the only reason I'm giving this game a negative review. Those are just so annoying that sometimes they make me hate ESO.Without those 2 problems the pros of this game heavily outweigh the cons and negatives and I'd definitely give a positive review anytime the last 2 problems are solved!"
Negative,Imagine playing skyrim or morrowind or oblivion without any of the fun. Thats what you're getting here.
Negative,I can't overstate enough that this game simply is not good
Negative,After 1463hrs on this game i got banned for apparently selling gold on the game which was not true. Contacted customer support asking for proof as I know for a fact there is none and got no response!Update - After playing this game since launch I found myself getting banned for something I didn't do. I tried reaching out through support tickets and everyone was closed as duplicate. I also tried reaching out through phone only to be met with automated answering machines and no one responds to voicemails. I've tried reaching out on the forums as well where I was met with my account login unsuccessful and registering would bring me to a blank page. ZOS seems to be doing this to so many people because that's all I've read while researching solutions. In my opinion this game is addictive and can/will be stripped from you at anytime without question. Knowing this now I would say not to play the game. From my experience thus far it screams communism in and out of the game. This is truly heartbreaking Zos doesn't care about the players and are extremely harsh!
Negative,Its like guild wars but worse
Negative,PVP is unplayable.
Negative,"This is NOT a game to enjoy adventure with a friend - party system is messy, quests get bugged, objective sharing is a mess.Seems like a good game to play SOLO."
Negative,Sells your data to ad companies
Negative,"Game is awesome, but you guys keep on getting greedier and greedier.  Some items in the store are very expensive (especially houses), crown crates are a rip off, and now crown discounts went down from 50% to 20%.  I love your game and I have supported it as much as I can (subscription, dlcs, expansions, crowns... I buy it all), but it's getting hard to keep up (Yeah, I know it's all optional and blah, blah... That doesn't mean I have to be happy about clown crates and 16000 crown houses...)"
Negative,"Look, I really like Elder Scrolls Online (ESO).  The graphics are somehow a bit dated, but beautiful and more realistic than most games.  The character creation is great.  Finally, I can be any part fat or thin.  The game is complex and has lots to do as far as skills and crafting, and you can really force into any kind of build you want, maybe not as good as you could back in Anarchy Online but it works.  High Elf Dragonknight all Magicka Fire Mage here I come.  I was so hyped to play an Invoker/Kael'thas/Thranduil, but, my partner and I just stopped playing it right before we decided to go long haul and dump tons of money into this game.  Why did we stop?The game is filled with suspension of disbelief killing woke ideology.  The game gives license to do violence against a particular race based solely on their race and culture.  In the game, although it's almost always canon that High Elves are snooty, they are also intelligent and build beautiful things and are good with magic, or magicka in this case.  The game doesn't just make jests about elvish aristocracy, it dehumanizes High Elves just for their race.  Of course I chose the elvish island as my start area and was met with a main story line about a Queen who opened borders and her princess wanting to at least screen migrants to make sure they would be willing to cooperate with elvish rules and not destroy civilization.  (Sorry but a culture that doesn't believe in women's rights won't mesh with a culture that does, right?)  Well, as the quest unfolds, the princess just learns that she was wrong and needs to recognize her inherent prejudice and that she has no right to her own life, identity or culture.  It is laid out that High Elves have no right to be with their own, no right to like their own culture, and specifically how High Elves, and only them alone, are somehow inherently lesser, evil and flawed and therefore must accept going extinct.  It's the same Marxist, ancestral sin, pseudo-education that China's CCP forces on the children of it's enslaved Muslim minority.  And as if that's not bad enough, the side quests are full of it too.  In fact a side quest is what broke my limit.  You're low level, trying to earn money, and here comes this quest, ""Duelist's Dilemma"" in which there is an Orc who hates High Elves.  If he hates them so much, you'd think he would just leave their island.  No, you have to help him trick a High Elf away from the High Elf guards (as if the fact they have guards is somehow a crime, like they cant defend themselves), and after tricking the elf away the Orc breaks the rules of the duel and punches the elf dead and rewards the player for it.  Its not like the Orc and Elf have a beer afterward, no, he just gets punched dead and that's it.  Has Bethesda, ZeniMax and ESO heard of the Waukesha Christmas massacre in which a black supremacist with a long history of assault posted about his desire to run over white people, tried to run over his partner, was released from jail in the name of social justice, and then drove through a barrier to intentionally run over old white people and white children, killing them?  Have these companies heard of Jussie Smollette, who used his wealth and privilege to stage a hate crimes to further push the dismantling of the west and cause racial hatred world wide?  He was just sentenced to jail, finally, its not like I'm giving you fake stories.Have these companies heard of Cash Gernon or Canon Hinnant or all the other little fair skinned boys being murdered by adult black men since 2020 when CRT and this Marxist racial division was pushed in schools?  ESO is a part of this racial hatred.Gaming is the last sanctuary of the imagination, where we can be any race, any gender, and dive in for immerse fun and creative thinking away from the propaganda of an evil world.  Its pure.  Its where you can team with people from China and Brazil for a Dota match and all work toward the same goal and have a good time.  These companies are betraying us by polluting games and filling them with hateful, un-creative, repetitive, divisive ideology.  ESO sends the message that ""It's okay to dehumanize an entire race, break the laws of that race, and do violence upon that race specifically because you don't like that race.""  I want to play the game and I can't because of that.  I wish they would at least remove the Duelist's Dilemma quest or change it.  My partner and I literally talked about going paid and making this our new long haul game.  But in light of current affairs we can't support a game that gives rewards for the dehumanization of an entire race and says its okay to punch to death anyone you don't like, in their own neighborhood no less, and even reward you for it.Yet another group of companies who hired inclusion experts and filled their game with the tools to encourage more people to hate their fellow man.  How divisive.  I further looked over their website and saw they made a statement in support of BlackLivesMatter, so that pretty much explains why every quest, every storyline, every NPC statement and even every book on every bookshelf in the game that I read is not about an immersive fantasy culture, rather, its about the same hateful political ideology that seeks to dehumanize one particular race.  I am wholly, utterly disheartened.I hope these companies remember, the violence they give license to today is the future that they, their loved ones, and all of us, are going to have to live with in the future."
Negative,"good for lore bad for immersive experience, which is the main reason i play the series"
Negative,"bad monetisation, the fact that they still dont have australian or oceanic servers and eso plus is required just for inventory kills this game. just go play a better mmorpg this isnt it chief"
Negative,Paid with paywall
Negative,********************Warning the GAME will not install****************************************The installer package does not work for a lot people and this has been an ongoing problem for more that 15 months.  If you enjoy spending money on things that don't work and wasting hours trying to install the game you paid for with no support from Steam or ESO this is the game for you.
Negative,"This game is BS. Company's who made this basically make this game unplayable unless you pay for ""eso plus"". Absolute BS. I'm not paying more money for this damn game. Don't even waste your time with this. it's a beautiful game yeah but inventory space is a joke, crafting is a joke and I hate the combat. Such a waste of damn time."
Negative,"Yes, ESO is everything I wanted, for a pvp enabled, multiplayer MMO/RPG like quest hunter.But this review is here to warn any buyers that, you will spend a lot, on the game, it's expansions and subscription.What you don't know, is that it will be offline, servers will be down, steam will be blamed, and most of this happens on weekends when we can afford to play. What is more, the recent few ""sorry, we are aware the servers are offline"" took 10+ hours to fix, and no incident reports or feedback, just a company giving its paying customers the finger.Keep it in mind. Else: when it's online, great. Meets all expectations :)"
Negative,"Update 1:As of Oct 2019, the game is unplayable because of constant disconnect issues. Only recommend this game when it's on sale.Update 2:As of October 2024, things have gotten worse. The disconnect issue is affecting an increasing number of users, causing the player base to shrink daily (This has been mentioned by many players on the ESO Forums). Although VPN helps to reduce the impact, why is it necessary for gamers to use VPN?----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It keeps saying I don't have a valid connection.I guess my connection is not fast enough to connect to your server, which is located somewhere outside of this planet."
Negative,Apart from being lacklustre overall (i.e. character model movements are awkward and questing/crafting unimaginative) the main issue I have is the bad lag / latency from Australia (which might just be the Steam version if you read other reviews).  It is supposed to be action combat but the delays make dodging and interrupting pure luck and pretty much unplayable.  I didn't get much time to play the game and it may get better at endgame but I cant bring myself to spend time finding out.
Negative,"So a friend of mine that plays this game, gifted me this game through Steam. I received the gift, the game is in my library. All well and good right??? NO. I downloaded the game for 3 or 4 days? I don't remember.  And so long cause I couldn't use the full speed of my internet(I am not the only one using it so I had to throttle the download speed)So after 3-4 days of downloading this game when I tried to install it, it said unable to install try again with another copy of the game. I am like what the heck? I tried to go to TESO/Zenimax website and log in with my steam account. After successfuly inputing my account info, the TESO website says that I need to buy a game-Basically doesn't recognize that I have the game. What is completely beyond me is the fact that neither TESO/Zenimax and their game installer, neither Steam itself has any option to like scan and repair the files or scan and redownload any corrupt/missing files, in case something went wrong with the download. And we are talking about paid products as well as a product that is freaking over 70 GB to download(94GB in the disk).My options right now is to either 1: Redownload the whole game or 2:wait for TESO/Zenimax to respond to my help ticket submission.In my experience problems like these happen with games and companies that have designed poorly their installers/games ect.I might change my review to a positive one once they fix my problem and if the game is worth all this trouble that I go through. So far I am completely disappointed.~EDIT:So after a lot of searching to solve my own problem of ""unable to..""blah blah blah, I found the answer here https://steamcommunity.com/app/306130/discussions/0/133255810023384381/?ctp=8For those who have the same problem and they try to fix it, yet they can't find ""Resource1.zip"" , remember to leave the ""unable to.."" error window open. Don't close it. Then you will do find it.Because my solution came from a user of the game and not Steam or Zenimax, I will not change my bad review yet. It remains that the game shouldn't have such issues.I will still consider to change this review to positive if I like the game/gameplay ect."
Negative,"Months of constant sledgehammer nerf and the ZOS keep painting us end-gamers as the baddies,and they have the audacity to ask for our trust.I decided to canceled my sub after 3.3 k hours poured into this game because I'm so fucking sick of constant change and the attitude of ZOS towards us."
Negative,Give me cross platform profile save. I'm not interested in regrinding for the same stuff on all 14 of my max level Xbox characters.
Negative,A sad disappointment of a once great company. Lost my support forever.
Negative,"Okay, but the content is still lacking quite a bit.  The pay to play content is too expensive for what is offered."
Negative,"Already payed for the game thinking I could play it like I own itNah, without an added subscription on top of a game I already payed for, there's just too many limitations for a loot goblin like me to do what I usually do in mmo's. Basically wasted my money buying the game, and it's still a sore spot for me. I moved on to Guild Wars 2 for my mmo fix where I pay for the game+content and own it forever with no further restriction tied to the content I payed for"
Negative,"A shitty game that is being sold to you under the guise of the good name of the TES series. And this is both from a TES fan and MMORPG enjoyer perspective. PVE sucks, PVP sucks even more, all progress in this game is pretty much meaningless thanks to scaling system. There is no atmosphere and immersion, which is one of the most strongest sides of TES series. Combat system with five abilities and switching between them is just awful and looks like it was designed for mentally disabled people. No gameplay changing mods of course, which is the main TES games feature IMHO. It absolutely doesn't feel as part of TES series overall as well. The whole gameplay is 95% stupid grinding, I would only recommend this game if you want to just kill your time. Totally doesn't costs it's money.Btw, don't mind that I only have 10 hours played, I have other account not on steam where I have played this shit much more.UPD: also, lookup their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021). This is simply beyond any bounds of decency"
Negative,"I wasn't even able to install it from Steam, as if you download it via Steam you need to have *twice* the minimum hard disk space (2x70 = 140 GB) available in order to install.I uninstalled a few games on my SSD to install it in the first place, but then as soon as it finished downloading and I started it, it prompted me for another download (and another 70GB free).Apparently Steam hosts an outdated version of the game, and when you first start it it detects that and goes to download the launcher/patch the game.This is beyond embarassing for a triple A game on an alleged triple A distribution platform.Cannot recommend."
Negative,"So i have been playing this game since vet ranks were a thing and i've had many fun moments in the world of eso......when it works. Lately the game goes through so many updates event and patches but nowadays every time they do something to improve the game they break something fundamental. Recently the game is becoming more and more unplayable. No i don't mean in the sense that the grind is insane because it is. im talking about not being anle to log in after waiting in a que for thirty minutes to just be thrown into another thirty minute que, load screens failing and logging you out, have fun in the que getting back in. Dungeon finder not working at all, And in game purchases dissapearing without giving you the item you bought but still taking your money. Alot of this is why i wouldnt recomend eso to a new player, but for the rest of us whove put more than 7 years invested into this game, all we can do is hope for the day that patches dont break the game weve spent so long playing. unfourtunantly with the way things are going. it doesnt appear to be anytime soon"
Negative,"Don't buy this game through Steam client.This happens to me yesterday, downloaded overnight ... when you complete downloaded the game and clicked ""Play"", the elderscrolls online Launcher pop-up and then it ask for INSTALLING the game...  cuz it shows up as not being installed on your PC.And then you have to wait and watch it download the whole DAMN thing... As soon as it finished it STILL shows it as not being installed.What can I do? DELETE IT !?Now I've deleted the full game content from Steam category and ready to ask for a refund."
Negative,"Tried to login to give game another chance since I haven't played in awhile. Apparently I forgot my Password.I requested password reset. I got the email. I reset my password. It said I was successful. I go to login with new password. It says wrong password. I go to reset password again. It tells me ""Access Denied."" I wait a week or so to see if it needs time to process or reset. I try again. My access is denied again for a game I paid full price for. GG.Gameplay-wise. The game is decent. It's not incredible and doesn't quite have that 'Skyrim' feel to it in the exploration/massive map sense. The combat is somewhat comparible, but it seems a bit slow paced for an MMO. Overrall it is a good game to pass some time and have fun in short bursts, but it doesn't get you addicted like some MMOs may.I still wish my access wasn't denied to play a game I paid for and followed the instructions to fix my password (which I now question if it was ever even wrong or if the Bethesda client was messing up the whole time)"
Negative,"I enjoy playing ESO. The world is beautiful. The game is a GREAT deal if you don't get ESO Plus, AND don't craft.I have spent 80 hours in Vvardenfell alone. Many quests, decent stories. Some are very short, but many are full out quests with nice emerging plot lines.It breaks down when you want to start crafting. The inventory system pretty much forces you to get ESO Plus. $15 a month for a craft item storage bag. Litterally. Sure you may want to play the DLC, and that would be a ligitimate reason for a Plus Membership. But as a new player barely having left the first region I explored, I don't need DLC content and litterally paid for only the craft bag.Second major complaint is the skill system / evolution is too simplistic for my tastes. Combat skills are fine, but the crafting skills I really am under whelmed. Crafting systems are really important in a game in my oppiion. ESO's is a huge let down.One thing I love and hope makes it into the next game is the special skills you get from guilds. I'll continue to play unitl my Plus membership runs out and then I trhink I will drop it. Too bad, as I love to play the game itself."
Negative,"Haven't played for a couple of years, wanted to check the progress of the game after Necrom, to my surprise I am one of the thousands lucky ones (check reddit) that got a permaban for no reason.Support is silent for several days.UPDATE:Ok, after almost half a year of constant emails and arguing, finally justice prevailed, and I've been unbanned!In case someone is still watching this thread.It was quite a battle!If you are in the same situation as myself - just don't lose hope!NOTE: I am not changing the recommendation for the review - so that people can find my case in search through negative ones."
Negative,"Updating my original review, now 7 years on from when I bought this game. At the time of writing, I have never once been able to play.This game requires an account with Bethesda, with which you use a unique code to register your game. Part of this process involves receiving some sort of confirmation email. It may have been a code or just a link, I can't exactly remember at this point. Regardless, that email is absolutely required to play the game. In my case, likely due to some weird spam filtering, I never got that email. I contacted their support first, and was effectively brushed off. Realizing I was not going to be able to play the game, I contacted Steam for a refund. Unfortunately, this ""game"" is just the updater/launcher for the actual game (or, at least, it was; I haven't exactly checked to see if that's changed). This means that all time spent downloading the game is counted as 'play time'. In my case, in 2016, my internet was slow enough to stretch the download to 20 hours. 20.8 hours, to be exact, if you notice my playtime. This was more than enough to ensure that I could not get a refund.This game could be great or awful. I couldn't tell you though, due to the useless support and idiotic design choices. Unless their processes have changed, you could be literally gambling on whether you will actually get to play the game."
Negative,not enough things to put hours into
Negative,fuck this goddamn abomination
Negative,This game has lousy controls.  No thanks.
Negative,dont buy this spent 50$ on this and made a account and all that fun stuff just to spend 37 hours trying to log in to the game and try it which never happened. overall just one great big fuck you.
Negative,"This is maybe the most confusing game ever. It has a somewhat healthy playerbase, somewhat okayish reviewscores and is still being updated. So after a long break of it because I thought the game will die pretty quick I returned to it with hopes of improvment..... This game is INSANELY stale. The combat, the story, the NPCs.... I really don´t know where the fun is all the reviewers talk about. The combat is incredibly boring, holy shit it´s boring. I´m just standing in front of the boss and singlehandedly bring it down by spamming Ransack, which is an Ability. No tactics, no risk of death, no gameplay at all. I was told that combat would get better with higher levels so I thought to myself ""Okay, I´ll give it a try."". Take a guess, nothing friggin changed except I occacionally press 2 for a Stamina/Mana regen buff. And if I am not fighting I stand back with my healingstaff and spam my group heal and contemplate life until the boss goes down with absolutley no effort. ""Go to the dungeons for 4 players"" you might say. Okay let´s do that. I did nothing different aside from seeing more stuff going on but still spamming healz (I am a Templar with a support focus) and my warhorn. Aside from that I have a suspicion that the dungeons are not designed for 4 players because it was so incredibly easy. Sure it wasn´t a high level dungeon but if I literally do nothing and spam my 1 and 2 keys without any other action while being able to make a sandwich then there is clearly a huge con. The loot you get from quests and combat is not satisfying. The loot from bosses and other quest related events is unique, but have no unique appearance. I´m a huge lootwhore and adore my customizations, but this is abysmal. For the first time ever I am purposely ignoring loot with the knowledge that it has no impact whatsoever. Inventory managment is a mess if you don´t upgrade to premium. I spend so much time on micromanaging my inventory it´s ridiculous. The best items for customizing your char are behind paywalls with so many other features (who the hell thought locking the Dark Brotherhood behind a paywall is a good idea?!). The worst part of this is you can´t get these things by normal means, that´s right, you have to pay because FUCK YOU GIVE ME MONEY! The story is laughable. I couldn´t do it because it was so boring and I couldn´t do it with my friend for comedic relief and some sort of diversion because ""you are expected to do this alone"". I don´t even know who all these people are I worked with and don´t care about them. There is absolutley no connection between player and those characters. Granted the voiceacting is somewhat passable, but I want substance and the storyrich experience everyone is talking about. Where the hell is it?! Did I join the wrong faction? Am I the wrong class? Do I have to pay more? WHERE THE HELL IS THE FUN IN THIS GAME?!The atmosphere is fitting for its regions, but then things happen that just are so ridiculous that I have to tell them. A city was apparently under siege and the city-main-guy told me to help defending it. I walked out of the gate and there were literally 3 guys outside with 1 trebuchet.... ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?! This is not a one time only thing, it happens so often that you can´t immers yourself into the world, which is the whole point of a RPG, MMO or not. The only really outstanding good experience I had were the sieges in PvP. Damn. They are quite impressive and a lot of fun in my opinion. But again, I dont get why I need an eternity with my uptodate equipment to dent someone and my enemy player just oneshots me ( not literally but it´s so fast I don´t know what happens). Aside from this I loved skulking around with my buddy in Cyrodiil.If someone can please tell me where the hidden gem of this game is, please tell me! I can´t find anything redeeming in it and I feel I only waste my time with it. I really love PvE and this is so unbelievably boring, bad, stale and unintuitive. I actually have more to say about it like the Levelsystem, the graphics, the music and crafting, which I find ok but on 1 good thing 1000 bad things follow. As it stands I can´t recommend this game. Cheers."
Negative,"I've played this for hours as one can clearly see and I cannot recommend this game to anyone.Edit: I got a response from some dev account talking about ""customization and convenience"". Bull-fucking-shit ""convenience"". My problem was the pricing you idiots put on the store. $15 for ONE backpack, armory (new at the time of writing this), or bank slot? And if you want to also count the mount upgrades. I know you can get the backpack and bank slots for free, with gold that scales a ridiculous amount imo, but think of the players who want to skip that. 18 times for both bank and backpack upgrades in-total. $15 each, $120 total for VERY limited space. If you ask your playerbase ""Is anything in the store worth buying?"" they will say ""No."", I guarantee it. And you have the audacity to ask for the amount of money you do.It's not an overall terrible game, there's tons of stuff to do in the big, wide world of Tamriel. The problem is their monetization of the game. I remember when they were first releasing this game and it was full-price with a subscription. Now it's $20, which isn't terrible, but the fact that they have ""microtransactions"", a membership subscription, and DLC with the prices they put on everything is outrageous. The game also feels like it's missing some features that other MMOs have. The combat is very 'simple' and gets easy after a while. The game is also full of beggars for crowns who pay GOLD FOR REAL MONEY.The Crown Store is not worth a single cent, the items on there are WAY too expensive for what they are. Spending ~$40 for an in-game house? Really? That's furnished and it's half-that unfurnished at least. Costumes are another issue; they are too much for what they are as cosmetics, same with any other form of cosmetic in the store. Supplies, pets, mounts all cost way too much. You can barely buy anything with $8 you spend for an item in the store.When a new DLC is dropped, it's $15-$40 for content you can get through in less than a day. Some of the features they add do have replayability, I admit, but paying those prices for areas that are really only useful for one or two of the features it includes is a bit much.The combat gets a bit boring and repetitive after a while, simply spamming abilities. Most MMOs have this problem, but for some reason ESO just seems a bit worse. I think it's because of the lack of skill use. You get all these skill trees and a bunch of skill points to use, but you can't even use most of them and are tied to only a few (10, technically 12 if you count ults, in-total). And only some of them are more useful than others, depending on what you're doing. I will say, there is quite a bit of variety, but again, some things are going to be better than others.Beggars have become a real problem in the game asking for people to buy stuff from the Crown Store for gold. In-game currency you get for free. I don't know when this became a thing, as a took a long, long break from the game, but I don't understand why it's a thing at all. It's honestly kind of disgusting because it ties in with the prices of the items on the crown store as well.The membership, ESO Plus, is a double-edged sword in my opinion. It allows players to unlock certain features, like the craft bag (storage for materials), and allow access to older DLCs, opening up the game more and other stuff. That's pretty nice. Along with Crowns every month, but are fairly worthless to me for reasons stated above. Again, the problem is the price of it, $14/ month or if you don't feel like making multiple payments $140/ year. What the actual shit?? I'm sorry, but you have to be mentally ill to pay that amount for what they give. That's a fucking scam and I don't think I need to say more.It's nice to be able to explore all of Tamriel and go to places you might recognize or visit new ones to see what they look like in the Second Era. But there are some HUGE problems with the game, again, mostly with the monetization. The community is meh, you get some good but also really annoying people, but it's better than others. And there's a ton of end-game content, too. All-in-all, be smart, don't spend too much and if you are going to spend money, just do the $14 for ESO Plus. Join a guild, make dosh and friends."
Negative,There is a wierd mouse acceleration bug that I can't find a fix for and it makes the game unplayable. Game seems particularly dull and dated. Would rather play any other TES game.
Negative,"nice game, but sales are scam. so a full game with blackwood and other previous DLC cost $10, but upgrading blackwood cost $5 without previous DLC. a joke upgrade."
Negative,"Full of bugs, devs don't care. Play a free mmo works just as good"
Negative,"Game is awesome fun for exploring and crafting. I love to sneak, steal and kill during my explorations, really good.BUT DO NOT BUY THIS ON STEAM !!!! Buy it on bethesda since steam i a cluster fuuuuuck to log in...."
Negative,"Pay to pay game.It's sad because I was looking forward to buying it after trying it, but the pressure to pay to progress can be felt from the start. Aggressive subscription mechanics, micro inventories and the sluggish grind are something I do not want to invest my time in."
Negative,"DLC does not come with necromancer class anymore (although it said it did...) That has to be purchased through the crown store. (BS.)Tutorial/Intro ""mission"" rivals oblivion levels of tragically uninteresting. Finally got to Seyda Neen (major throwback) and my first quest involved just running around talking to people for about 30 minutes. After which, I ran around a largely uninhabited island freeing slaves (0 challenge.)Less fun than any other MMO in the first 80 minutes. And that's a spectacular failure."
Negative,"I don't know what it is about this game....its just soulless. I'm surprised its been around this l long. The graphics seem...just outdated. The game play is just so boring. The fights lack impact, they feel very disconnected. The dungeons are so boring. id much rather quality over quantity. Its just one bum rush after another. The spell casting never flows right, when switching weapons it just feels clunky and always has since day one, and yes i played this at launch. I see some trailer somewhere and try this game out every couple years and it just feels the same, clunky, boring and disconnected. The worlds are massive, actually, its way too huge, there's so much emptiness, again, quality over quantity. The inventory UI is terrible, full bags everywhere, hundreds of mats, I'm stacking all this stuff and why? Who the hell knows!? Some towns have banks, some don't. That's silly to me, all towns should have banks!I've really tried to give this game a chance, its way too big for its britches, i have no idea what their vision was with this, impossible to keep track of any story lines or lore, there's way too much of everything. Nothing feels rewarding or accomplished. Scrap this game and make ESO2, with better everything and think quality over next time."
Negative,"Arrogant. Greedy.  Exploitative.  If you asked me to choose three words to describe Zenimax Online Studios these would be the words I'd choose. It is readily apparent to anyone who actually plays the Elder Scrolls Online that the Dev team does not play the game.  Changes are made to gear sets, skills and overall combat that confound even the nerdiest endgamer.  Items are buffed that should be nerfed, items are nerfed that need to be buffed.  Skills that noone uses are made even more useless, etc.  What's more changes of game-changing magnitude come every 3 months, completely exhausting the playerbase.All of these changes are made despite the fact that players have access to a testing server allowing them to test new content before it goes life.  Even with this, bugs spotted early in the testing make it to live; overpowered item sets which are identified make it to live, etc.Zenimax's response to criticism of game design choices is incredibly arrogant and dismissive.  Most criticism posted on the game's official forums is removed and the most outspoken critics are banned (as an old guildmaster of mine once said, Russia and China could learn a thing or two from Zenimax on censorship).  Toxic posts that are positive towards the game (such as those attacking the critics) are allowed to stay up without a problem.  This censorship extends to official twitch streams.  in one memorable instance, posting the phrases ""PvP"", and ""Cyrodiil"" (referring to repeated performance issues with the games PvP) got you banned from twitch chat.  For an example of Zenimax's customer support see here: https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/619332/friends-account-suspended-for-unknown-reason-support-unhelpfulOne of the main devs of the game has repeatedly insulted the game's PvP playerbase (and in my opinion should've been removed from his position long ago)Zenimax also partakes in exploitative business practices when selling new expansions to the game.  New OP item sets are added and advertised to entice players to buy a new $60 expansion (because there isn't enough content in the expansion to make it worth buying) that are then nerfed to uselessness months later.  The ingame cash shop contains several items (skill and attribution respec scrolls for example) that are easily obtainable in game but are seemingly only there to trick inexperienced players into buying them.  Despite the staggering number of bugs present in the game (and there's an entire pages long section of the official forums dedicated to reporting them) for years the only thing that without a shadow of doubt can be expected to work is the ingame cash shop.  Patches for login issues, inventory bugs, etc can take days.  A crown store patch will take hours if that.Zenimax has also repeatedly subjected its PvP playerbase to months long testing on live servers.Stay away from this game if you're thinking of buying.  It's too unstable and the company that runs it too greedy and dishonest to deserve your money."
Negative,X20 subscription price increase. I don't recommend it.
Negative,It just doesn't work. At all.
Negative,"QoL is locked behind a paywall.This is why F2P will almost always, necessarily, be bad for consumers. Even if the publishers swear on their mothers' graves that there is no P2W, the business model just totally incentivizes bad design via an annoyance model (Path of Exile and many other games say hello). B2P games with F2P business models (Diablo 4 is the most famous example as of April 2024) obviously suffer the same fate. I would happily pay $100 for a complete game with none of this bullsh**, but I won't pay $5 for this."
Negative,"Honestly I'm on the edge of not recommending this game. Overall, I would give this a game maybe a 6.5/10. Here's why.Cons:- Fighting is extremely repetitive and gets boring even with upgrading and using new skills. Even when you're fighting a boss or a mini-boss the fighting is exactly the same to fighting any regular enemy. Why not spice it up a little with different combat patterns instead of going head on into the battle and just spamming all of your skills?- Leveling up skills also gets repetitive. For example when you're leveling up your blacksmith skills you want to take on blacksmith writs, but every single time its the same thing: Make some armor and weapons. Why not make me go out and collect useful resources? Or maybe make me go craft a full set or a part of a bonus set piece?-Quests ALSO get really repetitive. Can you see a pattern here? This game is overall really repetitive. The majority of quests may consist of you breaking stones, protecting stones, turning on stones, turning off stones, solving extremely easy puzzles, protecting a mage as he or her painstakingly does something to a stone, and especially killing lots of people in the same way because the combat mechanics are REPETITIVE.Pros:- The game is story-rich, which is to be expected from any Elder Scrolls game. The only thing I wish for, in regards to the story progression, is that different story-lines connected in a more smooth manner. I just wish Orcs weren't always the bad ones :/. For the most part, the story is great though.- The graphics are definitely a step up from Skyrim. Character models look way better and character movements and behavior is more fluent and consistent.- You get to explore almost all of Tamriel. Its so nice to see different landscapes rather than the mostly snowy and mountainous terrain of Skyrim. Its also really refreshing to see cultural variation. The forests of Valenwood, the architecture of Elsweyr to the Tribunal's affairs in Morrowind; its just really cool to get to see such a variety in one game.- People are extremely helpful, especially in guilds. Players are always willing to give you guidance if you don't know what you're doing or you don't know what to next.Honestly I don't know whether I should recommend this game or not. To be honest, I'm a bit biased because I absolutely love the ES franchise, but at the same time this game just doesn't live up to it's previous successors. For that, I'm going to have to not recommend it."
Negative,"I'm more embarrassed about the hours spent on this game than I am of the 18+ games hidden in my library.Even for a MMO, this game is way too liberal with wasting your time with busy work, that advances your character in boring careers at the slowest speed known to man. Too bad the combat sucks too!The combat loop is in this awkward place for me where it isn't fast enough to be engaging or slow enough to be relaxing. It is most enjoyable with a controller, but you'll never need to be good at it until you enter Advanced dungeons, and even then it's just a pushover. I reached the end game and the gameplay barely evolves and isn't worth the investment. The only difference is that end game is completely out of wack cause the devs don't do proper balancing.The monetisation is like Destiny 2, which should ring massive alarm bells. How the base game hasn't gone completely free to play is beyond me. I started playing due to the low cost barrier to entry, but the Crown Shop made me completely quit after reaching end game. All the effort goes into the paid cosmetics, which leaves a lot to be desired from the cosmetics that you unlock during gameplay (of the expansions that you STILL BOUGHT with money).As long as Old School Runescape exists, I will never consider wasting more time consuming Bethesda slop."
Negative,"I've played for thousands of hours (before the steam release). The game balance is bad, classes don't feel unique enough and loading screens take far too long. It's ok if you want to have adventures in the Elder Scrolls universe but I can't recommend it as an MMORPG to play seriously."
Negative,"an aggressive monetization game that any free to play would envyover the past few months, monetization has become even several times more aggressive. It seems that this project is being prepared for closure and they are trying to milk the players dry"
Negative,"DON'T BUY!!!  i bought this game awhile back and spent the next 2 weeks after buying it talking to steam and Bethesda customer service.  At the end of the day, I can't play the game, and I can't get my money back.  So I highly recommend not buying this game through steam.  Buy it another way."
Negative,"EDIT: I checked  the game out after Greymoor release and the lag is actually significantly worse which I didn't think possible. DO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.I started playing this game quite heavily at the start of the covid break and at first enjoyed it thoroughly.  The open class system, world and well voice acted questing were quite enjoyable. However, as you progress further into the game and start to tackle more difficult content one glaring issue will make the game an absolute nightmare to play. THE LAG. My god! I have never experienced combat as laggy and unresponsive as in this game. I have one of the most expensive internet connections on the market and even open the ports on my router but it still absolutely awful. At first i thought it was on my end until i went to forums and saw how massive of an issue this was. The final straw for me was when i tried Cyradiil for the first time and consistently got around 250ms ping with spikes to 500. It is an absolute shame that a game with such enjoyable mechanics is  entirely ruined by terrible server quality."
Negative,"It's not bad for a MMO, but for a game that you have to buy to ""pay once and play forever,"" they sure do lock many necessary options behind a paywall, forcing you to buy crowns or subscriptions, because the base game isn't very user-friendly without those. Most of the story is bland and redundant, you'll spend most of your quest-gathering skipping dialogue (something most MMO gamers are used to). You'll spend much time fighting your own inventory management, because instead of using a weight system, you have limited inventory slots. Don't loot crafting materials unless you pay for crafting inventory acess. The leveling/character system is a generic reimagining of the Elder Scrolls formula, you get to choose ""fighter, rogue, sorcerer, cleric."" The only part a real fan has to look forward to is the lore, and even that is a minor attraction."
Negative,"PVP is quite disappointment, pve is ok"
Negative,"boring, play wow, wait no, go back in time to 2009 and play wow"
Negative,ALL NEW BUYERS BEWARE. Game does not connect to server. READ OTHER REVIEWS.  NONE OF MY FRIENDS COULD CONNECT TO EOS SERVER THAT PURCHASED IT TODAY.
Negative,argonians are hot
Negative,The Elder Paywalls: Online. No Subscription Required! ( But kinda is if you want all the content.) And even that is temporary for as long as you pay. Disappointing.
Negative,"Sincerely disappointed with the steam version of this game. The trouble of buying the game and downloading through steam then having to REINSTALL through the launcher is plain out ridiculous. I bought it during the sale so I wasn't out that much money so I'm not too frustrated about that. I will say though, I decided to just get the game from the source seeing as their game will actually download and not freeze while trying to install its patching. Sorry Steam. I can see why you only had it for $8 now."
Negative,"I stopped playing this game last November in 2018, during that playtime period I bought a month of ESO plus. I cancelled my subscription with the game at the end of that month. Today I just received my very first email telling me that I renewed my sub with ESO (February 2019). Turns out Steam never updated my cancellation request and I have been completely wasting $15 a month on a subscription based game without my knowledge. This ended up wasting $60 on non-refundable sub time for a game I don't even play anymore. GG steam, GG... What I would like to add is that Steam never sent me an email telling me I renewed a subscription to this game until 4 months after I thought I cancelled. Tl;Dr Don't sub."
Negative,"POVERTY SIMULATORPersonally, I like to decorate, so as soon as a game offers the possibility to have my own space and to customize it, I am immediately into it. With Elder Scrolls Online, however, this seems an impossible undertaking: first of all, it takes too much gold to buy a house, and missions offer an extremely small amount. For a person who works and has little time to play, it is already a miracle if he manages to expand his inventory.For furniture it's even worse: blueprints for beautiful/cool furniture are almost impossible to find, therefore one is forced to buy from the crown store by spending real money (and here it's hella expensive too!): I would like to point out the fact that Elder Scrolls Online is not a free-to-play, moreover, it is a game that including DLCs comes to cost 60€, and after spending 60€ on a game I don't want to spend any more money on in-game content.Also the awful login system: of course cool rewards are on the last day of the month... how am I supposed to login everyday if the game is down for 12 hours straight when there's maintenance??"
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THE STEAM VERSION! Buy it direct! THE STEAM LAUNCHER NEEDS TO BE FIXED!I love this game, and I got my husband who isn't really into MMOs to try it with me last sale. We played for a whole afternoon and he actually had a lot of fun.However, next time he tried to play the steam launcher wouldn't work. No matter what we did trying to get it to run, the steam version wouldn't connect to the ESO servers on his laptop. We tried everything! We easily spent the same amount of time troubleshooting as we did playing. We know it was 100% a steam issue because the non-steam launcher worked fine on the same computer. Not like he could use it though, ESO purchases made through steam are locked and you have to use their launcher. Neither of us have been so frustrated by a technical issue with a game before. He wont even consider trying to play a different MMO with me now.It doesn't seem like this issue happens often, but enough and unpredictably. It could happen to you."
Negative,"I tried. Not very interesting when it comes to a Bethesda game, this is a pretty sad one actually. Everything leans towards micro transactions. I tried ESO plus to see if it was worth anything and sure I got a few crowns <- the currency you buy with real money. Bought a house, not even 7 hours in and level 7. Bypassed the accomplishment requirement. No feeling of actual accomplishment. Decided to cancel subscription, but couldn't figure out how to for the life of me. Until I came across a negative review and directions on how as it doesn't actually state how to cancel the subscription.  Which I will post below.Steam (top left)SettingsView Account details (on the top right)Manage subscription Cancel that recurring fee. So you don't have to live with this mistake of a game. Delete game."
Negative,"Well... if it keeps giving me me error messages and refuses to run? Not even close to Blizzards WOW. played for adecade on a p.c. way less power successfully. Nice price on Steam, huge download now waiting"
Negative,Had shitty laptop.Upgraded to monster PC (was forced to take windows 10).Launcher hasnt worked since.Games GG for me.
Negative,Loot Boxes in 2020? Really? Aside that it is the usual horrible immersion killing thing that every MMO is in the end. Sad Coop Experience... Waiting for the real Elder Scrolls Games allowing for Coop play modded or not.
Negative,"They want you to pay 40$ for cute ""Khajiit"" merchants and bankers that look like little household cats. That's 40$... each. So, to get the cute little merchant AND banker it's 80$. If you're a mobile gamer who scoffs at outrageous micro-transactions then you should also know that the game is pretty mediocre other than that. The animations are dated, the graphics aren't terrible but they look so much worse because of the lazy animations. There are better PvP MMO options out there and if you're looking for PvE just mod whatever previous Elder Scroll title you prefer."
Negative,"I'm tired of MMORPGs.Everyone tries to get me to join them and then they quit playing them right as I'm getting the hang of it.That said, I miss the derpyness of the single player games; granted, it's tough to translate setting up bottles in a triangle and throwing cabbage at them in an impromptu bowling tournament from Single Player to Multiplayer - I get it. But it would have made it a lot more different than the usual MMORPGs out there. All the difference I noticed was this game being set in the Elder Scrolls Universe. And that was diminished when you're forced to skip through all the expositional dialogue because the rest of yourr guild is grinding the dungeon. Go figure.That being said, I liked how I was able to form my own class - I maxed out heavy armor and fire staff so I could basically juggernaught and tank for people.Excellent music."
Negative,"God what a boring game. I loved the graphics and the music, and started out really enjoying it. Then, after a couple of dozen quests, I just had it. Bunch of fetching crap and running around huge areas to accomplish worthless things and get worthless rewards. Just plain awful. I bought what I thought was the complet package, with all the current addons, but immediately ran out of inventory space and realized I had to spend more REAL money if I wanted buy more space. The constant notifications regarding the online store just showed what a money grab this thing is. Such a shame because like I said, it is beautiful, but other than a couple of good quests, the writing seemed very amateurish. Silly little things to keep you busy. And so I'm done. Not going to keep torturing myeself."
Negative,"This game was the worst choice to buy, FUCKING WASTED $50 FOR WHAT? LOOKING AT THE FUCKING MAIN MENU, AND TWO U HAVE TO SUBSCRIBE TO PLAY. I've been trying to play it but i need to get a subscribtion for the game, HOW IS IT FAIR TO PAY AT LEAST $50 FOR THE GAME AND TO SUBSCRIBE TO PLAY, THIS IS BASICALLY A SHITTY GAME. EXACTLY LIKE WORLD OF WARCRAFT. It was my fault that I didn't read the game's discription as much, but still could they like add a extra notice when you're about to make the purchase saying, ""THIS GAME WILL ALSO REQUIRE A SUBSCRIBTION IN ORDER TO PLAY ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO CONTINUE?"" Anyways, to those who also had the same problem as I did, I feel ya... STEAM GIVE US OUR REFUNDS!!!"
Negative,"Without the monthly subscription, the inventory management subtracts from the game far too much for enjoyment's sake. With the monthly subscription, it is a pretty cool game with some impressive voice acting and enjoyable PVP. Personally, I do not feel the quality substantiates ~$15 per month. I was also disappointed with the amount of non-cosmetic purchases that were small enough that they should have been included with one of the major DLCs. Overall, I strongly felt like this was a good game hidden behind a massive grab for more and more cash."
Negative,"Couldn't play game, steam walkthrough to make an account didn't pop up. tryed to make myself one and then link the two together so i could play but geuss what? zen told me that i didnt own the game on steam! they also refused to help me solve the problem claming it was a steam issue, but you can't make a support ticket for this game through steam because they say all issues are to be handled by zenimax... FAIL. 10/10 WOULD REFUND AGAIN"
Negative,"If you want to play a game where you can earn the cool things IN GAME and by completing content, this is not for you. Every cool mount or xmog skin is all locked behind loot crates and majority of them are 2% chance drop items from said loot crates. this game could easily be on top if they got rid of 90% of the cash shop and made the cool stuff and things unlockable by playing the game. Its the way gaming goes anymore i guess."
Negative,"Obviously there is a market for this game considering how long it's run and you might like this game. As far as quality it seems perfectly smooth and the visuals are very nice.For me, it's not at all the experience I expected. I'm a long time fan of the Elderscrolls series, I have all the main games from Arena to Skyrim as well as the Redguard Adventures and Battlespire.I went into this thinking it'd be like a multiplayer version of Skyrim. However, I immediately get the feeling this is more of a first person rendition of Runescape set in the Elderscrolls Universe. The story and dialogue are very fast, the mechanics are way different, and I'm constantly blasted with ads for the crown shop. The combat was ugh. I played about a half hour and had zero interest.I think I'm just going to read the story details on the fandom and move on. I'm so glad they had a free weekend so I could try it without commitment! xDP.S. I just saw that this is similar to ""Monster Hunter: World"" according to Steam which is a game I got because my friends play it and maybe I'm just not the target audience of MMOs? I don't really feel attached to that game either because of how gamified it feels."
Negative,"While there is immense amount of content within the game, quality of it leaves much to be desired. So much that most of the the time i watch anime on the side to keep me entertained while i leveled. Aside from a couple questlines (primarily the main questline and dark brotherhood was decent, so far at least) But the biggest disappointment for me was the limited space we are given. They give you so little space, leveling up just one character's crafting consumes all bank space which is shared btw, so you can't level up more than 2-3 crafting lines including your alts. Unless you pay the monthly fee ofc which pissed me off to no end, as there is a tool that can hold all your crafting mats and lets you able to enjoy a very major content in the game without a hickup. That also severely limits your ability to make money (unlike some games, here gold is everything.). And the devs were apparently adamant about crafting bag being an exclusive payment perk which i learned too late. Made me think it was arranged this way intentionally. So unless you are fine paying for the monthly fee for a very average MMO, i do not recommend this game to anyone."
Negative,"I love the Elder Scrolls universe. I want to love this game. My wife plays it, and watching her makes me want to play it. But I aboslutely refuse to, because Zenimax Does Not Understand How To MMO.There is no auction house in game. The only way to sell your goods to other players is to be in a guild- and even then, it's not guaranteed. Only a certain number of guilds have the ability to use a Trader every week so that other players can buy their goods, and the guilds have to vie with each other for that ability. My wife did the math and, out of a game that at least 2.5 million play, only 100,000 players can sell their goods through a trader at any given time. It's ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.The game doesn't have a /stuck command, like every other MMO in existence. Instead of having a /stuck command for when you get stuck on terrain (which IS going to happen, at some point or another, this is a Thing in games), you have to pay to go to the nearest wayshrine. Which is, quite possibly, one of the most ridicullus things I've ever heard of. 'You got stuck on the terrain of our making, so pay to get unstuck.'If you have a multi-core processor in your computer, then you can kiss your FPS goodbye. ESO, for whatever insane reason, was developed to only use ONE core in a computer's processor. What that means, in terms of playing the game, is that any computer with multiple cores isn't going to be able to use the full power of their processor, but only ONE of the cores. For example; my wife's computer has four cores, but her FPS is crap because the game only utilyzes a fourth of her processor.If you have a laptop, good luck playing too. I just spent several hours clearing enough space on my laptop and downloading the game- only to find out that the game won't run on an integrated graphics card. Despite the fact that my laptop meets all the minimum requirements to play, I can't run the game on my laptop solely because of the integrated graphics cards.Which brings me to the install bug that, apparently, is a well known bug. I installed the game through Steam, of course, because that's where I bought the game. After clearing 90 gigs of space on my laptop and waiting for a couple hours while it downloaded and installed, I tried to run the game. Immediately, ESO began trying to install.... and insisted that I needed 87 more gigs of space to install the game. This is an old bug, a known bug, and one that Zenimax or Steam apparently have no interest in actually fixing. Because as far as my wife and I could find, before we found out about the integrated graphics card issue, there's no work around except to clear another 87 gigs of space- that isn't actually needed, since the game is already downloaded- before the installer will let you continue and play the game.Then there's the issue of crown prices. Because again, Zenimax Doesn't Know How To MMO. The prices for crown items in game, or the items that you buy with Real Money, are INSANE. As in, there is player housing that costs over a hundred dollars for ONE player home. Just as an example. It's not the only outrageously priced thing in game, just one of the more obvious and outrageous. If you look at the reviews for ESO? You'll see that even the good reviews for the game mention that it is far too heavily monetized and money centric.I want to play the game. I want to like the game. I enjoy the universe, and I enjoyed the actual gameplay when I played on my desktop. But I can't. I won't. Not with all the issues it has."
Negative,It's so easy you can basically afk near mobs. Just why?
Negative,"Microtransactions (or well, Macrotransactions) at every turnBuy ESO Plus or be at a disadvantage and deal with awful inventory spaceWant to change your hairstyle? Buy CrownsBe rich or miss out"
Negative,"The game was a waste of money for me and I really wish you were able to get your money back since it would've be better spent on almost any other game, even better, on a good indie game.A big thing wrong with this game is that its like any other MMO, lets say WoW with a Elder Scrolls reskin. Also steam shows that I played this for 29 hours but really about 27 - 28 of it was actually me accidently leaving the character selection screen open when I fell asleep. I forced myself to continue through that 1 - 2 hours, trying to squeeze the $20 I wasted on it to at least get a little satisfaction from it and got nothing. Of about 4 sessions I ultimately just let my subscription run out and forget it ever happened.PROS- graphics, not only is it some of the best for an MMO, its some of the best overall, excluding the computer GPU killers- enviroment, kind of goes with graphics but gets some extra attention, the water looks great and the use of some vibrant colors in the trees and stuff kicks it up a notch- audio, it has some of that great sweeping atmospheric audio that you love from the other Elder Scrolls games- character creation, though I'd like some more choices but it is far superior to most or any MMO's and you can generally make a character exactly how you'd like them look... to an extent.- voice acting, I was amazed when I found out you could almost talk to any NPC and get a response, aswell multiple responses. It was a huge plus that really stood out to me.- Unlike some other MMOS you can not only go in first person but use your weapon and shield without the action bar! Finally some minimal attempt to do away with the atrosityCONS- everything else, yep its awful. Don't get it unless it becomes free to play like SWTOR did.*WARNING* THE BELOW REVIEW IS A RANT AND YOU CAN READ IT IF YOU WANT TO  Bottom line is this, if you want to play a WoW style MMO with better graphics go ahead. Here are a couple main things that instantly killed this game for me. Dungeons that are pethetic and poorly designed. First off, if I want to go in a really high level dungeon at level 5, just let me, dont close them off and not have a pop up or anything telling me why (I literally stood in front of this dungeon where people were going in asking them why I couldn't go in, cause I really didnt). I did get in a dungeon and this is what I found, a even scattering of enemies, no hidden loot and stuff that I loved in Skyrim (fair, its not supposed to be Skyrim afterall), a boss that I didn't know was the boss, killed him, looted him, pressed a button, a door opened, and found out that was the end of the dungeon and the door just took you back to the begining so I can run back and be like, wait wasn't I just here..... OMG WTF.  Next killing factor, action barrrrrr. I hate action bars with a passion, why do they feel the need to stick one in every single MMO? cause WoW did it? I guess thats reason enough, ok, throw it in there and do away with how every single person that played the other games expects it, its ok really... after all its not the other games. The single nail that killed the whole game instantly for me was the combat. Maybe I am biased after playing games with some of the best combat mechanics (Dark Souls I & II) but there is no responsiveness to your attacks at all, you can run up slash a whole bunch while they are slashing you back. You can use your shield and block an attack and it doesn't stagger them much or less do anything to you... so I guess just keep slashing. So melee was a flop maybe I should try something else, maybe ranged? Alright this is better, all seems good feels like more of a game when I'm using a bow (a huge bonus was when I block I look like I'm holding up a cross to people and start backing away saying begone demon was probably the most fun I had in the whole game)... wait a second.... you can't shoot enemies until you get to a certain distance? Wait wait, let me try, yep, you have to wait until the rectacle gets bigger when you get close enough to them and then you can shoot them.... Wait... get close enough to shoot them? Did I not create a ranged character? The game was dead for me by the time any way, I already walked over to my brothers room like 40 times to complain about all that is wrong but this one cut deep. Does anyone recall trying to do some skillfull long range kills in Oblivion and Skyrim, how about head shot even though they didn't mean anything. How about a head shot across a endless chasm seperating you and a skeleton/  zombie thats on a broken boat in a awsome dungeon? Well this game doesn't have it since there is some kind of max distance that an enemy can agro and not only that regains its health and stands back where you first found them. It was obvious that the combat wouldn't be that good and even Skyrim is dead terrible compared to a game like DS I & II but come on.   Here are some extra things that were bad. I had a quest where I needed to put out some fires in burning buildings while there are enemy bandits around and save the villagers that are trapped inside. The first one goes ok, oh look a couple people are doing the same quest as me neat! NO, they put out my fire now I have to wait till it respawns. The fire respawns and so does the bandit, alright have to kill the bandit cause you get interupted when putting out the fire when he attacks you, NOOOOOOOOOOO YOUU SON OF A, birds chirp, the smoke clears,and the area around you gets that golden warm sunlit feeling that you feel when you wake up in the morning with your blinds open, the woman is saved by a flying dildo that came and put out the fire as you kill the bandit that was keeping you from putting it out in the first place. Alright I think thats enough actually, its terrible thanks for listening to my rant."
Negative,Never expected to get harassed by the moderators!
Negative,"I really tried to explore what this game has to offer, and it's just boring. Combat is boring - no special mechanics, just hitting enemies until they die. Quests are boring. Nothing special in this game."
Negative,For lying about handleheld(steam deck or rog ally) compatibility
Negative,"After Over 2100 hours I've decided to stop playing. Even if the game is good there's no point if I can't access it. I've consistently had start up crashes and, even when I log out and close correctly, constant game corruption that the repair function cannot fix. I did have mods, but I completely removed them and completely uninstalled and reinstalled. Crash on start up and corruption. I'm so disappointed."
Negative,Won´t even start
Negative,No oce servers
Negative,Piece of shit game that fucks up my windows size and placement everytime I start it and it won't even let me log in.
Negative,"no oce servers because they have to have ""Mega servers"" to make the game feel good apparently but unplayable for anyone not in EU or NA"
Negative,I love the game but it wont load anymore. ithas extreme issues.
Negative,"While I love the Elder Scrolls universe, this MMO feels like Bethesda forced a square peg into a round hole. Pay-to-play is an instant loser in my book. Sprinkle in some poor performance, graphics that are even more out of date than Skyrim, and you've got a recipe for a refund!"
Negative,Changing my review just because of how ridiculous the monetisation of this game is. We are now pay the same for less every year for their Chapters. Cutting content from what would usually come with a Chapter and reselling in their greedy store.Not to mention this years chapter was so mediocre I quit the game after 10 years of playing. Now could it be I am not the target audience? I'm probably not and thats okay. But I can not in good conscious recommend this game with their current decisions. I'll revisit it next year for sure but till then my review is now negative.
Negative,So many issues logging in. I can log into ESO website just fine. but whenever I log in on the launcher it says its sending me a code and it never sends it. When I reset my password on the browser site it sent me a code just fine.Also steam optimization is horrible. It wont recognize that I have the game installed. I can launch there the launcher in the steam apps file but not from steam
Negative,"I have played this game since it's release because I'm huge ES fan. I took a lot of time off between then and now, mainly because it's a subscription game (not worth playing for free). I started on Playstation and probably put over 1,000 hours into it before moving exclusively to PC a few years ago, where I now have nearly 900 hours. I'll make this really short.This game has the best gameplay of any MMO, in my opinion. The combat alone does it for me, but there are many other aspects of gameplay to love. The music is also wonderful. HOWEVER, I cannot recommend this game because of how much of a money grab it has become. I'd rather not even get into the details because it has already been stated a thousand times by others, but there is one feature that needs to be brought up as often as possible, and that's the f****** craft bag.If you haven't played this game yet, please note that without an ESO Plus subscription, you will have to carry all of you craft items in your regular inventory, which basically forces you to completely ignore crafting. The amount of crafting materials that the average player will reasonably carry, is so great that you would't be able to realistically have any character dedicated to crafting even after purchasing additional bag space and carrying nothing but the crafting materials. It's just simply not an option without the subscription. The reason this is a problem is because crafting is a major part of the game. Even if you have no interest in being a master crafter, you will be wasting so much gold, crowns, and real money trying to keep up with other players' gear if you decide not to improve your crafting skills. It's by far the most efficient and cost-effective way to obtain good gear sets, which btw, are absolutely necessary for many of the game's modes.You can try the game out for free and just focus on questing and getting the low tier sets earned by quest rewards, or discovered overland, but you will quickly realize how much of the game is behind that subscription."
Negative,"I once heard a person state ESO is one of the most polished MMO games. Remembering this statement is what motivated me to write this review. Even though I stopped playing over half a year ago. Because it couldn't be a more facetious statement.First I'm going to get my main complaint out of the way. Older Elder Scrolls games are some of the most immersive RPGs you can experience. On a story-level ESO is laughable by comparison. If you were expecting this game to be as good as Skyrim or Oblivion with added multiplayer, you're going to be very sad. You'll instantly discover this in the opening tutorial. You wake up inside a prison cell with a high elf on the outside telling you that you came here through a portal and so did a powerful daedra. My first thought is - why isn't this the opening cinematic!? That sounds epic! Show us the daedra and why it's so dangerous. Show us how our character escaped that danger. No? Ok then. The next thing she tells you absolutely slays me. She says she initially locked you up in this cell because she was suspicious of you and wanted to be cautious. But five seconds later when you agree to help her with her daedra problem she lets you out. Seriously!? All it took was a few nice words to change her mind!? And never mind the fact if you're playing one of the races from a faction that are at war with the high elves faction. So following this exchanging of words is the next complaint I have. There is a huge disconnect between what's being conveyed in the story and what I'm experiencing in gameplay. You're told all the daedra in the area are super dangerous and scary. But even the ""bosses"" go down easily if you just spam the left mouse button (and you take almost no damage too). I get that it's a tutorial but even this is a bit much. What really takes the cake for me though are the starting zones after this tutorial. The only one that's good is Vvardenfell. The rest are just as mind-numbing as the tutorial, if not worse. And after Vvardenfell it just goes downhill again with the exception of the main quest.Then there are my gripes with the game from a more MMO perspective. To start with, why does this game even have classes!? No matter what class you play, each of them can fulfill any of the three traditional MMORPG roles (i.e. tank, damage-dealer, and support). Nobody is unique. If you want to be a sorcerer that tanks damage for your party, you can do that. If you want to be a dragonknight that heals everyone, you can do that too. And if you want to be a templar that deals top damage, that option is also available. In addition to this, every class can wear any kind of armor. So if you want to be a sorcerer or a nightblade in heavy, full plate armour, you can do that. If you want to be a dragonknight or templar and wear light, cloth armor, you can do that too. Combine all this with the fact that there are no class-restricted quests, and you can pick up any and all crafting skills (and master them too) on a single character. From a practical standpoint, nothing sets your character apart from another player's character. If you're playing a sorcerer the only real difference between you and a dragonknight is that you're flinging lightning bolts instead of fire. I also don't know why character levels exist in this game either. The whole point of a leveling system is to give the player a sense of progression and accomplishment over time. But everything in ESO seemingly scales with your character's level. So it takes you the same number of attacks to defeat an enemy in the first starting zone as it does an enemy you meet several quest zones later. You don't feel stronger or having accomplished anything.My final issue is with ESO's economy, which is so obnoxious I had to make an entire separate paragraph for it. The whole point of a world auction house is to make it so players can quickly and easily buy and sell their things with other players. But ESO doesn't make it quick and/or easy at all! First, if you want to sell something, you have to join a guild. All guilds have access to a single trade NPC, somewhere in the world, that sells only the items of players of that one guild. How it's determined what NPC a guild gets comes down to a bidding war. So as one can imagine, the top trading guilds try to always get the most coveted trade NPC locations. Because this costs money, the top guilds also tax their players. What this all means for you is if you want a good optimal trade location for your goods you're going to be forced to pay for it and join a guild with a bunch of strangers. But it doesn't end there. Let's say you want to buy something. Buying something with this system is an absolute nightmare too. Because if you want the best deal for something, you're going to have to visit all the trading NPCs across the world to compare prices. Or, go out of your way to install a mod or visit a website that does this research for you. But even then, if you want to buy multiple different things at the best prices you're still going to have to teleport all over the world to buy them from the specific NPCs that have them.Trust me when I say I wanted to enjoy ESO. I forced myself to play for more hours than I should've because my friends were playing it. But it never got better. The only redeeming things about it is the Vvardenfell zone and the main questline. I can't stand anything else about it. If you can get ESO on sale for a couple bucks it's not the worst purchase you can make."
Negative,"ERROR ERROR sorry you cant log in server is corupted, server is full, server is modernized, server an unexpected  man wtf is that... I Want to play i bought it?!?!"
Negative,Level Scaling - I think it ruins any sense of progression
Negative,"READ AND WATCH REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING A GAME!!!Overall - game is not WORTHY OF YOUR TIME AND MONEY! It's like you buy a ""Free-to-play"" game with boring combat mechanics and even if you become to like it, you will soon realize quests are boring and have no moral lessons to teach. Main quest line is a BIG joke.After all you just want to get into endgame and realize(PAY WALLS), you can't build your character properly as you missed a key items from your build which in order to get them you need buy additional DLCs in store even if you bought already all Chapters, so you won't be as efficient in dungeons as other players who had it.So if you want to get at least playable experience from this game you will need to buy a WHOLE game with all DLCs currently available in game-store, which cost around at least 80-160+ USD dollars(depending if you buy it on sales or not). I think that is a bit too much for a game from 2014 and where PVP is close to be dead, if not already dead."
Negative,"I have encountered a completely game-breaking bug that seems to be linked to my account; I am not certain what update caused this, as I was able to play the game without issue in 2021.After exhausting all of the more common solutions (uninstalling and deleting local files, checking all hardware on my computer, filtering for conflicts in the software, etc), I have made new characters to try and resolve the issue, but the bug impacts all characters made on my account.ESO Support has provided no support or feedback on the issue despite tickets and requests for Customer Support. I have attempted to create a new account in order to see if the error persists on a different account, and the system will not send the email required for me to log in through the direct launch of the game (bypassing ESO Launcher and the Steam auto-login).At this point, I am too frustrated to entertain the idea of trying to play this game. I am assuredly not spending any further money on a game that does not work, and whose Customer Support seems to have no vested interest in repairing issues with the game."
Negative,"Bought it yesterday and downloaded. Spent about 30 minutes accepting EULAs, played for another 30 minutes. Today played through a bit of the beginning training. Logged off to do some work. Had a plan to meet up with some friends and play but now my computer is not authorized and I have to enter a code that will be emailed to login. The message also says you cannot request a new code for 24 hours. waited 1 hour. 2 hours. Missed the meetup with my friends. Still not code after 3 hours.Based on a quick internet search this happens pretty often. This issue makes this game nonviable for the purpose I bought it which is being able to play it."
Negative,Just play the regular elder scrolls.
Negative,Just pay money idiot
Negative,"There are a lot of things to love, but the business side is too ugly to ignore.  There are quality of life issues (item storage) that would be worth suffering through.. except it's insultingly clear that the pain point is intentional and goes away for a monthly fee. Boo.Edit: Bethesda definitely understands this issue, proven by the canned response about their ""Crown store philosophy"" from the department of cash-grabbery."
Negative,"I loved all other Elder Scrolls games I have played, Olivion and Skyrim. I also enjoyed Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2, so I figured that ESO would be a natural fit. I was wrong.This game is just so.....bland. The combat is so mind numbingly boring that is almost put me to sleep after coming home from work and playing. The combat is more like WoW than any other Elder Scrolls games.I had to go look up a getting started guide on youtube to find out how to start the main story. What kind of game design is that??? Shouldn't you lead players to it? Shouldn't they WANT to go to it? I had heard that the quests were unique and interesting, but I didn't get any. I just talked to one NPC after another, and sometimes had to fight my way through a dungeon or something. Nothing to write home about. There are no unique items. They are all direct increases or decreases to characters stats. Nothing interesting or cool.I didn't get far enough to do big raids or large group dungeons or whatever. Might get better after that. I also wish I had a cool groups of friends to play with, but since I am a 30 year old father, I can't really set aside time for this. I just play when I can.Don't let your loyalty to the Elder Scrolls series cloud your judgement, this is definitely a pass at any price. If you enjoy games like WoW, you may enjoy it, but I played for about 10 hours and didn't really have any fun at all."
Negative,"The game is good to play, but loading screen is infinite. In addition, there is no Asia server, at least there are Asian countries."
Negative,left game on overnight to try to load but the app wasn't responding
Negative,"Got it, gave it a shot, not for me...I'll wait for TES VI."
Negative,Unable to use free event login always errors out.
Negative,I'd rather buy WinRAR
Negative,"Be sure to stay away from this one. Devs release a patch that causes the game to CTD with no workarounds. The support thread, found here: https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/620800/indicates an update on 11/14/2022, two weeks after the patch is released to fix the CTD issue. Maybe.So glad I subbed for a month so I couldn't play.Trash."
Negative,"Only reason I dont recommend the game is because it's not like any other Elder Scrolls game. If you like WoW or any mobile game like... idk RAID SHADOW LEGENDS. You might like this game, I for one, didn't particularly like it. But that's just because I dont like online games like this. It was very grindy and a money pit if you let it. Would rather play Skyrim or Oblivion again, or maybe, hopefully ElderScrolls IV before I die. I'm rooting for you Todd, please make ES IV live up to all the remasters of Skyrim."
Negative,"This game is ridiculous, all u got to do just grinding & repetition, for example if u have done some Skill Lines on ur current character ur effort wont include the others which means u have to repeat all ur work again on each one or simply.. u could pay a fine amount of money, and that would cost u around 30$ only for a Skill Line so if u intending to buy two that’ll cost u easily a new game price.."
Negative,"The login screen thinks my gmail address which is simply my name @gmail.com is in an ""invalid format"" which is bizarre.  Same email I've used for over 30 years, and saying it's an invalid format is just kookoo. Searching online found very poor support for this problem that many other people have had, for YEARS. I tried everything, including logging into my Bethesda account etc. All attempts to link this incredibly stupid login system to Steam failed saying my password was incorrect. But I've been using the same passwords for years and they work fine. Total BS incompetence. If there is a simple fix for this, message me. All attempts to get help from customer service failed, as has been also reported for YEARS by many people."
Negative,got ban for trading gold for crown item that in game item that should not get me ban what 220h just gone sad
Negative,Error 334 for the win.
Negative,"BUYER BEWARE If you have a 3080TIE I launched this game and my gpu was put in overdrive and each time i launched this game it caused my gpu fans to spin really fast and caused my computer shut off each time ( to protect my computer I believe) I can play every other game cyberpunk, the witcher, gta ect on steam except for this game. There is no fix to my issue on the support site and I believe it is the game causing this as every other one of my games runs fine.. The game does not limit your frame rate in game despite your refresh rate and gives you no option before loading the game I saw over 1000 FPS so I am guessing it over works your gpu causing your computer to shut down ( I also heard my temp monitoring alarms going off before shutting off) note i played halo infinite for 3 hours afterwards with no issues after crashing 4 times on this game in a row ) IF anyone else encountered this issue and have a fix I would gladly buy the game again as i refunded it!"
Negative,"Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the game. The reason I do not recommend it is the follwoing: Recent updates have been incredibly buggy, leaving core mechanics of the game broken for days or weeks. It contains many cash-grab tactics and most cosmetics are obtained through in-game shop or loots boxes. The loot box system sucks as you need to ""luck"" out to get many things you might want. For this reason, doing quests and content does not feel as rewarding as almost all the cool stuff is actually bought and not obtained through playing.However, if you don't care about these things and enjoy the Elder Scrolls universe and MMORPG's, go for it."
Negative,"It's like a bad Bratwurst. It's not fun, but at least you have Bratwurst."
Negative,"HORRIBLE loading time, update time, apply patch time , repair time.just waiting to play till you decide to not playing.."
Negative,"Was good until  they decided to forget that people still use other versions of windows.Lucky are those who didn't have to update to windows 10 and can still run the game.The ""Gameplay"" right now involves staring at the Launcher Loading screen and ""Troubleshoot Simulator"".Seriously? AAA company and can't do a quick-fix for a chunk of their players? Was going to renew my subscription for ESO+ but I won't spend more on a game that has minimal support."
Negative,"Was going to write a long detailed post but, all you need to know is I was eso player since launch(before steam), until later-greymoor.After truly experiencing every single content game has to offer from entire PvE  to  PvPHere are key points you need to know:> Every year, new chapter(expansion) had less and less ''content'' if you can even call grinding content> Crown-store(real money) has very disgusting business model, literally trying to scam new players into buying items/services that you can reach for free under 2 minute.> Even on the cosmetic side of crown-store, quality of armors/costumes are so low especially when compared to almost any MMOAlso you can not even dye your costumes that you pay real money to if you are not paying real money every month on top of that (Subscription)> Cyrodiil(Open world PVP) being unplayable for years (Imagine blinking, but your eye closes after 8 second) and this isn't even exaggeration, this game lowers your standarts as I was happy with my 3-4 second delays in the past, only to be bothered a bit when it got to 8 sec, and only felt totally wrong after playing a proper MMO such as ff14 and gw2, I did not have anyone to show me these working games to compare to ESO, you are lucky so make use of this info> Open World, simply empty with typical errant quests, and this would be okay if the game had any sort of dynamic events (For example FF14 Fates and GW2 Meta Events), there is no incentive to return to ESO maps thus they remain dead> Trials(Raid) With exception of 3 Trial, rest is simply shutting your brain off and parsing on a dummy, if this is the kind of pve combat you expect, can suggest the game otherwise, there are other mechanical heavy games that what you do actually matters.> Combat, wonky and clunky. Game assumes to have no cooldown even though there is 1 sec of global cooldown in every skill. Some open world npcs even have better looking skills with more effects than some classes but lets ignore visuals are lackluster, the skills are simply basic. If  you play as any stamina character this is not a problem, but base magic classes feel like novice in training even at max level.> Story of expansions are copy paste from previous expansions where you can drop your expectation of an interesting story. Game became a nostalgia sale for those who enjoyed from skyrim to oblivion. You can check the content of new dlc/expansions in detail to see this for yourselfAgain, all these issues could be felt in past anyway, but every year it has gotten worse (to a point they had to do beta reworks on live cyrodiil server) and not just techinal side but also content wise. As a fan of the Elder Scrolls games of the past, I wanted this game to succeed, success in terms of content they provide, cosmetics they offer, convinient services they can come up with (If they ever played their own game)But the only success ESO has is in its scammy business model and running on life support while draining wallet of people who think they are going to play skyrim onlineEso has truly become low-effort (If any in most cases) with horrible business model.If you value quality service and product, steer away from this cash grab"
Negative,"Good lore but the combat is pretty boring and the inventory managment system being a means of railroading people into the $14/month premium service really just takes away from the game as a whole, in my opinion if you want to have a good time without paying, either break the hording urge and only pick up stuff you will use or sell, or make a trip to the guild vendor every 5 minutes and sell everything"
Negative,"Just not my kind of game, I guess. Controls are weird. Buggy. Hard to navigate."
Negative,Launcher issue....would recommend but was unable to install game because once launcher was at 94% it quit on me like all of my exes
Negative,Easily one of the worst feeling combat systems I've ever experienced.
Negative,"It looks pretty bad, plays pretty bad, and compared with the other TES, a really bad story. If you come for the lore, better search it online, this is just a expensive mobile game."
Negative,This feels like WOW skinned with Skyrim with a shitty waypoint system.
Negative,"I have 1000s of hours on ESO across steam and  the normal site.I always end up leaving, game is so unbalanced as always and no auction house forcing the use of 3rd party apps to sell your wares on top of having to join a trade guild.Decent storylines if you just pick it up to play through main quests of the base game and expansions."
Negative,"Being an MMO, the review is as good as the last patch out. [Markath] Which Incidentally has just made the game into a torrid mess of crashes. The game is being increasingly moving to a cosmetic only approach and tales spun in 2020 chapters/DLC are at best worthy of a 2nd grader. At this stage, cant recommend. Easier to buy a talking catWith the devs short on ideas on how to stop power creep & restart Level progression - it is all aboutLoved the Summerset and to an extent, Elsywr chapters. Cyrodil (PvP) is very nice and unique when it works. For unbridled toxicity and if you are short on stress in life, there is always Imperial City PvPvE"

Negative,"I feel bad for the people who have slid down the horrific DLC cash hole this game seems to revolve around. There's plenty of content to enjoy without, so don't feel like you're missing out if you don't buy any. It's just Bethesda playing the corporate game and preying on the psychology of their players. C'est la vie."
Negative,"The game's first and foremost issue is the developer's lack of interest in truly repairing the game in its current broken state.  Since mid 2019 it's been obvious that ZOS has been decreasing the amount of money invested into servers..  From their latest patches it's clear they'd rather ruin the only market beating aspect of the game, being the combat, than spend the money to prevent performance issues.  Toss in your choice of bugs, lag and crashes and you've got yourself ESO."
Negative,"Create a problem, Sell the solution."
Negative,Could barely stomach any of it. Uninspired shite designed to fool nerds into a vicarious life. Unpolished and ugly. No immersion whatsoever. Do not buy this time wasting vacuum.
Negative,"Can't recommend it in it's current state. Game breaking bugs & constant crashes are the norm now since the Markarth DLC release. They still haven't fixed it, and likely will not for a few months at minimum. The in game currency store, 'Crown Store' that sell mostly cosmetics for $$$ (you also get crowns with ESO+ sub) went down on Markarth DLC release. It was back up within 24 hours while the rest of the game is still plagued by bugs, constant crashes. That should show you everything you need to know about ZOS right now. Wait until MSFT takes charge before jumping in."
Negative,"While I've enjoyed the game thus far, I have had some major issues with the game wanting me to repurchase it. Bethesda support has been the least helpful support I've ever found. They simply told me that I didn't own the game and that my email was not connected to the game, even though I was in the private beta back in the day.I won't be continuing to play after an issue I had with in-game and real life currencies magically 'disappearing'.Edit: I've been in contact with the Bethesda support still and it's honestly a joke how they handle this game. It seems like it's just a cash grab at this point that's merely focusing on creating micro transactions. Sad."
Negative,"Game has ping issues so badly, Fps drops on a 1080ti and i7700k down to 40fps in harrowstorms,dungeons even on 1080p. Quests are boring just go here kill this come back or go here grab this come back. I am level 9 and I feel like i have experienced everything the game has to offer, until they fix the terrible lag and fps drops I cannot stress enough this isn't worth 60 dollars, Maybe 20 because the devs suck at game development it's like all the good devs are gonew and now it's just crap devs working on the game, they shouldn't be making expansions when they haven't even optimized their game and the game was getting so many negative reviews they went and asked steam to change that, must have because it had mixed reviews 2 days ago at 42% and was on it's way to be being mostly negative."
Negative,Reasons why the game is bad: The tutorial is very boring and keeps spoon-feeding you everything.The tutorial story is shit.Combat mechanics suck.PVP sucks (everyone has like 100000 hp at low levels and you basically deal no damage)The inventory/character UI is annoying and bloated.Thy game-sounds hath more holes than my mothers swiss-cheese (it sucks).Bad animations. Reasons why the game is good: The game runs well with proton 5.0-5 on Linux. Conclusion:   sudo rm -r ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Zenimax\ Online/
Negative,"Lack of Oceanic ""megaserver"" support because they think we'll be sad that the game will feel less populated.Sounds like a design issue rather than a regional server issue.Avoid if you dislike getting 300ms+ in online games.Update 2022: Game is still unplayable from Australia.https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/comment/7191536/#Comment_7191536"
Negative,"yes I only have six hours but its just another run around collect shit until you grow a beard type of gamethe gameplay is lame as f, spam skills on champs that need 400 to die but dont pose any challenge, just consume time"
Negative,"Posted: Mar 5, 2020 @ 10:20amSadly, ZENIMAX runs customer service and in-game moderation for this game. They've let people get their real lives threatened and even people be doxxed without doing anything. this is some scary and horrible stuff.gameplay is always changing too because of the amount of glitches that get added with every patch.for the story though? this game is fantastic. really amazing."
Negative,I should have bought Winrar instead of this crap.
Negative,game puts shiny boy infront of mei cant open it without buying a dlc
Negative,This game fucccccccking sucks.
Negative,its a great game but DO NOT BUY THROUGH STEAM!!!!!!!Its an absolute disaster regarding login issues for 10+ hours at a time every other day......it works fine if you buy it from the ESO website.
Negative,Fix the login problem that is plaging this game in the recent weeks.
Negative,Fun until it stopped working....(for everyone) worst support and communication on any game I've ever played
Negative,"Their update launcher is RIDICULOUS STILL nearing 2020. Gave this a few good trys since the game launched years ago, and each time it has taken almost a day or more for the games launcher to update. (not download the game, TO UPDATE) When you finally can play the game, while theres  a lot that makes you want to like the game and keep trying its just simply boring in almost every aspect. I hate the term "" Microtransactions"" because that implies 2-$6. But their ""microtransactions"" are so egregious. Then the fact they dare charge so much for ESO Plus...top dollar for this garbage heap? WTF/E"
Negative,This game has been out long enough that the myriad of bugs should be worked out already. It's far too easy to get stuck between environmental object and sometimes you can get stuck in a wall that's impossible to get out of. Then when you go to submit a support ticket the system locks you out of your account for no good reason. Also PvP is a joke.
Negative,"I wanted to like this game. I honestly, really wanted to. But after more than a thousand hours in Skyrim (both in Xbox360 and PC), I can't help feeling utterly disappointed.When I started playing TESO, I was expecting a cool combat system, or at least the simple, yet entertaining system seen in Skyrim. Instead, I got a system that seems to be simply based on running around your opponent so he can't hit you once, while mashing buttons like crazy to attack. The telegraphing here is so pathetically exaggerated, it becomes a ""I'm gonna attack you! Oh someday I will! You better get ready!"" moment, where you see your enemies become practically statues as they charge their attacks. During this time, you can simply take a step back or to the side and... that's it. Done. You know there's something wrong if they can't lay a single hit on you in 2 whole hours of gameplay.The other BIG issue with this game is the UI. I hate comparing games when doing reviews, but Skyrim had this unobtrusive HUD that gave you all the information you needed without getting in the way, as well as simple, intuitive menus where you could easily find whatever you were looking for. Here... Oh god. Am I looting this body? What... what's it giving me? Oh, there it is... Is it? The UI is so poorly designed, the focus of attention is NEVER where it should be, making it horrifyingly confusing.I'm afraid I'll have to request a refund for this game. Maybe I could eventually get used to the super easy, repetitive combat system, and playing with friends is fun I'm sure, but the UI is so annoying it just drives me out of the experience instantly. Back to Skyrim I go, at least until TESVI comes out."
Negative,"""tested"" during free weekend, unable to login whatever setting/reinstal/blood sacrifice I tried.Game maybe looks nice but its impossible to log in."
Negative,Feels like a generic MMO with an Elder Scrolls' skin thrown on top.
Negative,"Honestly, the only thing I liked about the whole game were the beautifully designed worlds or running around and opening chests of all kinds of difficulty.The fights feel very boring, you mostly just dodge and spam your few skills, that's it. Not like in other MMORPGS where you have 30-40 skills in a skill bar and a proper skill rotation.The in-game progress is very slow and you rarely see any progress. Going through the dungeons is very tedious, many people run around here with high-level friends and let them drag them through.Important things like a minimap can only be installed later by installing mods, overall it plays too slowly and you quickly lose the desire to continue."
Negative,"The first review I did on The Elder Scrolls: Online (ESO) was done after an hour of play.  Quite frankly, I wasn’t really impressed.  I didn’t find anything to draw me into the story or the world.  There was nothing to hold my interest, so to speak.  Yes, it’s based on the lore of the Elder Scroll series and for some that might be enough.  For me, I needed more.  I left the game after an hour, as mentioned, and proceeded to check out the ESO website.  There I found the Crown store, and immediately I felt this game was just another pay-to-win money sinkhole.After writing my first review I received a bit of flack from dedicated players.  I expected that, as I do with every negative review I post.  It’s just something that reviewers have to deal with.  No matter how bad a game is you’ll always have a fan or two standing behind it, ready to make reviewers lives difficult.  That said, I found that one was willing to discuss things as an adult instead of jumping directly to insults.  A few things were cleared up and, while my initial review WAS perfectly valid, I felt I should give the game another try.Here I am, now 8 hours into the game.  Certainly long enough that my play time can’t be considered objectionable anymore.  So what’s changed?  Well, a few things, but some of you “fans” who like to critique negative reviews still might be disappointed.First off, I want to say that the game still hasn’t really grabbed my attention.  I’ve done many quests to help people out but there doesn’t seem to be anything that’s really giving me a purpose.  I’m still on what players consider to be the “noob island”, so I’m still hopeful that in the future I’ll find that purpose I’m looking for.  For right now it just seems like a bunch of random missions to help out people I really don’t know.  This isn’t much different from a lot of MMO’s out there, but I expected a bit more from a company that brought us Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind, and the world of Fallout.  Perhaps that’s my own fault.  Going in with preconceived notions of what I expected from this game, setting the bar too high.  Now that my refund period has elapsed I’m more willing to continue on and see if a story unfolds, but only because I’m now stuck with my purchase.  Fingers crossed…I’ve warmed up a little to the character development in the game.  While I admit that I still have yet to see all of the character skill training, I like the way it’s done.  It’s simple and makes it fairly easy to customize your character the way YOU want it to be.  You can have a heavy-armor wearing, double-handed axe wielding, lightning mage that tanks in combat… And I love that!  A true RPG shouldn’t have any boundaries.  Star Wars Galaxies started out this way, but then they ruined it.  Let’s hope ESO never has their version of a “New Game Experience” update because right now their character development system seems perfect.I’m also warming up to the immersion of the game.  Every conversation is voice-acted, which I really enjoy.  This isn’t the first MMO to do that but it’s extremely beneficial in an RPG atmosphere so I’m glad they did.  The missions, while they don’t currently seem to be a part of a larger story, are all well outlined and well explained.  You know what you need to do, why you need to do it (to gain XP!) and where you need to go to get it done.  Some even have points of humor to lighten the mood and keep you from being bored.  While I wish the larger story would reveal itself, these small quests do keep you busy and allow you to explore the world while giving you an excuse to do it.As far as the Crown Store goes, I still have my skepticism.  I’ve been told that a lot of the things in the store CAN be purchased in-game, but the store sure would give a short-cut to anyone who can afford it.  Subscriptions, as well, give players points to spend in said Crown Store, give bonuses to XP gain, as well as access to an unlimited bag of holding for crafting items.  It’s certainly not a “Pay To Win” scheme, but paying money to ESO does make the game easier than if you were to just play for free.  That’s a fact that’s absolutely undeniable.So, what’s my verdict after 8 hours of playing?  Well… It’s certainly not the best massive multiplayer game that I’ve ever played but it does have good points, as well as bad.  If I were to give it a numerical rating I’d probably sit it at about a 6/10, but you can’t give that kind of rating on Steam.  Sorry to say, I’m still not ready to give it that thumbs up recommendation.  If you’re just looking for a free MMO to play there are certainly others that are freer and do just as well keeping the pay-to-win scheme out.  Even if you’re looking for a purchase, then free to play, MMO there’s still others that handle their story introductions better.  If you’re still curious about this game then go ahead and make the purchase.  If you don’t set your expectations too high, and keep an open mind, you might enjoy this title.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more no-nonsense reviews check out my curator page at;https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45052020/"
Negative,"+6000 saat sonra oyunu bırakınca incelememi güncelleme gereği duydum:   Otistik bir bireysiniz ve MMORPG oyun oynayarak PvP mi yapmak istiyorsunuz?7 yıllık süreçte özellikle son birkaç yıldır gelen her güncellemeyle beraber Zenimax Online Studios (a.k.a. ZOS) sunucular lagdan geçilmiyorken ya da rekabetçi PvP içeriği hiç olmayıp Normal PvP içeriğinin de az olmasına rağmen bunlara odaklanmayıp tam tersine; organize, az çok da olsa yetenek, düşünme gücü ve bilgi gerektiren PvP'yi ortadan kaldırarak siz ''Casual'' otistik bireylerin de MMORPG oyunda PvP yaparak zevk alabilmesi için oyunu bu duruma kadar getirdi.

Negative,Imagine still playing this piece of shit when classic WoW launches OMEGALUL
Negative,"game is good, if you can look past them locking content in dlcs and subscription plans, which in the case of the resource bag(forget the name, havent played in a while for the precise reason im about to explain), you can litterally store unlimited skill related items if you pay monthly. otherwise it all gets dumped in your normal inventory. this single thing has kept me from ever coming back to the game despite enjoying the game itself. greed kills far too many games, save yourself the money ahead of time. buy this maybe if its 75% off, and dont get suckered into buying anything else for the game."
Negative,"I just wrote a positive review a couple days back, but after playing the game for an extended period of time... yep it's basically an MMO. It's super fun at first but every character I hit a roadblock at level 10-20 where it becomes monotonous. You can hardly call it an Elder Scrolls game, other than the universe it's set in (which has no correlation to any of the games). Combat is... okay. But honestly throughout my few day endeavor I was avoiding most enemies. Most enemies are such damage sponges that it's not really an issue to even fight them.Thing is the main story and side quests just aren't fun to me. I can't exactly pinpoint why. I ended up just doing daily crafting quests and calling it there for a day my last few quests. Which of course, hunting for the same item, then crafting it at some remote crafting station, then shuffling around town to deposit it, was just very boring after a while. And all I would get is some materials (mostly so I could do it again tomorrow) and a daily allowance of like 300g, which is abysmal and comes my first big problem with the game. Solo money is horrible, especially when high end houses and things are in the millions. In about a week of playing I went from like 1k to 7k. Holy shit. Thank you Elder Scrolls Online, now I can buy a singular item and be poor again. And this was after pretty religious playing for a week, most of which was habitual. Of course there are trading guilds, but I applied to multiple and was either ignored or just rejected. Cool. So I have to farm money solo since none of my friends actually like this game. You can tell after a few days this really burnt me out. Boring quests (even mainline ES games including Skyrim had some fun quests/side content) and everything being so far away. Then with the anniversary event I was like ""cool free stuff"" before I realized to get anything worthwhile I'd have to grind daily and just blow all of my event tickets on one thing, and it was literally impossible to get everything in this event (I did the math), so just pray to Zenimax for a rerelease of items.And of course the worst part is the monetization. At the moment ESO isn't free to play, so there is no excuse for this. The price per what you get is abysmal. I would never pay this much but approximately based on the prices I've seen in game and some outside resources, a house that is just a giant unfurnished box can cost like $80 real life. It's criminal. And I've seen modded Skyrim houses or even official Oblivion houses look way better and aren't $80. The ESO+ sub is pretty criminal for crafters too, as a casual not necessary but if you're playing serious, go grab your credit card and just keep it at your desk. Zenimax expects you to basically be buying $20 mounts frequently, especially since stock changes (gotta milk that FOMO). You can earn select paid items for free (emphasis on select) for an in game earnable currency... except drop rates of this are abysmal and are time limited. And prices are so high that it can be literal irl months or years before you get your wanted item... besides by then stock will change. And of course loot boxes, don't spend money on loot boxes in any game, they are scams using casino techniques to get you to pay large amounts of money for virtually nothing. And of course all of these use a trillion digital currencies to add more steps to buying the item so you think less and buy more. This is a common tactic, put items in a custom virtual currency so you have to do more mental gymnastics to view the actual price, and make sure the ways to buy the currency are above or below the items so you spend more for less. It's criminal, ESPECIALLY in a paid video game. Video games are supposed to be fun time wasters, I have a life outside of Steam and a computer, I don't want to dedicate my life so I can get pointless cosmetics for free. And I have dozens of games in my library, not like I only have to play ESO.It just saddens me as an ES fan, this is the best we got other than going to older games that are getting more dated or praying to the gods for something Elder Scrolls 6 related. I still check in from time to time because unless I want to replay Morrowind, Oblivion, or Skyrim again for the billionth time I can try to stomach through more of the story in ESO."
Negative,"Dont Buy this game,first at all the game stuck at hero select and then kicked you out to the main screen,then ESO customer  support will not attend you and the shit of steam will not refund you for a game did not want to function properly only because i have a few hours more than max cap for refunding limit hour,i shit in all personal steam's stuff"
Negative,"Too many pay to win or pay for quality of life aspects in this game.  For a paid product, I don't want have such content that can't be acquired by normal playing.  A shame."
Negative,je to picovina jak voda v kosi
Negative,I have never been so bored in my entire life holy shit.
Negative,"99% of the game is made for kids because it's super easy and without any sort of challenge at all a game is boring and simply not worth playing. A shame considering how much I like Elder Scrolls games. Needs a difficulty slider or World tiers. Before the ""One Tamriel"" update, the game was much better. Can't recommend to anyone seeking even the slightest of challenge."
Negative,"I've been playing Elder Scrolls games for a long time.  I never thought I'd see an Elder Scrolls game that didn't impress me with its creativity.  Until now.  As with virtually every MMO since its release, this game copies World of Warcraft in far too many basic and fundamental ways.  If you like the embarassing joke that the MMO landscape has devolved into since WoW poisoned the proverbial well, you'll just love ESO."
Negative,"Thought it would be cool to have an ES title on mac, boy was I wrong. This game is terrible. It's exactly like every other MMO, doesn't feel like any other ES game, and the controls are anything but smooth. The combat is also very boring and super button mashy. If you like the general run of the mill MMO games then you may enjoy this, but I do not. If you are looking for something new in the ES universe and came from titles like Skyrim, Oblivion, and Morrowind, you are better off just going back to modding to get a fresh experience. Overall just unoriginal and bland. If you have a group of friends that all play this there may be some more merit to it, but it's an absolute disaster compared to almost any other Bethesda title."
Negative,"Literally the only good thing about this game is landscapes and some quests. Thankfully you don't have to pay for traveling and completing them. Quests, albeit somewhat interesting, are all linear quite a bit.Cons: you are urged to pay for everything else. From weird-looking pets to an opportunity to change your appearance you are urged to pay in the most blatant ways possible. Aside of that you have promotials once you launch the game, once you enter almost any menu, once you want to get out of the game and once in a while just in the middle of nowhere. They are so numerous it feels disgusting to use any menu, even promotions one.Ultimately, it might be worthy to buy it with some 75-80% discount just to see the landscapes and artistic style, and that's it."
Negative,"So much paywall! Oh man, this game... You have to pay for the ESO plus membership if you want to have access to all the DLC. Werewolf and Vampire skill trees behind a paywall. EVERYTHING is behind a paywall and behind the damn monthly fee. See, If I am going to have to buy everything individually and need to ALSO pay a huge $14.99 a month fee just to have access to all the game, then why the hell do they charge for the game itself?! Bottom line, this game is just a money hole and literally no one who values their bank account should even consider this. I got mine from the Humble monthly bundle so I didn't actually intend to ever get this game.Now that I have gotten it, I actually do absolutely ADORE playing the living heck out of it. It is just enough to keep me sated till Bethesda sees fit to grace us with an Elder Scroll VI. It is a LOT of fun but unless you get this game for way less than $10 and have the self-control to NEVER pay for anything they want you to pay for I would still avoid it. Even considering how much enjoyment I get out of it, if I had the choice, I would have simply never gotten it. You would literally be spending hundreds of dollars to just get the actual game content and this doesn't include ANY pets, ANY armor sets, ANY of the houses, quite literally just gameplay areas. They even penalize you for not paying the exorbitant monthly fee by making all of your crafting, enchanting and alchemy supplies take up inventory space as well as take 10% of the experience away from you.Very little MM in this MMO. The chat window is so small I literally can't read it on a 65 inch TV 7 feet away from me. Unless you are in town the world is very sparsely populated with PCs and the insanely low number of skills you can slot at one time makes this a hard one to recommend to anyone but the most die-hard Elder Scrolls fans with money to burn.TL;DR WAY too damn expensive to do anything neat, just play Skyrim again. It's essentially that with a paywall for even much of the basic functionality of the game. At least there are enough quests to keep you busy for a while.Now I am going to go play some ESO while complaining heavily at their shenanigans while spending nothing in the crown store and NOT being an ESO Plus subscriber out of principal...EDIT 11/11/17 : Friend just told me you can get a vampire or werewolf player to bite you to unlock those without paying separately for them. My points still stand for sure but at least that is ONE gripe I have to retract. I know I can just pay the monthly for a short time and get the crowns required to make the DLC purchases. Still, it makes the game more than $60 before you add in the Morrowind expansion. WAY too rich for my blood.Neither of these are enough to change my mind overall but assuring my accuracy is a big deal for me with the reviews I write."
Negative,"i can't recommend this game for anyone new for this simple reason : you'll have to play for everything.i'll summarize what's happening in this game.  Each 6 months there's a new chapter out with overpowered sets ( a combination of items usually 5 you wear) and sometimes classes. these chapters cost around 30euros if am not mistaken. if you dont buy the chapter and farm the sets you'll be left behind ( i'll explain why later). the subscription: the only useful thing in the subscription is the crafting bag, you get an infinite space for crafting items. plus you get some crowns you can gamble with in the in game store, and more bank space if am not mistaken. PVP: at first i enjoyed pvp, spend many hours in pvp; but after some time you'll find the pvp hollow. you log in, you find all the keeps taken by one faction. you try to fight your way in for few hours until the ball groups log in. so what's a ball group ? they are guilds that CREATE lag in the game. they use some skills, that combined toghether will create huge lag in the server due to calculations. and there's nothing you can do about it. they said they'll improve lag for year, ran some tests, changed hardware, but the lag is still there. i remember it was almost turn based game, you look at your opponent and your skill triggers after 4 to 5 seconds. other than then lag, there's no point in pvp, it's a waste of time, and the game creators don't care about pvp. PVE: with each chapter come new dungeons ( 4 players content) and trials ( 12 players content). there's normal difficulty and veteran. if you're after veteran content, you'll need to find guilds, in game on by recommendations of other players. to be part of a veteran trial, you'll need the latest gear, in other words you need to buy every new chapter and farm the sets or you'll be left behind. i've been part of many guilds and except 1 or 2, the rest is filled with toxic behaviour. Questing: i didn't play quests to be honest but there's tons of it, without a propose  for meTL;DR i dont recommend this game because you'll pay too much money for frustration."
Negative,"Hey it's sunday. Maybe play some eso? Zenimax: Ha you peasant, you pay for our service and think you can actually use is?This is why we can't have nice things. Thanks EA, thanks Ubisoft, thanks Activision. Thank you for having all the billions and giving your customers the middle finger... Thanks"
Negative,"there is a lot of pay walls in this game.. yup, if you want storage then you gotta pay. i would not suggest a pay wall game when you already pay for the game. im not the only one that hates games like this."
Negative,"I really, REALLY wanted this game to be good.The only way to level up is questing (which takes unbelievably long), you can't play with your friends unless they are part of the same race basically, and you can only have about 5 skills at a time.Long story short: This game was a dissapointment"
Negative,"feels actually horrible to play compared to the other games tbhofc the extra payment stuff makes it bad too but i didn't even enjoy it outside of that soeverything just felt really clunky and weirdshame, really, the concept itself is really good it just doesn't feel like it was done very welltoo bad i can't refund it"
Negative,"It has to be one of the most boring rpg's on the market. The combat is stale, tanks and healers need big strong dps classes to walk you through basic campaign quests because tanks and healers don't even do enough damage to get through (especially late-game) missions and bosses. You just stall them. Also the whole schtick to the game is crafting, and you have to pay for a crafting bag or be constantly overencumbered. Just go play wow, its more fluid and flushed out. At least you get what you pay for over there."
Negative,"Well after 2 days of downloading everything i get the error 6 a launcher problem it seems. Tried reinstalling nothing tried running a repair and it simply redowloaded the whole thing again.Pointless as error 6 was still here. All in all almost a week worth of time wasted on downlaoding over and over and it won't even start. Tried many ""solutions"" i found online but nothing worked, time and money well spent i must say!From what i gathered i understand there may be a problem by installing the game with steam but if that was the case, as i saw many having this same problem, the game should have been pulled from steam as soon as problems started since it also seems there's either no interest in fixing this or there is no way at all.I did try as much as i could to make it work but as i am out of ideas i'm also out of patience, it shouldn't be this hard to install a game, in the few cases i found myself in trouble with other games in the past it always got resolved.This however, in all honesty, is just ridiculous.It doesn't really matter to me if i can play it or not at this point i'm just sad for all those who will eventually fall in this ""steam trap"" and waste both money and time on something that they won't be able to play at all.I also won't even try from their site since it seems it doesn't recognize i bought the game on steam and there is no way i'm going to buy it all over again when i don't even know if it will work this time.I suggest to any who reads this DO NOT BUY FROM STEAM, Just buy it from their main site, and if that doesn't work either, well just give up on it's not worth getting stressed out on a game."
Negative,"-----Updated-----For anyone who are going to install this game, make sure to apply this hotfix from Nvidia that i got from Nasi_Kucing and Avenging_Martyr. Big thanks and kudos to them.http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4378/~/geforce-hot-fix-driver-version-378.57This hotfix will repair your nvidia that somehow broke the Java in the TESO launcher, hindering it to launch.But why I put this as a negative review?Because this was a big turnoff for this game. it goes silent a long time, but as the game get discounted and many people are playing, the issues grows bigger and the solution is only popular hours ago.I really wish any new user wont have to struggle with this kind of errors, and if you are going to buy this, get your Google ready.------Previously-------Please can anybody help, I somehow cannot install this game even after ive downlpad it fully, and mu pc specs is high end. The installer somehow wont run after th java run.  I tried to install it with bethesda launcher but now steam wont link to the game and i dont have the account to play. Why i put this on the review? Because ive never been this frustrated with any game before, and this is a great turn off."
Negative,"the game was really uneventful and boring, the map was too large and too barren, also there was a general lack of focus on where i was supposed to go. Overall 2/10 experience but a cool idea if executed correctly."
Negative,"well, finishing out my prepaid sub to this game my opinion doesn't change. they still mis-manage their server work. for instance they took down the servers for work the last day of the holiday event currently going on. this is poor management of the game to me. glad i cancelled my sub and will be going over to something else that isn't a train wreck of game management.this has to be the worst run mmorpg. each time the game is even minutely patched, many issues arise and lost playing time (bad if you actually pay for an eso plus membership) accrues.cant recommend this title and when my eso plus account is up, def wont renew."
Negative,"As of late recent patch, it made unplayable, i had been updating my vid card several times, uninstalling, then reinstalling plus updating that takes 30 hours, and again another 30 hours within 3-4 days, both terrible patches back to back. they made some files dissappear from USER files. i can not find after i used search."
Negative,"Zenimax changed the intro.New characters no longer start in Coldharbour.  They instead start with the expansion content.  This is problematic if you want to play pre-expansion content as an existing character alongside a new player, who will start in Morrowind/Summerset with no idea what the hell you are talking about.I am baffled as to why Zenimax made this change."
Negative,beyond fucking lame
Negative,who plays this garbage? who plays this garbage?
Negative,downloaded the game  installed and then  everytime i start it  it freezes on launcher as loading.  Did  check the  intergrity of the files  and still same problem.  I meet the  hardware requirements  and still doesnt run
Negative,Game launcher made by literal clowns.
Negative,"Can no longer play on my MAC, what a waste !!"
Negative,this is just not a fun experience
Negative,"This game USED to work on M1 Macs, but doesn't anymore due to a recent software update."
Negative,"there is no Asian server even this game was been quite long time around,i hit 200 ping on NA server and EU was 170 ping... not so nice experience for playing online gameand i get kick from the game cuz the ping get to high over the limit, come on i like skyrim but this was suckadd server for asian region"
Negative,"It's a bit boring. The main quests are fine, but the side quests are boring. The voice acting sounds so slow, like there is no passion at all, no danger, no fear, nothing. Everyone sounds like a commercial actor.The environments are kinda repetitive as well, they look good at first but as hours pass it gets tiring looking at the same environment all the time.Combat is good, animations are great, but this game is an MMORPG, meaning you will be seeing the same animations 4-5 times for every enemy you ve got to kill.  Gets boring fast.I played 83 hours waiting till it gets better, but it didn't get better. I had much more fun playing Secret World Legends."
Negative,"When i bought this game a while ago, started up just fine, no issues.Now, after re-installing it and spending around 5 hours troubleshooting, looking online, and trying out every single thing i could manage to find, it continues to refuse to load past the launcher.pressing 'play' and that's it, the game itself never actually loads.So no, don't recommend, why buy It If you can't even play it.(UPDATE) Nothing is still working, All Zenimax could do was tell me to try a list of bug fixes all of which i had already done, spending 2 more hours troubleshooting was wasted and again the only thing i have not done is straight up re-buying the game on the Bethesda store, something i don't want to do because i already bought it here, No reason i need to buy it again and no reason it shouldn't work."
Negative,terrible. customer service team is awful. they have no idea what they are doing or how to monitor the safety and rules of the game. they lack intelligence of their own game and reasoning behind things.
Negative,"I bought the game, now they want more money to unlock stuff, like inventory space..."
Negative,I must say it is hands down worst MMO that i have spent my money on.
Negative,"If youre not gonna get ESO+, dont even bother picking up the title. you are doomed to have a miserable time.I beta-tested the game and it abysmal back then. I didnt touch it again until a few months ago and i gave it a whirl. Its not terrible, but the whole grinding mechanic to attempt to level is very monotonous and boring and extremely unintuitive. I just cant bring myself to recommend this title, were it not for the Elder Scrolls title, im fairly certain this wouldve burned out a long time ago."
Negative,"Gave this a try on a free weekend. Very disappointing. This game plays, looks and feels like it's 10 years old and is made for kids/new gamers. I love The Elder Scrolls games in general but can't recommend this one."
Negative,"The game has potential but needs a huge improvements.It's good lore and exploration.It's terrible at animations, which is a red flag not to play it. This alone put me off, after playing thousands of hours of games like Guild Wars 2 and Black Desert, i just can't stand how bad the animations in this game are.There's mobile games with better character animations."
Negative,"While there are some redeeming features in this game including evergreen systems, great voice acting, alt-friendliness, and story there are some glaring issues that would stop me from coming back.  These issues are namely - combat, gamefeel, lacking endgame, and economy.The combat is really strange. DoT-centric gameplay and juggling of those DoTs are king in this game. Many of the class abilities cover incoming damage boss telegraphing. Movement and interrupting feels clunky, floaty, and unintuitive. To top it all off the majority of the classes feel too similar there are mag and stam builds with few exceptions.  The endgame is really lacking and simplistic when compared to other MMOs. The economy system is a complex disaster with auctioneers with SEPARATE listings are scattered across the world bid on and controlled by player guilds."
Negative,"And I thought destiny 2 was a slog fest to get through, I feel disappointed and angry I went from completing skyrim (the absolute masterpiece of a game) and expecting the same from this game. I went from fighting dragons with spoons and my manly ass voice to doing basic ass fetch quests for 50 hours. No thanks I rather masturbate."
Negative,"Pretty cool game, mostly good lore additions, but it's always ""buy, buy, buy""Of course I'll keep playing and sometimes I'll crack and get a sub for the craft bag (to use my inventory again) and the ability to decorate my home, but is it too much to ask for some earnable rewards in game ?The first expansions had nice cosmetics that you could get by playing, now it's nearly always crown store exclusive."
Negative,"I normally do not give reviews, but for this game I decided to voice my opinion.  By decision to give this a ""thumbs down"" is based on the rule of Goods vs. Bads.  There are alot of both, but I feel the bads outweight the goods.  I am not going to ellaborate on most of my criteria, but out of all the Bads here is a short list of my Top Issues.- No Public Marketplace such as a Auction House.  You either have to be in a Trading Guild (see below) or just stand around shouting what you are selling.  - Must be a ESO subscriber to obtain and store items into a Crafting bag.  Unless you are just selling your extra crafting items to a vendor or in a trade guild where your items will sell quickly then you are probably going to have some inventory management issues.  I cancelled my ESO just to see how bad it would be and I was dead on.  Spent 2 days just vendoring items from my bank to keep up for my crafting leveling.- Tanking.  I have 2 characters that are tanks and really dislike playing both (DK worst than Templar).  Between no AoE Taunt in this game and the other weird dungeon/group mechanics.  Here one, if you hit a target in a group the other target can aggro to anyone in the group for at least 6 secs unless you taunt them or you hit them yourself and the group member does not.   Dont get me started on how bad most groups are in Public Groups (PUGS).  By the way, I firmly suspect these topics are some major reason there is a severe lack of tanks in the dungeon queues.-Interface.  This game seems to be designed around gaming console interface.  You have to switch your action bars between skills/weapons.  Thats right you need to have 2 setup of weapons.  If you tank then this typically means 2xswords and 2xshields. I could keep going but I believe this is enough for me."
Negative,"Pay to have the privilege of subscribing to ESO plus, honestly the base game is Free to play territory cant believe they charge for it."
Negative,it hase more in app perchises than EA
Negative,"Trying to return to this game as an old player to play with friends who've recently purchased the game is as if attempting to play WoW and being asked to shell out full price for Burning Crusade. The way Bethesda and Zenimax handle the additional content purchases for this game is a joke.Update: I have played for about 50 hours more since originally writing the review. The contents of the game are fantastic, up there with some of the better TES writing post Morrowind (best ESO content I would say is about on par with The Shivering Isles, most of it is still better than your average Skyrim quest), but since the presence of the cash shop is just as everpresent and absurdly priced I'm keeping the review negative. You shouldn't have to do in-game price calculations just to make sure you don't get tricked by the store to pay ludicrous prices for content you can also access for cheaper by purchasing the right bundles or limited subscriptions."
Negative,"Don't buy it on steam ! You may buy on steam it to link it to your acount if you bought the game on 2016 because there is a way to play even when it bugs for steam users.There is often issue with steam and it last.No communication too.The game is really good though.It looks beautiful, there is a lot of quest and you can discover every aspect of Tamriel.You can customize your character and class way better than any other MMO. You don't need the subscribtion to enjoy it, but if you want to go deep into the game and enjoy every aspect you either need to pay the subscription or to buy all dlc.The subscription is really correct, but you should have at least 4 hours into the game before paying it."
Negative,"A game I try to get interested in and rapidly grow bored of within days everytime I install.Multiple characters leveled into the 10-20 area and several in the 20-30 area.I hate the interface, it stinks of something designed for a joystick to interact with.I tried again with Morrowind release, 2 days and on the 3rd day I uninstalled after leveling a warden to 15.Perhaps if they got rid of Dolums but at the same time, I bet that's what is keeping the players they have playing. Me, I can't stand that the only constant leveling comes from running back and forth between dolums.Dungeons are fun, of the 20 or so dungeons runs I've done, I liked the mechanics, was utterly clueless of what was going on, and if it wasn't for players in group who had done them before would have no idea about how to beat the boss.  They also seem very long, by the 3rd boss I'm wantign to leave and go do something else but there ends up being another 2 bosses after.Another factor is that they refuse to merge non steam account with a steam account.I can't review the morrowind expansion here despite having 69.3 hours of morrowind play because despite playing on steam, i had a physical key unlock so launched game through Tamriel Unlimited. Really bad mismangement of content/expansion/account synchronization."
Negative,Pretty basic as far as MMOs go. The combats just not fun.And how about you make the khajiit not look like shit- why do they have rubber hoses for tails?
Negative,Horrifically bad combat.
Negative,"Cannot, no matter what I do get past error 210 after I have successfully installed once already."
Negative,"this game has such a poor introduction to early game it is hard for anyone to come into a game, have to spend nearly $100 to buy dlc to be able to particpate in dlc content that the end game community wont let them join for anyways xDDDDDDDDDDDDD otherwise if you dont have 11 friends to play this game with i hope you find some that are smart enough to not lick the dirt off the floor by the bosses feet."
Negative,Great content. Terrible game developers and publishers to allow malware installed without informing anyone and giving them an OPT-IN. Hiding behind some bs excuse as it got released by accident. And oh btw you cant run the game without also running the redshell malware and they are leaving it in the game all weekend. Canceled my eso+ subscription and will never purchase another game from these companies again. This level of greed is full retard... you never go full retard. Go take a lesson on how to treat customers from CDPR please.
Negative,red shell spyware why am i not surprised Zenimax
Negative,"Just logging in and out is a challenge. When creating a new player I could not see all of them at once and I had to keep logging in and out, in and out. This game needs work I'm going back to wow."
Negative,"it's a good game but on steam it simply doesn't work, won't launch, and hardly plays. Get the game on any other platform"
Negative,Would be nice to play if the servers didn't disconnect every 5 minutes.
Negative,"Played the game for 84 hours...great graphics etc but too dull gameplay wise..nothing like Skyrim..i dont like the pay to play type gaming structure i.e. if you dont subscribe you get a raw deal crap crafting, crap leveling etc I was really looking forward to this game but was very dissapointed :( at least i gave it a try."
Negative,"Has been downloading the launcher for 2 days now. After downloading the launcher, you eventually start downloading the game itself trough the launcer. After downloading i try to start the game and get a crash. Try verifying trough the launcher and after 30 mins, it starts downloading again. So after 'playing' 61 minutes i'm done and asked for my first refund..."
Negative,"Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will ""sell"" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really."
Negative,"Bought the game many years ago before it was reworked to not be a steaming pile of garbage. Fast forward to last week when my friends jump on and finally decide to pick up the game and beckon me to give it a try with em.I make a character and im whisked away on a boat to morrowind...but not before being plastered with a message asking me to buy DLC before ive even gotten the chance to play the game.  I do the tutorial in morrowind. I spawn out of the turorial in morrowind. I am then directed to do quests....in morrowind....I then become invested in reasonably well written quests. Lo and behold on the final quest in the chain im prompted to buy morrowind and im told I cannot complete the quest chain until I do.Even that aside the guild system is just awful. You get 2 guilds. Fighters & mages. But realisticly its just the fighters guild since you gain xp for it for just killing daedra.....Wanna level the mages guild? Enjoy a several dozen hour scavenger hunt to find lore books if you want to progress the guild relevant to your character. Now I bet youve been wondering to yourself, ""what about the thieves guild?"" Well if you want that crack open your wallet little timmy!The game is just advertisement to open your wallet after advertisement.EDIT: Spelling errors"
Negative,"The game is beautiful. The story, for the most part is interesting, though not compelling. Some of the characters are exceptionally fun, but most are forgettable.  The quests are bog standard stock quests showing no imagination in design.  Crafting does something interesting by making you break down items you find to learn their enchantments so you can add them to the ones you make, but actually crafting the items is so BORING and requires so many mats that it isn't worth it.  Hear I am, years later, collecting mats from hirelings and in the world, and I still don't have what I need to make what is required to move my skills more than a couple pixels up the XP meter to the next level.  Also, some item enchants are almost impossible to find, so you won't be able to learn everything as you would like.  This isn't a rarity thing, it's a bad RNG thing.Combat is meh at best.  It isn't challenging, rotations are a joke, and if you know how to read the stat details, you'll know instantly what skill is used for what play style, and how it fits into your rotation.  Oh, and that rotation is 5 slots, because the 6th slot is for your ULT, which you have to charge. There's not a lot of room for variety, despite every weapon having it's own skill lines, but also having the same skills you would expect.I've gotten through two(-ish) of the campaigns. I'm stuck in Skyrim at the moment because I got bored with having beat the final battle of the Daggerfall campaign, but still have another zone to go. What? And I have to complete a certain number of quests in each zone to unlock the achievement for that zone to progress through so I can do the next campaign.Don't get me started on PvP. It's exactly like you would expect. It plays the same as any other MMO PvP battleground.I had high hopes for this game.  I gave it 600+ hours. It just never gets fun, and while it isn't b ad, it just isn't good.Now we can talk about the monetization.  The cash shop isn't bad, and there's no pressure from the community, unlike some games, to buy certain looks, or even deviate from the default.  But the value/dollar is horrible, and the really nice items are locked behind a gambling mechanic where you have to buy crates and hope to get high value items you can break down for a DIFFERENT premium currency that you can't buy with real money.  I used to blame Zenimax for screwing up Bethesda, but after I played Fallout 76 for a while, I don't think that's what's going on here.  I think this was a prelude to what happened in FO76 and we should have been paying more attention.All in all, if you already own it, keep playing.  If you don't, I wouldn't buy it.  Bethesda aren't the company they once were.  Go play Outer Worlds."
Negative,The free to play event DOES NOT WORK!Tried for like an hour and a half to get it to work but all I found out was that you have to create an account through a free to play online portal or else you are totally screwed. Also why would you make it impossible to unlink your steam and ESO account. It makes no sense.
Negative,"Short version: this is an obvious cash grab of an MMO done (mostly) right. Not pay to win, and with some nice unique feature changes (that are IMO not fully done ""right"", but) that give it's gameplay a somewhat different feel to many other MMOs. However, some of these ideas feel half-done, or sometimes, conversely overthought. Still, it's overall a pretty standard MMORPG with the usual questing, crafting, and skill bars that those usually entail, just in the Elder Scrolls universe for those that like both of those things but couldn't mix them before.Long Version:Combat: It's a weird mix of traditional MMO combat (skill bars, 2 bars, 5 skills per, and you swap weapons to swap bars) and timing-based combat with semi-aim (you have a reticle, but moves track as long as your reticle is on someone when you activate). That being said, realistically it boils down to mostly AoE, both in support and in damage. When the game wants to up the difficulty? More AoE's, or sometimes mob phases. What do healers mostly complain about? ""Get in the AoE's!"" Most of the high damage capability in the game (especially since even in the overworld mobs tend to come in 3s)? AoE, especially prolonged AoE. Oddly, tanking takes the least, as you have to have a somewhat specific set-up in order to have any form of AoE taunt.Speaking of tanking, everything in this game has heals, which, despite the initially diverse-seeming list of skills (which come from your class, weapon, guilds, various ""world"" skills, vampire/werewolf status, crafting, etc), by the time you reach endgame really homogenizes everything. This gets especially problematic because there is a healthy amount of healers who will complain if you, as a DPS, have no major self healing (potions only go so far because cooldowns exist), despite the fact that they signed up to be a healer. I promise you, whatever damage you think you are doing as a healer, a DPS can do more if you just do your damned job and let the DPS do his, instead of having to stop to heal themselves. Traditional MMOs have been doing this for years, and math hasn't changed, my damage bonuses are way higher than yours, so JUST. FUCKING. HEAL. Not a difficult conceptLeveling:It's pretty easy, the real progression is past level 50 with Champion points, but these are shared so having multiple characters leveled really boosts it up. Progression is also gear-based, of course, which pushes you towards merching, crafting, or both. Skills are leveled up via combat, crafting, collectible books/scrolls, and other methods, depending on the skillset itself. Once most combat skills reach max rank, you may ""morph"" it into one of two optional variants of the same skill to finetune your build, then rank that up as well.Crafting:It's pretty standard, build thing, add traits to thing, upgrade thing, enchant thing, wield thing. The time required for the researching of traits becomes exponentially higher the more you research within one item category, which, while not taking any active effort other than telling the game to burn an item with the trait you want to learn, is pretty tedious for no other reason than ""oops, we made crafting really simple, we should make sure they don't have too many possibilities too quickly"". You find colors, styles, blueprints for housing items, add them to your collection, same with many gear sets, then you can recall them at the appropriate workbench.Community/Trading:There is no centralized market, which makes a system that has been figured out forever more tedious than it needs to be. Instead, guilds bid to have traders in prime locations. Player websites and mods, which are thankfully allowed, can help with this, letting you search in one place for what you need, price check items, etc., but you've got to go point to point to manually do everything still. Trade guilds often have dues required in order to ensure their population is making money to maintain their storefront location, which would be a nice mechanic if the PvP in the game had even half the overall map worth (larger-scale PvP is very region specific). Speaking of guilds, you may be a part of up to 5 guilds, for the purposes of trade, PvP, PvE endgame, just hanging out, or whatever other reasons, really. The community as a whole is a pretty standard mix of people who play too much and people who missed what the last 3 patches did, so nothing different from most games.General Gameplay:There is a lot of soloable material, including mini-dungeons called delves, larger public dungeons you may group for if you want, open-world event areas like harrowstorms and dark anchors, world bosses. There are plenty of travel options, although there is nothing truly by air or water (even locally swimming is just at the surface), just load screens. You can walk to basically anywhere, but generally after visiting a place once you'll just teleport like every other game. Dungeons are standard 4-man affairs, although there is a MASSIVE issue with people speedrunning lower level dungeons to get their dailies out of the way. Some of these even think they are doing lower levels a service. However, as with any game, when you take the ability to experience the learning curve of the game away from those new players, they'll eventually show up in endgame content without a clue about what to do, because high level players never let them figure it out. Those same higher levels will then complain that they don't have the knowledge of the dungeons they are running, as if it isn't directly their own fault. PvP is garbage, an absolute snoozefest, considering the homogenized classes mentioned before, and it just doesn't affect enough regions, especially compared to the trade system."
Negative,"Been playing this on and off for 3 years, thinking it might get better, it doesn't. Still couldn't get pass 40 hrs because of how boring it was. The combat sucks and the quests are repetitive and boring."
Negative,"This is a real good example of ""It looked better in the trailers"". Still a good game, but not for me."
Negative,"It fools you into thinking it's going to play like a typical TES adventure game / not play like your average MMO. But then it ensnares you with Combat that's subjectively worse than any mainline TES game to date with feedback that feels worse than Morrowind Movement mechanics that feel far too snappy, so its very out of place when compared to proper TES games Cluttered to Oblivion UI systems that are typical with MMOs (The regular gameplay HUD isn't so bad at least?) Insane number bloat that rivals the likes of Disgaea RPGs AT LEVEL ONE (Starting sword does 1400 damage???)If you're already a fan of the average MMO formulae, I guess give it a try, you may like it.But if you're hoping for it to be any different from that, it's really not."
Negative,"Unplayable due to lag, most likely because the servers are overseas. If your in Australia its not worth it."
Negative,"This game will never be as good as it was in morrowind and summerset, cash shop is always in your face when booting the game up, it has a sub for bag that holds all crafting items, dlcs add every little to nothing every year"
Negative,"First you have to download nearly 100GB from Steam. When you're expecting to finally be able to play the game, you have download another 50GB update in the launcher. Two days and I still can't play. Might not have enough space on my PC."
Negative,If you want to craft a set item you need to buy the DLC needed in order to open this one specific area so you are able to go there and craft your items. The game was really cool but now it is all about money grab. Like we saw recently with Starfield. Bethesda is following Activisions money greed steps.. No thanks.
Negative,"imagine playing a bethesda game with limited mods-this game right herethe only thing i have seen for this crap on nexus are ENBs. no texture mods or anything else (as of right now)played the DLCs, i didn't feel any of them. and greymoor was pure garbage. can't believe i wasted my time there. lolcriticize the game in zone chat = you get dunked on left and right^ and god help you if you criticize the game in zone chat of imperial city. the fanboys will literally search every corner of that area for you"
Negative,"very fun game, but even after about 3 years still runs like shit and im still finding new glitches every week. it just automatically signed me out of my NA user, a user ive had for about 2 years, And now i can only log into EU servers without giving me the option to switch? please fix your shit."
Negative,"I tried so hard to get into this game. It's boring and outdated. Just a standard MMORPG, there's nothing special about it."
Negative,Uselles support and maintainance time over 12 hours.
Negative,UPD.: after 6k hours there is noting to do here =(
Negative,EU server is shit.
Negative,Latency issues !! 999+ Ping from 15:00 to 21:00 every day - unplayable experience to me and my friends
Negative,"HOT garbage. Don't waste your time. Like most MMOs theres just a lot of grinding without a lot of reward but unlike most MMOs it will constantly remind you that you could be paying for upgrades to skip boring quests and what not. Obnoxious game, horrible to spend time in."
Negative,"I finally decided to get the game seeing it was a free week to try it out. After 3 hrs of download and installation time I try to create an account it tells me my email is already in use. I try to get support but you need game code to even send email. I can't even have an email sent to my email to reset my password without game code, I don't have a game code because it's a freee weekend!! I'm afraid if I spend money and buy the game it will tell me the same thing. My email is already in use this sux so I guess I delete the game and move on. Save me $20 bucks and delete the game.."
Negative,"I really wanted to enjoy this game, I really did but I just find it so boring. The story dousnt interest me, the quests are simple and the combat is super dull. Its basically an attempt for Bethesda to jump onto the multiplayer market and through online transactions but for me as a result of this it has lost its soul as a Elder Scrolls game. I understand why people like it, its in the same world as Elder Scrolls and for lore junkies its all there. But the price to get the main game and ALL the DLCs which are done via there in game money grabbing store you feel like you are just playing a meh game overall."
Negative,"A bit more expensive than rival MMO's, especially for entry-level if you still feel like you want to make the commitment and buy all the content.I still regret buying this game, thinking since I've enjoyed almost every other MMO out there then this couldn't go wrong, and I'm sad to say I was mistaken. The only reason I've tried to stick with it is because I feel like it will just definitely be wasted money unless I sink time and effort trying to find the fun in the game."
Negative,"A fan since morrowind; a fan no more. Bethesda has cured me of my RPG addiction by sucking the fun out of gaming through over-taxation.  The tittle cost 40$ and each addition nearly 40$, ludicrous; add a small piece of map and some challenges to a preexisting  game and charge an additional game fee for a incomplete game in the first place, disgusting."
Negative,"Man I really hate having to do thisI love TES games so freaking much this was just such a disappointment it hurts and pains meI get they were trying to reach as wide of an audience as possible but just 5 abilities???I must say it got dumbed down way too hard, makes me want to play Skyrim insteadPpl say ""it makes you think about the abilities your going to put into your ""build""""Its depressing that ppl defend it instead of just accepting that it's just over-simplifiedEverytime, without fail. The defense is ""this isn't another WoW clone so that you can just mash 40 buttons""Really, WoW?I've never played WoW in my life, and here I thought GW2 had too little abilitiesI also didn't ask for 40 buttons, but com'on man just 5 abilities?!There are more options in a single player game for an XBOX LEGACYI never got to the part where u get introduced to the crafting and yet I was already running into inventory problems :/What do ppl say? ""make alts"" or the better yet ""don't loot it then""Ya, what great solutions. Make a character your not even going to actually playOr the better option, don't interact with things inside a game *forehead*The way games are meant to b played apparentlyInstead of enticing ppl with rewarding features and content, they make a system that's purposely flawed so that the only mitigation is by forking up some more cashHonestly, just look up multiplayer mods for each of TES gamesMan, its been awhileThe story must b really good (I absolutely loved the trailers, so sad the combat didnt even try to reflect it)Because with how little you can do in the game, apparently this is a top mmoShould honestly jst make a movie or netflix series"
Negative,"Kinda shit, not very interesting and not as cool or good as other MMOs ive played"
Negative,"Killed a singular lady in a bar, now every guard in the entire game hunts me down and beats the living hell out of me."
Negative,The combat always felt like smacking a wet noodle against paper for whatever weapon I used.
Negative,well i like the game but i barely got immersed into it the combat is pretty trash for an mmo as well.
Negative,Literally impossible to play the game. I've just bought it and I can't get past the loading screen after logging in. I've gone through the deep wep trying to fix it but there's no support from Bethesda.
Negative,Game is awesome and super annoying....1. Amazing story and acting with boat loads of quests (++++++++)2. Annoying update fatigue (--)3. Gambling crate mechanics to get anything cool (and spending a lot of real $$$$) (--------)4. Worst character aesthetics of ALL Elder Scrolls EVER (armors are generally really bad!!!! Mid-evil nuns designed male armor and gay monks designed female armor  (-------------)
Negative,"Decent game, but the multiplayer feels pointless and poorly developed. It's not a game you play with friends, it's a game you play at the same time as friends.Overall, this feels like it's trying to make you the ""special chosen one"" but it's kinda silly because you know every other player is also the ""special chosen one."" This game mostly exemplifies why TES doesn't work well as an MMORPG."
Negative,"The Elder Scrolls is a game series featuring rich and immersive role play experiences. The Elder Scrolls Online is a cheap money grab vaguely draped in the skin of the series as a whole like some deranged serial killer wearing someone else's face. It is clunky and awkward, fails visually and mechanically to fit into the Elder Scrolls universe and should be avoided by anyone who is looking for immersive or impactful gameplay."
Negative,"I'm changing my review for this game if you can call it that, games still got bugs pvp still sucks and the game seems to be more for casuals don't worry they do not care about your feedback to improve the game just give them money for shit DLC's."
Negative,When ever i log in or try to teleport to far locations error occurs please fix this issue it is really annoying
Negative,"they hide the rest of the game within the game, buying the collectors edition doesn't unlock all the dungeons.this is false advertisement at its finest, save your money and DO NOT BUY!"
Negative,"The game is boring and hollow. The quest lines are boring, the worlds seem empty and the side quests are following you like a curse. The quest system itself is misleading and there is no proper introduction. You get spawned in a jail cell, and after playing this game for hours I still have no idea what is going on. Partly that´s probably my fault because I had to skip the dialogues. It is supposed to be a online game, but you barely get in touch with other players ingame. Everyone is just minding their own business. The game was in sale and sadly I missed the time to return it. It´s not even worth the 6 Euros I spent.I am really disappointed."
Negative,"doesn't actually let me play, just loads forever"
Negative,I could have gotten a sh*tty pay-to-play MMO for free online but now I'm out of $20 and no better off
Negative,"Like most MMORPGs, ESO too is a hollow experience. Hard as it might try to make you feel special, it is nevertheless blatantly obvious in all areas of the game that you're but one player among thousands and that none of your choices matter.You clear ""delves"" - small one-person dungeons - with endlessly respawning enemies, often not more than a few meters behind another player, creating an unshakable feeling of being on an amusement park ride and just going through the motions with every other visitor.In larger four-person dungeons you're usually the newbie trying to catch up with the more experienced players, all of whom clear dungeons with ruthless efficiency and who will absolutely not stop to smell the flowers or listen through dialogue for any reason.Major cities, like with most major MMOs, are auction houses that also double as fashion shows of ridiculous-looking end-game gear.None of your choices in quests matter beyond that particular quest, and you can redo most of your character leveling choices for a reasonable fee.I will mention for fairness that the no-subscription version of the game doesn't make the game significantly less fun than the paid experience - unless your fun relies on doing lots of crafting. Also some of the quests have an actually decent story if you can get past the amusement-park feeling.Regardless, I wouldn't recommend ESO for anyone except MMO enthusiasts who have already accepted the quirks of the genre and aren't bothered by them. And even then you'll want to also be an Elder Scrolls fan. Otherwise the game will likely not give you anything that any other MMO couldn't give you already."
Negative,"Cant log in to PC EU for 3 days now, whole guild and friendslist has the same issue. Support doesnt react or care. Wp bethesda."
Negative,Do not make a mistake on buying this MMO thru Steam. The Game is flooded with login issues that they do not address nor care about.
Negative,"4000hrs+ and the lag and bugs are the same when i 1st started playing, great game if you want to be brain dead and a complete waste of my time i tell you, would of rather went to go get some bitches with that time at least i would of had something to show"
Negative,"This game sucks. It has a horrible gameplay, nothing like the previous Elder Scrolls. Enemies are appearing and disappearing, you can't collect what you want from dead corpses, there is a fu**ing huge amount of GIANT INSECTS wherever you go. Quests are totally random, combat system is probably the worst ever appeared in a videogame. Plus it took a whole life to download and activate.Don't buy this game. It is not worth the money."
Negative,This game is fun but you need to spend alot of money to get the full experience of the game. This game have a lot of DLC and the price is not cheap.
Negative,There are a lot of reasons but I will just mention one reason :Craft bag shouldn't be behind a pay wall :)
Negative,"I have played 3000+ hours of this game on its native launcher (played from release up until about last year) TLDR; Invest your MMO time into a game like GW2 that is actively IMPROVING with each expansion, and listens to their core audiences wants and perspectives.Ill keep it short and sweet; casuals will love this, hardcore or competitive players will have rose tinted glasses for a little while and the pain will set in slowly over time. If you're looking for a game to play some cools stories, or collect achievements / craft / explore, this game is probably a good fit for you. If you like competitive PVP, or high level organised raiding, the current state of the game is NOT recommendable. They have killed this game for it's hardcore audience SEVERELY in the past year or 2, and continue to ignore the community that keeps the game interesting and evolving. The game has been reworked in terms of balance to the point of blandness and a lack of true class diversity, most classes work pretty much the same way with a different animation set behind it given the meta. I used to run 3 separate guilds that propped the PVE community (training new players for raids/ HM content, teaching vets to raid call and run their own groups, teaching GM's raid team/schedule management for core teams) and 3 years of effort building that community was destroyed by bad update - after bad update - after bad update - after bad update - after bad update. No thanks, keep your ESO+, and i'll keep my $$$."
Negative,"Not worth your time unless you plan on subscribing to eso+, and having to pay for dlc's, and mounts, and appearances. It's clear they only care about milking whales. Great game ruined by greed."
Negative,"It crashes everytime I try to create a character... Well, that's it."
Negative,"Got banned permanently for no reason almost immediately after entering the game for the first time.They say ""it has been determined that the account did in fact violate our Code of Conduct"" and that I cheated and that's it, no explanation on ""how did I do that""."
Negative,"Was excited to find I could try this free for a few days. Then was disappointed when I spent 3 days downloading and installing multiple updates for the game, client, and game again. At last I get to play the game. Created account and then I get logged out in 30 seconds. I wait a few min as requested and it keeps happening. So I will not buy this game if this is what I have to look forward to. I do not have this issues with any other game either. So very dissapointing to spend my few days off waiting for nothing."
Negative,"I reaaaaallly want to bitch slap these devs back into oblivion days. Or just into Oblivion. Bastards.So, on top of everything they actually removed the original thieves guild quests from the original release (I played up to TG level 60 in 2018, so I know) and made it separate DLC. I paid about 80$ for the original game and the bleackwood DLC, nothing else. And was able to play the thieves guild quests along with the nightblades... Now they actually had the nerve to REMOVE IT from the game I purchased... Whoever decided to do that just needs to be killed. Most nasty, corrupt, capitalist bullshit. It's even pay  to win at this point. Crafting is pointless and takes 10x longer without an ESO + subscription. You and anyone who plays your game are a disgrace to the gaming community. NEVER AGAIN. It could be so damn good...  And really isn't very far from great. But they refuse to fix  a number of things that just destroy it. Mainly their skill tree mess combined with the fact that you have a maximum of like 7 skill slots at one time. And thousands of skills. And only one alternative skill bar to swap to... its a joke. A messy joke that had great potential until the devs got their heads stuck up their asses and said  ""fuck it, we're on to the next game"".All they had to do was make Morrowind MMO... Instead they jerked it around and made it into some kind of  wonky ass wanna be MMO that just has to be different. Even though it was one of the most unique RPGs out there in the first place. By refusing to copy other MMO's in some base functions, like having many skills you can use, they just limit their game. Not make it unique or more interesting. And in the process they forced players to conform to stupid limitations  in their builds that make creative PVP a no go, and even makes creating unique builds basically impossible. Instead of fair, or unique, they made it not fun.And they support rapist behavior online. I literally just got suspended because I told someone who was telling me they would ""find me and dance with me IRL"", I told them I'm not gay and they said they'd ""find me and fuck me"" in response. Telling them to stop and leave me alone apparently was ban worthy... So basically now we support rapists so long as they're gay? What the fuck people.... Woooooh.... I actually just found a class action suite for this sort of discrimination too...  Shoes about to be on the other foot you perpetual victim gaybois."
Negative,"I realized I never wrote a review for this gameFun as a lore piece to the entire TES universe and building for meta (getting dlc content that requires it) can be done without paying a dime if you're in a decent guild. Otherwise it is a pure MMO and gives you major FOMO. This game made me quit MMOs lol.Had fun making lore and ocs with friends, but kinda fell off playing because the MMO grind was too much as someone who was heading off to college. IDK PvP was okay but it is PvE focused (and the Citadel stuff is actually decent). Doing dungeons is a blast, but it does siphon you into making a meta build eventually or people will scream at you"
Negative,"Takes a good while to level. Quests are boring, let me illustrate I spent twenty minutes for one quest going to each and every part of town talking to different npcs. PVP balance doesn't exist. Group finder will leave you waiting for 7 hours. Do yourself a favor and look some where else for fun."
Negative,its a good game. theres lots of stuff too do and amazing too see nern with updated graphics. just feels like theres no sense of direction and not as fun as i hoped
Negative,"as of late the lag in this game is impossibly high. along with the practical abandonment of pvp really makes this game unappealing for me. hopefully in a later update these issues will be fixed but as of right now, dont bother"
Negative,3rd party launcher bloatware
Negative,its a no for me.
Negative,Might have been a good game but I wasted $20 not to see.  It had a glitch from the outset.  Wouldn't let me create a username!  No help from Bathesda at all.  TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.  I won't forget it either Bathesda.
Negative,"This game is just bland. Nothing about this game is outright bad, it's boring. Try it out if you can play it a bit for free, since I'm certain there's people out there that the gameplay this provides is exactly what they're looking for. However, don't expect it to be like ""Skyrim but with your friends."""
Negative,"I recently revisited The Elder Scrolls Online after a long break, and it quickly became clear why I stopped playing at Champion Point level 650. While you can technically engage in the core gameplay after reaching Champion Point 160, it’s still far from satisfying. The game simply doesn’t reward the time or money players invest, even as subscribers. Instead of fixing core gameplay issues, the developers have opted to overwhelm players with a massive grind—thousands of Champion Points that need to be earned before reaching a competitive level for endgame content. On top of that, new mechanics are added that can be leveled up much faster if you’re willing to pay.One particularly frustrating example is the mount leveling system. You can only add one point per day to one of three traits: speed, stamina, or carrying capacity. Each point requires in-game currency and essentially puts a timer on your progress. To fully level up your mount, you’ll need a total of 90 days. And if you’re thinking this progress is account-wide—think again. Each character has to go through the process individually.If you're a new player considering this game, I’d honestly recommend against it. The grind to endgame is not only long—it’s frustrating. I truly wanted to enjoy ESO, but seeing so many essential features locked behind the in-game shop, which should be included in the subscription, left me feeling disillusioned.The final straw for me was when I was working on maxing out crafting, only to find out that researching a new trait would take 30 days. The only way to speed it up? Buying scrolls. For a subscriber, this feels completely unreasonable.While I’d give the game’s story a solid 10/10, the systems themselves drag the overall experience down to a disappointing 2/10. In my opinion, The Elder Scrolls Online has become just as frustrating as gacha games and pay-to-win models games.One last thing, the players are great, its just sad the company isnt."
Negative,"A voice-acted and engaging high-fantasy, story-driven action MMORPG that bucks traditional tab-targeting for an active aiming system; Elder Scrolls Online takes what's great about their single-player experiences and makes several repulsive compromises to bring their IP into the modern massively-multiplayer realm. Chose your class, complete story-based main and side quests, build your abilities and gear around your preferred fantasy game-play strategy, craft weapons, armor, and housing materials, and take on various dungeons (and PvP content) in ever-so-slightly-aged, triple-A studio style . Then, to enjoy even a smidgen of it, subscribe to their monthly service, purchase a variety DLCs, peruse their extremely overpriced cash shop, sign in every-single-day to get rewards, and get ready to open your bank accounts further in order to try to enjoy hearth, home, backpack and bank storage, and cosmetic alterations to your hard-earned gear (and to greatly assist with survival and progression, of course).Sure, it almost sounds like a promotional review, but any accolades earned also drag a wretched carcass along behind them. The FOMO cash shop + sub + DLC + cosmetics + advancement + loot crate monetization strategy takes what could have been an epic and incredible adventure and drowns it in the same loathsome, predatory, FOMO monetization mechanics leveraged by what most would otherwise deem less-than-prestigious studios. Players may experience much of the game for free, very true, but crafting (storage), housing, and fanciful fun is mostly gated behind a player's real-world purchasing-power...or, yes, grant it, a metric ton of not-so-fun playtime dedicated to those very things. While I do appreciate that the best player-crafted potions and food are better than their cash shop counterparts (at the time of this writing), the difference is negligible enough to punish to those who'd previously earned their way. As a one-time max-level, all-craft player with sub and all DLC purchases (up to a point), I've seen it all from all factions/sides... but, as always, the cash-shop sickened the experience like a festering wound, an inescapable cancer, and it caught up to me. In the end, I had thousands upon thousands of harvested resources, but not enough to craft furniture to decorate a home (and certainly not well). Ignore my listed Steam play time, I have hundreds of hours in this MMO elsewhere - and it burdens me to leave a negative review, but if the pauldron fits...Elder Scrolls if it was published by Molag Bal, developed by Mannimarco, and monetized by Sheogorath. Previously, one of my favorite of all MMORPGs, it is with heavy heart that I bid it farewell."
Negative,"Years back I played a Morrowind game and really enjoyed it, so thought I would give this a go. This feels completely different, it has been a while, but still not what I imagined at all.Positives It looks good. There is crafting. Multiplayer works extremely well, you can sort of do group content with other players without actually knowing them or being in a group.Very large world, a lot of content. Negatives.95% angry, dark depressing occult themes and very little other medieval or real world themed quests as if the creators turned the pure fantasy up to 11 rather than embrace any semblance of realism or actually using their imagination. I might be biased, but I am big fan of not reinventing the wheel with fantasy genres.  Weak story lines, buckets and buckets of chaotic lore, there is just storylines all over the place, NPC’s or the character you play will make big decisions or betray someone, you’ll do many uncomfortable things in this game.User armour or magical skins are gaudy and colourful, a lot is not what you’d expect. Bugs, UI pointer not working correctly on Mac, focus, sometimes you’re fighting and not facing the mob, some of the bugs like the location not changing depending on what zone you are on will waste days of your time.I had a heavy armour character with a 2H sword. There is large pauses between attacks, and it weirdly uses stamina for all of them, a lot of the time I was sitting there waiting to press the next button.The map is confusing, Western Skyrim in the middle north?A lot of content you have to pay to access or is subscription based, if you stop paying you lose things. Little storage space, you can’t just make chests and stash things in it. In a real world there would not be limitations like this, just another thing to ruin the vibe.Took me a month or so to realise it was another hamster wheel grind type thing, every day the same thing but the numbers go up, I did some really horrible quests and then decided to uninstall the game."
Negative,I did not like it.
Negative,Was a great game until native Mac M1 support removed.
Negative,Good Quests but very boring fight system
Negative,currently pretty dead in endgame
Negative,Loading screen simulator.
Negative,Questing which is what i love to do is way to easy. If ZOS just introduced a difficulty slider it would bring a lot of experienced players back to do questing again. There's so much overland content that I never play because it's so mind numbingly easy that it frankly becomes boring. For us there's only two dungeons and a trial every year to look forward too. With a difficulty setting to make new content fit all skill levels I could also get a nice experience just questing though the new stories in the chapters they release. Lord Of the Rings Online introduced this last year.
Negative,"ESO is the perfect example of create problem to sell solution, right from character creation there are beard options that will clip through certain head armour and the only way to fix it is to buy an item off the cash shop. The waiting times for research of new traits for your gear gets incredibly long and yes you can buy speed ups from the cash shop. It is almost impossible to play the game without the sub as your inventory is quickly filled, the crafting bag should be a free resource like in GW2.Unfortunately so much of ESO makes me feel like I have to pay to play it and its not just the pay wall aspects I don't enjoy. Combat its way to spammy and dungeons are full copy paste environments.and on top of it all, it runs horribly sometimes taking upwards of an hour to log in after updates.You should stick to single player Bethesda, at least then fans can fix your games."
Negative,"Don't play this. MMO's are an ""investment"" in terms of gaming. ESO is an absolute pile and investing hundreds of dollars in subscriptions/expansions along with thousands of hours isn't something you can walk away from easily, let alone contently. After the initial month or two of flashy junk and cosmetics you'll probably want to actually play the game only to realize how limited it really is. Bad performance, bad servers, 3-4 months between patches, character-locked progression, and a total (I MEAN COMPLETELY TOTAL) absence of communication from the dev team and managers make for an extremely embittering experience. Over the years I've played since 2016 I've never encountered another community with more white knights and devil's advocacy than ESO's. At the end of the day it feels like a capitalistic Disney fantasy simulator with nothing but badly written stories in lieu of fulfilling content. Don't play this. Just don't."
Negative,"as iroshu put it into a very great perspectivei have a ton of hours in this game much like he does except i was on console before pc and quite honestly this is one of the most toxic games i know tbqh pc alot better than console by far but like he said  this games sucks your soul and your wallet dry but my  perspective lies more with console than pc but it is true the devs dont care about veteran players or fixing known issues that have been longstanding in this game i have thousands of hours in ESO since lauch on playstation i have played on all three platforms pc being the calmer of the three and better version by far  pve meh pvp could be GOAT if they ever fixedserver issues and got rid of proc carry sets and stop killing the game in general i see this game soon dying and it is sad could have been the best mmo out imho i  think the devs are self destructing this game on purpose but hey opinions are like assholes everyones got one right nuff said also this games population is getting smaller and smaller they need to consider cross platform play/progression add stuff people want this game is on life support there is only so much pve a person can tolerate and since the beginning of this game pvp was always endgame content they keep adding more and more garbage to the game more cp and more  proc sets they need to go back to basics pre morrowwind when the game was at its best pve and pvp but hey im  just the consumer of a product that my entire family had a part in keeping alive since it came out now its a ghost town on any platform good job zos how do you expect to launch another ip if you cant even bother to take care of this one at this point i cant reccommend anyone purchase this until they actually start giving a shit about their community both pve and pvp and not cater to just new players and casuals or force people to group in cyro cuz of tarnished nightmare, which is far worse than plaguebreak vicious death and dark convergence combined, or guards that have every skill in the game wheres the player class like that i mean when you cant even solo resources anymore cuz guards are the most op npc in the game tougher than Veteran Bosses even ya good work Zos"
Negative,"Dynamic quests and AAA voice acting from every NPC which hooks you, but everything is depressingly easy. Even end-game.Wondering why I am neg reviewing at 900 hours ""played""? Well, I didn't. ESO has a bug that hangs onto a task that keeps running, and won't close until you end task it. It was reported years ago, but never fixed since it probably artificially manipulates the Steam algorithms to make them look better than they are.Although the gfx is not as modern as other games, it's still beautiful. The quests are full of amazing stories that are beautifully voiced over. However, it's pretty much ezmode - I found more challenge in WoW, and that was a game for mindless drones that had were rewarded the best items in the game for tediously collecting 100 pieces of fruit.As you level up, the NPCs level up too. You can skip to the hardest boss in the game and he'll be evenly-matched. I really dislike this - no feeling of progression. No feeling of getting crushed in 1 area, swearing to come back one day to destroy them all. Everything dies in like 2 brainless combos (which is at least more than WoW's brainless single combos).Not even the bosses are challenging. I don't think I ever died once, even when I was being reckless. There's no risk/reward, only reward - and as an adult over the age of 13, this isn't fun to me (except perhaps for the first few hours). I did keep playing for the stories, but even that only lasts so long (when you realize that Netflix probably does the same thing for less time spent)."
Negative,"NO ty, never again"
Negative,Great game with dial up servers powered by hamsters.
Negative,"Can't even log into the game cause of steam. It's also a WOW type of mmo, not like what they show on steam. Don't get unless you like to waste money."
Negative,friendly advice: it's better to buy on the official website
Negative,"The game is what it is, feels a bit dry, no sense of real drive to do the quests at all after you hit lvl 10 and the quests are mostly generic. It is a decent MMO don't get me wrong but the whole Idea of it, the mechanics and everything is outdated. Sad to say I think it is like all of the MMOs out there at this point lacking that something and they all feel the same and the MMO community is clinging to what we can get and we try to convince ourselves that this is as good as it gets."
Negative,All these years and still a simple thing like the movement speed bug has not been fixed. Even after the fight ends I move slower than a tortoise. I should have chosen an argonian character so at least the game would be consistent in showing a slow-moving reptile.
Negative,"I purchased this game a few years ago, but never really got into it because of the frequency of issues between steam and bethesda. Not really into MMO's but decided to try again to have an RPG to play with my gf. Since then, every step along way has been a huge pain.Installation UX:Since the game hasn't been launched in a long time and doesn't update through steam, updates were needed. Instead of downloading the newest version and applying it directly, the launcher instead downloaded 3x50GB patches in increments, which literally took hours. Literally the most inefficient installation process I have ever seen.Start the game, accept multiple ToS, gf starts the game, we both chose the same alliance to start in the same area together... That didn't happen. Apparently, the new edition comes with Morrowind, along with a new starting area, I still had the Coldharbour start, and I never purchased morrowind.Then more shenanigans:""I'll just get the Morrowind DLC, no biggie,"" right? Nope! I couldn't find the Morrowind DLC anywhere in the steam store. I later come to find out that Morrowind is now part of the new standard edition and can't be purchased through steam anymore. Sounds shady AF if you ask me. Also steam won't let you re-purchase the new Standard edition, despite being separate products.Let's check the ESO web-site:Classic retarded login shenanigans. Using several of my standard passwords in rotation, can't login with any of them. Used forgot password, did password reset... ""You can't use the same password you used before"". So I DID have the correct password... Oh FFS! It  Just  Works, eh Todd? Fine, new password, whatever! Anyway I see that you can purchase the Morrowind DLC through the crown store. 3500 crowns... Well, 3500 crowns is around $30, overpriced! You can buy the base game, which includes Morrowind, and is $20, 33% cheaper! WTF Todd?As an aside, here's my Todd timeline:Morrowind era: Bethsoft is great!Oblivion era: Bethsoft watering down to cater to console, also, horse armor?Skyrim: Okay maybe your not so bad afterall, Todd... But seriously, why did you get rid of athletics and acrobatics?!Skyrim paid mods: ummm....Skyrim VR: okay, $60 for a VR mod?Fallout 4: meh.Fallout 76: okay wtf, just, wow!TES 6/Starfield: Not getting my hopes upI just hope Microsoft cleans things up. IMO, MS should just let Obsidian run with the Elder Scrolls IP."
Negative,"Some kind of glitch going on at the moment where it's telling me to purchase the game again. When I try to launch it from Library, it takes me to the store, where it says I already own the game and to ""Play Now"". So I Click ""Play Now"", and it just reloads the store page. What gives? Kinda regretting not just buying the game straight from the ESO Website, as I doubt this would be happening. According to other reviews this is happening to more than just me, so I truly hope it's fixed soon :("
Negative,"The community is full of old people that like to act like bitches. Don't be fooled by "" this is a wonderful community"". Its horseshit.Also, you WANT to like to this game but its just garbage. Always has been... i have so many hours because I sit down to play the game and then I get distracted with LITERALLY anything else and it sits idle in my background.I kind of started to like the housing... but you need ESO plus for it to really matter. Nah.What happened to gaming?"
Negative,"In its favor, this game runs well on Linux Mint with Proton.  Kudos for not including weird program libraries that don't play well on a variety of systems.  Thanks for that boon.  :)Beyond that, though, I find myself increasingly disliking the inventory system.  It seems to be the perfect ""problem requiring customers to pay for a solution"".  If you intend to craft (and I always do), then there is simply too much inventory to keep on your character and bank simultaneously.  You have to buy the monthly subscription to make the whole issue magically ""go away"" entirely... which makes me want NOT to do that.I'm still logging in to do some daily craft quests, but we'll see how long I can continue doing that while having to micromanage my combined inventory.  That part is simply not fun."
Negative,"The game itself is actually pretty cool - if and when it actually works. Unfortunately, it's cracking at the seams in 2020. The weekly 'maintenance' often lasts for many hours longer than planned, and when the 'megaservers' finally come online it's simply not possible to log on for many players. Especially incredible because many free online games are running smoothly 24/7. After being unable to log on for days on end I've changed my initial positive recommendation to a disappointed 'thumbs down' - and ended the additional paid 'ESO Plus' subscription which is required to avoid many hours of menial work to develop your characters."
Negative,"I'm not saying I know everything about the game, because I don't. Only CP 101 before I put it down. However. I stand by this, ESO is the best MMO for content, but the worst MMO for combat. Animation cancelling has ruined the game IMO, besides being able to skip animations to do bigger deeps, the animations themself are absolutely awful. It looks like my 6 year old cousin did them. Especially the bow animations, it looks like a small child is having a seizure.In part, the combat is pretty much why I put it down, aside from the horrible loading screens... Some last up to 2 minutes.PSA: If you are going to get the game, don't do it through steam."
Negative,Can't get the game to patch through Steam. Don't bother
Negative,"ESO crates? nah, just a money simulator. EA should learn with this game, lmaoBesides that, the game is good"
Negative,"Cannot Play due to no servers in India. It says error just after character creation. Totally hate this.Edit: In order to play here, I need to use a free VPN software."
Negative,"I would recommend this game. However, the servers are garbage. You get login queue's that don't actually queue you. You crash out after so long and have to re log in and then get the same log in queue. So...I can not recommend this game because it's unplayable more often than not."
Negative,"Bought the game to have some nice time over the weekend and relieve experiences from other TES titles. Turns out they'll happily take your money, but if you're european and try gaming through steam you get 6hs maintenance time on Saturday in european 'prime time' and then some extra login problems, for some additional fun. Not to mention the bugs... Stay away, people. Not worth it."
Negative,"Good game, bad developers. Unfortunatly it's something very very VERY hard to fix when you have developers that actually don't care about keeping schedule times for maintenance.So until you fix your competence, I'm afraid I can't recommend this game. It will just frustrates others, like it frustrates me."
Negative,waste my time for the f*c*ing launcher. can't login.
Negative,0/10 almalexia lost all the swag she had in morrowinglet s make a petition so almalexia can be ugly again
Negative,I really like this game itself. But having login-issues via Steam after almost EVERY update makes it frustrating - especially when you can't log into the game during an ongoing event ... at the weekend.
Negative,make australian servers if u want more players
Negative,"Shallow, boring, overcrowded... a typical MMO... Not worthy of the name Elder Scrolls."
Negative,"Too many hoops to jump through. After a 60GB download and a 35GB patch, ESO didn't send me an email to authorize my PC. If this is how they run things, I'm not interested. Refund Requested."

Negative,"A very nice MMORPG set in the ES universe. It's not pay to win, it's not (overly) in your face about buying microtransactions, and everything blends well.They have microstransactions so they lost a lot of my respect but other than that, they did a nice job.It's a little too big on the MMO side for me, I wish it was more like Skyrim or Oblivion. The HUD is cluttered and I just don't like how there are so many other players constantly. Friends and I can't even do a quest because there were so many other players in the area who kept killing everything as soon as it appeared."
Negative,"While the graphics overall are pretty good, I don't recommend playing it even if you are a fan of the Elder Scrolls series. it plays more like a stand alone single player RPG, than an MMO. Community is nice, but the layout for the ability panel and interface is confusing and overly complicated. That being said, if you do want to purchase this game and you've played other MMO's out there like WoW, prepare to be somewhat dissappointed. Lackluster in a sense that they almost shoehorn the ""crown store"" the moment you set foot on the second zone. Please consider for at least a few hours/days before purchasing. :(I should also mention that it took THREE DAYS for this game to download, and 5-6 HOURS for it to update on its own once the launcher for the game started up and the first quest for the game is quite mediocre for all that time I spent waiting. Not worth it imo.But hey, at least the character creation screen is good."
Negative,"What can I say? I should have trusted RL and online friends across any game I've played to whom they have tried this travesty. It's one of those bad mmos, one where the cinematic team deserves rousing applause and the game development team a quick trip to the gallows."
Negative,Pay for convience
Negative,just play skyrim
Negative,The elder scrolls online is only 1/18 of how good skyrim is. if you want a multi player skyrim just download playtogther and deal with some of the issues instead of wasting your money on this game.
Negative,Couldn't even get into the character creation screen due to the infinite loading screen glitch and I tried all of the standard fixes to get it to work right. Fuck this broken ass game.
Negative,waste of my time!
Negative,"I can not in good faith recommend this game. Combat goes from laughably easy overworld content, to bizarelly difficult 12 man content. It's uneven, and poorly planned. Basic things, like playing whatever race you want and more inventory slots, are locked behind their cash store. It's looks great, but that's about it."
Negative,"so i go to recover my account and it says my email is invalid... so when i try to make a new account it says my email is in use .... most assbackwards process ever... customer support is dead , the phone number is dead and the help online just loops me back to trying to account recover and it says my email is invalid, dumbest process ever ... goiing to find a different game"
Negative,"This game is a massive time sink, wrapped in a sub-par Elder Scrolls skin. A necessary function, the crafting bag, is locked behind a monthly paywall called ""ESO Plus."" One can very easily skip all the dialog and still get all of the ""quests"" done. Save your time, save your money, avoid this game. Oblivion not only looks better, but also has less immersion breaks from other players running up and grabbing the same thing you need to grab.UPDATE: I have played this game for almost 50 more hours. My original points still stand."
Negative,"Manufactured Discontent.The fact that there exist items in game for gaining Bank access anywhere, and to sell your items for gold anywhere, which cost the equivalent of $50 USD _EACH_, and that the advice of long-term players is that they are the most worthwhile ""micro""-transactions in the game, tells you everything you need to know about what your long-term experience with playing this game will be like."
Negative,"Honestly not a good game. wanted a fun game for me and my friends, terrible experience. I love skyrim ive played it for years, this is not it. It over stimulates you with quests and monsters and mechanics. Its super confusing besides the combat which is fine. but especially starting out youre at a huge disadvantage because the world is so big. ive spent the majority of my time running around trying to get places because you have to find the teleportation spots before you can use them, and quests have you travel is wildly different places for little rewards. And to make matters worse everything wants to attack you every second and its impossible to get away from them, ive had enemies tail me for incredibly long distances and i was just passing through. I cant even find a spot to look at my map because theres so many aggressive creatures and bandits. Very much pay to win also. Story isnt interesting and hard to follow. its just not great."
Negative,"Hours and hours of grinding for a single set and then before you can enjoy it for just a while, they are out lvl'd and stats degrade like worthless pieces of sht. Community is bunch of carebears and to all of you delusional degenerates that think this is a skill based PVP game: No, if I can have 20+ kda as a new nightblade player with just a couple of hours into learning the PVP mechanics, this game is not skill based what so ever. Lack of progressiveness after hitting lvl 50, spamming the same set of skills over and over for countless hours. If you are into input delayed gameplay, repetitive & discouraging grind and playing with community full of retrds, then this game is for you. 12/10"
Negative,"Tried it for free during free weekend. The experience can be described in general as this:Your inventory is full. Your inventory is full. Your inventory is full. Your inventory is full. Your inventory is full.So much loot, but stuff has to be thrown away every 2 minutes or after each fight because of the full inventory. It is Not clear where to sell the loot, there seems to be no place to stash it (at least in the beginning of the game) and the inventory space is ridiculously tiny. Another Inventory Simulator game. No thanks. Bye."
Negative,"Not an Elder Scrolls game I expected. More like a dumb Elder Scrolls wanna-be gimmick.Game is extremely boring, very repetitive.Feels like yet another cheap f2p MMO.The world is huge and such a waste, because everything is like a blueprint based copy paste crap everywhere, even the fact that every NPC is voiced doesn't cover the dead feeling you feel inside while playing this.I literally felt like dying inside even more, the more I played ESO.Combat is the main letdown in this game, it's another shitty traditional tab-targeting hybrid with crosshair aiming, to make it feel like action, but it's not. Really feels boring. If they had made the combat more real like TERA or Vindictus, this game could've been 5X more populated."
Negative,"They had removed ASIA server, be careful my fellow rice field people."
Negative,I feel offended being Bethesda's customer
Negative,Pay. Pay. Pay. Pay.
Negative,21 million players. lmao
Negative,The monthly premium is such an incredible advantage that I just cant recommend this as a more casual MMO player. It's a shame because the world is awesome.
Negative,after i play this shit 144h i rly don't undrstand anything and the ppl dude i try kill some monster one off player come with lvl 99999 and power 99999 just one hit and bye bye baby dude make me stay with the new player i don't have damn power 99999 like who buy stuff THIS GAME ITS PAY TO WIN
Negative,DONT BUY THIS S-H-I-T. Worst WoWlike gameplay. Nothing new in game you will not see. There are many like MMO s-h-i-t for free. - Small locations- C-r-a-p story- Disbalance- Classes- Bugs- Useless and boring PvP- Bad graphicsetc0/10
Negative,"I love Elder Scrolls games and MMOs, but I can't get lost in the fastasy setting when the UI keeps transporting me back to the corporate wasteland setting of IRL."
Negative,Basically a reskinned Wizards of the Coast DnD online game. Not skyrim
Negative,"This was kind of fun for a while, but not really THAT much of a similar experience to oblivion or skrim.  :shrug:  Its an mmo, pretty regular, not sure what differentiates it from the many other parody products."
Negative,Decent but feels like there's nothing to do
Negative,"They fix very few bugs or lie and say they fixed it but its still broken, servers mainly go down for the crown store to be fixed and not much else! They need to listen to the community or keep losing more."
Negative,I loved this game for quite a while but after what happened its impossible to play. One day i try to start up the game from the launcher. it loads up and i try to press play but the button wont work! Other people have experienced this as well and still no fix. and because of that. i cannot recommend this game. Edit: after waiting about half a year the game is now working but seeming how i had no help with this at all. I still cannot recommend this game
Negative,To be honest all the custom mounts like rainbow horses and flying monkeys pets kind of ruins the whole immersion while playing this game. Also the fact that in order to play all of the content you have to subscribe to a monthly plan after paying a lot of money for the game itself is kind of scummy. Uninstalled won't touch this game again.
Negative,"DO NOT BUY IT FROM STEAM!Theres nothing wrong with the game, I'm playing it and I love it, but the Steam connection is just ASS. You cannot connect to the servers about weekly, or sometimes daily. Its just ridiculous.Do something, Gaben!#MakeTESOGreatAgain #LeaveABadReview"
Negative,"The Elder Scrolls Online is a massively multiplayer online role-playing video game developed by ZeniMax Online Studios. It was originally released on April 4, 2014 for Microsoft Windows and OS X.Story- the story for this game is terrible and unimmersive. It is very generic and jsut your typical story but you are not someone special like a dragonborn you are just a normal guy! The story is jsut a load of fetch quests and boring mission. you complete a mission and get a weapon that does slightly more damage than the one you got from doing the last mission!gameplay- the gameplay jsut gets repetitive and same old same old. It is jsut repetitive and feels like a chore to play!combat- the combat is one of the only things that is good about this game. the combat is amazing just like always in elder scrolls! They did not go for your typical MMO combat and stuck to the elder scrolls formula which is great.Character- the character creater is average and nothing special at all. It should be way better than it is by now!skill/perks- the skill and perk system is very detailed and confusing in a good way. it forces you to think about what you are doing and not make blind choices like an idiot.Series-This does not feel like a elder scrolls game as a lot of people say.It feels jsut like an MMO and not an elder scrolls game which is a complete disaster and a crime.Multiplayer- unless you have a friend to play with who is the same race then it jsut feels like a singleplayer game. trust me you will not meet people who will team with you. if you dont already have a friend before you are alone and might aswell be playing a single player game.Dialouge- Dialouge is very generic and boring and not interesting at all. I get to apoint where Isut skipped almost everything and I never normally do that no matter how boring! and I am not the only person! I have noticed a lot of people jsut rushing through the dialouge and moving on!Overall this game is not a complete disaster and has gotten better with age and fixed by Bethesda so I am going to rate it 5.6/10"
Negative,The devs want your kidneys
Negative,Not a fan tbh. I have hundreds of hours in Skyrim and this just feels like a cheap knock off.
Negative,"I am sure this game is great! But the sign-up process takes forever and I have been waiting for hours for the multiple verification codes! What is this, the early 2000s? Who still uses access codes as part of game security?"
Negative,"New non-binary companion announced, clearly going the ESG/DEI route. It's all downhill from here in the long run"
Negative,Constant downtime because of steam buy this game from the ESO website if you dont want to have 7 hours of downtime with no explanation.
Negative,"I haven't played the game in a long time, and I would love to do so again but there's just no challenge to the overworld. Everything melts with the press of a few buttons, which takes away any reward or satisfaction. It's a shame because everything else about the game really is great."
Negative,Do NOT buy via Steam. It is equally cheap on the official ESO site and Steam denied my refund even though I bought it only yesterday. The Login problems occur on a regular basis and only through the Steam Launcher. Totally not worth it.
Negative,"The biggest reason behind my bad review is the misleading advertising on the store page. It says on the chapters that they include all previous chapters up until this very chapter, which they do not contain.So do not buy this game on steam! Buy it on the ESO website, were you can see better what you are buying. You can add it to steam as foreign application afterwards and it has the same effect as buying it here.The game has huge amounts of content and is very fun to play."
Negative,"Will they ever fix the bug requiring double amount of space to install? First, its like 70Gb to download the client via Steam, and then installer decideds for whatever reason that its not good enough, and asks for another 70-80 Gb to install the game. Yeah I heard it may be due to the older version of Steam client, whatever that means, I heard that it is Steam only issue and there are workarounds, like not using Steam version.Well, this game was purchased via Steam, and I reasonably expect it to work via Steam and not consume my entire disk space in the process.This is extremely annoying, and while the game itself is good, I'm not going to play it until this is fixed and won't recommend it to anyone but those lucky enough to have dedicated 1Tb SSD for gaming."
Negative,"Great game, just really regret getting it through steam. Steam support for ESO is terrible, many times unable to log into game via steam, while folks who do not use steam have no problem getting in. It totally blows steam sells a product and then messes up ones ability to use said product."
Negative,"This game claims to support Mac OS but does not support Apple Silicon Macs, and fails to start properly on them."
Negative,Do not buy this game from Steam. Login problems with Steam only.
Negative,don't buy this from steam
Negative,"Steam won't load the launcher.  When I try launching zosSteamStarter.exe directly, it tells me to launch it through Steam...."
Negative,"This game is good . . . as long as your aren't doing quests or in dungeons or in cites or on the road or in the wilderness. The environments are beautiful and alive but enemies just keep spawning. Walk somewhere, if you turn around they are back already. This is especially annoying in dungeons. I JUST CLEARED THAT ROOM NOW THERE IS 10 ENEMIES AGAIN!!!!! But what angers me the most, I bought the Elsweyr edition and it only included half of the Elsweyr province! There was a bunch of others provinces included in the package but still . . . That really sucks. Technical support is brilliant, really the best I have ever death with, but the servers are crap. They are constantly under maintenance, buggy as hell(Bethesda standard, I know), you constantly get errors that prevent you from logging in or you log in to the character screen then it kicks you out for no reason. In the beginning it was beautifully stable now you can't even get in to claim the daily rewards. If you get this for free try it, but don't buy it. Most of the community is very nice and understanding of new player and really goes out of their way to help you. If you get this for free try it, but don't buy it. I tried this when it was free, it took more then a month with daily emails to the tech support to get this working. And now I constantly get errors. I'm just giving up . . ."
Negative,"There are different kinds of players out there. I'm someone who's into exploration and social aspects. I want an MMO to be about the adventure o exploring the world and growing, the levelling process, like WoW originally was. I gave ESO a try because I enjoyed Skyrim but the overworld is too easy. It's boring. No matter if quests are decently written, and maybe some are, there's no challenge. Yes, there's some PvP and so-called Endgame is the actual game and I never got that far. Because I have no interest in speed running the same dungeons hundreds of times. Where's the fun in that? No different than playing a slot machine. The volcanic vents in High Isle are cool and fun to play. By far the most fun. Dungeon Finder? People run dungeons so fast you don't enjoy them at all. Say hi, bye, and collect your loot, then repeat. Where's the danger, the immersion, the fun? You might as well just open loot boxes; it's faster.I paid for the monthly subscription for a month and it made a massive difference having bag space. That was nice. And I think it's good to pay for a service you're using. But ESO isn't the kind of fantasy adventure I want to enjoy. It's like a kid's game. Very disappointing."
Negative,"I heard great things about ESO and it has an incredible crafting system which I love. But know this;HUGE AMOUNT OF CONTENT  is LOCKED behind PAID DLCs. You bought the game? You have like 65 % of the game.You want to play as imperial race? NO you can't! You need pay for that... Necromancer class? No, no, no!Pay us please.You want to learn jewel crafting ?Noppppee... You need to buy Summerset content. Be warned, depending on where you are from and what kind of value your currency has, you may need a ton of money to completely unlock the game.And the worst part is that all of that stuff is in your face.You download it, you see it and at every opportunity that game will tell you that you don't own a content and you need to purchase it."
Negative,"This is a really good game. When I first bought it I was very disappointed but I have since realised that this was directly as a result of completing Skyrim (and then playing Oblivion and Morrowind) before beginning ESO and it not meeting my far too high expectations of a Skyrim Sequel. Whilst I do not have the Summerset DLC, the publicity piqued my interest in the game again and after the announcement of Fallout 76 and my subsequent realisation that even if it turns out okay there is almost no chance I'll be able to run it sufficiently on my system, I decided to give ESO another go.As I said, this is a really good game. Don't expect it to compare with Skyrim but if you are looking for something between now and TES:VI, it will be perfect. Personally, I prefer the story-driven aspects of this game and have been playing mostly solo through the main story, guilds and Orsinium DLC (a fantastic DLC almost on par with some of the BGS expansions). However, I imagine that as I play more I will grow to enjoy the PvP and multiplayer aspects, I just have not experienced much of it yet. I also really enjoy the combat and find that this game deals with Magic a lot better than its singleplayer counterparts.However, this review is negative. The game is called Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited but this is a lie. In fact, the base game consists of just a few provinces, many of them bland and uninteresting. Most of the map is locked behind very pricey paywalls. I bought th gold edition on steam and am happy with the deal I got. The areas unlocked by these DLC are some of the best. However, whilst newcomers can purchase the base game plus the Morrowind expansion for a few quid, I am forced to go through the crown store for no reason other than it allows Zenimax to charge me effectively three times the price of the game plus DLC for just the single DLC. This is outrageous and not the way to treat pre-existing customers. Moreover, until beginning to play again I did not realise just how many mini-DLC there are. Each of these DLC block off a whole other province of the map so if I really want to have ""Tamriel Unlimited"" I need to pay extortionate amounts or buy ESO +. I would but for the issue that has prompted me to leave this review. Steam users are constantly prevented from logging in to the game due to connection issues and the servers going down. I will not pay a monthly subscription only to have the game be unplayable every other weekend.This game is genuinely good and really underrated. Please stop the greedy DLC practices and sort out the server issues."
Negative,"I really did enjoy this game for the 40 hours I had with it.  Then an update came and now I cant get it to start.  Reinstalled twice, to no avail.  From what I've read, this is not uncommon among people who got ESO via Steam.My recommendation?  Try the game, but buy it somewhere else."
Negative,"In order to get some kind of engrossing Elder Scrolls experience from this game you have to bring out the $$$ for the monthly subscription, and possibly for some other things. Buying just the Morrowind expansion like I did is kind of a waste, it's more like a paid demo version. Not only do you get just a kind of shallow, amusement park version of the island of Vvardenfell with no challenging gameplay, you also have to buy some of the actually interesting questlines separately. If you just want to look at a prettier version of Vvardenfell you might as well spend more time but no money looking for mods for the original Morrowind game."
Negative,The devs should fix the name! My suggestion:The Elder Scrolls® Online: Loading Screen Unlimited™
Negative,"Animation cancel, the game."
Negative,Don't waste your time.
Negative,If you have windows 10 do not get this game it will not work will crash on setup tried every work around everything has failed
Negative,This game is unplayablefps drop huge problem very very very laggy in pvp100 mbit internet and R9 290 4gig normaly 120 fpsDont buy and waste ur time.
Negative,"bad UI, low QoL systems, boring and bad gameplay"
Negative,I can be a gambler.
Negative,"Steam version is garbage, every month I can't login for a few days to a week. Don't buy it on Steam."
Negative,"Game in itself is fantastic and I am having a great time but it keeps randomly disconnecting me (and no, it is NOT my internet connection). It has now disconnected me twice in the middle of a solo quest, leaving me to restart from the beginning and all of the boosts and resources I have used to do those fights has been wasted thanks to having to do them all three times, now. This is incredibly frustrating and offputting. Will update if it is fixed."
Negative,"Are you living somewhere outside the US or EU? yes? then this game is not for you. Currently there are only 2 servers that is us and eu, i'm liveing in asia and having major ping issues. not once have i played a session without 100 ping usually 300>.the game and story is full of fun but for me it got overpowered by the ping"
Negative,game wont fucking launch what so ever servers are always fucking up and its not worth 130gb to not even play. wasted 30 bucks on it.
Negative,"DO NOT BUY JUST THE STANDARD EDITION!Doing so will end up in you having to pay €120+ to unlock all the chapters instead of just dropping the €60,- at the start. It's just not worth it in the long run."
Negative,"woof, only ever heard jokes about how much paywall locked this game is but after finally playing I realised yall make EA look like the good guys"
Negative,"this is bloody stupid, 43gig download and THEN you pretty much have to download it again before you can play it. total wast of time and bandwidth....bloody stupid!"
Negative,ESO is great for one thing only - house decorationEverything else is garbage - especially tech service department.
Negative,"honestly pretty crap, there was some nostalgia from morrowind, but otherwise its crap, the combat is boring and the character dialogue is so bland, don't waste your time and money on this."
Negative,"While the hype was high on this game, when I heard about the early plethora of bugs I stayed away. Elder Scrolls fans were finally dreaming of a MMO with some real combat but instead we get just another hot bar button mashing game. That format was fine in 1998 when Ultima Online and Everquest were all the rage, but almost 20 years later I want more out of an MMO. I dont want to be bored to death button mashing or spamming macros. Too much of the same old thing with a different fantasy backdrop."
Negative,"I have to say that the presentation of the game vastly exceeded my expectations. Dialogue acted on par with other ESO games, reasonable quests and story presentation for a single player experience (for an MMO anyway). It even looked better than I expected. I got to play for about 3 hours and apart from some super heavy MMOish stuff (players talking in a bunch of anacronyms referring to optimal character builds etc. all completely impenetrable to a new player) I kept being surprised with how much I was enjoying it.Then while fighting in an underground temple an enemy hit me and pushed me through a wall, then I fell through the ground into an ocean beneath the world. When I looked up I could see through the floor of the temple I fell out of.No big deal I'll just use the stuck feature, no, not allowed in this area, well I'll contact support and wait... and wait... and go to bed. I have made multiple attempts to contact support both in and outside the game explaining the situation and all I get is automated messages telling me to try the stuff I've already tried.It has been over a month and I have been unable to play because my character is stuck and support won't help me. So I have requested a refund. If you are an Elder Scrolls fan the game is probably worth trying, just beware you run the risk of been completely abandoned if you actually need technical support.At least I can take some amusement from the fact the bug that ultimately ended my short ESO experience (falling through the floor) was about as classic an Elder Scrolls bug as they come."
Negative,"At first I loved the game. I stepped away for a little over a year and the game is no longer playable. I also notice they want to charge for deleting and changing our characters. Greedy much? This is not what I originally bought this game for.Just the menu and character customization is bugged. You can only use the keyboard to navigate. You cant rotate or zoom in on character creation. There are practically no setting options at all. Its a nightmare. Than I search online and see there are way more bugs than that.It seems the devs want to charge more money and no longer want to properly fix the bugs or listen to their customers wants and needs.I am uninstalling and removing the game from my computer. What a waste. It seems the more popular a game gets, the more greedy they also get. Sad really."
Negative,"Bought the game on steam, downloaded updates for 4 hours in client, played 30 min and didn't like it (generic mmo, feels like multiple existing free to play games), couldn't get a refund."
Negative,with all this maintenance you would think the game works better but its just a buggy piece of shit
Negative,the loading screens online
Negative,"didn't catch my interest.pro:- familiar elder scrolls setting ( feels like an MMO version of Skyrim)- having a free appartment/house in the inn from early on. cons:- cash shop is in your face- design fatigue starts quickly (urns, weapon racks and gear)- I'm bored of again being the chosen one. MMO's need to come up with a better reason to be who you are.- nothing special to drag me in. old familiar pizza delivery questsI've been playing DAOC, Middlearth, Rift and some other MMO's over the years. For me ESO didn't stand out at all. I won't compare it to Morrowind, Oblivion or Skyrim as that wouldn't be fair but I've had way more fun in these games then I had in the first hours on ESO."
Negative,"For a game that is almost 9 years old, it still feels like in beta phase. Devs doesn't know the direction in which the game should go. Players are the ones testing the game for them. Its Public Test Server (PTS) is seemingly useless since the devs shuts down constructive feedback from the players and pursue to push their vision despite backlash from the players that actually cares and plays the game. If you don't want to grind and grind and grind to be effective every single patch both pve/pvp, this game isn't for you, trust me. I spent 10,000 hours playing this game. Veteran players such as myself are tired of Zenimax Online Studios and their incompetence as game developers. ""ZOS'd"" a popular term which every ESO players know when the game is not performing well, or when they encounter a game breaking bug that hinders their enjoyment. Get your shit together ZOS. WE DON'T WANT ANOTHER FROG RESKIN lIKE WHAT YOU DID IN FIRESONG DLC NOR ANOTHER GAMEBREAKING MYTHIC SET HIDDEN BEHIND A DLC PAYWALL. WE WANT YOU GUYS TO FIX YOUR DAMN GAME."
Negative,"Don't get me wrong, the game is great....until you get to champion point territory, then it becomes WoW in a bad way. You have a bunch of top level toons trying to sell runs to dungeons, which deters people from running them because ""Why would I run it with people my own level when I could make a bunch of gold carrying some noobs through it?"" Similarly to WoW, tanks think they are God's gift to the earth and refuse to let you forget that, often times throwing the phrase ""tHiS iS ThE wOrSt TeAm I'vE eVeR SeeN"" around if you're not top level, using a bunch of add-ons to optimize your damage/healing or using the best food/drink buffs.It's a shame because, before I hit Champion level, I really liked this game because of level scaling, allowing me to go where I wanted and not be too overpowered (not to mention that if i grouped up with someone higher/lower level than me, the enemies scaled to both our levels, so it worked out nicely). I wanted to like this game beginning to end, but I guess that can't happen as long as there's a market for carrying people through dungeons for a price.Side note: if you want to keep most of the things you loot, like materials, you'll need ESO plus (their $15 a month subscription) for the craft bag. So even though you technically can play without a subscription, you're heavily disadvantaged if you do so."
Negative,"not enough quests and non group dungeons , good gear is hard to come by aswell"
Negative,PVP is eso's greatest failure they should never have allowed people to switch alliances and now the game is one sided. Ebonheart act ran off with several Aldemri dominion guilds like 6 months ago and ever since they have dominated the game wiping every other faction out. the result is a very one sided game at the highest levels that is murdering the fan base as a whole. Because cyrodill was meant originally to be end game content where players could compete and now get absolutely crushed. What a disappointment after all these years.
Negative,The games support is shit unless you like getting the exact same response every day without getting any help. they wouldnt even help me fix my security question problems. after 5 days of talking i had to refund the game sense i couldnt play it any more.
Negative,"It just never really got my attention. Pretty standard fare which didn't really draw me in a more immersive manner. Glitched in a couple of quest chains so unable to complete them. Possibly a reinstall of the game would have corrected them, but due to the size of the required download that really wasn't a realistic option.Enjoyed the PVP element, though didn't benefit much from it.In spite of my lack of recent play, I would update occasionally and was excited when Imperial City downloaded, until I saw that it would be an additional cost to access the new areas and that all of my skills had been reset (seriously bad when you haven't played in a while and have no records of what skills you had chosen). Neither the price of the access from the crown store (2500 crowns . about $25) or the price of the eso plus subscription ($15/mo) is worth it to me.Thumbs down is for the price vs content. For what I paid originally plus what is being asked to access the dlc, I might as well go back to WoW again .. lol"
Negative,"Great, lock the most interesting parts of the game behind a pay wall. I HATE that this trend exists and the only reason this stuff escalates is because people are actually paying for this crap.Apart from that the game is mediocre anyway...Edit: In response to the ESO developer: ""We never add items to the Crown Store with the intention of making it harder for our players to enjoy The Elder Scrolls Online. we want our players to enjoy ESO regardless of whether or not they make a Crown Store purchase.""My enjoyment comes in great part from customization, housing, painting gear, etc... Anybody that thinks charging 21 euro for a crafting bench for your home without the option of paying for it in gold isn't making it harder for players to enjoy ESO needs to step back and think about their role in all this."
Negative,"I had to spend a day figuring out the steam ESO patcher  and manually DLing files to get it to ""unfreeze"".https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/434017/eso-launcher-crashes-on-update-9-04-2018/p18Loving ESO so much I bought a 12 mo ESO plus membership....only to find out some things with that are NOT working.  Then I find out I can not log into or link my PAIDED FOR steam ESO account with the standalone client where everything I PAID FOR WORKS.  Will NEVER buy another game thought steam!TLDR - do yourself a HUGE favor and buy this game today but NOT thought steam!"
Negative,"Its the best MMORPG game with one of the best storylines but the latency is really high and lags frequently. Furthermore, the prices of dlcs and expansions are extremely high and not worth the price. ---Update---I'm really excited and thankful that ESO team has resolved the latency and lag issues.--Another Update--Please if you love Elder Scrolls don't buy it through steam, buy from somewhere else, the installation and updating issues are really bad if you buy through steam.--Final Update--This went from best to worst. Ridiculously overpriced DLCs and the new stories are lamentable. This is an insult to the Elder Scrolls franchise."
Negative,"Are you a huge fan of The Elder Scrolls franchise? Thinking about reinstalling Morrowind or Skyrim for the 10th time while you wait for TESVI? Think ESO might be the solution? Or  looking for a challenging, engaging MMO to play? WELL, tl;dr: Any other TES game is a better TES game, and any other MMO is a better MMO. ESO has the greediest monetization scheme I've ever seen in a North American game. It seems unethical and dishonest to me that the majority of DLC content is not shown on and can not be purchased from within Steam and can only be accessed through the in-game shop. The game without a premium subscription intentionally significantly inconveniences you constantly, especially with regard to inventory management. Probably more than 60% of ESO's content requires a premium subscription or in-game microtransaction to access. Half or more of all Best In Slot equipment including nearly all of the most powerful weapons and all Antiquities Mythic items are locked behind in-game shop microtransaction DLC. Central storylines are left unresolved without additional paid zone DLCs which serve to wrap up the final 10% of the plot, like having to pay extra for the final chapter of a book or the series finale of a tv show. Entire guilds that were core content/gameplay components of previous titles (Thieve's guild, Dark Brotherhood) and their associated items, stories, zones, NPCs, and skill lines are exclusively in-game paid microtransaction DLC. And you won't know most of this unless you are reading reviews and forum posts before you purchase. Many times I have begun a task only to hit a point at which I can't progress on it any further without some DLC I didn't know I needed. Hundreds of items and pathways that can be found in the game world tell you outright that you can't interact with them without their DLCs, ruining immersion. Exp gain is accelerated by 50%+ via microtransactions and you can buy gold with real money by selling Crowns at an insane exchange rate of like 1 million per 9 dollars, which prices non-premium players out of the economy and trivializes progression in several ways. Bear in mind that everything I'm mentioning is in addition to a base cost of $101.83 CAD for the base game + main Chapter DLCs within Steam. It's whack.And in spite of how it may seem on the surface, there is frankly just not actually a ton of real content or depth here. At 250 hours I've completed the main storylines, hit max level, maxed out 5/7 crafts, levelled every weapon & guild skill line, fully geared in epic/legendary set combinations, done every non-DLC dungeon, solod most delves and public dungeons, explored every non-DLC zone, acquired legendary antiquities, and earned hundreds of skyshard skillpoints and champion points. I'm ready to move on from ESO after about half the amount of time I spent exploring Skyrim. There is a great superficial breadth on display here - the developers churn out what seems like a lot of content when you lay it all out, but it's actually just many small updates and disparate compartmentalized systems that they can charge piecemeal for. The main storylines are short and uncompelling. There is very little development of main characters and with maybe one or two exceptions none of them are memorable. You get almost no backstory on any of them and they tend to die or disappear unceremoniously. Main quest lines are replete with cliches and end anticlimactically with unlosable scripted battles. Main antagonists are cartoonish, tropey caricatures with no depth. There are no interesting twists or meaningful moralistic choices or divergent pathways or major race or faction-based dialogues or choices. And everything in terms of the writing goes in a light, jokey direction dissimilar to previous TES titles, which precludes any kind of a sense of gravity about what you're doing and makes the game feel simplistic and immature. It's the only MMO I've ever played that has absolutely no cinematics or cutscenes whatsoever, which means that you get every storyline delivered to you in its entirety as thousands of short bits of quest NPC dialog. Engaging with the stories by doing quests is the slowest way of actually levelling and gearing your character; individual quests can take up to an hour to complete, because they are long and plodding with dozens of objectives instead of being split up into a line or chain of multiple shorter quests with rewards at each stage like in every other MMO. And rewards for quests are an extreme letdown - a 10-minute random dungeon run nets easily 3x the experience points and 50x the loot of any 30+ minute long quest. This is a title with one of the richest pedigrees in gaming history to lean on and borrow from and build off of and it does not even come close to living up to what previous titles accomplished/pioneered. If lore, worldbuilding, character development and story are a part of what you love about TES, this is not that.Gameplay-wise, the first 98% of progression is extraordinarily, trivially easy. It is impossible to die or lose, all the way up until you reach the final bosses of veteran dungeons, with an elective hardmode enabled, where one-shot mechanics come into play. You literally do not ever have to engage with any mechanics whatsoever in order to succeed before this point. Gameplay can be ""fun"" in the sense that simple combat against fragile enemies means that the pacing feels quick and your hero feels powerful. There are a lot of flashy abilities to choose from, but between them you must repetitively, infinitely left-click forever as there is no form of auto-attack. ESO is very sorely lacking the environmental density and level design of previous TES titles. Environments between settlements are barren and dull. One of the biggest disappointments of playing this game for 250 hours was conceding that there is really nothing interesting to organically explore or discover. The same landmarks are iterated on over and over again at predictable intervals. Dungeons and delves are all one-dimensional and linear. Delves are especially repetitious in their repeated usage of the same layouts and tilesets. There are literally no exploratory puzzle or trap or platforming or stealth mechanics or mazes or minigames to engage with. There is no Alteration / Illusion magic system in ESO and therefore no utility spells or abilities that you can use to interact with the world or discover hidden locations. Stealth and thieving skills are likewise pared down to almost nothing and are not interesting or useful, compared to their key central gameplay role in past titles. Environmental loot is strictly vendor trash and never worth collecting; there is nothing to reward exploration. The entire overworld is completely planar with no verticality. There is no sense of wonder that accompanies exploring and discovering things in the environment. On the technical side the game was difficult to install and get running for me and is a huge 160GB download. The initial load time when opening the game is extremely long and it occasionally crashes to desktop. The megaservers seem to have good stability without a lot of maintenance and no queues. FPS performance is good even on outdated pcs. Mod support enables a lot of qol stuff but mods with dependencies with dependencies and outdating can make it frustrating to set things up. And there is a lot more that I could rant about but I'm at the character limit now so yeah. Just don't bother playing this."
Negative,Economy killed the game for me. And the devs and higher ups dont give a shit.A economia está horrenda e os devs e slá quem acima não ta nem ai.
Negative,"+Great graphics+lots of content (lots to do, explore)+interesting combat system+interesting crafting system-Boring loot -no progresion (almost none small step progresion due to scaling system, until 160cp i was shit and now i got good gear and stuff, and im still feeling like shit, im feeling like im wasted my time, there is no difference when i started to play and now) Dont get me wrong, the game is good for those who like lots to do and explore, but for those who seeks good rpg looter game ,its no good"
Negative,"It's probably my attention span. Maybe its my choice of genre in gaming. Or maybe i't's the fact that this games 24 hour newb area bores me to sleep. I literally start to fall asleep during mid-day while playing this game.I have not yet past level 9, but this game has already convinced me i have wasted my time and money."
Negative,"Imagine you you've spent 20 hours on a story that is building up to a boss fight on the moon. Now imagine you stood there naked with eyes closed and tapped light attack over and over again and you won. That's how easy overworld and questing is this game.The end game group content is 5 star content that keeps me coming back every week but I can't get any new friends to level up a character to play with me because, while the story's are good, the combat in this game is soooooo boring until you get to veteran hard modes."
Negative,"Everything feels empty and pointless. Everything is level scaled, and values start in the thousands, so you never really feel like you get stronger. Inventory is super limited if you don't subscribe. Enemies in dungeons respawn quickly and wealth/XP gain from killing monsters is minimal compared to quests/chest, so there's no incentive actually fight them and not just bypass them.Writing is bad, even without the problems adhering to series lore. I walked into a major city and got 5 different NPCs treating me like some superhuman messiah when I hadn't even talked to anyone.Character creation is awfully limited. I made a minimum height female Breton (the second smallest option) and my character is STILL taller than most NPCs. The shape of the mouth and outline of the face are so limited it's impossible to customize much. No option to change lighting. Also for some reason changing what gear preview a character is wearing during customization moves you back to the first tab of character creation (with your stuff saved), despite the main reason you'll be swapping this to see what your body proportions look like with different gear. It still uses male/female at least.Getting this to run on Proton is overly complicated. It needs to be run on 5.13-6 and a command to finalize install, and Experimental+ that command to play. Seemed to run fine after that though."
Negative,So much time and effort has gone into making this game and it is just straight up boring. It's sad because the environment in game is beautiful.
Negative,"Well, to review this game i need to play it, but some how i cant even login to god damn game !! if you are gonna play this game on EU server dont even bother to buy it !"
Negative,Update 35 killed casual play as well. what makes me the most upset is seeing that the entire community said they dont want this change and ZOS ignored us all. I refuse to give companies that openly disrespect their customers money.
Negative,"No, I would not recommend this game anymore.The ""little bugs and glitches"" may seem endearing in the first few weeks, but if you are a player looking to get into any sort of ""endgame content"", or if come from a different MMO where raiding is the solid core of the gameplay loop, you can't really be blamed for expecting higher quality.The 12-man group content is bland, same-same, copy-paste with very few actual mechanics and only two difficulty modes (veteran and normal). And no, I will not accept a ""speed run"" as a DIFFICULTY mode.Dungeons vary in difficulty from boring and too easy (normal) to veteran (still easy, still boring) with no further difficulty level except for a ""hard mode"" (usually one extra mechanic only on the last boss).There is de facto no competitive PvP, as battlegrounds leaderboards are bugged and don't display actual ranks, and Cyrodiil is an unplayable laggy mess on EU servers during any hour of the day.Patches, instead of (as the name would suggest) solving issues, introduce new bugs and problems, the latest being crashes and broken addon support (without which the game can very well be considered unplayable). Earnable in-game rewards are bland and meaningless, as all the well-designed stuff (well, not even that, but we'll get to that in a bit) is only available in the Crown Store, through either currency purchase or loot crate gambling.So speaking of the Crown Store, other than containing shameless new player-ripoffs such as Vamprisim / Lycanthropy (both of which can be obtained for FREE in the game) it contains items that are bugged or dysfunctional (weapon appearances, hairstyles that float, costumes that don't fit properly) and endless reskins of the same base mount models. Everything is ridiculously overpriced, while often being available for very short timespans only, to induce FOMO.I am not even touching on combat mechanics and physics, item sets, balancing and several other points that make this visually beautiful MMO a very subpar game.As sad as it is, I would not recommend spending any money on this game in its current state."
Negative,"Good game crippled by insanely aggressive monetization. So aggressive that the game genuinely feels unrewarding to play because pretty much everything interesting is locked behind an absurdly high paywall.This game has so many terrible systems that instead of removing or reworking they sell you the solution. The excessive greed is why this game will never become more than it currently is, playing this game feels like having someone choking you by the neck whilst demanding you empty your wallet."
Negative,"Only thing I have to say and what it has going for it is that it does have a ElderScrolls game feel. That, and the fact that a monthly subscription is optional. Yes you can go around and steal crap or even work on many different crafting skills, yet many features are behind a subscription paywall such as a crafting bag to hold your materials and the ever useful ""premium"" currency you get monthly. I personally didn't like the feel of the game as everything felt albeit forced when it comes to combat, such as with bows you only ever  hold left mouse to just shoot the things. There's no holding or waiting until your release the button to loose an arrow, just feels mechanical. Though everyone should take my review with a grain of salt as I'm spoiled by WoW."
Negative,"At the moment of writing this review, I can't even login to the game. It gives me a request time out error. How nice is that.Don't get me wrong though I love the game itself. But ZOS is not trying to fix problems like this. On the other hand, we see new products to purchase in the crown store at all times. If only they spent some time on fixing the game........."
Negative,Please consider giving players the ability to turn off or ignore pvp so they can freely learn and explore what ESO has to offer before being hacked down continuously at level 3.   I find that forcing someone to engage in a fight to simply gain stats is geared to one TYPE of player.  I regret my purchase of ESO for this reason alone.  Perhaps giving a new player till level 20 or so.. this option.  Until then..  I will give my time and money to games that do.
Negative,$250.00 bucks down the tubes. Online no one answers a simple question. Quest log full when you get to the way point the target ALWAYS says (ABOVE) or (BELOW). no one willing to answer why . 115 hours played can't do ANYTHING OR GET ANYWHERE. why pay ESO+ and only get pissed off. TERRIBLE game
Negative,"If you want to buy this game, then buy it through the official website and not through Steam. Great combat, engaging quests, fully voiced dialogue, but the servers are shit. Lag and disconnects are common place in pvp. Steam users have problems logging in every weekend. There's no way to unlink your account to play without Steam, so you're just screwed."
Negative,perma banned for bs in pvp.
Negative,"Waste of time with garbage progression and unfun bland gameplay that I would define best as aggressively mediocre. If you've ever played a good MMO, don't waste your time with this."
Negative,"If they paid me to play this game, I still wouldn't play it. Why would anyone buy a subscription for this garbage?"
Negative,Applying 60 GB patches in external launcher for hours is exactly what I was looking for.
Negative,"Before we start, I think it's important to note that ESO is an incredible MMORPG, and an all-round great game. Unfortunately, there is currently an ongoing issue with pretty frequent disconnects of steam users, every 30 or so minutes. This has continued for over a month at this point, nearing the end of the second. This is not an issue if you purchase the game outside of Steam, however.Anyhow, this is a fun game when it's playable."
Negative,"I wish ESO never happened. along with tons of bugs and problems with installing, logging in, linking accounts, opening the game second time, the game itself is not worth anything. Neither detailed and fun in gameplay as other MMORPG's nor as beautiful as other elder scrolls games. I'd rather get TESVI a couple weeks earlier than wastign time and money on this game."
Negative,"Like most of us, I’ve come to expect rich world building, engaging stories, and interesting side quests from Bethesda. I figured that since it’s going to be a good while before Elder Scrolls VI or Fallout 5 comes out I could feed my addiction with this game. I thought it couldn’t possibly be as bad as I had heard. It was. To sum it up in one word “generic,” another would be “empty.” The world space was ok I suppose, but the story was weak and I had no reason to be invested in it. Furthermore, nearly everything was a fetch-quest, I felt like an errand boy. I’ve found free to play mmorpgs (such as Guildwars 2) that were every bit as good as ESO for none of the cost. My advice to all who are interested in this game is to save up for the next real ES game, this isn’t worth it."
Negative,"A beautiful game - if you have a LOT of free time for endless grind and a LOT of money that you don't actually need because pretty much all the content, new and old, is behind a paywall. I've tried to return to the game multiple times, but you can't play for 30 minutes in peace without some premium content being shoved in your face. And don't get me started on the crown crates.I still have a tiny sliver of hope though, that someday the monetization team will come to their senses (no)."
Negative,"What an absolute let down.All the quests are repetative and basically go x, kill x, return; the same old fetch quests over and over, while several other randoms are doing the same. There is literally zero immersion.Unlike previous Elder Scrolls titles, I do not find myself caring enough to interact with characters as they all seem generic, uninteresting, and frankly disposable.The graphics are subpar for it's generation, low res textures, and low poly counts dominate a wasted HD screen. The only visual save and grace are the use of lighting and godrays which are just enough to distract you from everything else, adding to spectacular panoramic views of Tamriel. Gameplay is terrible at best. Combat is clunky and not at all responsive. The fact that every swing of your sword, every arrow, every bolt of lightning always hits as long as you're pointing in the general direction and within a generous range takes the skill out of the game. Enemies seem to have an arena style battle zone where they'll retreat to and regain all their health. Not worthy of its lineage. It's like Zenimax made BethSoft slap ES name on the most mundane MMO ever. Worse than that, it's like someone released a half assed Elder Scrolls mod for Second Life...Edit:13 hours in, still terrible. Feelings moved to a more ""I feel ripped off"", ESO feels more and more like a cheap knock off. Though it did free up a nice amount of space when I put it in the bin. Where it should be. Bethesda, it's an abomination."
Negative,"Maybe worth for someone really into MMOs, but if you are expecting something resembling a Skyrim online, you will be disappointed, the constant swarm of people running and jumping around like crazy methheads or the fact that the world seems unresponsive to your actions (you kill an enemy and 5 seconds later it respawns for another player) completely breaks immersion for me and that ruins what a true Elder Scrolls game experience should be."
Negative,Recently game has become unstable - crashes virtually every 30 minutes. until this problem is fixed - not recommending game.
Negative,"cash grabif you love the elder scrolls, don't."
Negative,"This game looks like blender models running around in store assets, runs like ass, and uses way too much bandwidth. It barely works, and the monetization is out of control."
Negative,"The gaming being taken offline for 8 hours (10:00-18:00) on a Tuesday for ""maintenance"" with another patch planned later the same week (10:00-16:00) is a cruel joke. Players are expected to pour loads of money post purchase, yet the game is constantly unavailable to players. It's beyond ludacris when you really think about it. The communit has also gotten more toxic over the years and it's no wonder the game is losing tons of players annually. It used to be a great game. Used to.."
Negative,"IF you love MMOs and TES at the same time, go on, get it.If you despise clickers, don't even think about it. Dozens of utterly boring quests await you on a pretty large complex of areas. You'll be running here and there for thousand hours doing all the same - clicking dull stuff. For those, who are enchanted by TES world this may seem interesting. For me it is just a waste of 5 hours of time."
Negative,"Alright, i love the elder scrolls series till the depths of my soul.. i didn't really listen to anyone about ESO being bad. because i wanted to try it out for myself and i said ""hey it cant be that bad,"" Thinking because its a newer year it would have better graphics. WRONG. it is NOT worth the money, The graphics are TREMENDOLY TERRIBLE. And just no. DO NOT BUY THE GAME!!! IT IS A WASTE OF 60 DOLLARS PLUS 15 DOLLARS A MONTH FOR A SHIT GAME? DO NOT AND DO NOT GET THE GAME. PLEASE. I took my own risk of my stubborness and well ..i used to be like youuntil i took 60 dollars to the knee"
Negative,It was a decent MMO and I had some fun but it's not the best MMO I've played by a long shot and the customer service is horrible I had my account suspended due to it somehow being compromised according to Bethesda and even though I tried numerous times to contact customer service I was always sent to a machine and no one ever returned my calls or messages it's like they don't give a damn about their player base at all so needless to say I'll likely never play this game again when you can put time and money into the game and they can simply take away your account for little to no reason whatsoever and then ignore any attempts for you to give them the information they ask for I'm not sure if anyone else has had the same experience but I would be careful investing in this game because it they decided for some reason your account is compromised don't expect an explanation why and don't expect any help recovering your account at least that was my case which never should have happened but oh well I'm playing much better games anyways lol
Negative,"At first I really loved this game when I bought it. I was a long time player, and it was fantastic in 2014. However, recently the game has gone downhill. The level cap is absurdly high (Champion Point system), for which you will need to grind HUNDREDS of hours to compete with end game players. But this is just to compete. Every 3-6 months they change up the meta, so you need 3-4 different characters to stay competitive. You literally can't compete if you dont play 50 hours a week every month.I get this is an MMO, but this is extreme even for an MMO. This game is dead -- don't buy it. Trust me."
Negative,"I was pretty excited to hear about this game a year ago. Just finally got to purchasing it from the sale. I am fairly disappointed and here is why. They turned a single player game into a MMO game without thinking in MMO terms. A lot of the content available is fine for single player but when you have 10 -20 other people running around in the same area, it makes a major and annoy difference.Do not get me wrong, It is a beautiful world, character creator is just fine. Choices of races /class location combination is limited , however you can throw 1500 or so crowns for your account to start at any of the 3 locations with any race. crowns do cost money however.Give you a example ""you must kill so and so"" , simple right? you stealthy make your kills on the way to your target . half way through you are still stealthing along getting imersed into your little world and out of no where Bam a guy runs into the group you are about to pick off with stealth and bow and kills them. What is the point of stealth in this MMO when it just makes you go slower and others just rush through? By the time you reach your target there are 20 other players waiting to at least get one hit off on the boss before it dies to finish quest. public dungeon is horrible for this game. Great idea but implemented poorly.  If you have a lot of paintence , try the game out if you wish, but know that it is a MMORPG so there are a lot of griefers in this game. If the producers can add instanced boss fights (which they wont) i would play again. Sadly , it is fun till others break into your little world. Stick with skyrim, oblivion if you want to be left alone."
Negative,"Buy expansions, find out expansion storyline doesn't end in the expansion, it continues in DLCs that you have to pay separately to access. What a disappointment. Just how much of my money does Zenimax Online think they are entitled to? And don't get me started on the ridiculous regional pricing on ESO+ and Crowns, if you think I'm ever gonna pay for any of those again you are deluded ZO, deluded!"
Negative,tons of hours on xbox and repurchased on pc with all dlc packs. unfortunately will be quiting for now. dev is out of touch (u35)
Negative,Somehow still about as boring as it was at launch
Negative,"very weak. played longer on xbox. its a few classes, 10,000 versions of the same quest and a cash shop"
Negative,I cant cancel my sub help i also am pissed off that it made me pay it even though I havent played in like 5 months
Negative,Played this game yesterday and enjoyed it went to play it today thinking i might get there monthly sub and ran into an 18 hour maintenance. Sadly I played to long to get a refund on my 20$ but all thoughts of getting any kind of subscription went out the window if a simple maintenance takes almost an entire day.
Negative,"Played for free online on a free weekend.  First MMO.(Update: Bought it on sale and have played 300+ hours.  My review is unchanged with one addition. Every time I play it I need to wait an hour to a day for the games updates to download... Wish another elder scrolls stand alone game was coming out...)Will online subscription games be the death of gaming?Pros:- Elder Scrolls, love their games. Have played 2k+ hours of their games over the years.- I had no problems running it on my connection or old systemCons:- MMO related-- means player mobs (hundreds!) often in the same place at the same time running every-which way. Horribly confusing and distracting. Breaks immersion-- other players kill everyone before you-- fast respawns to make enemies/boss available to others.  I have killed the boss and while I'm still looting it respawns behind me and kills me before I notice!  Often all the enemies in an area respawn before you can finish the area.- Greedy (shareware) - unless you spend real money often or get a $150/y subscription the game is very limited, even crippled. (effects inventory, classes, abilities, what you can do while playing, etc.)Conclusion:Will I buy it? Probably not. The crippleware concept is way to annoying but I might get desperate enough if I can't find a new rpg to play."
Negative,"As a long time fan of the Elder Scrolls series, I was vainly optimistic about this. However, the fact alone that Valve will actually allow a company to actually take money for content in a game, and then not provide the goods agreed thereupon for the transaction, and will not allow you to even contact customer support without going through the rigmarole of never receiving said agreed upon goods, is shameful. Bethesda AND Valve need to pull their heads out of their corporate backsides, and get back in touch with its customer base, because to pay for content, and then not receive said content, with no means of getting the issue fixed, is absolutely disgusting, I would not recommend this or any Bethesda title now or in the future to even my worst enemies."
Negative,"ESO feels really wonky and bizzare.I've been a fan of the elder scrolls from the beginning,  I really regret paying $60 for this game to pre-purchase blackwood. It took too much time to get a feel for the game and there's no way I could get a refund, probably can't get a refund on an online game anyway. After 12 hours, trying multiple classes, game just wasn't fun for me in any way. It's like they took all the boring features from previous TES games, and bundled into an online game for the sake of it. I uninstalled the game, won't even bother trying it after blackwood comes out. They got my $60, this is the first purchase I really regret in the past few years."
Negative,"I wasted 15$ reupping my elder scrolls online account to see if the game had improved since I last played it years ago. Not really. Blew a couple hours figuring out their skills system again, googled where to find an outfit changing room, killed some mudcrabs, and called it done. Then remembered to cancel the subscription."
Negative,Not what i was hoping for when i bought itGame is complicated just like all mmorpgs barely explains anything (Not main reasons to give it a bad review)the main reason why im giving it bad review because of expensive subscription that gives you a lot of unfair benefits and the game servers stayed down for more than a week after an update only for steam users
Negative,Overland is way to easy
Negative,"I have put a total of 4000 hours into this game, on both PC and console.and for most of those 4000 hours I was having fun, however currently, the developers don't fully understand what the playerbase wants, and actively goes against this regularly, they censor any critics, they don't listen to reports from their playtest server.If anyone from the combat team is reading this, we don't want update 35, and your actions directly are causing me to leave and take my money elsewhere. I'm speaking with my wallet here. #RevertU35"
Negative,"After so many hours played and I am sure many more to come, I can't fathom recommending someone this game. Why?It's because of an insurmountable growing number of glitches, bugs, and straight money-grabs that make it harder to enjoy the game and feel as if buying the DLCs are even worth it. The base game is okay to say the least, it's nothing spectacular or awing in any nature with some parts feeling just fine but others feeling extremely sluggish and unnecessary (it took me up until my 750th hour to actually want to complete it, some of my guildmates have never had the will to finish it at all). Some of the DLC stories fix this with slight visual improvements and better storytelling but gives very little in game play time as some stories can be beat within about 5-6 hours in zones that feel kind of bare and lacking a feeling of ability to explore and find interesting things. The size of these regions are quite disappointing as well when you consider you are paying $30-$40 on these expansions. The DLC region of Northern and Southern Elsweyr is an example of this where if they just combined both into one expansion it could've made sense and possibly have been worth the money since the area seemed undersized for the price point. Something else that has been bugging me has been the seemingly lack of concern about the performance issues that get worse and worse after each update and the glitches and bugs they just seem to ignore, this makes me wonder if they have a Quality Assurance team at all. After each update the game feels slower and drops in frames horrendously. Then there is the crown store in this game or the in-game microtransaction store that has overpriced cosmetics that are priced at sometimes over a $100 or more for things like player housing and mounts, and things like werewolf or vampire bites and cures that they fail to give a disclaimer of any sort about. The bites can be easily attained in-game by asking other players willing to infect you for the small price of free or by rare NPCs. The cures are even easier to attain with them being available in any major city such as Elden Root. Yet they put these in the store unnecessarily when you could do these things essentially for free. Making the store seem highly predatory especially to newcomers who may be unaware that these things can be done without paying real money.These are the reasons why I do not recommend this game at this time, go play or buy something else like Stardew Valley or something else that better floats your boat it will probably be more worth it and fun than this."
Negative,"It's probably one of the best MMORPG out there, specially after you've spent some huge amounts of money as monthly subscriptions and in-game currency. You can acces even more features to make your gameplay and overall experience better, more depthful and more pleasant. That's where your nightmares begin. Customer support is really not interested to help you solve your issues nor to keep you playing, much less investing on their products. They have their policies set on stone and will send you to review them whatever you need. They seem robots or very frustrated and overworked/badly paid people. It's a mess. I found myself lost and in need and they could not do anything, just that, despite years of investment in monthly subscriptions, currency and TIME spent on this game. They don't care. Recent announced content seemed wonderful at first, but after second thought, it got obvious it's content reused from previous DLCs. Every year is the same mounts and pets with new textures, and you ought to buy it. Everything is a rework of itself. The Crown Store is ridiculous. They dump whatever retext item they seem fit every now and then, despite the huge collection of itens they could make available. The things you want and need are never there for you when you can have it. It's a sad and frustrating conclusion to an almost 10 years experience for me. Go and play it as you want, it's a very nice game and community. Just don't put your money on it, seriously."
Negative,"Will do as fix while waiting for Skywind...whenever that one is released. Beautiful scenery. It's nice to go back to Vvardenfell every now and then.140 hrs in and decided to elaborate on my rather short review. While i'd still recommend this game to people, especially TES fans (I personally play it for the rich lore) there are some drawbacks that have caught my eye. Visually, game is as beautiful as somewhat unbalanced. While I do appreciate the fact that from a technical standpoint it's a tremendous amount of work(rigs, textures, models,fx) I'd  much prefer a smaller scale world but with more attention to detail. Better a smaller world with more variety e.g. more character animations for NPC than a larger world where you just have a default Breton/Dunmer/Altmer face that just moves its lips.Post 5.3.8 patch update. I don't want to nag but I second that this game has become almost unplayable as far as pvp and pve is concerned. A game kicking you out every 5 minutes in the midst of a trial - quite frankly this is pathetic. Even fishing/ crafting is no exception to lags. The technical aspects of the game need a serious update and revision."
Negative,"FAVOURITE MMO.Spent so much time into this but servers are real shit...spent  hours on queue to a game i paid to play ... first of all its not that i started the game and got into queue, NOOOOO i was in the game .. server kicked me out put me in a queue of 16 min then after that  it put me in a queue of 20 min again ... Instead of taking players money every month for inventory space TRY fixing THESE REAL PROBLEMS...EDITqueue problem is fixed but the servers are still shitty .. dungeons and pvp area are like slideshows and then there are random  disconnections and game is marred with microtransactions on every way possible and the fanboys defend it so hard..first try to fix the basic servers then built expansions on top of that basic fundaments rather than piling shit on top of a weak pole  which make the player base suffer.."
Negative,Could not even login. They provided no instructions on how to create an account / if you have to link your account to steam / how to do that. Never have experienced anything close in any other game. 0/10. I'll wait for Fallout 76
Negative,Paid 20$ to have this message pop up everyday;                                             LOGIN ERROR -----------------------------------------------------| Connection to server timed out. Please try again  |------------------------------------------------------
Negative,"Keep in mind if you want to test the game and thinking of a refund of this Bethesda ******* game, when you start the game for the very first time it will start the ESO launcher and downloading updates. That alone can take 2h for some! You’re then not eligible for a refund anymore as the game in steam was appearing as “playing” while downloading..."
Negative,"I first tried this in open Beta before launch in 2014. It was aweful. Grafix were horrible, it was janky and aweful combat so I gave it a miss. Sometime during a steam sale I picked the base game up for almost nothing. Had it sit in my Library for a few years until I finally was bored enough to give it a try.Now I have put a few hundred hours in since and ofc I have had some fun, else I wouldn´t have kept playing. It´s better than it was in 2014, but it´s not amazing. It´s a mixed bag.The Good:All the quests are fully voice acted, even the smallest sidequests, and there are soo many of them. I haven´t managed to finish all the quest in a single zone yet. Everytime I think now I´m really done, I stumble across another quest, or another questgiver runs up to me calling for help.The Storytelling is quite good. I´ve enjoyed playing through all the quest lines I´ve done so far. Even tho the quest design is quite basic, (Go there, click this, pickup that, rarely a simple puzzle) but the world building is good. There are also Lorebooks everywhere.And the best thing is, you can continue to quest forever after you reach max level, because content is still relevant and you get skill points from many questlines and ofc XP.That brings me to the next thing, Horizontal Progression. I love this. After you reach max level you open up the Champion Point system, which is account wide and lets you spend points in three skill trees to gain passives. Most of the passives have to be slotted, you have to choose which ones are important to you. But the best thing is, if you level up an alt, they have access to the system and your points right away. You gain champion points by gaining xp, so you continue leveling up that way.Then you have classes and they have their own skill lines, but you also can open up a lot of other skill lines and pick abilities from them. All classes can equip all three armor types (which come with their own skill lines), so you aren´t locked into cloth as a caster or plate as a tank for example.And these skill lines level up from being slotted/equipped and open up more abilities as they level. You spend skill points to unlock the abilities you want and the abilities themselves level up a few times aswell until you can morph them into one of two options. Crafting also has skill lines, you can max out every profession on one toon. You get skillpoints from quests and by picking up Skyshards scattered around the world, so there is always a reason to be out in the world and quest and explore.Because of that you will run into people in every zone, not just the latest expansion ones.The bank is shared between alts and gear is accountbound, so you can share sets between toons. Downside is limited storage space per character.HOUSING. Janky and untintuitive, but a lot of creative freedom and you don´t have to pay upkeep on your house like in LOTRO.The Bad:The game is janky AF and combat is not great. I normally prefer action combat over tab targetting, but this isn´t it.Grafix. The base game is still as ugly as it was at launch, the newer zones look much better, but still not amazing. Runs on a potato tho, I guess for some that might be a plus.Mount training. You have to train your mount everyday and it takes 6 month to fully train it (If you log in every day and don´t forget). It´s split into 3 categories, Speed, Stamina (how long you can sprint) and carry capacity (increases your inventory slots). And the worst, it´s not account wide, you have to repeat it on every single alt. Or pay an insane amount of cash to skip it in the store...Light attack weaving, what was essentially a buggy combat system at launch, never got fixed and is now a feature embraced by the community...The dungeon finder doesn´t detect if someone who signs up as a tank or healer actually is that role, so often you end up with fake tanks and healers. It´s probably hard to implement a role check because of the way classes and skills work.No gold sinks ingame, since everything is paywalled instead of being obtainable ingame with gold.Unrewarding, the cosmetic stuff you would expect to earn through gameplay are paywalled. Several hours long maintenance during prime EU time every week, sometimes extendning until midnight.Login servers acting up constantly, queue times.The UGLYExtreme FOMO and predatory monetization.All the good looking stuff is locked behind a paywall. There are only a handfull of mounts obtainable ingame but hundreds rotate on the store. Ingame armor sets, especially from the basegame are lowress, blurry and not very good looking. If you want something nice, you have to buy it from the crown store.They almost completely stopped making houses that can be purchased for gold ingame, instead it´s all crown store exlusive and they are ridiculously expensive. And to make things worse, they rotate on a very long cycle, if you don´t buy it when it´s avalable you might have to wait years till it comes back. And they are all huge pretentious palaces. No small or medium sized houses anymore.Want another armory or outfit slot? Buy it from the crown store but it´s per charcter, not even account wide.Want an assistant (banker, merchant, deconstructor)? pay 35€ on the crown storeAnd last but not least Crown Crates. They are expensive and the chances to get anything good for them is very low. But hey! You can turn the unwanted stuff into gemshards and buy what you want with that! Yeah... but you still have to buy the crates in the first place. Oh but Microsoft made us put a system in so you can earn those items in game! Yeah, you get daily and weekly endevours which are extremely unrewarding and it´s impossible to get all the current items. If you want that APex mount, by the time you have saved up enough endevours to buy it, it will be gone and you can´t buy any of the other things. you buy the base game, you buy the lates chapter, or you buy the collection which includes the previous chapters. You might think you now have the whole game. Nope... That´s just the yearly chapters, it doesn´t include all the smaller DLCs. You either have to buy all of those seperately from the crown store, or subscribe to ESO+ which gives you acces to all previous chapters and DLCs, but not the lates chapter and two newest classes. Oh yeah and ESO+ gives you the craft bag, which has unlimited storage and the game is almost unplayable without because of the insane amount of different crafting mats you otherwise have to store in your bank and inventory... You also get free crowns each month. Until Yesterday, it was allowed to trade gold for crowns ingame, but there was no official and secure way to do it. You did it on your own risk of getting scammed. Now they have disabled that. So now you can´t get all the expensive crown store items with gold anymore. Think now they will be left with a small playerbase of whales.Compare that to WOW: Only have to buy a new xpac every second year (same price as esos small yearly chapter) and it includes ALL the content for two years, pay your monthly sub and nothing is paywalled. You can farm mounts, pets, transmogs to your hearts content ingame. Does WoW have a shop? Sure, but there is only a small selection of mounts, pets and transmogs there, which doesn´t matter since you get plenty cool stuff ingame. And the oldest shop items have returned for free via the Trading Post now.Conclusion: I had a blast questing, furnishing my house, digging for treasures and hunting Dragons, depsite the jankyness. But everything being behind additional paywalls, despite having bought the game and paying a sub puts me off. I can understand that they need to make money and since the sub isn´t mandatory they need other ways to generate income. But putting ALL the nice things in the store makes the game feel very very unrewarding to play. 85€ for an ingame item? Fuck that. Can buy a bunch of better games with that."
Negative,can't play as imperial 0/10
Negative,"After playing for a fair amount of time, I cannot recommend this game. In spite of its' positive sides (pretty graphics), in the end the negatives that mostly take root in game mechanics (lag and non responsive controls) ultimately make it an extremely frustrating experience."
Negative,Game cannot be played unless you have add ons game manipulates you into buying ESO Plus because it gives you so much junk and you are tricked into hoarding it all. the final boss is inventory management if your not ESO plus member i'll still play it because of friends but that is it.
Negative,"It's totaly time and money waste. If you want make some dungeon, trials, arena or some shits you needs item sets. In order to do item sets, you need again item sets. It's like a dog chasing tail. And if you really want to able to play the game you have to pay the price every month and it's have a worst pvp system on the rpg game."
Negative,Not like TES at all. Very much as pay to play game as it uses an in game currency that you buy with actual  money. Log in issues. A 'Log in que'? what is that in this day and age. not at all a good representation of TES franchise.
Negative,is not possible to buy a game which have dlc to pay and to wait even 1 hour to play. this is microsoft shit. i cannot wait for starfield but if will be the same i will refund the money. pitty for eso because all games in elder scroll series was super.
Negative,"BAD GAMEDON'T WASTE YOU MONEY ON THIS CRAPIF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY THIS SHIT, BURN THAT MONEY. THEY BANNED ME JUST AFTER ME PURCHASING A CROWNS AND A MEMBERSHIPI SPEND WHAT IS EQUAL TO 38.29 DOLLARS JUST IN-GAME PURCHASES AND THEY BANNED ME AFTER THAT"
Negative,"A waste of your time an a PAY TO WIN TRASH. You need to buy yourself the best race, buy yourself the best class and buy yourself the werewolf or vampire transformation and smash everyone in PVP. Don't like the two bar mechanic? Just buy the latest DLC and get a ring that will give you all in game possible buffs and eliminate the need to swap bars. The game is also designed to fill your bags with useless trash just to make you buy the monthly subscription that will magically unlock you an unlimited slots crafting bag."
Negative,"The game play has remained the same for its entire life span. You will have 2 weapons both assigned a bar(where you can put abilities on and get access to use said abilities). And you fill your second bar with Dot/buff/debuff or anything that basically does things passively. Then fill up your first bar with each of single target/AoE spammable + one strong skill(like executioner, proc based ability... etc) and some more DoT/buff/debuff.No matter what class, what weapon type you use it's essentially the same for all DPS roles. There's no mechanically distinguishable differences to be had in between different abilities. Buff yourself, debuff enemies, DoT, and spam the same ability over and over again for 8 years. And those buff/debuff/DoT all come in the same 'some number goes down, or that number goes up' type of numerical conditioners. Not mechanically unique/play style changing buff or debuff. If the game gave the players more accessible 'change class' system or at least 'additional class skill line update', or make weapon abilities relevant it would have been better, but no. The player base is so thick on 'wahhhhhh everybody will play the most meta build ever only and ONLY so just be stuck with one class forever or make another tune just discard your main character with all the zone quests done!!' attitude, I don't see any change coming to this system of a hell loop. These people don't understand RPG players like all the quest completed. Making a new character just to try out different play style isn't appealing at all. How is that, the older games like Skyrim or even Oblivion give the players more play styles within a single character? You might say 'oh, because ESO is an MMORPG, can't compare this to that of a single player RPG genre'... I'd say even WoW gives the players way more options. Usually 3 specializations for each class that give the players access to a quite different(entirely sometimes) play style within THE SAME ROLE. FFXIV? Class change anytime as long as you're not already in combat situation or in dungeon/raid/trial. ORSR? Literally free of being class locked.If they are so hard pushing on one character one class system they should give each classes a new mechanic every big expansion or so. But no. It rarely ever happens.The player base being so divided by PvP/PvE doesn't help this situation at all either. Any change to an ability carries over to the other content, making hell of a mess. Both parties care about balance, but it's hard to get the right balance for both PvP and PvE. And a change for one content can and will ruin the entire vibe/fun of the counter part.A part of journey in this game especially anything story related like questing, voice acting, narration... etc are all decent, but you have no sense of getting stronger or any kind of character progression whatsoever, because the only thing that changes is the number. You don't get to have more complicated combat with new, stronger, better looking abilities with unique mechanics being unlocked related to the said abilities. Only the enemies get to have that."
Negative,"I wish I enjoyed this game more. Something is off with it, can't get into it like I did with Oblivion or Skyrm."
Negative,"I would love to play this game but the loader is broken. Please believe me when I say that there is no solution. This game is a set of problems and a waste of your time and your money. Avoid this, go buy something else, and actually find something you can enjoy and not feel cheated.To make matters worse Steam have counted the lengthy download time as play time and are taking my money. Shame on you Valve for taking money on a broken product. You used to be a decent company but not now."
Negative,"After following this game for a year, I say this game has improved a lot, the previously mentioned race imbalance, connection and crown store issues are either fixed or become less obnoxious, however, I would still list some points that I am not satisfied about:1. Boring combat system. Combat boils down to resources, since it followed the TES tradition of ""no skill cooldown"", everything either consume stamina or magicka, so the combat system feels like this: refresh buff, spam one skill and light attack, refresh buff, rinse and repeat. Not satisfying at all.2. Imbalanced class desirability, although tanks and healers always have the highest demand in every MMO, this issue is most prominent in this game. If you decide to queue up dungeons using a damage dealer, you would wait 30mins to 1hr to find a team, how ridiculous. This problem is partially caused by no 3.3. Insanely slow character leveling and gearing process, making another character is such a grind and unpleasant experience, because the experience granted is so minuscule and scaled down. In addition, you need large amount of skill point and mages guild experience, and they are only available through exploration. Last but not least, the gear set quality and disparity is very significant, and most of the good gear set are locked behind trails, thus making poorly-geared damage dealer deal a lot less damage, of course good tanks and healers will not use group finder if they can. That also means ppl not starting out as a tank or healer will likely get screwed.4. Meaningless side quests, just finish those zone quests and main quests, I spared you the precious time you needed to queue for dungeons.5. Extremely long loading time, also this game requires colossal amount of disk space (93.9G as I am writing this) Please optimize your game, it's nearly a joke now.6. Most of the 'required' features are only available from addons, typical 'let the fans finish our job' Bethesda approach.But hey, I would still recommend people to check this game out, although getting into this game is freaking expensive, you are looking at 60$ + 15$ each month (Expansions + Monthly Subscription, since there's no way you can play this game without subscription) But if you have a buck, you can try it for sure."
Negative,"Even with the updated graphics....this game is horrifyingly horrible. The only thing to do is quest and craft. Questing consist of running back and forth talking to people. The crafting is extremely simple. Gathering the ingredients can be difficult on a populated server. Just rush around and hope you happen to stumble upon what you need before somebody else does. When you do fight....it's insanely slow. When using a bow, you literally have to sit and wait while your guy slowly pulls back the string before each fire.  Although I was the same level as some enemies, I only did a teeny tiny amount of damage. They did even less to me. Therefor the battle was never hard, it just took way too long to kill one enemy. There is no way to sell and buy items aside from visiting guild stores that purchased a temporary store front that you can only buy from in one location. If you do join a guild (which I never figured out how to do) you can buy and sell but only within the guild. There are NO npcs that sell crafting material. They only sell stones that are sort of like crafting tokens. You need one for every item you make. I spent about six hours gathering iron to craft, spent about 200 on the stones, and then crafted some items and sold them. My reward....I went from crafting level 2 to level 3 and I got less than 100 gold back. The effort is insane and the reward is worthless. My favorite thing in MMOs is crafting and buying and selling items. Those two things in this game are completely broken. I'm seriously sad and want to cry right now. I was a huge Elder Scrolls fan."
Negative,"While the game has a more than fair price for the amount of content it offers, unfortunately I found the game itself to be incredibly lackluster. Relatively boring combat, made completely pointless due to how ludicrously easy the game is (I never found myself having to learn the mechanics or do anything beyond left clicking in solo PvE), and a lack of roleplaying depth or the living breathing world that I've come to expect from the Elder Scrolls franchise made this game fail to grab my interest in any real capacity. It isn't a bad MMO per se, rather it is simply mediocre, however it is utterly horrible for an Elder Scrolls game, a franchise for which my expectations are sky high. If its an MMO you're after, it is perhaps worth a try due to the reasonable price, but there are certainly better ones out there. If its an Elder Scrolls game you're after, DON'T PLAY THIS ONE.... play literally any other Elder Scrolls game. Only unless you are a die hard Elder Scrolls fan who has played every other game to completion and then some and still needs more would this ever make sense to play.... and even then you'll still likely be disappointed, as I was."
Negative,"The character creation menu gives NO useful descriptions for classes OR races. Spent 28 hours on a character that I just ended up deleting because the whole build ended up as trash hitting a wall due to the skills I wanted not being available to the class I chose, choosing based on the description which tells you nothing, and there being no way (that I could find) to change class or respec skils without making a new char and starting over or spending all of your real money on micro-transactions. Which ends up making me have to spend time looking up and researching everything just to get the build I want, which just kills the game for me. Good thing I didn't waste money on this game, god bless free weekends."
Negative,"After downloading it twice, it still does not link my steam account with the game, or the game site I made an account with.I'm yet to play it an haven't been able to get any help via support or to speak to anyone from the game developers or steam. It is a game I am still hoping one day to be able to access though for now, I'd not reccommend it simply as I have only had a craptastic time trying to access any game play.Hopefully it'll be sorted out one day soon."
Negative,I would really love to recommend this game. Honestly I like most of the games mechanics. But the difficulty is absurdly low. You never ever even have to think for a second before just rushing into any enemy in sight. That is also true for dungeons. In fact it is almost impossible to die. Basically it's a game in easy mode where you cannot adjust the difficulty. It's so easy that it quickly becomes just boring.
Negative,"I put alot of time and effort into this game and for the most part i really like it. That being said, in the time i have played i have had more than 9 million gold stolen from my account from constant inventory bugs that are still very prominent today. The worst was when it Ripped 232 hakeijo from my inventory just over two months ago. each one sells for around 20k so that was another 4 million ripped from me. I've opened up more than 10 tickets with the support waiting up to a month for a reply and if you dont message them back within 48hours your ticket gets closed. The support is the worst i've came across in any game my entire life they are totally useless. Eso+ is also a scam."
Negative,"After all this hours i can say this is the best game i've played (every ""non online"" content is great (npcs.voicelines,maps etc) the way tamriel is represented is incredibly good). that being said. the community is horrible (zone chat is disgusting most of the time). the queue times bad. they lock things behind a payment and the dlcs are getting just ridiculous (40 dollars for a card game and a new map?) no thanks. the gear system is not the worst but is not good either. the metas kill most of the game content, you will soon find that no one wants to run a specific dungeon or trial because you get nothing ""worth it"" i always play with my girlfriend so we only need 2 extra spots to run a dungeon and still the Q times are insane. also it has a lot of technical issues"
Negative,"I got this game during the free week and I honestly can't give a review of the gameplay content because the launcher system is so buggy and ineffective that I can't even login in to the game or the online Website. It says profile does not exist, but then when I try to create a new account, it says that my email is already being used for another account. Well which one is it Bethesda?From what I've seen in videos the combat, graphics, and quests can be pretty mediocre, but honestly couldn't tell you. And it took over 5 hours to download on top of all of this mess.If you enjoy Tamriel, just go play Skyrim and get the extra quest mods."
Negative,Spent 2 days downloading then another 3 trying to get it to run ... and then the free week was up. Bit of  a joke really.
Negative,Rip for asian/OCE playerscommunity is huge here idk why zos think we are poor and cant afford to spend money in this beautiful game
Negative,If Skyrim was more CORPO and boring it would be this game.
Negative,The game doesnt even start
Negative,"Meaningless progression (as in the literal sense, level 50 or level 1 it doesn't make one bit of difference for any content).Buying the game won't give you access to everything, be ready to shill out over three times the purchase price for that.Tedious, meaningless and tiring are the tree words I'd use to describe this loathsome excuse of an mmorpg.Don't waste your time with this, there are so many better games out there for you to play that don't require you to pay into the tripple digits."
Negative,"Everything in the games is run by the meta. If I could refund I would but now I'm stuck with a game that I'll probably have to play just to get some worth out of it.I don't like that you can't get creative with your build. The demographic of players is pretty toxic unless you have a friend or 2 introduce you to a good guild. If you aren't running the meta, you probably won't be on a team for long. You have to download 3rd party add-on's just to make the UI better and the mechanics more consistent.Overall, not impressed. I should've guessed that there wouldn't be much development since it's release but I'm the fool for buying it."
Negative,"this game is so boring it´s kind of fascinating.the enemies are so weak there is no need for actuall class builds or any kind of skill, just lmb and 1 hotkey.you literally can go AFK infront of attacking mobs and you won´t die.the only times i died in this game is when i got so bored that i stopped paying attention to where i was walking so i fell to my death, i NEVER died to a mob or ""boss"" in my 30 hours.all classes seem just the same, a combination of warrior-mage with the ability to heal yourself.there is no need to find a group or speak to each other, the few dungeons i visited where a race of who can kill the weak mobs the fastest.we finished dungeons made for 4 player as a duo and it was still too easy.i feel like even on novice difficulty skyrim was harder than this game...maybe there is some good end game content, but if it is hidden behind this seemingly endless pile of pure boredome then i gladly miss out!"
Negative,"Banned for no reason after 5 hours of play. What little I got to see of the game seemed alright. Support tickets went unanswered. I tried emailing - bounced. I tried calling their offices and they just sent me a phone message asking me to raise a support ticket. I have NEVER cheated nor installed cheats on any game. I didn't use in-game chat. I didn't call my character something 'rude'. All I did was walk around and try to figure out what buttons to press.Lame company. Money grabbing fraudsters.EDIT: without any explanation or interaction with the company I was unbanned but seriously, FUCK this company. I'm not wasting my time on a game that bans me randomly, for no reason and then refuses to answer support tickets. Eat a DICK ESO."
Negative,"31 plus minutes in a, ""Log in queue."" WTFFFFF??!!! I pay out of my own pocket for the ESO membership. Your current members should be priority, ZOS! Or at least accommodate members for the inconvenience! I don't care if it's, because of an event, where you try to entice potential members to pay for membership. You do not put your current members (CUSTOMERS) to the back burner. This will be the last month I PAY for membership. This is bullshit. Still in queue for ""31 minutes"" 10 minutes ago!!! This is not worth paying for membership. I moved from Xbox ESO to PC ESO. Was hoping it would be different. ""Nice"" to see ZOS still puts their members (CUSTOMERS) last."
Negative,"I am a huge  elder scrolls  fan. I love the single player games, and am a Tamriel Lore buff. When this first came out i played the beta to get a taste, it wasnt that bad, but the mmo elements  just killed it for me. ENTER Tamriel unlimited updat and the 4 day free days that we got . I AM SOLD. This can now be played as an  elder scrolls game, granted not skyrim level, or oblivion, but stil an ELDER SCROLLS game. BEAUTIFUL worlds, lots of intersting FULL VOICE ACTED  side quests , nice music, including music from the pastgames (god that oblivion nostalgia when i heard a song from like 7 -8years ago and still recognized it) I do not like mmos, i just dont. They just loose me , but this is the first i can say I enjoy becuase am playing it as an elder scrolls game, with more npcs running around doing stuff. Am sold.Having sed al that, I returned to this game in 2020, there was a free Dlc unlock trial. I just can not belvie the world here anymore. Too MMoed is the fastest way to describe it. Too artificial."
Negative,Gets boring after a while chasing the carrot
Negative,You need money to play this game. I want things you can only buy. So i would rather not play if i cant own them with out spending IRL cash.
Negative,"The questing/world-building are the pros of this game, but the basic combat mechanics make it hard to digest."
Negative,"terrible support from Steam who have double charged me for ESO plus. edit: 1000 hours of game time later - still wouldn't recommend you buy this game through steam, you will experience issues with the client intermittently. I am presently re-downloading because of one such issue so I can join a trial tonigh. stressful and unfun!"
Negative,"The Lore is fantastic, the zones and dungeons are pretty good.  At the time of writing this I have almost 2,000 hours invested in the game so believe me when I say, DO NOT INVEST MONEY IN THIS GAME!If you insist on playing with it fine, they run lots of free weekends.The combat is terrible and has gone worse over the last three years, the developer's attempts to ""add more class identity"" have created a bland mush where every class does the same thing.  Weapons for PVE are One Handed and Shield if you are a tank, Destruction Staff if you are a DPS, and Restoration Staff if you are a healer.  There is NO STAMINA DPS regardless of what people tell you all the other weapons are a lie... you have to do twice as much work to be 90% as effective as Magicka DPS.Want to play a Werewolf? Pretty much useless.  Vampire is ok... until Greymoor comes out.  Then Vampire will be PVP ONLY and must have, and a massive penalty for playing PVE.  Vampire + Stamina DPS? No you aren't allowed to do that Zenimax has decided instead if you try you will pay more for skills, have less health, and take more damage... NO EXCEPTIONS!Creative Gear sets? Only in the base game, once you get to the Clockwork City DLC they decided to just make every gear set about the same.  Quest lines? Started Blanding those out around the Summerset DLC 2 years ago.  New skills, nah let's just revamp existing ones so every skill is roughly the same.  I mean if everyone is identical you have 'balance'.  Stealth mechanics? Oh they got that only useful when leveling for the first time or PVPing...completely non-existent in PVE past level 50.  How about character looks at least? Yes out of the hundreds of outfits they put in that look about the same there are about a dozen that look decent and to get them you will have to pay out the nose.Complete honesty this game has so much potential and the developers do not.  Until they change the creative direction this game is taking do not give them a penny.  Not one!  I really wish someone would come along and save the MMO industry.  It's beautiful, but very diseased."
Negative,"Gonna give it some more time but very underwhelmed so far. A few very glaring issues with the gameplay that other MMOs have easily sidestepped1. Instancing. This game needs it BAD. When playing solo every ""lost ruin"" or ""hidden cultist base"" you delve into already has a small army of random players ganging up on the handful of mobs inside. Games like SWTOR solved this by giving the player private instances for them and their group wherever it wouldn't make sense for others to be, but not so here.2. Difficulty. I have made it to the second area, and have yet to encounter a single quest, boss, or location that gave me event the slightest amount of trouble, or required any sort of strategy or tactical gameplay to win. I doubt my health bar has gone below 3/4 in a fight even though I have yet to use my healing in combat, I havent needed to put any effort into managing magicka or stamina despite spamming abilities.3. Choice doesnt matter. Too much player freedom might not seem like a bad thing, but too much of a good thing really does turn everything to shit. There is no difference between factions since it appears you can do all questlines on a single character, every class can use every weapon and armor with equal proficiancy, which means class choice is just a different set of spells.4. Instancing. I'm going to say it again, because it cannot be stressed enough. This is 90% of my problem with this game. Even just reducing the number of people in the zone might make things tolerableGonna let subscription run down and then back to SWTOR, or maybe I'll give New World a try once it doesn't brick peoples GPUs."
Negative,"is this a good mmo? yes it is, it has tes lore, ok quests, probably the best combat mechanics in an mmo (when it works)can i get into this game this far of the launch and still be competetive?yes you can. gearing in this game is a bit different than the traditional ones. there are always easily accesable gear that performs comparable with the meta one. rest is just skill which depends on you.should i tho?nah its dogshit"
Negative,would rather walk on lego than play this shit
Negative,Launcher does not work. Stuck on UPDATING. Read online that this is a common issue when purchased through Steam. Cannot even play the game.
Negative,"Some people love the game others not so much. for me personally i am not into it. i tried it i really did. but i keep finding myself running around bored. This game is going to be awesome for the people that love the lore and like creating and being part of a guild etc etc. the fighting just doesn't feel right, i will give them credit for trying to emulate the single player elder scrolls games. But it just doesn't feel as nice, at times the timing is just off due to otherwise barely noticeable lag spikes.for the price it is at right now I wouldn't buy it again. I am kind of sorry I did. Hopefully it will get a bit cheaper in the future, then maybe it’s worth it. 60 bucks plus subscription fees seems too much.If you get a deal on it for around 30 i would say its reasonable, and if you don't mind paying the subscription. Fee to play would only make the game follow in the footsteps of so many mmo's that failed so i for one like that it has a subscription. That gives hope that the game will be getting updates and is being expanded.So kind of a mixed recommendation here, If you like the elder scrolls and want to explore the lands go ahead but don't expect skyrim with mmo aspects in it. it feels a lot more like morrowind to me when you play it after having played skyrim for days. kind of clunky but it still has some interesting things. The landscape looks interesting but like all mmo scattered with baddies that respawn after a while which only gets annoying after your pack is full and you just want to get back to a store and sell up. overall i have to say no, mainly because of the price of the game versus the actual game that you get. it's a subscribed game so they wouldn't need to jack the price that high since if you want to keep playing it you will keep paying them. but that is my opinion.Have fun either way."
Negative,Doesn't work on Mac at all. Just spins and spins. Tried various fixes offered on forums (around enabling / disabling accessibility settings) but simply doesn't work.
Negative,The Elder Scrolls Online: Collection has 40%The Elder Scrolls Online Standard Edition often goes -50%Why there is never Crowns Discount?Purchasing the game again is cheaper than upgrading it.
Negative,after spending $137 on this game a update broke it and now i cannot play it the launcher freezes every time and i cannot recieve a refund because i have 21 hours in the game.........no elderscrolls game will ever recieve my money ever again good work
Negative,"If you're like me and you love loot and collecting stuff, then prepare to either A) suffer, or B) spend a lot of money on ESO+. Without the unlimited crafting materials bag and the free added bank space with ESO+, this game becomes an inventory management simulator. It is such a painful slog to do anything once you reach the last few inventory and bank slots. Good luck running dungeons, because you'll have to stop after every group of enemies to decide what you want to dump in favour of that set piece you need that this monster just dropped.If you don't care about crafting, then it's more bearable.Also, loads of content is locked behind ESO+ as well, unless you want to buy it all separately. Each new chapter doesn't initially come with ESO+, either, so if you want to play the new content right away, you need to buy it regardless of your ESO+ subscription."
Negative,"Apparently Steam and EOS don't play well together. Have done all of the sugested steps to dial back my firewall settings for all things EOS, Bethesda and Steam.  I guess if a free weekend won't work there is no reason to spend money on the game and its new expansion."
Negative,"The latest flame of ambition DLC breaks the game for everyone but the most casual of players. ESO is also constantly recieving sledgehammer changes, thats usually bad every time. Not to mention the horrible performance, thats been worsening every patch for years. Every PVP mode in this game is currently unplayable after last changes."
Negative,"I purchased the game on Sunday July 7, 2019 and have been trying to load the game since then but keep getting error message and the the screen freezes.  I sent a ticket in today and asked for a refund.  Steam said that I have played the game for three hours therefore no refund.  If they looked at the game they would see that I don't have a character because I could not get in.   What a ripoff"
Negative,the game does not launch
Negative,really hard to get into very very grindy
Negative,"the game itself is fine enough. if you dont have friends that play you will get bored with it sooner than later.  it can be buggy af at times. but most importantly, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM. steam cause issues that will not let you log in. ive experianced this several times now. ive only transferred from console to pc like a year ago. that many incidents in that amount of time is inexcusable. if you want it, exit steam and by it from the website instead"
Negative,i walk for 5 minutes = disconect from serveri enter dungeon or any buidling = disconect from serveri fight monster = disconect from serveri try to quit the game = disconect from serveri contat the help = they didnt help me much and disconect from serverunless they fix it somehow i cant play it...disconect from server
Negative,it would be okay if the microtransaction crown currency wasn't so $$$$$ especially if you have to use it to buy the dlcto join the dark brotherhood it's  2000 crowns. atm 24.99$ For 3000 crownsto join the thieves guild it's also 2000 crowns there is a lot of dlc and they're all priced around the same. that along with not being able to play with a friend because of the login bug issue and doing one repetitive dungeon i did not enjoy this game
Negative,game is unplayable 50% of the time on steam. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM!near every day you cant login for hours or even an enitre day because steam players cant get through their login server. this has been going on since release and continues to get worse.Steam even selling this game is as close to a scam as you can get on steam.
Negative,"I gave this game SO MANY chances but I just can't play it.The combat is a spam of the same button over and over (Or a spam of the left mouse button)If you dual wield just spam Flurry over and over until you kill the enemy, not to count that there are immortal enemies, specially the guards.If the devs pull a FFXIV and just wipe the entire world and remake the game with a new combat system, maybe it'll be good.Graphics are dreadfulCombat is boring, repetitive and lacks any kind of strategyQuests are... heh--- confusingStory--- Idk and Idc I've skipped it completely because who the fuck cares.Overall a waste of money, clearly the ""Very Positive"" reviews are just botted, which it isn't surprising, afterall Reviews are a way of marketing.It's a poor attempt at a game so far, since games are supposed to be fun and I can't even give a pitty laugh at this mess.Recommendations: New combat system - Maybe a WoW-ish or FFXIV-ish combat system would be best, if not, blade and soul's combat system is pretty nice... OOOOOOOR You could just grab Skyrim that has a nice combat system and improve it...Put cooldowns on spells / abilities, since I can literally spam Flurry and kill everything.Cutscenes and a main story to follow - Random quests that don't connect at all, also if you lose a single quest you'll be lost forever... maybe a minimap / actual map that shows where your quests are at instead of that shitty compass.Classes - Why have a class if you can just grab two daggers and spam flurry? Sorcerer's spells are too slow and deal almost no damage, Nightblade or whatever that is only has one cool ability which is the teleport one... AND GUESS WHAT?! I only use it as a gapcloser to spam F L U R R Y.Races - Are there even racials? If I pick an Orc would I have more proficiency in Axes? While if I pick a human would I have more proficiency in Swords? Is there even a reason to pick a class in this game? Of course not... it doesn't even change your spawn point, you always start in that shitty ship and do the exact same things.Skill based activities - 20% pickpocket chance is not a good thing, make it a minigame that will get me detected if I'm caught... like god forbid **SKYRIM** where there is a minigame to lockpick shit and stealth ACTUALLY WORKS... Remove immortal enemies - If I kill a random NPC (Which is a good thing in the game, props for that.) I'll have to fight immortal NPCs... I mean... At least buy me dinner before softly fucking me... ALSO How would they know it was me if I killed him while hidden? ALSO! Why aren't there stealth kills? In Skyrim if you rolled an Assassin you could sneak behind someone and deal a 30x crit from behind... WHY IS THIS GAME THAT CAME OUT **AFTER** SKYRIM **MORE** LIMITED THAN SKYRIM?!Open world - If I climb a mountain I'll be met with an invisible wall--- Fun exploration guys...Mounts or Fast travel - Walking around is slow, specially if you have to swim for the next quest... Putting the game on an autowalk and alt-tabbing is not playing the game, it's just boring... specially with the most boring and dreadful zones possible, there's nothing to see, FFXIV Has the Aetherite, WoW has Flight paths, ESO has... Numlock.Pay to win - Real life money shop, enough said, now I don't know if you get skins there or mounts or whatever... but it's still shitty and in this situation I'll also admit that WoW and FFXIV has cash shops and I also think that they shouldn't... but to balance the cash shop the games are actually good... something ESO can't contest because the game is REALLY bad.Now I'll proceed to roast this game to grind the funny reacts.I'd rather sleep on a matress made out of cactus than playing 10 hours of thisI'd rather give my legs to an homeless man that live in the same planet than this abominationI'm genuinely ashamed of being human because humans (I assume) made this train reck of an MMOMetin 2 manages to have more gameplay than this gameWarframe manages to have a better combat system than this smegma ridden cock of a gameListening to every Nickleback song for a week straight would be less painful than playing this game for half an hour.There ya' go, give me all the funny ha-ha's now."
Negative,"Game doesn't run, but because I spent time in the launcher troubleshooting as the game devs and community managers told me, steam won't give a refund. First game I have ever tried to return in my entire life and steam will not do it. Lesson learnt: don't troubleshoot games. Abuse the refund policy whenever possible. Don't buy from steam otherwise. Damn thieves."
Negative,"Ill just state the reason you need to avoid this game.Long Maintenance - Specially during events ( They would have 12-14 hours of maintenance, and even then the game would crash or players would experience long character loading time and crashes - which will be followed up by another maintenance )Bugs - They haven't fixed the Dungen finder bug yetHorrible Customer Service - If you submit any ticket about any issues you have faced they will take their own sweet time to get to you.Server Crashes - This one is one of the most common issue ( The servers crashes after every event release - Players have to wait for infinite loading times and loose out to play for that whole day ) OH DID I FORGOT TO MENTION THEIR SERVERS ARE LITERALLY 12 YEAR OLDER VERSIONS AND THEY HAVE'NT UPGRADED IT Please invest your money elsewhere there are better games to be playedCurrent Update : 29 - 06 - 22 ( Getting kicked out of the server after every 15 mins! ) Im about to drop this game for good until they decide to upgrade their servers :)"
Negative,"Cant tell you if ita a good game or not as im an australian and cant log into north american or euroupian servers, well not steams shitty low quality ones anyway, i wish there was a viable alternative to dealing with steam, as an aussie we get shafted by them every time some great new game comes out, ive actually bought  an xbox and a playstation even tho i was soley a PC gamer from the day they first came out, now the only time I play pc is with non steam games of wich their are precious few."
Negative,"if you got the cash  these guys have the game. a lot of micros in this one. not that they are necessary at all but they help out A LOT. but they are still greedy and kinda hand in your pocket the whole time. the over all game play is good 8 out of 10 range but still some lacklustre game design AROUND pretty decent core mechanics. IF you are looking for a decent game that is spendy and you want to make a huge group of friends and have like 3 guilds to manage and constantly have the devs trying to upsell you on new content or old expansion content, this game will work. still pretty decent just greedy and spendy. if you are a frugal gamer this is not your game. if you are not? this is still only a yeah sure if you wana try it out game. NOT a must play by any stretch. over all give it a hardy MEH! i wish i could give it a neutral rating instead of negative or positive. went back and forth on whether to give this a thumbs up or down. there is a heck of a lot of good stuff. but it kept coming back to the money with me so can't recommend this....to everyone. so i can't recommend it."
Negative,"Very limited playability if you don't buy a monthly subscription as well as the game. You also have to buy dlc chapters and there is also, on top of that, a store for p2b stuff. Most of the things you will ever find in your adventures are worth nothing or are EXTREMELY cheap, you also need to buy subscription to hold more than what you can collect in the beginning of the game (you can also sell what you get but you might as well throw them out of you inventory since they are not worth anything, making looting much more of an useless chore if you don't constantly pay).Overall, the extreme greed of bethesda in the last years shows, monetizing their popular p2p games as much as possible, even legendary ones like skyrim which are single player. I would only receommend playing this game if you have deep pockets and you really enjoy elder scrolls lore and the multiplayer aspect."
Negative,"I got to start by saying I really like the game itself. I played a lot of Skyrim and I've gone through a lot of MMOs as well and I can say that this has all the makings of an awesome title. The combat is fun and responsive, the quests are generally more interesting than gather/kill x number of y, the level up system is an improvement over what Skyrim had, and I could go on.However, there is one thing - a probably easily fixable thing - that anoyed me to no end. The dungeons I've been in aren't personal instances for your party. There is a beautifully laid out cave with puzzles to go through and a mysterious voice talking to us all setting up for a great atmosphere, and then there's over 50 other people in it! They're ahead and behind, fiddling about in every corner of the place, it just looked silly.So yeah, instant turn off."
Negative,is is a lot of fun but they gate keep a lot of content behind pay walls although if you have no game to play check this out
Negative,Needs more clear instructions on the starting quests
Negative,Pay to win garbage
Negative,Buy it from the elder scrolls website you wont get the constant login validation request that lasts forever
Negative,"UPDATE: 2023Non-stop Error 307 and/or getting kicked from server. Not even getting into the game and getting kicked before loading character. Submit several/many tickets on the matter and no help and solution.Proc sets and Ball Zergs are out of control. They are the reason for all the latency in game. Server is in NA, probably Texas, and ping is ridiculous, especially when it shoots into the hundreds whenever a person or ball group comes by running nothing but proc sets. I subscribe to a service that isn't being provided. I gave ZOS another opportunity, but what am I getting in return for my money? Garbage storyline, dearth of content (especially PvP as I've said before if you read on through my older reviews), lack of design diversity (diversity comes from limitations, not from open access to everything), bad balancing (hybridization now makes everyone use same sets to perform at same level, tags in with reason stated before, lack of diversity), material gets old fast, game is too easy, achievements are lackluster at best (made easier with every patch/update/expansion), Devs would rather release a broken set and nerf it later than introduce diverse stat/resource-based armors. I could go on, but this game's steamcharts speak for itself. Stable, but weak and/or in decline. There's not much to keep a person engaged or competitive, especially for PvP. UPDATE: Server/Hardware update/fixThe LAG IS GONE!! Well-done ZOS! PvP in Cyrodiil for most part is smooth and playable! Looking forward to new content for pvp, but all in all, thank you for your work!UPDATE:  Ascending TideQueue to log into a game I'm subscribed to. I pay a subscription for no service. Servers are worse now, not just in Cyrodiil... ZOS, Bethesda, Microsoft... whoever, fix your game plz. Bare minimum have a functional game... not even asking for balance or new junk, just fix your game.Update: BlackwoodServers can't handle population and randomly go offline every now and thenPvP in Cyrodiil is practically unplayable most hours of the dayMythics are unbalanced, some were ok and then got nerfedNew content is defined by ZOS as changing what already exists (nerfing and buffing set bonuses)PvP still limited to Cyrodiil and 4v4v4 arenas they like to call ""Battlegrounds""Nerfing stats (Health recovery) of player-characters upon entry to Cyrodiil despite building a character to perform a certain way; so there's no more individual design or reward for building a character which performs well.ESO is trashing the gameplay design, that made it great to begin with, to reward zerglings and ball zergs who roll around spamming 1 or 2 skills with proc sets their servers can't even handle.  Western Skyrim Launch:I love the game. It has a lot of amazing elements that make it better than WoW as the two are comparable. It is mechanically sound and promotes freedom with your characters as everything is based on your chosen sets and abilities. If you want to focus on being a Greatsword-wielding dragon knight with focus on stamina and high burst damage, you can do that. There are endless combinations of gear sets and abilities that will allow you to play as you want. There are abilities that are better than others, but you can make things work and there's no pressure to be the absolute best. The game is fun for pvp because of this freedom, but it gets stale as there are no competitive elements in-game. Battlegrounds, Imperial City and Cyrodiil, that's it... there are no statistics for pvp events/leaderboards, cyrodiil and Imp city are the closest things to open world pvp you get (former:like a round-robbin MOBA with ppl as creeps, latter:farming/gankfest/zergfest), no rewards or incentive to really do anything in pvp, bg's are arenas with randoms who don't play objectives in 4v4v4 scenarios/instances, unbalanced/pay-to-win classes, too many abilities/sets that buff/heal others, and proc sets that carry weak builds/players and lag pvp zones.This is not the only issue with the game, but the state of PvP in ESO is something that severe limits its potential. What's the point of a MMO with extremely limited player versus player content? Might as well make it a single player or co-op game where you build up personal wealth and carebear empires where you're the judge, jury and executioner and everything goes the way you want. This game has great potential but the devs don't care. They see the PvP side as a bonus feature, nothing more. PvP is the minority in ESO because the devs continually fuck over the population who plays for that content."
Negative,"I feel like I spend more time managing my inventory than playing the game. The quests and mobs all around the world are so easy it's pretty much impossible to die. The gear doesn't matter because of scaling. Your level doesn't matter because of scaling either.Dungeons, at least with the dungeon finder from level ten to level fifty are so easy people just run through it. It's easy with other low level characters, no real risk of failing a dungeon, but most of the time you'll be matched with people with a high champion level. They're too strong for the content so you have some damage dealer running ahead of the tank and also possibly the healer killing everything themselves and all of the other people in the dungeon chasing after them looting dead bodies. Then your inventory fills up and you have to break things dowm, sell things, and put things into the bank to try to make room for each dungeon run. Even then you'll probably run out of room."
Negative,"It's an amazing game, but since the launch of the Summerset chapter there have been serious issues with logging in via Steam. So I would definitely suggest buying it, but not through Steam: it's not fun to stare at the ""login error"" screen for 9-12h every other day. Plus, there is deafening silence from Bethesda Studios, when that happens, they sometimes release a tweet or two saying they ""are investigating"" the situation and then keep the players in the dark. Yeah, so buy it, but not via Steam."
Negative,"I bought the game full of excitement on june 17th. i have not even gotten to the character creation screen, with all the login issues. all of my excitement has vanished. fix the game, dont just be greedy developers."
Negative,Just buy Skyrim again.
Negative,"This is more a game for casual players. Crafting, chilling, decorating, wondering. If you expect high challenges, hard PvE or challenging PvP content, this is not the game for you. Performances in Europe are horrible, most of the game tools to play together are broken between 8pm and 11pm as the game is overcrowded. There are so many lags from the server that PvP is unplayable. You need a very good computer to have decent fps in a group, which decrease over time and you need to relaunch the game/teleport again to the same zone in order to improve performances.All new content is every time focused on how will the player spend money. Costumes, skins, housing new stuff is what the developers bring to the game.The new content in order to play is not tested. At every patch players are afraid that the game will be broken again. A lot of bosses have known bugs that won't be corrected as when they try it breaks the game even more.Played for 2 years every night. Tick Tock Tormentor, Immortal Redeemer, Gryphon Heart and Battleground Butcher on many characters. I stopped playing when I saw performances were only decreasing over the years. But the shop is always full of new content of course :) If you want a shiny armor and you would like to go for easy adventure, and grab flowers, you can install this game. You will enjoy it. But after all a non-MMORPG game is always better to go for adventure in my opinion.Disappointed."
Negative,game is slow and boring gets charged for being a ruski parkoorer and killing civies is less bad
Negative,Almost fell asleep 13 minutes in
Negative,"Unbiased and fair review, written with the help of two glasses of red wine!Being a big Bethesda fan, of course Skyrim online sounds good right? So I had to try it out.After spending hundreds of hours in Oblivion long before it was made available on Steam, being a little disappointed in Skyrim and undoubtedly addicted to Fallout, I saw ESO on sale and thought, now is the time to jump in.I am left feeling torn between to things.I feel like ESO is trying to cater to people that played Elder Scrolls games as a single player experience and people that just want it as an MMO.The problem is that it doesn't excel at either.When two genres are focused in on like this it feels like a confused mess.The game often tries to tell you, its a single player game, here are a bunch of quests and we are going  to execute them like a single player game and throw in some mmo elements to make you remember its an mmo. This game constantly feels confused between genres and its very off putting.My 70 hour play-through experience was this:Constantly greeted by ESO Plus advertising.Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild held hostage behind a paywall, AFTER BUYING THE GAME!22 Million players, but how many active ? Most zones in the game are beautiful but empty.Quests are repetitive and very boring.Voice Acting across every single npc is very nice.Combat feels like most mmo games and sometimes meets the standard.Excellent soundtrack, as expected!Average story, feels forced.I don't know about you, but i think gear is a very important part of an mmo, if end game gear looks great, you want to in grind for it, right ?In ESO most of the gear in the game looks like garbage, everything that looks good is held hostage! Where ? In the micro transaction shop! Shame on you Bethesda! I will not give you the cock sucking pass that most Elder Scrolls fans will give you!Excellent lock pick system!Pick pocketing was fun!Graphics are ok, but starting to age.According to the internet the MMO tier list looks like this in 2024:WOWFF14GW2ESOBDOESO deserves to be at the bottom of that list.So glad i paid $15 for my 70 hour adventure, goodbye ESO, it was not fun!Lets sum things up.If you want more Elder Scrolls while waiting for the next release then you wont find it here, just mod Skyrim.If you want a real MMO then you have better options.Thank me for saving your time!Time for my third glass of red!Cheers!"
Negative,"Just another Grind MMO, nothing new."
Negative,why my game is lagging?
Negative,"sorry im going to say mmo a lot in this. very unprofessional but this game is so boring and uninspired that my vocabulary will mirror it.eh. its an mmo. if you like mmos its a fairly average mmo. if you dont like mmos its going to suck big time. as an mmo? eh. it really is just like skyrim if it was an mmo. its like a clunkier less interesting skyrim really. thats all i can think to say about it. combat is very standard for an mmo, character creation is terrible and some of the worst ive seen in an mmo, if not the worst, which personally drags it down for me on top of the ugly skin-tight armour and general unpleasant design of a lot of the game's elements in general. since its an mmo, expect very stiff and unsatisfying combat with even the most basic of enemies taking far too much time to dispatch. Imagine skyrim if you ran into wolves every 5 steps and each wolf took like a minute to kill. expect bland characters and writing so dull you'll be skipping through dialogue within minutes without so much as giving Generic MMO NPC #78 a chance to say a single word. except shitty business practices such as overpriced lootbox/microtransaction nonesense, on top of a paid product that ALSO has a ""gold membership"" sort of deal to boot. That's right. The Elder Scrolls® Online: Tamriel Unlimited™ not only costs money to play in the first place, but it also has the balls to limit certain features unless you pay a recurring monthly fee to subscribe to their ""plus membership"". I..don't really know what else to say. It's an MMO and anything that stands out to me I think I've mentioned already."
Negative,holy shit this fucking game is cocaine pls for the sake of your life do not play or u cant stop. 10/10
Negative,let this awful cashgrab die and make a real elder scrolls gamethanks
Negative,dont waste your god damm time or money that is all
Negative,I can't even run the game. The stupid launcher keeps showing me error 209 no matter what I do. Shouldn't such an error be fixed in 2022 ?
Negative,"From infinite loading screens to glitchy gameplay I regret having spent money on this. Between 7 hours of frustration, I would have been lucky if I achieved even a single hour of gameplay. Even then, this hour was buggy. I have eventually given up after an NPC becoming unresponsive. This game doesn't even seem fit for beta and it shocks me to see it has been going for years with these problems."
Negative,"The game is awesome and has great amount of content truely worthy of an ES title, BUT:There is severe powercreep in the latest expansionDLC Content is overly expensive, effectively forcing you to pay for ESO+Inventory management is horrible, effectively forcing you to pay for ESO+ (google crafting bag)The whaling in the store is too muchIn many areas you are forced to wait 10 seconds before loging outEven on a MVNE SSD the loading times are insanely slow, due to crap serversOn inventory issues, the game throws at you hundreds of crafting materials, yet you are capped at ~100 inventory and ~100 bank slots. You have to either waste many hours sorting your inventory or Buy ESO+, which gives you 2x the bank space and unlimited room for crafting materials (crafting bag). You cannot get access to the crafting bag in any other way.The servers are the worst I have seen in any MMO, I have lost many days of ESO+ due to server downtime for Steam users and have not been compensated in any way for this denial of a Paid service.All these days lost and they give out a single Crate to Steam users? A few weeks from now?Is this a joke?This game content is GREAT, but it is plagued by greed and technical issues.Do NOT buy this game on Steam unless it is at a discount.Update 05.07.18:The game went down 2 more times for ~12 hours each time with zero compensation even for premium members.Avoid this game on Steam and do not buy premium."
Negative,"I can't recommend this game because of the following:- requires steam client always running online, often drops connection to steam and boots you from the game. should rely on own servers to manage players like it does with game on bethesda launcher.- poor optimization, FPS and ping is all over the place which is OK for single player experience but game breaking for fights. I had issues with desyncing during the fight more often than I haven't. this game is for PvE only. - no restrictions for players in towns. as a result everyone can cast spells on you, can block your access to crafting tables or banker with their annoying summons. This one is my biggest grievance with this game. It is hard to enjoy your time when you have to constantly click on objects between flips of the wings of summoned pet or when you have to look into bears's butt at the banker's table. ZOS have to unsummon all pets in towns automatically and prevent spells as well. Otherwise my review will stay as ""not recommended"". People don't show respect to each other because no one has rules to force them into it. ZOS has to make these rules.- everything looks like unfinished product. they released Morrowind to capitalize on old players nostalgia but it has no old charm - no caves, no shrines, no nothing. everything is ""under construction"". OK, but then I visited Gold Coast during free ESO+ event and guess what - Anvil area caves and forts also non existent. They have fort Strand, just one room and then nothing. I take it ZOS thinks we won't notice it. - enemies respawn too soon. is it some kind of joke to get a boss respawn in 45 seconds after you killed it? in a closed room where you can't just escape? and he has a pet so there's 2 of them. world bosses have bug where they will reset health to full bar out of a sudden and will aggro at you while you stand there amazed at their miraculous recovery. especially pleasing if you're soloing them. I have one boss I can't kill, it always resets its health even if I stay at his spawn spot +- 2 steps. it resets health and attacks me. sort your respawn timers ZOS. fix health bug. this is not acceptable.- no regional price for crowns and eso+. get real ZOS, you can't ask for 1 month of eso+ as for half of AAA title. just for crafting bag and couple of new areas? no, thanks. this is complete ripoff- you can't purchase all game content from steam store. I refuse to buy crowns (game currency) to purchase new game DLCs in game. put it in store for real money so we can have rights for refund and for support as we granted by valve. lootboxes and ingame purchases should be regulated. - game plagued by old bugs and ZOS adds more bugs with every patch. They try to be innovative and change things in game every 3 months. That renders your current gear useless, abilitites you learned redundant and introduces bugs with old mechanics. As of patch 32 (11/2/21) I can no longer play my character as before. They nerfed my crits, nerfed Vampire power, broke sneak so I no longer can sneak like I did before (without speed penalty). This is game breaking as my build is heavily based on sneak ans sneak attacks. I had to waste many ingame gold and resources to re-craft my gear because every patch manages to screw my current setup. It seems like ZOS has no idea how to balance game so they just randomly shuffle set item properties and call it a day. if you have to change base sets may times in 7 years old game probably your game balance is just pathetic.don't get me wrong, the game is still good and worth playing if you can overcome issues I just listed. just don't expect great PvP experience or immersive RPG - technical issues and MMO nature of this game won't let you to enjoy it in full. However questing is decent and loading screens have some great scenery - worth putting on your desktop. Technical details for Linux users:I played most of the time on Windows 7 because it works out of the box and gives twice better performance than playing it with Steam Play (Proton). while on Windows I had 45-60 average FPS and my GPU almost idled. On Linux it performs in a range of barely playable - 15-25 FPS with CPU chocked on 100% all the time and GPU same idle. Same hardware but very different results. It can be hardware or driver related, people from protonDB had various reports, most of it better than mine.On Debian 10 game won't work out of the box, need to manually install outdated ca-certificates for Mozilla. Otherwise game launcher will be stuck in endless loop of loading. Then I had to disable ""esync"" in launch options because game crashed with that option on. I suspect that lead to performance penalty I've seen. D9VK vs D3D gave same performance. I simlinked game folder to Windows NTFS steam library to avoid wasting another ~100Gb of space and it works well.performance changed with last major update (patch for CP 2.0). my windows version of the game started to have audio muted for 1-2 seconds even when FPS is high and FPS slightly dropped  compared to old version. tried various suggestions to fix sound, nothing helped. at the same time Linux version feels more fluid and has no sound issues. edit. Public Dungeons in this game are the worst thing for PvE player yet you can't complete the zone without these annoying Dungeons. The thing is, it is populated by zillion of trash mobs and overpowered bosses. You would think if it is ""public"" you won't need to solo bosses, especially in DLCs where they are insanely overpowered? Wrong. No matter when you enter the Dungeon you will be alone. Good luck fighting 3 bosses in tiny room surrounded by constantly respawned trash mobs. Or if it is event time and servers overloaded you can solo the boss and loot it, then you desync, booted from server and when you login back guess what? you died and boss does not count. Just what happened to me in Morrowind Dungeon. And it happens every weekend, every event. If you want to have decent ping you'll have to play at night or early morning. Haven't seen any online game with such abysmal server quality."
Negative,Was a great game for a stretch of time. The last few updates have seen ZOS continuing to mess with combat to the point and finally just completely destroying it. They've ignored community feedback and now the community is dropping the game in massives. I'm in a couple endgame groups across PC and console and none of them are complete anymore. They've driven away their playerbase and there's no longer a reason to log in.
Negative,"A highly-refined dopamine drip-feed that consistently gates off the best areas and content behind a paywall, even if you've bought the most deluxe edition available. Certain things simply cannot be had without either paying a monthly subscription fee or coughing up additional significant payments of real money. There is nominally a way to buy Disney Dollars for ingame gold but practically speaking it's an impossibility to accumulate any significant amount without a massive time investment. Its defenders will say ""but there is so much fReE cOnTeNt"" but ignore that the best-in-slot equipment tends to exclusively drop from areas you have to pay more to access. Like cotton candy, it's a sweet but ultimately unfulfilling waste of time."
Negative,"might have been good when it was released but does not stand up to current game quality expectations.  combat feels like a button masher, graphics are acceptable at best.  I was very disapointed in this game im pretty sure DLC will not improve the experience.  Im pretty sure bethesda made their money off this one by now and i look forward to them disapointing me in future games."
Negative,"I was under the impression that the most expensive option on the steam store, which listed a number of different DLCs as being included, was the price of the whole game as it currently is. Sad to say, that is not even close to the case. It costs at least an additional $100 to unlock all of the areas/story content of the game inside of the in-game store. To be fair, there is still quite a bit to do in the areas that are unlocked with the versions that you can buy on the steam storefront, but I definitely would not have purchased if I had not been lead to believe that I was getting the entire game. So be warned. You're not buying the entire game. you're buying a stripped down version of maybe half of it. Quality of life improvements to the game/inventory, large questlines, and large swaths of the map are hidden behind very steep paywalls.It's also worth noting that ESO seems to have an issue properly utilizing system resources. In my experience you can expect 30-60 fps irrespective of the settings that you use, with CPU/GPU utilization far below 50%. Based on the forum posts I've seen, this is a longstanding issue that occurs on a wide range of hardware. For reference, I say this running a E5-1620 and GTX 970 with a gigabit internet connection."
Negative,I dislike the fact that the game cost roughly 15 dollars a month on a month to month basis.. In my mind the game is worth about 4 to 5 dollars a month with there plus package add on.. Sure they may give you a ton of crowns but the crown system just sucks you into this useless ritual of figuring out what bank/merchant to buy only to find out that it isn't a real banker or Merchant and you will have to eventially go to the in game banker and merchant to do different things. Example from the banker that you purchase with crowns you can't access your guild bank or sell items from there... You have to find one in the game to do those functions. The 60 dollars a year plus the 150 dollar a year subscription roughly costing the end player about 220 dollars a year just to be able to have ESO plus and the latest greatest update.. Its a money making scheme that cost more than hosting your own linode server to host a website at 5 dollars a month.. No thanks..
Negative,"This game has one of the worst combat I have seen in an MMO and the movement animations are not great. Since the game started (I played at original launch before it came to Steam) it seems they kept increasing the combat and movement speed to the point it feels like a Korean MMO. I tested the new class while it's cool it's execution sucks and the 'Krux' spinning by your screen is going to get soooo annoying. Oh and don't get me started on how you have to take out your weapon every time you cast (pulling out a staff to cast with a book) so dumb >.<*Edit* So I have played through Necrom and the story is pretty amazing, but I still cannot recommend this game. Story might be good but game play is still missing the mark. PS: Thanks for the canned response ZOS."
Negative,Bad multiplayer game. Too many people think its singleplayer. Also rip endgame.
Negative,"Played a little. It's a'ight.. . .Played a little more... It's a little cash grabby... All-in-all, still a'ight.. . . I love(d) this game and it makes me unhappy to have to change this review. The in-game advertising and necessity of subbing in order to have a decent experience is enough to do it however. The game world of ESO is amazing, the NPCs are voiced, the world feels alive and there's always something to do (even if you just decide to wonder in a direction because you don't remember what you where doing before or just aren't interested). The most important combat ""mechanic"" is called attack weaving. Attack weaving is using a Light Attack immediately after casting a spell to cancel the spells animation. This process allows you to skip the animation time of your spell and start another, effectively allowing you to cast spells ""faster"" therefore doing more damage. This ""mechanic"" when done properly (which requires low latency and HOURS of practice) causes your character to twitch between attacks instead of doing animations. If you enjoy weapon animations like those found in Elden Ring or Final Fantasy XIV then do NOT play ESO.Crafting Levels in ESO used to be very time consuming to acquire years ago. Being a max level Crafter was not just an achievement but a fun role to play as well. Guild Crafters where well known within their guild, players had to interact with each-other in order to convince (or pay) someone to make something you could deconstruct, unless you where lucky enough to get the trait you wanted dropped on a random item. But then they introduced ""Instant Research"" scrolls, an item you can purchase with Crowns (their form of digital currency for ESO) that immediately completes all your research. So those MONTHS you spent getting your crafting skills went straight out the door. Unfortunately it is very clear that the company behind ESO is what limits the potential for the game. Customer support is horrendous, so if you have a problem seek assistance from other players. Getting an email confirmation code to simply log into the game can take up to 10 minutes (and this is normal behavior).TL;DR""Hmmm, I kind feel like playing ESO, that is a really fun game! I could play my Sorcerer... go explore the Coldharbour to kick some daedric butts. Oh yea! There're some mages in towers I need save before it's too late!""> get on""Oh yea... I'm not subbed.""> get off. . .Played a little more... Less, but still, cash grabbyEnjoyed an experience w/o subscribing.Got a DLC for logging in for two days, that's not cash grabby. That's hope.. . .Played s'more. Game is the best in the market atm. Switching to thumbs up, it's an MMO and for anything even close to this quality you're paying a monthly fee. ESO is VERY cash-grabby and ""pay to win"" with the updates they've made over time. But this is still just Tamriel and you get to run around."
Negative,"I hate to give negative reviews based on technical issues that prevent me from even playing the game, but I have to make an except here. I've been trying to load the game for hours, including hours I've had to spend reading forums and making settings changes on my computer, updating other programs, etc. The game ran when I load the exe files directly, but, of course, wouldn't let me play, because it's an out of date version.So the problem is entirely the Launcher and the updater. I finally got the Launcher to load, by grabbing the Launcher from the %temp% folder, and now Steam even consistently properly launches the Launcher, but I can't log in, because it says I don't have an account, and that's where my patience runs out. I'm returning the game, and I'm just going to play the dozen new and unplayed games that install and run from Steam without the headache.While, again, I freely admit that this is a bit of a nitpick, my complaint really is simply a point of professionalism. If Bethesda and Zenimax are going to sell this game on Steam, then the bare minimum expectation is that their launcher is compatible with Steam and that when I try to log in, it shouldn't matter to them where I bought it.Sadly, it's clear that Bethesda has just gotten lazy, making pieces of buggy garbage with incredible lore that depend on a robust and UNPAID modding community to rescue from Bethesda's incompetence (Congrats, modders, you're unpaid contractors). From crash to desktop bugs when you used autosave mechanics in their games, to busted dialogue and broken items, Bethesda's unprofessionalism and mediocrity has gone on so long that they can't even write a working ""out of the box"" Steam launcher? Nope, not worth it.After hours of messing with it, I simply no longer have the interest to play this game. ESO is just going to be a game I don't play. And I think I'm done with Bethesda in general. I know, I know, Fanboys. Bethesda won't miss my money. It'll be even, I won't miss their games, either. That's how capitalism works. Win win.-Fist-"
Negative,"The launcher took me about 10 minutes to deal with as it was spitting out errores at the start. When i finally got into the game it already started to offer me crowns (this games microtransaction currency). I decided to ignore it and move on to make my character only to realise that they pay wall the imperial race. At this point i was ready to quit out of spite but i decided to give it another chance and continued on making my character Brutus the Docile, a breton paladin(would of been an imperial but you already know how that went).  Character done im greeted with a scene of being in a ship greeted by a fellow traveller sporting a mug of ale and terrible animations that i would compare to a game from 2005. Ship gets attacked fade to black only to awaken in a cell as a prisoner (or in this case a slave) very original. Managed to walk to the first npc using there oddly floaty movement system only to find out that there combat system is even worst. made my way out to explore and at that point i realised i had no interest in a game that has had a fraction of the effort put into compared to the scinematic trailers used to advertise this wallet leech. Not going to come back to this game until they lay off the paywalls and scummy methods to monetize this game."
Negative,"Would be a great game if the servers weren't complete trash. I have 25 native ping, on the NA ESO server I have 250 at lowest (managable) but 80% of the time it reads ""999+"". I bought the gold edition for the dark brotherhood questline and gathered 500 gold in bounty in the first mission just because it's impossible to sneak  past people who teleport around the room willy-nilly. ESO - LEARN HOW TO MAINTAIN YOUR SERVERS.also why the hell is there no OCE server? after what? ... 3 years? -Get your shit together ESO."

Negative,Horrendously reptetitive quests and grinding. Researching blacksmithing traits takes literal years of waiting across multiple characters. No fulfilling sense of progression due to scaling.
Negative,Just play Skyrim Because theres no players and you can mod skyrim so you kill children
Negative,Another mindless MMORPG leaving me with a sense  of regret for wasted time and money. Nothing new.
Negative,In one word: boring!
Negative,"I have been playing this game since the beta. I have to say I love this game, which is why I am writing this negative review. I think the game developers have gone too far on monetisation. Here are the things you pretty much have to pay for:Pay for the base game: ✔️Pay for the expansion every year: ✔️Pay for the best classes (in time of writing): ✔️Pay for all of the DLC's unless you sub; by the way, you will be spending 100's if you buy them: ✔️If you want to get a specific creature mount, you have to spend money in the crown store: ✔️Want cool skins? You then have to buy loot boxes.Swapping from their own launcher to steam, you have to pay for the game again.Almost forgot seasonal houses, if you like those houses you have to pay quite a bit for them.Want the best-looking mounts in the game? Well, better fork up $100++ for crown creates because the drop rate is less than 1%. However, you can farm these tokens in the game, but it will take your natural life to get enough for these mounts.If you want to swap from EU to NA, you have to pay for everything again what you have bought in their online store. Quite honestly, this is worse than EA's MMO SWTOR monetisation; I mean, let that sink in.....worse.....than....EA.If this has not put you off the game, then take this advice:DO NOT PAY FOR THE RESPEC SCROLLS IN THE STORE; YOU CAN DO IT IN-GAME."
Negative,"ESO is a very fun and addicting game, I have over 800 hours on a different account. I had never bought Crowns or ESO plus, but i got it for 6 months, and i didnt get the crowns for those months that i played. Im not sure if this is a glitch or you just dont get crowns for using ESO plus anymore, but it didnt give me the crowns yet i had the crafting bag and the other perks. I wouldn't recommend ESO plus as it is a waste of money since you can make characters for space in the inventory."
Negative,Ever since the recent update I haven't been able to play it always says something about not making connection with steam. I've tried contacting customer support for ESO but I got the typical answer. Down voting because I can't play the game anymore.
Negative,"Can't login via Steam, support and they suggestion are useless."
Negative,bleeping compass navigation!
Negative,"I have loved this series from the beginning. and I have hundreds of hours in Skyrim, it really is a shame that this game is more about micro transactions and sales. You cant emerge yourself into the game, becuase everywhere you look, there is an add to something bigger, something better, something one of a kind, on sale for the next 2 minutes and 44 seconds, get it now! Dont miss out! FOMO, FOMO! Flashing neon signs! No, this is not a game, this is an advert."
Negative,"The gameplay by itself is okay, but this game is is so filled with loot boxes and monetization it's really not funny anymore.  The game also has additional downloadable content that costs a lot of ingame currency that must be bought with real money. It might have been acceptable for a free-to-play game but NOT for a tripple A rated game that costs me a lot of money.Edit 20-11-2019: I paid full price for this game but if I want to play an Imperial I have to buy this race in the ingame store."
Negative,"Something about this game is good, the atmosphere, stories for example. But i find it hard to make progress in early stage, i have to travel and travel, having relentless conversations. Comparing with the Elder Scrolls V, this game is kind of boring. Maybe it will improve as the stories develop, but I don't feel like to keep trying, because it doesn't attract me at the first place."
Negative,"although i enjoy the game play and the environment the truth of the matter is that this game is tailored for the players who are willing to spend hundreds dollars a year on this game with their subscriptions and micro transactions,"
Negative,"Note: if you want to look for a guide to play the game, google AlcastQuesting: endless, you can do both side quests and main quests. They are entertaining and sometimes sad.Builds: the sky is the limit, builds change constantly due to the devs keep buffing and nerfing skills, gears, mechanics nonstop and 99% of the change is a waste of time and man power.Combat: not skyrim, don't try to be skyrim archer or assassin, you will fail miserably. Combat is a steep curve to learn (animation canceling, weaving, buffing, potion, food buff, equipments, voice coordinating (discord preferred)).Solo: moderately ok for 90% of the content. If you don't want to struggle, master the combat and get some good gears. You can solo group content if you are good, except trials (12 men run, mechanics need full group with voice chat).Crafting: takes a long time to learn all traits. Very complicated and not skyrim for sure. Requires massive storage space (eso+ subscription will solve this, but they are just milking you with this and the crownstore, so it's your choice). Best gears in game are mostly dungeon, trial, zone drop gears. Crafted gears are mostly for training and pvp.Graphics: not impressive enough but I can live with it.UI: terrible UI. I use a lot of addons to modify UI to make it look more convenient, plus the game doesn't have minimap by itself. If you want to use addon, go to Alcast page for suggestion.Performance: Still terrible and getting worse and worse. Connection will spike up to 999+ ping regularly for no reason. Pvp zone (cyrodiil) lags like hell. Better just play battlegrounds. I think Microsoft will change it by buying more server (Microsoft just bought Bethesda, Zenimax as I knew).Should you buy this game to play solo? No.Should you buy this game to fool around with your friends? No, if you don't have any veteran to help you with crafting and teaching. Yes, there's a veteran who is willing to teach you the basic and avoid the bullshit of the game.I have helped enough noobs and they appreciated it. Some took my stuffs and ran away like a thief. Some are grateful more than I asked for. I made good friends in the game and still talk to them through discord here and there. I faced idiots and cunts sometimes, but I learned to ignore them. It's not good for your health to argue with trash.The choice is yours."
Negative,"Here's my review for what it's worth... Download 70gb, download extra patches, bother to create an account and all ... Try to launch the game. Game start, get to the loading screen and then is unable to reach login server. Tried for 2 hours, various solutions, came back nearly 24 hours after to try other solutions and yet in the end nothing to do, I feel like I'm playing pokemon with error codes: they evolve all the time. I didn't manage to play or even see the inside of the game yet I got bothered to download nearly 80gb of data. Is it because it's free trial so everyone is jumping in and the servers are overburdened or is it something else? First time I give a negative review to a Bethesda product but this time it is deserved."
Negative,"Honestly, I really like ESO. However, do NOT buy it on Steam. It is just such a sick experience. I had to reinstall the game, and after an 80GB!!! download it launched the ESO launcher and that then downloaded a further 60GB(!!!!) patch. I still don't know if I'll be able to play after an hour and a half of waiting for all of this stuff.For god sakes, save yourself the heartache. But ESO directly from their website and ignore all of this bullshit from Valve."
Negative,Unable to login on weekends. Login server connection timeout.I thought this kind of nonsense in Online games ended decades ago.. Until this is fixed because apparently its an old and known issue. My review of this game through steam will be a big FAT AVOID!--For some reason my comments for this review got disabled.... why?--Seems that all negative reviews for this title have there comments disabled.--
Negative,Asia server when??
Negative,"Basically, expect the worst aspects of a free to play game, but in a not-free title with the added gouging of a monthly subscription.-Monthly subscription to offset horrible inventory caps imposed by game, selling solutions to invented problem.-Premium Currency (never earned in-game) locks significant content, both cosmetic and game-altering.  Horrific value on said currency, a single mount or pet costs $10-15 real-world equivalent.-Loot Boxes. One free to start, then only earned once every couple months for habitual log-ons, but always available for cash.-More DLC than core content.  Expensive individually, HORRIBLY expensive collectively.  The true price to get just all the maps for ESO is many times higher than the original purchase price.I play because I paid for it.  I play because friends play.  But for the starting price I only got 1/10th of a game that uses every opportunity to shove more purchase options in your face."
Negative,"Edit: After another 128 hours I've decided I will give a positive review when we can hide our shoulder pads. Because I am petty and because I really fucking hate, like, 91% of the shoulder pads."
Negative,"If you were waiting,  I'd wait some more."
Negative,"After logging in once, I can no longer log in. Wtf is this..."
Negative,"There are issues with the steam version and logging in. It seems to be getting more frequent where login will be down for half a day. Do not buy this game on steam, it needs twice the disk space to install initially because the launcher is stupid. And it requires what seems to be unstable integration between ZOS and steam to be able to log in."
Negative,"The story, lore,  and learning the multitude of proper nouns didn't interest me; neither the racials helping direct class choice, cash shop that isn't strictly aesthetic, borat-sounding cat people, & general vibe of the game. I'm just glad it was free to try so I can cross this MMO off. Maybe it's better later on but unless the game goes free 2 play with a good cash shop I won't find out."
Negative,"""Wow a multiplayer Elder Scrolls! Wonder what the gameplay is like!""The Gameplay:""An unexpected internal Error has occurred. Please contact customer service at https://help.elderscrollsonline.com"""
Negative,"Like all MMOs, this requires you to live, breathe, eat and sleep it if you want to get in with a decent community, and then all that community wants to do is play the game and judge everybody else playing the game anyway. I wouldn't recommend MMOs to most people as I firmly believe that they're brain rot.This one is very pretty, though."
Negative,"Had the chance to try it when they made it temporarily free this August. I suppose that, being an MMORPG they had to cram in a lot of stuff (gameplay mechanics, gimmics) to try to appeal to a lot of players. And I suppose it delivers for the players who are looking for an always online experience, maybe bump into some random players whenever they turn their heads.Me, I just can't get that immersed to actually enjoy the game. The acting is good, but I understand you wouldn't really want to put too much effort in writing when its an MMO. And ultimately, that does not translate into a 100% enjoyable experience for me."
Negative,"I found the game complicated and when I didn't want to spend the over 150 dollars for eso plus, the game  creators deceptively placed the people who I needed to contact (like Fighters Guild Sees-all-Colors) in the gold coast travel boat....only accessible if you purchase eso plus!  Later I found her in an accessible area! ) Deceptive. Not nice!!! This is only one example....there are others.  I found the quests intriguing but difficult to finish off... You need to go to someone else to finish off the quests and then if you forget where these people are, the game makes it difficult to find them. Result you have an large list of quests you cant finish and can't add to.  Sorry, I gave up on this game and uninstalled"

Negative,"The game itself is prerry good, around 4/5.  There are plenty of reviews about the game itself, so I'm not going to go into those aspects. If we're talking just the gameplay and the base game, I would definately recommend.However, the way that DLC and other in-game purchases are handled feels like a money grab. For instance, if you want to play your favorite race in a conflicting alliance that your friends already joined, that will be at least $17 (1900 Crowns). Want to join the Theif's or Assassin's guild? That will be around $20... each. Want to change your character's name? That will be around $20. Want to change your character's race? That will be around $30. There are tons of other examples of extremely overpriced content, some of which I would consider core game functionality that shouldn't cost real world money.Additionally, ESO isn't pay to win, as you can be just as powerfull only paying for the just game as you can paying for in-game boosts (excluding DLC content). However, you can definately pay for 'convenience' in the game. You can buy items to reduce trait research time, gain additional experience, respec skills/attributes, gain additional character slots, buy repair kits, soul gems, food/potions, additional bank/pouch space, and probably others that I'm forgetting.There are also tons of paid cosmetics, though those don't bother me nearly as much. Overall, I'm fairly disappointed to see another large IP like the Elder Scrolls series preying on its players for cash."
Negative,"ping too high for living on SEA region.its  over 290ms+game is fun with gaming vpn/tunnel. worth playing when there is no other game.and there is eso+ too for access for all dlc, is it cost even more now."
Negative,"I can't really recommend this game, because Steam is recording over 5 hours of play on this game and I'm still stuck in the tutorial. The tutorial is horribly long. But the main problem is that this game takes 10min-1hr to update every time I turn it on (with ethernet), then most of the time I get booted from the server for server maintenance. So even once I finally finish the stupid tutorial and can play this game with friends, those other problems will remain. That's a shame because I would've loved to play multiplayer in this world."
Negative,"Its okay. But i'm just not a fan of the clunky Action combat, and being locked into skills."
Negative,Sold out.Probably doesn't have much longer until it becomes a predatory data & money harvester with nothing of value to the player besides addiction.
Negative,it a different approach to elder scrolls one that is filled with micro transactions and a very slow to progress story
Negative,"I would not say this is 'negative' it is a great game, just want people to know that according to steam it is a 85gb download which is  correct i suppose, there is also about 100gb of patches hiding once you try and play.Steam will not mention this. Recommend the game but do not expect to play it until the next day."
Negative,"The game itself is great, got over 900 hours in and love it, but there are flaws. Big massive stinking flaws that cannot be overlooked. There are serious bug in the game, long standing ones, which have not been fixed.Often times after an update it breaks the launcher/login system via steam. Steam users particularly on the EU servers regularly cannot log in, and despite plenty of vitirol from the community, neither Steam or ZOS seem to lift a finger to fix it. At the time of writing there is a special limited time event running. An event I have only managed to take part in once, because in the first instance the dugeon finder was broken (this has been an issue for ages), and then when it is patched the patch breaks the Steam log in, so now I can't play at all.For now it's best to aviod this game, or buy it from ZOS directly, as their launcher doesn't seem to have the same problems experinced by steam users."

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.CONNECTION TO SERVER TIMED OUT. PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.CONNECTION TO SERVER TIMED OUT. PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.
Negative,"Weak combat. Feels like you're slapping people with noodles and they die out of nowhere.Graphics are garbage. Comparable to Oblivion.Steam downloads half the game, then a launcher downloads more so no refunds.I mean, if you really love MMOs then you'll probably enjoy this. This is typical boring MMO combat with absolutely no weight behind it."
Negative,"Subscription that I had CANCELLED still caused the game to uninstall itself!?!?! Now I gotta wait for a 200gb install all over again? If your going to play it never buy subscription, obviously they punish people for wanting to spend only some money. You gotta either go all or nothing forever wtf"
Negative,used to have a guild when the game first came out. was pretty great. eventually it disbanded and i never heard from any of those guys again. all of my playtime from that point forward is from the launcher being open on my desktop while i struggle to come up with a reason to play it alone.
Negative,"The game become boring when im lvl 50, i'm buying ESO+ for a monthn when 1st time trying this game, and i feed it's not worth, spending 15$/month just for a crafting bag in 2023? hell no...Now the ESO+ ending, i will uninstall this game...."
Negative,"- I have only played during the free week -If you are a MMO buff, you may love this game - if you're an ES fan/anyone else, you might want to give this a miss.I'm not heavily into mmos but I have played a fair bit of GW2, ArcheAge and RS. This feels like a pretty rough version of Guild Wars 2, everything from the environments to the core systems are rougher and less interesting to explore.Its just a damn shame, Elder Scrolls is so rich and unusual, but this went further down the Oblivion/Skyrim route in hiding those eccentric parts for the sake of a broader and more generic fantasy."
Negative,"I love this game, but with a broken heart I have to let this game go. The performance issues have increased dramatically over the previous months and today it has become pretty much unplayable at the endgame content. It'll work well if you just want to ride in your horse around, but if you want to experience Trials (Raids) or PVP (Battlegrounds and Cyrodil) you will experience dsyncs, disconnects, lags, etc. In the other hand, Zenimax Studios doesn't respond well to feedback. They ignore or censor complaints. And by the way, they removed group queues from Battlegrounds, yes, that's right, you can't queue up with your friends. Think about it for a second....right?! It's ridiculous.It's a beautiful game based on the Elder Scrolls franchise, with so much potential. But for the reasons stated above,I'm out."
Negative,"I just hit the veteran ranks in this game.  The scenery and graphics are what make this game.  Online really has no point.  Yes there are player vs player matches, but the dungeon missions are stupid.  Suddenly the same creature takes 4 people 10 minutes to kill because they simply say ""this mission requires 4 people"".  None of this game really requires any other people, and there is no story line contingent upon your actions.  There is no real reason to interact with another player you see running around, it's pointless to be online quite honestly.All the other aspects are interesting at FIRST, but quickly get old.  Run around in an open world, encounter random people and do anything they ask.Do that 10,000 times.  Half the time you run to one building, click to talk to one person, run back, click ot talk to another, fight a few guys, then run back again to talk and get some crappy reward that really makes no difference.TIP: The game is scripted to go ONE WAY.  It does not matter what choice you make to kill, or let someone go.  It won't make a difference.I really got bored with this game, I gave it until the veteran ranks and now I'm just trying to run past the same crap non-stop and see if I can just beat a quest that's above my level.  Really, a repetitive boring game with good graphics."
Negative,"Login issues with Steam. Just got the game a few days go, bought a copy for the wife and cant play on her first attempt. So im leaving a review while shes plays Skyrim :/"
Negative,"DON'T buy this game on Steam, buy it on thier site instead. The Steam version has way too many login problems."
Negative,Yes i love the gameplay of watching the Loading Screen and listen to Music
Negative,"It's a great MMO for casual players at least, offering tons of content and a very large world. That said, if you buy it on Steam, you'll be locked out of the game for hours at a time, usually during prime time, and there's basically no upside. Buy it directly from Zenimax instead."
Negative,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME THROUGH STEAM!For the past few weeks, every weekend ONLY STEAM USERS become unable to play for several hours at a time.  This has happened numerous times.  You will have a LOT of weekend downtime for ESO if you buy this game through Steam.Purchase the game through the official ESO website."
Negative,"70 gigs to download , like wtf and a huge amount of content is locked behind 'f2p style microtransactions' Can be a good game tho even with the outdated style for my prefference. If you want a subscription based game go play World of warcraft i don't understand how this game is trying to compete"
Negative,"First of all I'm 77 and have been online for 40 years. I've played a lot of different games over the years and for the basic game the $20 is well worth it.  You will get a couple of years of play out of it, before it gets boring. Then it becomes American greed. The add on additions cost more then the original game, and give you far less play time. Next; after playing this game for 8 years, all my purchased DLC to the tune of $140 stopped working, and these clowns can't seem to be able to fix it, and they won't refund your money on anything they sell after 2 weeks; so I'm just out  the money, because there support team sucks! They can't fix their own crap, they are more interested in selling you something then fixing what they already sold you! So, I don't recommend buying anything from these people."
Negative,"It has a little bit too much (and overpriced) DLC to be called ""Tamriel Unlimited"". Even guilds like the thieves guild and the dark brotherhood are behind a paywall, they just hid them in the ingame paystore instead of the steam storefront. You get enough fake money when you register to buy a single horse if its on sale so you don't have to grind out the massive amount of gold to get it for free. There is nothing else in the shop worth mentioning.The combat is slow as ever, but who plays TES for the combat right? All that matters is the story. Sadly only the Dominion has an intresting story and without the Imperial DLC you are racelocked in the character creation. (Otherwise all of them are generic MMO stories)In comparsion you can get more for your money in Guild Wars 2.If you think Fallout 76 has bad servers then you'll love this game."
Negative,"After almost 4 hours in post-Steam downloads of patches and updates, etc... the game feels very average.I feel no motivation to explore this world. The tutorial missions are mediocre at best and the world that I ran through felt kind of dead. Mind you I tried this back in the day when it was a closed beta... and it felt like it had more promise back then, 10 years ago .As of now, it feels like yet another cheap imitation of World of Warcraft. All the casual gamer, unskilled elements, without the ""life"" of an active and populace WoW community.You would have to be a hardcore Elder Scrolls fan to stick with this, considering there are tiers of DLC purchasing and microtransactions. And even then, you are probably best going back to Skyrim."
Negative,"Got this game as part of the Humble Monthly bundle, and I was curious. So I started the download, went to bed, and woke up to see where it was. After launching the game, it needed to update (nothing new for MMOs) so I started that and moved on. All good, right? Now fully updated, the game was playable, and I started to create my account for the game. Entered in all the information it asked for and confirmed it. 'Email address is in and invalid format.' Huh, that's a little odd- maybe I mistyped something or forgot the period? So again. And again... And again. Even went so far as to henpeck the keys to ensure I typed everything perfectly. Every time, 'Email address is in an invalid format.'So, it's now removed from my HDD. If the game isn't designed well enough to recognize an email address for account registration, I'm a bit wary."
Negative,did not work. it crashed every single time i tried to play this and every solution did not help.
Negative,took 3 hours to install in game content and now i can't refund :(
Negative,"I have an amazing internet connection, that being said I have been trying to download and patch since the free to play weekend crap went live and I still haven't been able to get in cause every time it finally says that it is done patching it goes through another set of patching, wtf, fix your crap, even World of Warcraft didn't take this long to install and patch and that game has been out since 2004 and has countless dlc (don't know the exact number) that are huge.  What is the excuse to patch then patch then patch then patch?  and on top of that I have already gotten 4 error codes just in the patching, sounds to me like they need to consolidate their download, and tbh at this point even if they did fix it I wouldn't want to go through the process again"
Negative,"THIS FRIGGIN GARBAGE. SERVERS ARE SHIET, EVENT GOING ON, SERVERS DOWN. WTF?YOU GET NO LOVE."
Negative,In 2018 I bought two DLCs. Now I just have one of those DLCs. No response from support other than automatic responses that do not answer the question. Read the new EUL and found that they claim that they have the right to take back any dlc that you have purchased. Do not trust this company. They just admitted in the EUL that they are thieves.Edit:This is a call out to all IBEW members. This company is screwing one member (at least). Cease purchasing and playing any of this company's products.
Negative,"This game is absolute shit. I played it for years. It's literally a rich man's MMO. EVERY SINGLE THING is a cash grab. Even if you wanted to no life this game and pay for things with in game currency, you can forget about it. They've disabled the gifting of their insanely lucrative crates that have anything even remotely cool in them.  Ridiculous. Don't waste your time on this game."
Negative,"First and foremost, this game has always been advertised as an all inclusive game that can be played anywhere in the world. One must remember though, that the world, according to American game developers only includes the United States of America. So, I guess, that caveat would indeed mean that it could be played anywhere in the world.If, on the other hand, you live on Planet Earth, then playing the Elder Scrolls Online can be a very much hit-and-miss affair. You will be reminded by the mostly American playerbase on the North American PC server, that you are playing on the North American PC server and if you suffer from lag in the game, you should use the other server for the European Union. These canny, mainly North American players actually have no idea where North America is located on a world map but they can point you, from whatever country you play from, where to go to get a lag-free playing existence because there is only one other server on Planet Earth to play ESO and that is the European Union PC server.Therein lies the problem with this game: two servers that host a playerbase that comes from potentially 180 countries, most of which are not located in either Europe or North America. But don't let that hold you back if you wish to purchase the game and all of the reskinned cosmetic items in it that you may want to spend a couple of hundred dollars on per DLC release. Each release, you can choose from the same items that look a little different, each time they are released onto the ingame Crown Store. You will need to purchase crowns and these crowns are priced differently, depending on where you are located on Planet Earth.Americans located in North America get to pay the cheapest prices on Planet Earth for Crowns because the Crowns are American made and even though they are digital items that have no tangible value outside the game, you will still pay less for them in the United States of America, than you will if you are located in Japan. But it has nothing to do with currency foreign exchange rates.Americans look after Americans and this game is no exception. When you are playing the Elder Scrolls Online, you will get to experience American hostility directed towards you because you have no idea of their timezones but you are expected to remember these when playing the game if you wish to participate in group activities with North American based players. They actually have not heard of online search engines and will need you to explain to them why it is, on Planet Earth, that there are 24 individual timezones of which your particular timezone is 12 hours in the future. And that's just for the time.I could mention other things like the fact that American laws do not apply in non-American countries but these cluey North American players will give you all sorts of unsubstantiated legal advice from their cozy gaming dens regarding your rights and your freedoms when playing the Elder Scrolls Online but this is tedious. If you want to invest in a massively multiplayer online game that is inclusive, I would recommend to stay far away from the Elder Scrolls Online, if you don't happen to be North American. The game is not for you but please spend lots of your non-North American currency on ESO because you will help the fat cats get richer."
Negative,"PVE part is nice, PVP = one shot garbage."
Negative,makes me download an extra 85 gb
Negative,"The game has the potential to be fun but aggressive monetisation means you're constantly chafing against some form of paywall. It's up there with some of the more egregious f2p games with how much money it expects out of you just to have anything approaching an enjoyable time.It really feels like they don't want you to play, they just want you to pay. Also, like Fallout 76 you have this ever-present feeling that this didn't need to be an MMO/Live service game. Interaction with other players is minimal to the point they might as well not be there."
Negative,"Ironically i would've been more than willing to buy every current and upcoming DLC expansion pack and enjoy the world of tamriel. But, DLC's are only temporarily available on steam until you have to buy crowns and/or directly buy the DLC's from the in-game store.I'm not a big fan of weird financial workarounds to purchase something that should be simple and straightforward. If you're on steam, this should be no problem at all. There's no excuse. Therefore they'll have to miss my wallet that i otherwise would've opened up for any content expansion that comes out. But i know why they do it. If you do it their way, valve can't get their transaction fees. Thus they get full payment. Good for you, but i'll pass. Thanks."
Negative,"The PvP is awful, and the game lacks many quality of life features available to its competitors. While the game does have some qualities to it, I often sat there playing thinking to myself 'Why should I play this game that's OKAY when there is another MMO I can play that is just BETTER?"" To expand further on how awful the PvP is: Abilities often times will not fire as a result of server lag, Cyrodiil and Imperial City are exceedingly boring Zerg fests, Battlegrounds do not allow group Que and they do not have rankings leading to zero incentive to play. Lastly, while I'm not one to complain about skill gaps, as its always means you can improve and get better, there were multitudes of things I saw that that would make it obvious to any gamer how unbalanced the game is: 1 man surviving an 8-man zerg on him as he kites them around the imperail city, equal level CP characters where one is dealing 1/5 of the damage the his opponent, etc. TL;DR- PvP is horrendous and that's my primary focus. Regardless of your rig, the server lags too much, PvE content is enjoyable."
Negative,"the combat is bad! might pick it up again some day,  if I am bored to death"
Negative,Try as I might to enjoy this game it simply has no hook. The story is mediocre and after you recognize the standard 5 Bethesda voice actors it just feels like every plot is helping the same people over and over again. Gameplay is tedious and interactions with the world/combat feel like they're a slightly delayed even with low ping times.Dev response is hilariously out of touch and just an ad for the game. Would be funny if it wasn't so sad.
Negative,"Struggled with very frequent client crashes during the latest ""event"" to try to collect the event-specific currency needed to buy the components available only during said event. And for the last hours of trying to finish this, the servers were down for maintenance for last *several* hours of the event. This leaves us players with only one way to complete the set: Pay real money for it.Ah, now I see why you pulled the rug out from under me. No, that does not make me more likely to buy crowns or DLC. It's the opposite."
Negative,"Been a fan of TES since Arena and this one just doesn't do much for me.  Some will like it, others wont.  Can't recommend it for any particular reason though; Its not great nor terrible either. Just....meh!"
Negative,Servers are almost always down. The game itself is great when you can actually play it
Negative,Cannot recoomend this game to anyone anymore.Rich Lambert and the rest of this incompetent dev team together with all managers should be replaced.Such a shame they killed this title
Negative,Don't buy this game through Steam.  There are weekly server issues.  Pretty aggravating.
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THROUGH STEAM!!!steam connectivity issues consistent for many months. Amazing game, just don't buy it here!"
Negative,"Great game, but you should buy it through eso website and not through steam. Never link the accounts together, or you won't be able to login during the weekends."
Negative,Do not buy this game through steam buy the stand alone copy!
Negative,"Won't let me make a new account to sign in with my desired email address, as it says it already is used. This could be true, but when I go to recover my account it says the account doesn't exist. Trying to find a support ticket to send so you can recover your account? ""I'd like you to sign in or sign up""Either way I want to note the fact that they don't consistently reply to support tickets according to small majority. I was looking forward to trying this game out in 2020, but I guess it wasn't meant to be."
Negative,"These are just a snippet from Zenimax's own Patch Notes (Google this yourself), many many many other skills have been nerfed arbitrarily by ~70% and have had their stamina/magicka costs increased.Patch 5.1.0: (Update 23: Scalebreaker)* Twin Slashes: Increased the Damage over Time from this ability and its morphs by approximately 37%.* Barbed Trap: The damage per tick has increased by approximately 33%, since it was lower than the base morph.* Poison Arrow: Increased the damage over time portion on all morphs by approximately 78% per tick.Patch 5.2.0: (Update 24: Dragonhold, 2 months later)* Twin Slashes: Decreased the damage per tick of this ability and its morphs damage over time by approximately 63%.* Barbed Trap: Reduced the damage per tick of this ability and its morphs by approximately 63%.* Poison Arrow: Decreased the damage per tick of this ability and its morphs by approximately 63%.That should show in a nutshell how incompetent Zenimax is at approaching and delivering balance patches. As a note, even though *some* skills were buffed in 5.1.0, every class/build across the board experienced a net -30% overall DPS. PTS for Update 24's further nerfs (ironically to skills they buffed to ""compensate"" for other bigger nerfs to other skills) shows yet another net -30% overall DPS, regardless of class/build. As if it wasn't expensive enough to get new legendary gear sets appropriate after a massive balance patch, they literally keep doing this just months apart, and yet the dungeon bosses are still the same millions of HP, and are mechanically ""don't stand in the boss aoe"" damage sponges and whack them for a solid 5 minutes before they *eventually* die. Damage sponges were bearable, to a degree, prior to these constant nerfs because at least you got through it after 3 minutes and some change, but these changes aren't improving the game at all.Normally balance patches and updates should generally be well received by the public. Do you think AT&T should still be in business if they go up and one day say ""Decreased the speed of downloads over time by approximately 63%, your internet bill remains the same."" Nah."
Negative,"I'll repeat what others said. DO NOT BUY THROUGH STEAM. I did and regret it. Constant crashes and MAJOR lag in game. If you buy it through steam, you also can't launch it without Steam which is total bogus.However, the game itself is really enjoyable and fun. A lot to explore. A plethora of quests. You get more than enough skill points from what I've heard. I'm only level 27 and I enjoying it.__________________________________I need to update my original review. Lately ZOS has spent so much time pumping out new content that the bugs continue to pile up. As of the latest patch, there is so much lag the game is unplayable. ZOS loves to point out they have 19 million ""players"". Translated into reality, that means over the life of the game 19 million accounts have been created.They would rather spend their time policing an adult game and treating their customers like 3 year olds; spitting out new content that is riddled with bugs on release and takes months to fix; and just looking at how they can milk every single customer dry, than actually fix the bugs in the game and make it playable. A few patches ago they made wildly explosive changes to the way the game was setup and a TON of players left. Since then the lag continues to get worse, bugs continue to go unaddressed, and ZOSes target audience is the MMO hopper rather than the long term player. The creative director has also stopped just short of admitting that the game is written with spaghetti code, which is why the lag is so bad."
Negative,"I bet the game would be ok, if at least I could log in into it. Steam version contantly has log in issues. I hope Bethesda does something FAST about it. You pay for the base game, pay for a subscription (mine case) and yet, you're unable to even ACCESS the game. Welcome to 2018."
Negative,"1.) Dungeon finder is broken and has been for several months. Sometimes you don't get the bonus award for completing a random dungeon, or you get ported out of the dungeon for no reason at all, or you are stuck in an endless queue for a dungeon until you leave the queue and requeue.2.) Small number of active abilities (10+ 2 ultimates) makes combat very repetitive. Even if you cycle out the abilities for others, it still doesn't mater since you will be only using either the abilities that you enjoy to use or the ones that are ideal for a certain build3.) You are at a gameplay disadvantage if you aren't a subscriber. 10% less exp gained, 10% less gold gained, and can't access the craft bag (holds crafting items and has unlimited slots)4.) PVP is rediculously imbalanced. OP builds can easily 1-2 shot you making it extremely frustrating."
Negative,"The game is boring and dull. I really don't recommend it.I don't know how it continues to go on this long, but then I remember most MMOs value your time more than your enjoyment because the more time you're in game the longer they can ask you for money and say you don't own anything you're paying for all of which is useless and not fun. Because they don't value fun. There's not enough money in fun.Now, though, I can't even play the game because it now won't let me install it. It says my hard drive has 0 space when I have more space than six MMOs could ever need.A bad game made worse by being complicated to install. Waste of my time. This game will never get my recommendation."
Negative,Why is the patch as big as the game? Hmm? 87gb game and the patch is 70+ gb. What the cinnamon toast crunch is this bullshit? Zenimax this is a complete waste of time and hides the true wait time to play.
Negative,"Ok, back to playing skyrim"
Negative,Game is too slow. The world is massive and you have to travel a lot plus do a lot of boring tasks on foot. If you have a lot of time on your hands it might appeal to you.
Negative,"If you're after an MMORPG with no sense of progression, then this is the MMO for you."
Negative,"El nuevo precio de la subscripcion para Argentina es una estafa, fue de $ 149 pesos a $ 2599 pesos, me acaban de cobrar sin ningún aviso del cambio de precio.The new price of the subscription for Argentina is a ripoff, it went from $ 149 ARS to $ 2599 ARS, I just got charged without any warning of the price change."
Negative,"I can't create an account. Every time I attempt to register it tells me there was an internal error, and to contact customer service. Contacting Bethesda's customer service requires logging into an account. If I could get a refund, I would have done so already.None of this should be necessary. I am already authenticated through Steam. Valve should disallow the sale of any products on Steam that require signing up with a secondary account."
Negative,"Game is so bad. Was enjoying my first 10 hours. Then I realized something. Something was off... then it hit me in the face! I have been pressing the same combos and buttons on my keyboard from my first hour, and will likely do so for the remainder of the game. Was a mage with that chain lightning and autokill lightning. Press chain lightning, attack, chain lightning, then use autokill. Rinse, repeat, and you will be doing this for the REMAINDER of the game. All these new combos and skill upgrades? They arent worth shit-because-wait for it- ALL ENEMIES ARE THE SAME FREAKING COPIES OF EACH OTHER, just with a different coat of paint. Every enemy is basically 2 hits of chain lightning, 3 normal attacks, and 1 autokill. Ever. Every enemy. From a golbin to a bandit, to weird morrowind creatures. Every. Friggin. Enemy is dispatched by the same number of combos. Its insanely boring, insanely insane. Those guys that have spent 1k hours on this pressing the same button over and over again-is insane. One might argue that they can try different skill sets, something like, 2 blizzards, 1 chain lightning, and 3 normal attacks. Its still the same fucking thing. Now this wouldve been fun-IF ONLY THE ENEMIES WERENT AS CUPCAKE EAZY. Nothing can kill you on this game, or rather, in the overworld. I literally stood still while 3 creatures are gnawing at me. I just... never died, and were easily dispatched by the same combo. You will not be using your brain or anything in this game, its a button pressing game masked as an elder scrolls game. Its too easy its not even funny. Others would say ""try dungeons and endgame blabla"" oh fuck off. You mean to say, the end game dungeons, of which is like 10% of the game, is the only thing that even has CHALLENGE? The overworld? Of which you spend like most of your friggin hours, and in the dungeons as well, ITS TOO PISSPOOR EASY. Oh, and do not make me start on how you get weaker as you level :)) Or how insanely boring doing dungeons are :)Tried dungeoning, trying to complete my armor set. Then I again realized something. Every time I level, the armor pieces of the set im farming, becomes weaker, and I would have to again farm for the same pieces so it gets matched with my level, the problem is, I leveled again, so that means, the pieces I gathered are again useless. Got this rare armor set from a dungeon?? OH HOW COOL. Now level up. Bam. Worthless-cause you would get more use from armors of your level, and BECAUSE LOOT is tied to your level. This was the deal breaker for me. That warrior that just started at level 1 is almost, if not, more powerful than your level 25 toon, because you get weaker as you level. That shiny rare armor you got? Useless by the time you reach the next level. Now do that for 60 more levels, until you reach the endgame, which takes, weeks, if you are non stop playing. Armor builds are literally useless until you reach max level, at which point (I assume, at 650 or something post-levels-forgot what theyre called) I assume once you reach the max level (Post-level, CP's I think) once you reach this, only then will armors and armor build matter because at this point the loot is now static. Trash game."
Negative,you can chat with others in the game but that's it. There are no mission or scenario need to play with others. All I need to do is kill the mission required target and return to the NPC or even talk with NPC all the time.   Good thing is that you can play whenever you like to but bad thing is that you feel like you are playing offline game all the time. This game needs to improve a lot especially on game playing and coo mission.
Negative,Clunky and unintuitive. If you're expecting Skyrim or Oblivion you're not going to get it.
Negative,"Thinking MMO's are not for me, maybe something else would turn me on the the genre, this wasn't it..."
Negative,stop giving them money
Negative,"It's ok if you like fishing, the rest of the game is completely broken and it's only getting worse"
Negative,Boooring and Grindy
Negative,Not an Elder Scrolls game!
Negative,Used to be fun but is now so full of cheaters and a-holes with something bad to say it's just not worth the time anymore.
Negative,Download the game from the actual site. Steam edition has issues.
Negative,"Skyrim, but bigger and with more issues and online with whiny little kids"
Negative,"Morrowind created an unbalanced experience for those who do not have enough money to upgrade.  Warden, the new class, is much better than all the rest, and Morrowind allows others to gain skill points etc. faster.  This makes those who cannot afford the 40$ expansion (Double what I payed for the game) at a huge disadvantage.Zenimax finally released a major update just to make it Pay to Play.  The game used to be a lot of fun, but the developers ruined it."
Negative,"I've been wanting to purchase this game for months and when it finally came on free to play weekend, I downloaded the game instantly(well after 5 hours or 60 gbs). First thing that grinded my gears was that every time i try to login I get an error. Luckily after trying over and over again it will finally let you in. Next I wanted to be able to play with my mates, but wait when you search for your mate it says hes unavailable. But i know he is because were on discord talking so hes 100% online. So the only way I could add my mate to my friends list and group is by finding him in game which took awhile. Then once added your mate if you want to teleport close to him, It doesnt work! My game ended up crashing or it takes you the waypoint of the mission your mate is on. Super boring gameplay and not even worth the stoopid headache this game creates. Imagine the Gta V loading times plus call of duty infinite warfare. Skip this game and just stick to Skyrim. Not even worth the money if it is on sale."
Negative,"There are no complaints to the game itself, everything is fine, there are no ugly boobs and asses, an interesting universe and the most important is a pleasant community, but there are problems specifically the STEAM- version of the game, very poor service and often there are no servacs available. Do not make a mistake and DO NOT BUY STEAM-VERSION OF THE GAME, BUY ONLY ON THE OFFICIAL SITE!К самой игре претензий нет, все хорошо, нет уродливых сисек и задниц, интересная вселенная и самое главное приятное комьюнити, но есть проблемы конкретно СТИМ версией игры, бывает не доступны серваки, бывает с обновой перекачивает всю игру заново. Не делайте ошибку и НЕ ПОКУПАЙТЕ СТИМ-ВЕРСИЮ ИГРЫ, ПОКУПАЙТЕ ТОЛЬКО НА ОФИЦИАЛЬНОМ САЙТЕ!"
Negative,"Just getting worse as time goes on. severs are sooooo goddamn slow pvp isnt playable due to this and pve is frustrating as hell when youre just staring at a monster waiting for youre damn lava whip to appear and activate for 3 whole secs after pressing the key, the servers where just passable the last time i played about a year + ago.. (how does this happen? are they shutting servers down or doing something to save money on servers???), more add-ons/dlc to keep track of than any other game out today. sub fee is double the price of the main game when its on sale. if you support this game with micro transactions or a $15 a month sub fee youre the lowest trash of this community and should be shunned and laughed at for making this hobby so fucking stupid and for giving devs like this NO REASON TO DO BETTER WHEN YOURE BUYING PILES OF FECES WILLINGLY AND HAPPILY LIKE A DONKEYBRAINED INBREED."
Negative,Do Not buy this game on Steam constant downtime due to not being able to log on.
Negative,"Had fun at first, but it gets obvious that nothing means anything on this game. Everything seems to be designed to make you spend real money."
Negative,"Essentials like access to depositing resources into a resource bag are kept behind a paywall (you'll never fit them in your bank).  No auctionhouse as to dump said resources and buy back later when you need them.  I found the game unplayable not being a member, even though I paid for the game as opposed to some games that give you the software free.  If you want a better experience, Guildwars 2 offers more for less.  They may fix this later, but from all the MMO's I've played, I felt like this was a waste.  Shame."
Negative,"This game is a parasite that sucks you for money. Whenever you instance in anywhere you get constant ads trying to sell you crowns. There are several small DLC packages placed behind several paywalls. the game has a box price AND a monthly sub. If you are going to have both, you better make d*** sure players have access to all dungeons, guilds and systems. I understand the larger expansions need a box price, but the monetization in this game is ludicrous. And hey if you love the game don't listen to me, buy all the things. Cash hungry, ad shoveling parasitic games just aren't for me."
Negative,"I hate to give this game a No. I love this game, I fell in love with MMOs again. Yet I cannot play it! It has given me more trouble than any other game to install and actually make it run. The game either crashes spontaneously, black screens with and gets stuck or simply stays in the endless Logging in... The whole weekend!WHYYY? I WANTED TO PLAY THIS GAME SO BAAAD!"
Negative,"Buy the gamedownload the game, grind for a bit, don't interact with anyone, get bored, uninstall.time goes by, buy the expansiondownload the game, grind for a bit, don't interact with anyone, get bored, uninstall.time goes by, buy the expansiondownload the game, grind for a bit, don't interact with anyone, get bored, uninstall.why do I keep throwing money at this?"
Negative,"I got over 6000 playtime hours in this game, counting my playtime before I rebought it on Steam for convenience. You may think that I won't recommend the game just for the sake of ranting. But this is an honest review from someone who dedicated a LOT of time and love in a game with such potential for perfection, but instead, slowly watched it becoming a P2W piece of garbage. I just want to spare your money and your precious time. After enduring 6000 hours being screwed over and over again by ZOS, I couldn't recommend ESO for anyone. That will be a VERY LONG review, I want to make it clear, so even the smartasses and fanboys can understand why I wouldn't recommend a game where I spent so much time on.The graphics, audio and other aspects are simply beautyful, the game is beautyful in general.It is Elder Scrolls' lore, that I must say is awesome. The quests are pretty immersive, even consisting on the MMORPG's standard 'go there and talk to someone', 'go there and pick some stuff', 'go there kill someone', 'go there and solve a puzzle'... but there is no challenge at all, as most of PvE content is ridiculously easy. There are harder, challenging PvE contents in the late game, it consists on the same basic mechanics, but now you will actually die if you miss something. Nothing really challenging as long as everyone knows what to do and when to do it. It is mostly about timing.Your character's level is scaled, so champion points system aside, you can pretty much get a good gear in your current low level character and you will be almost as strong as a max level player (it was hilarious clapping high level players with a well equipped level 4 character and be called a cheater).Forget about PvP: Cyrodiil, where the alliance war takes place, is a laggy mess, totally unplayable. There is Battlegrounds (3v3v3) option, that is actually fun, but still laggy, the duels aswell. Also, you can get banned for teabagging. There are only 2 mega servers: the US and the EU megaserver. I don't know about the EU megaserver, but I can say that the US megaserver is a laggy mess. You will assume that the game is laggy just for me, who doesn't live in US, but EVERY friend I have in game that lives in US complains about the lag, and north american players always use the excuse 'I lagged hard' when they got clapped by a dude with 300+ average ping AKA me. The game is much more laggy for me, indeed, but I assure you that is enough lag for everyone. Keep in mind: in PvP, where having to unreliably spam a skill hoping for it to activate or hit during a critical moment, makes simply using a skill RNG (trust me, in a game that you must keep your buffs and debuffs running all the time, missing a single poke because of lag will screw your entire rotation and get you killed).Don't get me wrong, you can join a RP guild that will have rules and mechanics they use for RP, probably have a good time, or not... it is their guild, their hub, their rules, I can't judge them, I can either join the guild and follow their rules or not join at all, simple... BUT, if you want to just go to a public RP hub for some casual RP... the public RP community consists of a bunch of snowflakes that get offended when you are being lore friendly, E.g. expressing your distaste about vampires, werewolves, necromancers, etc, who are openly behaving as such in a public RP hub... you will get hate for following the game's lore in character and get them whining out of character about you being intolerant, calling you racist and other stuff (imagine dealing with SJWs in character). Not mentioning how cringy they can get when they get edgy and you push them out of their safezone by attacking, they will go full cringy mode, godemoting ridiculous stuff and expecting you to accept that they won a fight just because they said so using the emote chat, if you invite them for a duel, is when the out of character drama starts, with players cringing because they want to be edgy, but don't want to face the consequences (imagine having a leveled character, properly geared, who achieved the hardest PvP challenges, being insulted by a level 4 dude that never actually played the game, who expects that you consent loosing the fight just because he said so. This is public RP in a nutshell. I don't know what kind of RP is that, based on every RP experience I had, RP consists in level up, grind, learn to fight, get proper equipment, win a few duels against experient players, and only then, you become a badass... you aren't a badass just because you said so, if you think you are, prove it in combat which, spoiler alert, the game has duels).The game is as laggy and buggy as it was in release if not worse. There was improvement at some point, but ZOS managed to ruin any progress with their greed: with every DLC released, more bugs, glitches and lag are included. ZOS is a company that is more concearned about releasing 4 paid DLCs a year instead of fixing the lag that was an issue since release. ZOS doesn't take 2 steps foward and one step back, they try sprinting 20 steps, trips on the first, breaks a leg and keeps limping towards the wrong direction: ZOS forces you buying DLCs by nerfing most of the best sets (that you grinded so hard to get it, test it and upgrade it) and releasing a totally overpowered set that you will only get access by subscribing or buying the DLC since ALL drops from dungeons can't be sold or traded. You buy the DLC, grind, get the stuff you want, spend your precious materials to upgrade and BOOM! Your overpowered gear is now useless, because next month there is another paid DLC to be released and new overpowered sets to grind. Just to better illustrate how greedy they are, ZOS is a company that, back in 2018 slipped a spyware called Red Shell in their games (including ESO). They already removed it, after players learned about this and questioned them in their forums about how illegal and dishonest making people install a spyware without concent is. ZOS: ""My apologies for the confusion over the integration of Red Shell into ESO. Here’s what happened: we have been experimenting with a better way to link which advertisements and web content new players see to the eventual account that is created in the game..."" cool... it is a company that 'experiments' how much they can profit by exploiting the players' privacy, by selling their data to 3rd parties...The Crown Store is another P2W element. It sells only cosmetic items for real money, yes, BUT they allow players to gift those items, which is totally exploitable (I know countless players who sold and/or bought those from another players), it is their money and they spend as they want, but it heavly impacts the game's economy and it is a ToS violation. I never heard of a single player getting warned for doing it, ZOS is profiting by selling crowns, so it is ok... meanwhile... I spent 5000 crowns (real money) for a giant NAKED statue of Dibella (goddess of SEX) and got my 6000 hours playtime account suspended for saying 'tits' on a mature rated game's chat (a game which content includes SEX, MURDER, PROSTITUTION, DRUGS, etc...).ESO WAS simply the best game ever between 2016 and 2018, but ZOS ruined it. The only thing that kept me returning to the game after ZOS completely ruined the experience, were the good friends I made in game, but even that ZOS managed to ruin, since I can't even trash talk to them anymore, it was the only joy left for me in ESO (if you get suspended and your account is on final warning before a permanent ban for saying 'tits'... imagine trash talking with your friends... I really don't understand getting a final warning in a mature rated a game that, BY DEFAULT, got a profanity filter TURNED ON and also counts with a block player option. I am not harassing, I am not shaming anyone, I am not saying anything racist... just trying to have a good time with another adult friends, who also got suspended for similar ridiculous reasons)."
Negative,This review can be read in our in game store for 1500 Crowns
Negative,"The introduction did not grip me at all, the combat is lackluster compared to skyrim, which already has lackluster combat. I would not recommend the game based on what I played, just stick to skyrim co op."
Negative,asia server when?
Negative,"They have destroyed resource regeneration and then later healing in the game, so the end game isn't fun anymore. As a healer I've now quit the game- along with many others. Only buy the game if you just want to do the exploration and quests solo. If you're looking for an MMO- look elsewhere"
Negative,"Purchased during summer sale.  Couldn't install.  Refunded.  Seriously Bethesda, if I can't even install the game without jumping through a bunch of hoops, why on earth would I want to pay you monthly for a subscription?  Poor, just poor."
Negative,"please sir, go to the far end of the morrowdoogles and collect me 3 gigglyboos and you can join my magic guild and become the chosen one spoken of in the skaboopie prophesieslook i love this game even if it's just mindless, generic mmo fetch questing ad infinitum, but at 60 hours playtime right now, i swear to god i've probably played a good 10 hours and spent 50 just downloading patches through bethesda's nightmarish launcher.just spent my entire weekend letting this download (or fail to download) patches so i could go to work on monday having not collected a single schnordack for the dragon-guy trifectus. just let steam do the patching for you, bethesda, my god.(and hire a writer. any writer. just a single writer, please.)Edit 20/04, a: My weekend patching (after a year of not playing) took just under 22 hours total to finish.  I can finally open the game!!Edit 20/04, b: After spending an evening playing this with my partner, I remembered that it really is mindless, generic fantasy word-vomit and endless fetch quests. Changing from recommendation to a stinky NO. Infinite content for the sake of it."
Negative,"I played it during free weekend. The weekend isn't even over and I had enough. I'm a huge Elder Scrolls fan, but this doesn't feel like the Elder Scrolls game... Hard to say why. You are in Tamriel, you are on of the already known races, there are familiar monsters, but it just doesn't feel right. It could be an interesting spin-off to the series, but it is a boring one. It's just another generic MMO. Iit is better than other MMOs I played, but it's not enough.Interface is pretty clean, it's not cluttered at all (but it can be, if you want to). The combat tries to feel natural and ELder Scrolls-esque, but it is pretty clunky. You can play with a controller just fine, you can relax on the couch while playing it. You can also play in first-person. Dialouges are pretty meh, everytime is just 'We need your help!'. Locations look okay, but they are not feeling right.After 6 hours with this game I have enough, it costs just 9,90€ for the base game at the moment, but to be honest I don't care. It could even be free and I wouldn't care."
Negative,"Please add optional harder overland content!Tried posting on the actual forums, but apparently despite playing on and off since 2015 my account is not linked there.  I came back and bought Necrom after not playing for about 8 months primarily to experience the story.  I played maybe 2 hrs of the story on a fresh lvl 1 character and promptly lost interest.  There is no immersion for me because there is no challenge.  I'm not sure if I will ever finish this story in the current state of the game because there is simply no incentive for me to.  A good story is simply not enough, and I am sure I am not alone in that sentiment.  All the visuals and voice acting in the world are insufficient if the immersion is gutted by me able to down every big bad villain of a 30 minute quest in 5 seconds, literally, on a fresh character with terrible equipment.For context, I play games because I enjoy a challenge.  If there is a highest difficulty to be achieved for a game, solo in particular, I am usually not satisfied until I achieve this level.  Frankly I am usually bored with most games unless I am playing them at the highest difficulty.  I routinely play civilization on Deity and Total War on Legendary, as examples.Please ZOS, figure out some way of adding a vet difficulty to overland content and properly incentivize it.  This is a feature that has been repeatedly asked for by players like me.  The vast majority of the content you have released over the years, particularly the last three, has been mind-numbly easy overland.  I have done about half of this content, and honestly did not enjoy the experience because it was far too easy.  The stories were good, at least the ones that I played.  The lack of immersion because the combat was too easy killed it for me.  Telling me to remove my armor and weapons to impose self challenge, as is one of the usual responses to this request, is an insufficient solution.  I recognize that some people love the game for how easy most of the content is.  Unfortunately, I am not one of them, and how easy the content is currently, is quite literally preventing me from enjoying most of the game.  I do not want to change the experience for those that enjoy the current state, I just want an option to make it harder with a proper reward commensurate for the additional time required.  Telling me to go to Vet dungeons, Cyrodil, Vet Arenas, and Vet Trials is also insufficient.  I have done them.  I have the equipment I want from them and do not have a reason to continue doing them because playing these at the highest difficulties is also not properly incentivized (separate issue).  Learning the solo Vet Arenas is my favorite experience from the game so far, and it is a shame there are only 2 of them.  I want more challenging content like this, and I am frankly very unlikely to return to this game unless it exists.  Please figure out a way to OPTIONALLY add difficulty, preferably Vet Arena level difficulty, to the overland of your game.  Please give a reason for gamers like me to want to experience the great stories your game has told throughout the years, because right now playing overland story content is a chore that I do not care for.  It offers the same level of challenge in my life as doing the dishes.tldr:  If you are a gamer that enjoys any form of challenge, this is sadly not the game for you."
Negative,Had it for like 2 weeks couldn't play on the weekend because Steam doesn't play well with the login servers!
Negative,Same profile on EU and NA servers ofc and crowns same but when you buy DLC you can't use in all servers? WTF?
Negative,"paywall game, poor and unbalanced pvp, boring."
Negative,the most expensive mmo with a very minimal return for what you getsadness
Negative,What a *HUGE* disappoint this game isComplete let-down to the whole Elder Scrolls seriesUtterly devoid of any of the atmosphere and character of the single-player gamesGame amounts to little more than a MMO scavenger hunt - no place for the gameplay of the rest of the series
Negative,"TL:DR I'm of two minds with this one, but decided to not recommend this game, because the core gameplay just doesn't feel fun or exciting in any real way. Story is great, it's definitely my favorite part of this game. But the combat is uninspired, and pretty much the same thing you see in every other MMORPG. And the core gameplay is basically just number management, and nothing else. Pros:+ The Story: It carries the game big time, and is definitely it's biggest asset. This is one of the few times that i've consistently wanted to follow the story all the way through, and the voice acting on all the dialogue definitely helped that alot.+ The Voice Acting: It not only makes the game alot more immersive, but it's also alot easier to follow the story, when you don't have to read 90% of it.+ Graphics: The game looks great, and definitely does alot for the immersion of the game.+ Player market: Players can form guilds, that can sell items from their own stall in several cities. The guild leaders takes a cut, which makes them want to have good traders and put up stalls in the right places. Everybody is profiting in this system, and i really like how they put it together. Also it's not a global market, where everybody's prices are listed on the same list. Each guild stall have individual prices, depending on whatever they have put for sale. Therefore the prices are not insanely low, and the insentive to sell stuff is still there.+ The Thieving System: This is one of my favorite parts of the game, i spent alot of time stealing stuff and sneaking around. The guards are decent aslong as you don't fight more than 1 at a time, then they get incredibly frustrating as you're infinitely stunned/rooted. (Especially if you're on a horse, since you'll spent a good 3 seconds getting up after it throws you off it whilst they kill you.)+ The Fist/rock throwing spell on the dragonknight class. (Throwing a rock into a guards face after he rooted you for a full 10 seconds is hillarious, i would go tea bag him if there wasn't a cooldown on the effect.)+ Every single Khajit NPC (They just all seem like that friend who is about to get you into trouble, but will help you get out of it aswell.)+ Dolmens: Those portals look really awesome when they appear, and the sound they make along with the storm is so incredibly immersive. I love standing in the city, and hearing that horn go off and just run to defend the city, very accelerating.+ Pets and Mounts+ First/Third person options (although first person feels useless when it comes to avoiding spells, since you can barely see the red casting markings on the ground.)+ Freedom to explore: You can explore everything at any level now, which is wonderful. (But it certainly didn't change the importance of upgrading gear constantly to keep up.)Cons:- The Combat: This is my bigest gripe with the game, and really the main reason why i can't enjoy it. 90% of the time, i feel like i'm fighting a ghost. I'm pretty much just mashing a bunch of buttons, and the only reaction i'm getting it the health bar lowering.- Number management gameplay: Playing a game like this honestly feels like working. I'm constantly getting loot with certain numbers, whilst leveling up and thereby making my old loot useless so i have to optimize to my new level all the way till max level. Whilst i do that i have to gather a billion weapons, armors, plants, hides, w/e to level up whatever skills i want to max out. And since this is pretty much all that this game is about, then that is pretty much what most of us are gonna do. Some might call this ""progression"" and say they enjoy it, i would personally call it ""Wasting every single opportunity to increase the happiness in my life"". I'm playing a video game, i wanna experience something, i wanna fight exciting bosses, i want to explore the world, i do NOT want to gather a million items to max out each and every skill, or do the same boring combat for weeks on end, that basically just consists of managing numbers, whilst just hoping that the next skill i unlock will make the game fun.- Too much pointless loot, that only differs with numbers. (now you deal 5 more damage, yaaaay.)- Too much Inventory management. (Also owned items, and stolen items of the same kind takes up 2 spaces even though they're the same item.)- Item Laundering is only useful on rare items, since you can only launder a specific amount of items. So laundering 100 swords worth 200 gold each, is the same as laundering 100 potatos worth 1 gold each. (Let me launder my damn potatoes Zenimax!)- And now that i'm getting to lvl 30, people are starting to kick me from dungeon raids. Proving that these games will only allow tryhards, and anyone playing casually will still have a bad time in these types of games."
Negative,"Honestly from what I have read about the game when it was initially released, it was half decent. However people apparently complained about the fact that each zone was different level monsters, so they changed it to monsters leveling along with you?The game is a non stop boring grindfest, as you only really level half decent with 1 other person in your group, any more than that and it slows down.The only few areas to level half decent are always packed, in turn making it annoying to level.Really the only way you will be half decent is to complete Veteran dungeons and make a good set of armor and such. But you pretty much only want a set after CP 160, and getting to that is stupid boring. Plus Veteran dungeons will destroy you without the gear.There is also no end game content unless you consider wasting time to make a ton of gold to buy a house for absolutely no reason end game content.Either way, the game really isn't worth the price, and the content is lame. ESO plus is really only worth it for the crafting bag, as the DLC blows, and some of the DLC isn't even considered ""DLC"" even though its clearly DLC. For instance, Summerset does not come with ESO Plus as they like to write it off as a Chapter instead. Atleast have the common sense to clarify what is and isn't part of ESO Plus on the steam page, and allow refunds. Honestly now, you expect us to pay for some much bullshit in this game and you rip us off at the same time? Shame. It's no wonder Bethesda is so hated these days."
Negative,"Developer put in Redshell, tracking software. This game was on my to play list, now its in the archive never to be played.https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/8pud8b/psa_red_shell_spyware_holy_potatoes_were_in_space/"
Negative,"Don't waste your time on this. Don't buy it even on sale.First, the gameplay doesn't resemble the mainline Elder Scrolls games at all. Instead it plays like a Korean MMO where you mash your number keys to shoot pew pew powers at the enemy until they die. And there are exactly two types of quest: Kill something and Fetch something. All of that interspersed with copious amounts of woo-woo dialogue about the Mystical Dreamwaiver of Stonesnark and curing the poison Barfgrid the Mendacious, rebellious leader of the Hurlsnatchers put into King Rotund the Braggart's mead soup or whatever that you forgot about long ago and couldn't possibly care less about, all over the setting of a war among three stupid and impossible factions that don't make sense if one knows the first thing about ES lore and in a barely fleshed out time period no one knows anything or cares about, sorta like making a game about ASoIaF before the Andals set foot in Westeros or The Witcher before there were humans.Second, and worse, you'll spend about half your time trying to get the game to login in the first place, because the game is full of ever new and ever more creative bugs, like having to accept the (27 different) Terms of Service and set your brightness every single time you try to log in, to simply not being able to enter at all because it won't recognize your account and will require you to type a confirmation code they're supposed to send to your email, but won't ever be sent (seriously, it won't even be in your spam folder, no matter how many times you retry the log in; it simply wasn't sent)(and apparently that's a known issue they haven't solved yet.) But ofc they have the time to make new tiny mission DLC they'll sell for $25 instead.Also, the graphics are lazy as fuck. By the 10th NPC you see you'll notice that all, and I really mean ALL characters of each race have the exact same face with a different beard, and all females have the exact same face with a different hairstyle. All houses in the map look the exact same, and all all rooms have the same arrangement.Nothing in the game seems to have weight, everything feels light and floaty, including your horse and your heavily armored character with a two handed sword. Feels jarring. Anyways, I think you get the picture by now. Bye. Don't get this. Mod your Skyrim instead."
Negative,"This game initially seems like it has a lot of promise, but it feels empty and pointless and I can't find any motivation to play it."
Negative,"I just couldn't get into it. Maybe it was the plasticky graphics, maybe the artificial atmosphere, maybe the loot. Also it constantly reminds you about the cash shop. Or maybe I'm too used to LOTRO."
Negative,"This game sucks!! Very buggy, overcomplicated, and requires  you to make online purchases in order to advance in any way."
Negative,it's still wouldn't go any further of its loading screen
Negative,Personally the level scaling for this game killed it for me. It feels like the sense of progression is just not there. It can definitely be fun if ur cool with that tho. Also if feels like they made some things unbelievably inconvenient just so you would spend more money the weight system makes me suicidal
Negative,"The game wasn't ready when it launched.  The concepts are great, but they executed it dismally.  Everything more or less felt half-finished and sloppily rushed.   As a result, the player base was short-lived, and the game quickly began to die.  A lack of end-game content and too much emphasis on PvP started to flush the game down the crapper.  People were unimpressed.  Therefore, the game quickly became pay-2-play. It's the only way the game can continue to survive and afford it's very expensive and international servers and staff.  As they grew more desperate to fund their dying game, it more and more became pay-2-win.  Trust me, there is an entire community of people out there with blatantly disposable incomes who play games like this simply to spend their way to the top.  Features that were available for free when I bought the game now require a $15/mo subscription.  You can buy an advantage.  They've added a lot of content since launch and fixed a lot, but at the cost of adapting to a pay2win/play game model.    I guess it's ok.  It's probably the best MMO out there for adults.  But don't expect to get a lot out of the end-game experience."
Negative,"I have more than 5k hours on this game, because i just f'''' love the The Elder Scrolls universe, but the game has some serious problems. Nowadays you can count on big bugs in dungeons, like the final boss just not spawning, or the final boss stuck in an animation that makes it impossible to kill it. ( It's almost always the final boss so that the dungeon breaking bug REALLY hurts ). If you queue for a dungeon with random players, you can count on getting a faketank with 20k hp, because the devs are fucking over tanks in every turn they can. Now my I got a big suspension, because of my 3 year old characternames, what a joke that is.""Zero'Fox'Given"" and ""lamest dlc ever wtf"" are appearantly hurting some feelings at ZOS. Maybe this is the kick in the ass I needed to stop playing The Elder Bugs"
Negative,"Prepare for an odyssey of disappointment should you dare to venture into the desolate landscape that is Elder Scrolls Online. This purported MMORPG, rather than standing as a beacon of gaming prowess, crumbles under the weight of its own inadequacies when juxtaposed against the titans of the genre.Embarking on this journey, one is immediately struck by the feeble attempt at visuals, as if ESO emerged from an era where pixelation and jagged edges were acceptable. In a universe where World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy 14, Guild Wars 2, and Black Desert Online unfurl breathtaking tapestries of visual ecstasy, ESO seems like a relic from an ancient digital graveyard. It's akin to presenting a scribbled doodle in the Louvre and expecting applause.Delving deeper, the so-called combat in ESO unravels into a lamentable charade – a choreographed dance of button-mashing banality. A symphony of monotony where one hits a button, feigns a semblance of strategy with a perfunctory power attack, only to resume the uninspiring choreography. The combat lacks the finesse and innovation displayed by its competitors, rendering the player's actions as inconsequential as a whisper in the wind.Yet, the descent into despair doesn't conclude there. The difficulty level in ESO is an insidious joke, a malevolent trick played on unsuspecting players. Open-world skirmishes and story-driven confrontations unfold with a mind-numbing simplicity that obliterates any semblance of narrative significance. Where, pray tell, is the thrill of conquering adversity, the elation of a hard-fought victory? Nowhere to be found amidst the barren wasteland of Elder Scrolls Online.In a gaming cosmos where players crave immersive landscapes, formidable challenges, and cutting-edge aesthetics, Elder Scrolls Online crumbles like a sandcastle in the face of an approaching tide. Spare yourself the heartache and embark on a quest elsewhere, for in the realm of MMORPGs, Elder Scrolls Online stands as a forlorn testament to the art of disappointment – a catastrophic collapse of epic proportions."
Negative,"VERDICT: Stay away.First let me talk about the download size of this game. 60something gigs in steam, and then when you start up the game launcher there is a another 40g waiting for you to download, SURPRISE motherfucker! I find this very stupid and unethical tbh honest because downloading that 40gig still counts as game time. And now I can't return this game.I have to say after all that waiting, the expectations of this game have risen a little bit.This game failed spectacularly.I cannot believe the amount of positive reviews this game gets.Graphics: The artstyle is bland, desaturated and the whole environment simply feels lifeless. Your character runs like a drunk wooden dummy walking on water. Coming from a game like Guild Wars 2 this game simply do not hold up.Gameplay: The quests are very boring with everything I've encountered so far as a fetch quest. Combat is unresponsive and feels laggy. And the doors.... wth? You have to wait for your character animation to end and then wait another second to enter another area. Trust the few seconds you wait adds up.Story: I didn't play long enough to actually become immersed in the story, which says a lot about this game actually. Usually I am a story-driven gamer. I can forgive a lot of shortcomings if the story is good. But this game from the beginning did not grip me in any way. Sure, ok, I'm a survivor in an tormented space, I escape, then WHAT? Explore the bland world? Accumulate skill points to invest in skills that look and feel EH? Run around saving NPCs you don't give a shit about? The combination of bad gameplay and uninteresting beginning really stopped me from enjoying this game at all.I also told my mate to get this game so we can delve into another mmo. Sadly, this is not it. Now I am ashamed for telling him to actually spend money on this. Conclusion: STAY AWAY. Go play something else.You might enjoy this game if you are below 12 years old and never played a mmo before. Damn was I disappointed."
Negative,"Disappointing. I had high hopes this was going to be more along the lines of the Elder Scrolls world, but sadly. It's just WOW (World of Warcraft). It's dumbed down, rushed, disproportionate weapon models, and an experience that cannot be related to what we've known. Thank God for the modding community. This could have been amazing, dark, ""adult"", and an truly different from the regular, boring, child-like, and cartoon MMO's. But nooooo....... What a waste."
Negative,This is not Elder Scrolls. This is boring b-tier sampled game with poor content and broken mechanics.
Negative,Loading screen simulator along with selling personal information to 3rd parties.
Negative,"Game has become total garbage , ZOS money grab. Played since console launch and it just continues to go downhill last 2 years"
Negative,"Played at launch, left because it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Came back much later after they reworked everything and it's still not as good as it should be."
Negative,"Don't be deceived by the pretty animations like I was!My account has been suspended yet they have still charged me for the month. I haven't done anything to be banned: I don't speak in chat and I don't even know how to use addons let alone hacking. Such a shame as I'd say it has the best story in an MMO I've ever played. The gameplay gets repetitive and boring after a while with no real skill curve. So yeah, don't recommend."
Negative,"it took a long time to download, had many issues getting it running and it wasn't worth it. the stealth mechanics are lackluster to outright bad at times, yet it is constantly used in missions. I didn't want to play as a stealthy character, but I'm forced into that role. I wonder how wondering onto an ashlander camp by accident somehow gets me a bounty with the houses, despite the fact ashlanders and the houses don't communicate with, or even like each other.. strange. the quests are incredibly boring, yet aren't even kind enough to be short. and the rewards don't feel worth it at all. the combat while not hard, is sluggish and again boring. because of the way the game scales you with the monsters, they will always feel rather spongy. maybe someone else like it, but gosh does it feel horrible to me.  it just doesn't feel like an elder scrolls game. nothing feels satisfying, the combat, the spells, the stealth, leveling, nothing. I got it as a gift, and I feel bad they wasted money on it.worse, I feel bad for wasting hours of my life playing this I'll never get back."
Negative,"I love this game, but you really shouldn't bother playing it. Unless you have an extreme level of patience, hate gathering/crafting, and don't mind a TON of time-gated content, I'd stay away from this game. Sure, the PvP is fun, and the classes are interesting, but the combat is terribly implemented and every single system in this game absolutely REEKS of monetization. Even if you're just looking for lore and general questing, you'll be pushed to the MTX shop via the giant unavoidable pop-up every time you log into the game. You'll be forced to deal with terrible, obnoxious inventory management unless you pay for ESO+.  A ton of the questlines are slogs, and they aren't even lore-friendly to the greater Elder Scrolls universe. Hell, even the MOUNTS are time-gated. You have to log in every day for months to get your mount to full efficiency (that's right, they don't even START at full-speed. Sprinting is faster than mounting for the first few days, assuming you choose to level Mount Speed over anything else).All in all, the game is fun. Sure, there's enough to do here that you'll enjoy your time in ESO regardless. I just can't in good faith recommend this game, as it'll suck every ounce of joy you've ever had out of gaming in general. If you're someone who is considering ESO+, PLEASE consider FFXIV instead. It's an MMO that genuinely respects your time and rewards your investment, as opposed to Zenimax's desperate attempt to squeeze you out of every cent you're worth."
Negative,"Urgh. Where to start? The positives?So, it's a visually beautiful game. Full of all-important story and lore - which is the only reason I log in. You can - if you're socially inclined, as I am - find some decent people playing. The gameplay itself though is... well, crap. The battle system (constant button spam and refreshing of abilities because apparently the whole world is on crack) is designed poorly - but highly consistent with the overall philosophy of the game, which seems to be rush everyone through it and not care that there's no reason to keep playing. Player retention isn't difficult if you give folks a reason to hang around and not quit every month or so and come back a year later. Burnout is seemingly endemic and systematically ingrained.It's an exceptionally shallow game personality-wise, really, which is disappointing.  The story telling itself is beyond aggravating and patronising (NPC's repeat what they literally just said several times whilst offering quests/conversation - waaaay over done and frankly insulting). The lore books themselves aren't as bad - some of them are quite enjoyable, but there's a clear distinction between those written for this game and those that appeared in the Elder Scrolls universe prior.  I've put more time in than should be required to feel some kinship with my characters, but I absolutely do not - and this is the first game i've put time into that I can say that about in 30 years of gaming.The guild system is bonkers - as are the limitations on social side of guilds. Totally unnecessarily useless. Plenty of games have shown how to do this correctly. Even WoW. Chat / commuincation requires third party modding / apps to be functional on anything other than stand resolution. In 2023... Ridiculous.The auction house system is... well what? Somebody had a bad trip and sadistically decided to take it out on random gamers? It's ridiculous. Yet one more system that absolutely requires third-party assistance/mods/website for no other reason than bad design. The levelling system isn't a terrible idea, until you do it and you soon reaslise that it is completely popointless having assigned roles that can't be changed on the fly.  Not because assigned roles are a bad thing, but because you can change at any time, by teleporting away and teleporting back. For free if you log out and back in too - so why then bother? It's a literal wwsate of time. Which makes the entire skill and levelling utterly system redundant. ... perhaps they have different devs work on the game each month and never let them communicate?The lack of challenge outside the end game is again symptomatic of the overall philosophy of rush rush rush rush, and frankly you're far more likely to die from having fell off of a hill than in combat, and then only because you've stopped paying attention. Sometimes I let my toon die on purpose - something I have never, ever considered on any game ever before. The loot system leaves you completely lacking any sense of achievement - which is annoying because it could be awesome.The character optimisation is in reality a not-very-well-disguised excuse for money grabbing and nothing more. It's OK to monetise your stuff, but ffs ZOS don't half take it to the extreme.The housing system looks great on the surface but they stupidly ruin that with arbitrary limits, actively disincentivising participation.Oh, and there's also the fact that I've now been waiting two weeks for them to refund the money they took from me illegally - despite their telling me they'll sort it out. Hiding purchases behind scripts on screen because you've screwed up your update is NOT legal - no matter what country you live in. So customer service definately gets a big fat ZERO.... it's just not a very well put together MMORPG. It COULD  have been, and the world itself deserves it, but it isn't.And don't kid yourself that it's worth playing free.ZOS aggressively push you into paying through the standard limitations. You'll  spend more time sorting your inventory than playing the game.....1500 hours or so, and honestly the only reason it's still installed is that I can play it with a controller. And the assistance of several UI mods (yup, not even just one...).All of that sounds horrendously negative, which isn't what i wanted to to be. So i guess that i do NOT recommend the game afterall. Before I thought about it i wasn't sure tbh, because being able to use a controller is super important to my lifestyle and it gets massive credit for that.Oh well."
Negative,I got in for 37 minutes. Then it asked me to verify the game and sent a code - which didn't work. It'll send a new code - in 24 hours time. No use - by then I'll have uninstalled. This kind of thing just boils my pss.For the 37 minutes I was playing it was like playing the Oblivion - something about 15 years out of date. Certainly not enough to inspire me to fight to get it back up.
Negative,"Honestly?Just try Guild Wars 2.It's a far better, far more alive, MMORPG.You can play it for free, but (If you make a 1 time payment like this) you have access to many things.Such as trading in game currency for premium currency!There are more classes, more races, and races aren't locked to alliance or classes.Want a giant chonky man with a love for necromancy? Can do!TL;DR Just play Guild Wars 2 instead. It's prettier, far better, and for sure more fun."
Negative,"No meaningful PvP updates. At all.Content is just boring imo, it was fun for a bit but honestly without VOIP I just felt like the PC version was a complete downgrade from Console."
Negative,This game is not a multiplayer skyrim just saying
Negative,"If there was a sideways thumb, I'd give it.  This is a solid 5.5/10.  It works, but it has essentially zero redeeming qualities.  It's just another MMO, nothing special here."
Negative,"EDIT: Sadly, in ""expansion"" after ""expansion"" the content has been absolute trash, the most low effort spamfest of generic garbage content possible. There are, to date, *two* expansions worth buying. Having them churn out new ones constantly, and ask $50 each for nearly nothing, on top of having a intentionally broken inventory system designed to force anyone who actually plays to constantly keep ESO+ in order to be able to do anything past logging in and collecting their daily bonuses...I have spent a *lot* of time in this game, most of it on the actual game launcher before linking it to Steam and my playtime being counted here, but it has been over a year since I spent more than half an hour in the game and nothing they're doing is making me reconsider that. At this point it's just a waste of hard drive space and I'm finally uninstalling it to have a chunk of space freed up for games worth launching,ORIGINAL REVIEW:This game had a rough start, enough so that despite being a beta tester and owning it from the beginning I only actually started playing after Elsweyr was released, but I have to say it's one of the better MMOs out there right now.The only down side is, if you're any kind of a crafter, you will NEED to subscribe to plus due to an intentionally broken inventory system that is designed to force people to pay for the ""craft bag"" in order to have a usable amount of space.It has some great guilds, interesting new content, and enough customization to keep people playing with the side stuff long after they've cleared all the base content of the game.I'm not sure if it shows when I bought the game, but I only got a Steam copy recently, linking the new one to my existing Zenimax account gave me enough Crowns and bonus content to more than pay for the Steam version and took care of that annoying login screen that won't properly save your information (and doesn't like accepting a pasted password from your manager) like every other MMO I've played in the last decade or more."
Negative,I spend more time trying to load in than I actually get to play the game ffs
Negative,It would be a decent MMORPG if it were Free-To-Play considering all of the purchasable items/pay wall.
Negative,"Very good pve very fun pve and a lot of content for pve and solo pve too but pvp is very very bad becuase some classes are too strong like nightblade with infinite cloak spam is very annoying + crazy burst and gank damage potential as well as sorcerer with his overbuffed shield healing ward all in 1 skill this skill makes a sorc who builds full into damage still tanky and that is something other classes cannot do yeah maybe arcanist can do it too but he needs full crux but sorcerer can just spam it nonstop and he still has the best mobility in the game too that can also stun and damage the target.. yeah other classes also have good tanky skills like sorc but other classes like dk and templar were designed in this way because they are the ''hold your ground classes'' meanwhile sorcerer is supposed to be the glass cannon yet with such a tanky skill that scales based on both offensive and defensive stats is just wild and the scale is way too big i even tested it on myself and i dueled other people using it and i was playing with it it's strong no matter what , sure it wont make sorc actually immortal but its crazy op in 1v1 maybe even 1v2 so maybe i small nerf to that skill would be good? and maybe a reword to nightblade to make him good in pve and not only in pvp? that would be awesome in general i feel like other classes are balanced enough in pvp"
Negative,"the worst 42 hours i ever spent on an mmo. Everquest on ps2 was a better experience than this. i should have trusted my better instincts against buying this game, but i was looking for something, anything to cure my boredom at the time. i watched as my brother beta tested this, many years ago. we theorized a rogue with a 2h weapon could keep enemies perpetually stunlocked with abilities and heavy attacks, and we were proven right. this was nerfed only slightly. its actually very silly.at this moment ive become aware that this company has implemented data collection of your personal information, name, address, email, phone number, and so on. and to this i say, Bethesda, eat shit and die.not only have you been hyping up all your shit content for your shit games, but youd also wish to rob us of our privacy. kindly throw yourselves in a tub of acid. i mean that from the heart, with the deepest sincerity. youre a trash company now, and its quite sad because i was a major fan of the elder scrolls and fallout. but weve all seen what youve done with those franchises, such terrible failures one after another. and to think youve released skyrim about 10 times asking full new release price everytime... lol. my god, youre fucking pitiful and deserve to tank."
Negative,"Used the ""Play for free"" offer to try it out. I am not a fan of multiplayer games, but I read that you can play most parts of the game as single player, and given how much I enjoy Skyrim, I gave it a try.TLDR: While it may be one of the best multiplayer games, it is not really suitable for single player campaigns. Visually, the game is stunning. Definitely makes me want to explore the world. Quest design and story are good, from what I have seen so far. I was struggling a bit with the controls, but that was just a matter of getting into it and accepting it's not Skyrim. However, my favorite weapon is the bow, and unfortunately that weapon is a major let-down. Control is just disappointing compared to other games. (Skyrim, TR, HZD)Obviously, to really enjoy this game, the player has to invest a lot of time and/or money. In my case probably both. So, I really gave it a thorough examination and tried to get into things. However, I failed. I prefer to do things in my own pace. But no matter where I went, there were always dozens of other players, interfering in fights, looting stuff and ruining the immersion. Sharing the bank or crafting with 20 other players at the same time is just laughable. Sneaking up on group of enemies, when suddenly a high-leveled party of 4 basks in, annihilates all opponents and is out before I have even finished looking at the beautifully decorated final room is simply frustrating. Because of this constant onslaught, enemies re-spawn frequently. Which meant in the rare case I would have a fight all for myself, I would run into enemies I already killed before while moving around. If they would offer a mode that turns the game into a true single player experience, I would be on-board in a heart-beat. I'll even arrange myself with those dreadful bows. But the way it is now, it is definitely not for me. I rather spend my money on dedicated single player games. And given how mercilessly this game is monetized, I can buy a lot of them for the money I just saved. Back to Skyrim for me."
Negative,"ESO lore doesn't really coincide with the already established lore of the Elder Scrolls. Alliances between mortal enemies were formed and with just that a lot of people were turned off. Now with One Tamriel, you can group up with your rival faction, but only in PvE.It's not Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim Online.Inventory is not slot-based, not weight-based.You can't join every faction introduced in the Elder Scrolls series like the Great Houses or the Morag Tong. Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood are behind a paywall.Dark elves are selling horses instead of guar for mounts.Game is fun for the most part. PvP has major issues.People who revel in achievements will have a blast. You can unlock costumes, pets and novelt items. You can even customize your armor's color anytime. It's just that most colors need to be unlocked by getting achievements. They range from piss easy to fuck my life.Crown store prices are *rubs hands*Think of the game as a spin-off rather than a prequel and the game automatically becomes better. Not great, just better.Summary:If you've loved the Elder Scrolls series since Battlespire and Arena then don't buy this game. If you do love the Elder Scrolls series and still want to try this then treat this as another game that's in no way related to the series except in name.The first two hours of play time Steam tracks is loading screens nd the main menu.Buy the Gold Edition when it goes >=50% off. Vvardenfell is coming at a way later patch."
Negative,"I can't start the game. I got ""Error - 210"" ""An Error has occured during Lancher self update."" and ""Error"" ""Unable to load Application list""."
Negative,Game is generic and boring.
Negative,horrible game full of micro transactions the only good ting about it is that its in the elder scrolls universe
Negative,"It's hard to put my finger on why this game is boring. It has kind of cool abilities, but somehow it all feels kinda pointless. However, my 9 year old likes it, so I play with her."
Negative,"Loader screen stopped working, tried everything to fix, wont launch anymore. 0/10"
Negative,"The game itself is amazing. But thats not what This review is for, it's a warning for the scammy money hungry practices of the developers, and I just can't recommend anything made by a company like this. If you can get the game on sale, go for it, but whatever you do, do not buy anything, and i mean ANYTHING, from the in game store, as the entire thing is a complete scam. Save your money. Don't waste it like I stupidly did."
Negative,"its nice and all, but the fact that its almost unplayable in Asia and Oceanic countries doesnt help advertise the game. Wasted money until they fix it. for PHL players, tol wag ka na dito. Kahit ano pa ka bilis ang net mo di pa rin worth it."
Negative,"In truth, you will have to buy the game, but then pay monthly for subscribtion because without it (ESO+ it's called), playing the game is a chore.Just google ESO Craft Bag and learn about that before buying.Research helped me to see the truth."
Negative,"Don't buy through steam, It's quite a good game but if go on the ESO website to purchace otherwise you'll only be able to log in about 3 days of the week. This is a real problem and makes even the low price tag of £7.50 a bit much."
Negative,"Played the first 4 hours, completely boring gameplay, mechanics and story. I don't understand why people would buy this game, I'm glad I was able to try it for free. Uninstalled. Skyrim itself is way better."
Negative,"eh, not my cup of healing potion"
Negative,"This game is trash, the combat is boring and the story isn't engaging, doesn't feel like an elder scrolls game, more of fake with bad mechanics."
Negative,"You need to pay for everything, if you do not have ESO+ it is very difficult crafting and the PVP is broken."
Negative,"Piece of crap devs, unbalanced as hell they care DLC and other stupid thingsNot the player are balancing any of the classes. Lame"
Negative,"The game would be fine, except for the fact that they intentionally made the inventory system so annoying to use that the game is basically unplayable unless you pay for the monthly plus membership.  You will spend more time doing inventory management than playing the game, and you will not be able to store crafting materials. I just can't support such a toxic method of monetisation."
Negative,"For the price you get a lot of hours gameplay of lag and bugs, but it is still fun.I think it could be a good game, but the gameplay bugs will obviously never get fixed, so it is not a game i would want to support more, than buying the core package. Most bugs already exist since the beta and never got fixed, last patch made the game even worse for my class, now the bugs really make me crazy sometimes."
Negative,"Tried it many times, but just can't get into it. Quests seem very shallow, dungeons don't need communication or coordination whatsoever in low levels, lootboxes and weird DLC that you need guides in order to buy good ones. Character building or leveling doesn't feel impactful at all. Unless you like mindlessly following arrows from point A to point B, I can recommend this. Otherwise I'd recommend you to save your money for another title. The free version can be used to spend some time though I guess.."
Negative,"Well, since it was a free for a time, I thought I might as well test it, however I can not really recommend it to any TES fan. Whether it is recommendable to MMO(RPG) players I can not tell for to be frank, I find most of them unappealing to begin with. I'd like to refrain from voting either way but it can not be helped... because that ""No game subscription required."" already counts as affront.To put it bluntly, it is more MMORPG than TES, TES setting but gameplay is pretty much MMOBS.I'm not even mad that I had to download 80GB and then still update, taking about half of the daylight at full speed. It can not be helped I admit. However the loading screen taking tens of minutes to get to the character edit and another when I applied my game settings did not make me feel good.But even never mind that, what made me quit after the tutorial was that it was just too much unlike TES and more like any other MMO I tried. Playing more would just have made me more unhappy and a game of course has to appeal in the beginning.Story? Characters? For better and for worse, they were always rather uninteresting in TES-Fallout. To little dialogue, too much gameplay. Even if one would want to read books, it is not like one could get their fill then for even short stories are longer.For to begin with I meant to go with a bow which turns out to be very unsatisfying, auto-attack my behind, bullet, er, arrow drop just truck you! Needless to say I also liked the trajectory of enemy arrows which one has to dodge rather than just sidestep, drawing a very odd arc...Having such a limited bag, 60 slots rather than X lbs also became annoying quickly since one can not just drop with a single key but right click, select destory and confirm (at least that has a key). Even if one can later carry more or even have a warehouse that does not cost any real money, this is already a turn-off when one material can ""weigh"" as much as equipment.I love loot, I understand that I can not carry unlimited loot but the real TES/Fallout system is much better.What got me as well were the numbers that could not help but start in the ten thousands plus only having Health, Stamina and Magicka as Attributes, a change I never endorsed even if Oblivion's petty system was also bad. So MMO, so not RPG?Active Skills are also a staple of MMORPGs, I won't add ""somehow"" into that sentence because I can understand but I still do not find those satisfying. Evem though I only watch and do not play the latest ""Souls-like"" (aka very difficult game) Sekiro, I can see how executing a fight is much more satisfying for one does not just press a single key at the right time.Even though I am bad at action games, I still enjoy good action over bad one even if it makes me look even worse. As much as I like to plan, and might very well also be as bad at it, this game is only satisfying in that way if you lead a party, that is if good cooperation besides common aggro&health management is rewarded.Don't even get me started on how Stealth appears or rather does not appear to be anything but obligatory.Not for Solo-Players, not for Archers, not for TES fans that are not MMORPG fans to begin with. Of course one has to bring time and money because the servers do not pay for themselves~"
Negative,"Overall, I'd give this game a solid ""OK"".The potential for being a great game is there, but it's buried underneath a complex web of monetary systems, DLC that is split between buying in game and from Steam, cumbersome crafting systems and irritating ""housekeeping"" every 20 minutes or so to keep your inventory cleared. Everything about this game reminds me of Neverwinter: the monetary systems, the loot boxes, the banks, everything...except the crafting. The godforsaken crafting.   The gameplay itself is good. It's what I expect from an Elder Scrolls game. In fact, I was actually suprised by how good some of it was.  I wish it wasn't overshadowed so much by the things listed above.I haven't played that many MMORPGs, maybe 4 or 5, so I don't have much to compare this one to, but this game just seems like more of the same. Play for free, pay to win. Maybe I'm being too harsh. Maybe I just don't like MMORPGs. I LOVE the Elder Scrolls games. I guess I just wanted this to be TES 6 and now I'm dissappointed - and I realize that's not fair, but hey - there it is. Bottom line - Neverwinter Online does everything this game tries to do, but better. If you want to play a fantasy MMORPG, play Neverwinter and if you want to play Elder Scrolls, don't play ESO, play one of the stand alone single player games that is already out and so effing amazing, or do like I'm going to do and wait for TES 6."
Negative,"Dear Zenimax: Thank you for allowing me to completely waste my time arranging all my UI & addon elements only to have them all become oversized and unadjustable as soon as I pick up my gamepad. I already owned this game outside of Steam and hadn't played for awhile so I grabbed Greymoor while it was on Steam just for the convenience of it, only to be met with a major inconvenience in game due to your inept decision making. This is a deal breaker for me, gamepad is my preferred method of playing and the whole reason I decided to come back to ESO was to be able to kick back and play with a gamepad. Thanks for ruining that with a completely unnecessary annoyance. Boooo to you! I just might have to refund this purchase......"
Negative,I'd rather have ES6
Negative,I've just spent a lot of cash on something I'm not likely to return to.
Negative,"Grate game. but the deves never play there game so the bugs stay buged and the gear sets get nerfted. cuz ""oh the pvper's know everthing""."
Negative,they make EA looks good
Negative,Cant even login says it sending the access code to my email but never does. I can login through the website but not in game.
Negative,"75gb downloaded, launcer downloads another 50gb ...Shitty dlc's that are over priced."
Negative,"not new player friendly, if you start a new game, your dropped on your head."
Negative,"The game has way too many bots and the customer service is worthless.  XP farming bots will tag your monsters in the overworld and easily sap 50% of your earned XP they will also queue up in the dungeon finder and go afk.  Resource Node farming bots will be a constant competition for resources.  Reporting doesn't seem to do anything, do a google search and it will tell you.  Attempting to get help from Zos staff on the forums will result in you being punished or actioned.  Zos_TrishM is a waste of functioning organs and deletes forums posts but lets the bots run free."
Negative,"Would reccomend that if you want to play this game purchase somewhere other than Steam, i have had it for a bout 3 weeks now, and it consistently has Server Time Out login issues  on the weekends. And i dont mean ""hey i had to try a couple of times to get logged in"", I mean hours of down time reported on the game website. Steam doesnt provide support for this, it takes hours to download which is followed by hours of updates, all which count as played time. Just get it from the Game website."
Negative,"Where to begin with this one...hmm...well the game is kind of a hard to recommend for a few reasons...its super pay walled in order to have a completely enjoyable experience, the PvP in the game (arguably the only thing solo players will be able to partake in end game on a as-wanted basis since you need bigger parties to do any endgame PvE content and queues for regular/vet dungeons are frickin horrifically long) needs to be refined by the devs, and the sale prices they put on things in the crown store has no rhyme or reason as to why the prices get hiked. Lets break these down:Pay walled fun:Don't get me wrong, the game can be played with just purchasing the base game an no DLC, but it will definitely get old very quickly. No access to bigger/better areas, SUPER limited Inventory/bank storage, etc. Knowing this and going into the game with this mindset will make the game more enjoyable to play, but, in order to have a lot more storage (bank/inventory) for your characters, you'll need to spend a good little amount of gold to increase those limits. The best storage of the game the ""Crafting Bag"" which allows you to store unlimited resources is ONLY available from having an ACTIVE ESO Plus membership ($15/month at the time of this writing). If you are good at inventory management, then you can get away with getting the chests for storage in your house from doing writs for extra storage, but be prepared for a grind. Also, to make a guild in the game and get access to 500 slots of guild storage you need 10 DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS (not characters, ACCOUNTS) in order to make a guild and get access to that sweet 500 extra slots.PvP: PvP in ESO...ya, big yikes. Play a DK/NB/Arcanist (newest class with CC on literally every ability with tons of damage to boot) and you win. Rest of the classes are inferior. There's no arguing this. Check reputable YouTube ESO creators for tier lists. Stop thinking what I just said isn't true. You know it, I know it, the guy that quit ESO 2 years ago knows it. Couple that with the fact Imperial City (the only place IMO where you want to PvP solo outside of BGs) is trashy as far as mob aggro through multiple zones goes, players who (very obviously) use addons to break free/roll dodge CC in the same game tick it gets applied and dont get banned despite multiple different accounts reporting them, and, the fact that PvP in the game hasnt been given any type of attention in literal years and BAM, you have a recipe for disaster. Oh, did I mention the devs just buff/nerf classes based on how they feel that day?  Ya, you get the point. Trasho. I could make this section a lot more in depth here, but these are just some of the major problems I see with PvP that need to be addressed a lot sooner than other PvP issues...Crown Store Shenanigans:So if you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on this game in ""crowns"" then you can find one of multiple sources out there on the interwebs that have services that you trade your in game gold to players who then gift you crown store items and volia, you have access to the crown store items without spending IRL $$. Sounds good right? Well it is, and if you are a conscious consumer, you will more than likely save up your gold for certain crown items to go onsale to get. Too bad the sales are few and FAR between for items that are not just cosmetic (DLCs, account assistants, race unlockables, etc) but couple that with the fact sale prices on items change all the time and it makes it super hard to save up for a piece of content you want without spending way more than you wanted. That DLC bundle that was onsale a year ago that you got your eye on? Ya its now 800 crowns more because I said so. Typical money hungry devs at work.TL;DR The game can be played and completed with just purchasing the base game, but dang is it super grindy and not enjoyable IMO. For reference, I got this game on Steam sale for like $6 and bought 1 month of ESO plus for $15. I'm $20 into the game and right at 800 hours."
Negative,"used to be a recommended review with the text ""it's alright"" (leaving context here because of the ""deep thoughts"" reactions haha)updating this since it's been quite some time, and the game is in an abysmal state. the devs not only making changes just for the sake of it anymore, but are actively making objectively bad-for-business changes (disabling crown store exchange is a huge part of this). many players including myself have quit the game during the timeframe between update 35 and now, but it's especially bad now and I don't see it improving in any significant way in the future. I could not recommend this to anybody, not even casual players.I could sit here listing off all the problems with the game rn, but it's extremely long and the problems affect every type of player (casuals, roleplayers, endgamers) so I don't feel it's worth my time. just know that the game is in a very bad state right now."
Negative,"you get to download 80 gigs on steam, and then another 80 gigs through their dedicated launcher at a throttled bandwidth speed.after which you can slam your head againt the keyboard, pray it lets you launch and spend the rest of the day looking up how to fix it.this was months ago, the problem is still not fixed.oh did i mention that downloading the massive game file through the launcher counts as game time? yeah so you definetly can't refund this game since you will be spending much more than 2 hours downloading it.i have 21 hours logged, about 4 of those are actually playing the game, the one time it worked."
Negative,"Pros:1) Takes place in the beautiful Tamriel and gives continuity to vast narrative that started decades ago. For a veteran Elder Scrolls gamer, it's pure gold2) Offers many hours of gameplay3) For a MMORPG, it actually offers a reasonable level of visual noise and individualityCons:1) Buggy as hell (no surprises here). You can expect the game to crash everyday and having to load it 2-3 time per session, especially when joining battlegrounds and dungeons. 2) The usual problems with MMORPGs - You have all those trolls and hysterical kids that play 10 hours a day, have hyper-advanced, invencible characters, and insult everybody around. Customer Service won't do anything about it even if you report it.3) You also have some infinite-spawn enemies, that really take away the realism of the game. 4) After you spend money buying the game and have built your expectations you realize that, to have access to the nice features and adventures, you need to keep spending more and more. The game is designed to monetize the heck out of you and that sucks. I don't want to buy a game with locked areas, locked dungeons, being in disadvantage because other players spent more money on their character than me. Merit and fun should be the drivers, not cash.I'm putting a thumbs down because, in essence, this game doesn't leave me with a good feeling so the net effect is negative. It could be great but it's barely good. I wouldn't buy it again."
Negative,"running simulator , dont waste your money, no action shit game fuck it where is my refund"
Negative,"The servers are so bad that i cant even log in, 5minutes in and dissapointed... Unninstaled"
Negative,have to repair the game through the launcher everytime i load it up due to an infinite loading screen. incredibly frustrating.
Negative,"Combat is soo ass, like for real is it so bad"
Negative,"(I have plenty of time playing on the ESO launcher) The combat feels awful, and the game has loot boxes. Also, the craft bag being locked behind a monthly subscription pretty much makes it a forced pay to play. The lack of inventory space and the large amount of crafting items will clog up your backpack and bank in no time, so you'll be forced to constantly throw things away.Also the servers lag pretty frequently."
Negative,"Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will ""sell"" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really."
Negative,"Stop killing games with a company greed first approach, Bethesda. It should always be players first."
Negative,"An okay game, marred by bad customer support. As long as you never have an issue, this game is worth a little bit of time. But if you, like me, have an issue at any point, you're SOL."
Negative,"No endgame elements, nothing i do feels good. Could be seen good game with rich elements for new players, those good comments come from them perhaps."
Negative,"World is not exciting to explore, lore was thrown out the window (example: people riding atronoch mounts in Kvatch and the population there doesn't even react to it!), clothing and armour is uninspiring.   This game survives by relying on people's gambling habits ( crown crates) and I can never recommend it for that reason alone.  They do a good job adding new content. You can do a lot as a solo player or multiplayer but it is repetitive and boring.I love the elder scrolls games and have spend years playing them but this just can't compare."
Negative,"Horrible game. You have download the 80 GB launcher then within the launcher download the game which is at least another 80 GB. The game play is not exciting, poor graphic quality, poor story line. Worst $60 spent in my entire life."
Negative,game has shown me as having played for 33 hrs when I haven't even played for one second.. I don't even know what the game looks like .   delete and reloading the game one more time to try to get it to play on my Alienware system.
Negative,"I only played for a short while so I can't say much about the game other than I didn't like a single second of its moment to moment gameplay. An hour of play has made me go from ""wide awake"" to ""I need a nap"". The heart of the gameplay feels off. The combat is incredibly stiff, the controls are awkward, and the game's nature as an MMO leads to an overbearing level of dissonance. It's hard to feel like your character matters in the world when other players wait in line to ""stealth kill"" the plot enemy or run in from out of nowhere to instantly wreck the quest boss you're fighting. The best example of this is in the game's opening moments. You fight your way through a short prison segment, you're told by your companion to kill some important big bads for some reason or other, and then you're immediately thrown into a playpen of other level 1 players running in circles and swinging at nothing. For me personally it feels like a tonal 180° from what I like about Elder Scrolls titles. I have nothing against MMO design, I just wish the game was more instanced than it seems to be. (From the small bit I played.)I'm sure there's a great community and a number of great features to enjoy in the game. But I just don't have the motivation to dive back in right now."
Negative,"Not Recommended.The game is decent... but somehow feels old. This is just my opinion after 37 hours that I could play for free, after two created characters, one I left at lvl 31... so just after scratching the surface.The control and animations in 2021 are very important part of the game and somehow it feels ""floaty"". It just feels wrong when you go through your enemy, there is no ""weight"" in the game for the movements, but aside that it is not particularly ""bad""... and well visibly was not made for 3rd person view, which is usable, but terrible if you have to aim and select an enemy in the midst of a battle... and a game with so fast movement and very bright visual effects for a 1st person view is not the best, but this is just a viewpoint of mine, however:In every point... just feels old:- The graphics are not great, lets say ""good enough"", but lack some visual tricks that makes the game feel old... (starting with shadows, foliage, and so on)- The animations I have mentioned already, just too ""floaty""... and static at places that are visible for the player all the time (the tail of the character, for instance)- The instanced world that just barely missing loading screens between territories just... feels old...- And that the first time I have felt that I am a part of a world and a player-party was after lvl 30, when the dungeons got harder and my random party truly needed the tank I have raised.Aside these there are way too many good points for this game to mention, but the most ""rememberable"" ones for me were:- You can really mix-and-match your character as you wish. A tank with heavy armor, taunting skills, with self- and party-healing on the side and with devastating ultimate ability? No problem. All of this on a khajiit, cat race, originally for medium armor and light abilities like stealth and stealing. :)- The story-telling of this game is amazing. Full voice-acted, well-enough animated where it really counts, which helps you feel the world somewhat.- Music matches the environment, after a while it becomes so deeply a part of the experience, you will not even notice, but it is there and is a must to have the full experience.- Being solo-able is good and bad at the same time, but it is, at least at the part I have tried. You can start alone easily. :)I still cannot recommend it. If the base game were to be free, yes, absolutely. But not even the discounted 8 EUR is something that I would be willing to pay for it, not with so many downsides... not to mention that the good stuff, the real game starts with the Plus Membership, which is a monthly subscription - even if you can easily have fun for ""free"" as well - which is not free, let me remind you --, and with very pricey DLCs after...Not Recommended."
Negative,"Possibly the worst game in the series and that is being generous. Cities and settlements are captured in true Elder Scrolls style in that they are unrealistically small, even for medieval-type cities. They are also much less interesting than many cities from Oblivion or Morrowind. As a member of the Daggerfall Covenant, I began in the city of the same name. The supposed capital of High Rock actualy appears to be smaller than many walled cities in skyrim, and most of them are pretty small. The landscape was repetitive and the graphics are somehow worse than skyrim's in many ways. The game runs incredibly poorly as well, with close to 30fps on medium settings in some areas with a GTX 970. The combat is a clunky Frankenstein's monster, stiched together from the systems traditionaly used in Elder Scrolls games, as well as the likes of World Of Warcraft. This results in some awkward finger placement if one wants to move and use abilities at the same time. The game does have some redeeming qualities though. The art design is quite good. It feels almost like a gloomier version of Oblivion. What really, REALLY annoys me about this game is the ignorance to the lore of the series. I find it hard to believe that by the time of the main series, everyone has somehow forgotten about how Molag Bal nearly conquered Nirn. No references exist in any other game and this makes the story seem somewhat forced and shoe-horned in to the lore awkwardly. I wouldn't be surprised if this game eventually goes the way of Age Of Reckoning (a much better game) and die."
Negative,this game was $6 on sale and i still feel like i've been robbed
Negative,"DON'T BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM!The grass is greener on the other side. By that I mean go buy the game through zeni online website, and don't link it to your steam."
Negative,"didn't read comments, bought game through steam, can't log in. seriously disappointed right now."
Negative,Streamline the main quest you fucking retards
Negative,Fire Rich Lambert so we can get something new please.
Negative,You can imagine that with 4936 Hours I would have something to say about this game Your right This game was a great game for a time. I loved the aspect of getting to explore Tamriel and become engrossed into the MMORPG space. Over time however the game has added dozens of new DLCs that you MUST pay for. Over time you begin to lose out on the items [Sometimes playable Classes] of the new DLCs. Considering most are overpriced it's simply not worth it to continue buying those DLCs. I understand games gotta make money but after Microsoft got a hold of Bethesda and thus ZeniMax the base game has suffered.
Negative,"i own this game since 2015. the high latency in this game and low fps makes you feel like it's 1996 again and you are playing on a dial-up modem. if you are a masochist then go right ahead and buy this game. endgame for this mmo is pvp. only a handfull of ppl run trials. just for the score... there is no other incentive to run them. engine sux. servers suck. find something else to do while we wait for Ashes of Creation and Camelot Unchained. if you're looking for single player then go right ahead. loads of content for the price of the base game. you don't need to buy any dlc. just sub, finish the dlc, unsub."
Negative,"i played a few hours now and i like it, but i just learned that there is a thing called ESO+ what is a monthly subscription for the game which gives you unfair benefits against other players. I tought it will give some skins or other cool stuff like looks and mounts maybe... no... u get the upcoming dlc-s with it as well and bank spaces and personal bag spaces for your stuff and guess what they give you and extra ""material"" or "" Crafting bag"" upgrade which holds infinite amount of crafting material for you. otherwise if you start crafting you are doomed... you not gonna be able to enjoy it because you constantly run out of spaces and it will turn into a space management game..... i'm kinda a hoarder myself and this was a big dissapointment for the game... sadly i cannot refund the game but i would probably do after i learnt this....So if you are into crafting (Alchemy,enchanting,blacksmithing,woodworking,leatherworking,clothing) who knows what else is there and you wish to do any of it then don't buy it... I personally HATE to pay extra for a game after i already BOUGHT a game.... freaking ridiculous..... I might be too old for thinking like this but if i'm buying a game once i don't wanna buy it again every f***** month.....its making my blood boil....So i wouldn't recommend this game for these reasons... I hope i helped some of you make the right choice and leave this game alone..."
Negative,"The game looks fantastic, but unfortunately that's as much praise I can give. The combat system leaves too much to be desired. It makes Skyrim hack and slash combat system look like a masterpiece. The walking animations are stiff and the sprint does not improve. As a MMO RPG that presents itself as a third person game you'd think playing it in the perspective would help do it some justice. Instead you just see all of the flaws even better. I spent maybe an hour or  so playing the game to see if it gets any better, the answer to that is no. The recycled nostalgic atmosphere from Skyrim and previous Elder Scroll games can't help this lazy game get any better. Please if you're looking for a game that is a MMO RPG better just stick with WOW or something cause this game really is lazy in terms of mechanics. Again, highlights are graphics, environment, character creation, and cut scenes. Possibly music...maybe. Honestly the amount of micro- transactions to that is required to make this game even playable is shameful. DO NOT BUY if you are expecting a masterpiece game or buy at full price. Base price of 20$ I would say was too much for you actually get in this game."
Negative,"Play ESO :) it's probably some of the most fun i have had in an MMO in a VERY long time. The game is just refreshing on every level.It's helping me enjoy games more, almost like breaking down what years of wow has taught me. In dungeons as a healer i'm not staring at bars, as a dps i'm not staring at a meter, and as a tank you don't just sit there and take damage. When you are healing you don't start at people's health bars, you just aoe heal, you are there to keep your teamates alive, as long as they don't get themselves killed, not heal them through fire.The combat is great!! Seriously, it's alot of fun, but buggy. The thing about buggy though, is it's fixable, and shitty combat is not fixable(to a degree). It's not THAT buggy though (says the level 50 sorc running around spamming teleport all day long waiting for a fix)Questing, i don't know where to begin! It's rewarding, it's enticing, and it's exhilarating. You discover a new town...THATS FULL OF SKELETON PEOPLE...but they are alive and you MUST help then, and at the end, you have to decide the fate of this village, will you keep their immortal existence without skin or flesh, with no heart or brain just, dry nothingness. Or release them from their mortal bonds and let them rest in peace.IT'S JUST SO GOOD... idk, i love the game though, i'm level 35 and i'm still in shadowfen finishing up quests because of how much fun i'm having exploring tamriel. Come join me :)"
Negative,for rich WoW playerto grindy1 bean can out of 34 dragonborn
Negative,"Remove ESO Plus and free the QOL features and I'd play. Keep it paywalled and I won't, simple as that."
Negative,"Another week, another massive Steam outage.Don't buy this game."
Negative,"Poor floaty combat combined with server lag. The writing is atrocious, I played on console for a long time because of friends and couldn't remember a single quest, you wouldn't expect that in an elder scrolls game.The timesink isn't worth it, you need to play for hundreds of hours to touch the proper end game stuff when you could just play ff14 and get through a ton of its good content doing the story."
Negative,"Game is not new player friendly at all, and only if you're a roleplayer, a true Elder Scrolls fan, or an MMO addict, do you get to see any of the ""Fun"" this game has to offer.1. Intro process for new players is time consuming and mildly ridiculous. The leveling system in the game has two parts, you character level, and your ""Champion"" (Account) level. You can only earn experience towards Champion levels if your character is max level (50). Skills are another mountain new players have to focus on as there are A LOT of skills that effectively do the same thing, but with some slight variations in damage types, effects, and aoe/single target. With 12 slots to put skills in and with the amount of skills in the game, this feels overwhelming from choosing which of the optional skills that are the best, to realising that 10 base skills doesn't feel like that many in choosing, it is difficult creating a solid rotation. But none of that matters until you hit max character level, which if you're just a casual player without using xp buffs, will take a hot minute because.....2. Base game content is laughably easy and mind numbingly so. I quit this game 3 times over the course of multiple years attempting to drag my character through xp farms and find fun things to use. The game features basic mechanics of Stunning for blocking, bonus heavy damage on stun, and even some wind up attacks that enemies can be bashed out of. None of these mechanics will enemies use against you, and in addition to that, hp pools of creeps are just kinda high, which makes leveling just a true slug fest. 3 This game gets good. For those of you really looking for hope, this game does get good, but the question you do have to ask yourself is ""Is it worth my time?"" For those of us who love the grind, love mmos, and enjoy a bit of lore, this game is indeed worth it. A whole world to explore with stories to be told, characters can be built with purpose and have fun without being terribly far behind in power just because you wanted your Paladin to have a bow. Class balance is Alright, not gonna say good, but any class can fulfill any role. 4 Prepare yourself for every new patch to be broken. Currently ESO is infesting my D Drive and when contacting support they say they'll have a patch out in 2 weeks. I can't play the game and have gotten kicked from all my guilds now because of it. Thanks ZOS."
Negative,"Back in 2017/2018 when I started playing I was very charmed with the sheer size of Tamriel. All quests are voiced, which is extremely impressive. The landscapes are often beautiful. I was very approving of the philosophy of ""you can play however you want and still be good"", however this is accomplished with extremely easy overland enemies. I was excited for the end-game, until I realised how inconvenient it is. Halfway through I was pushed to the corner of having to pay ESO+ because of the sheer amount of trash materials that appear everywhere as you steal and deconstruct gear. The state of PvP is absolutely dismal. The same balance that goes in PvE is applied to PvP except for some generalized changes. Everyone has to be a vampire to play PvP, which really kills identity. There are a couple sets that are viable for PvP because they're so OP against players. It's mostly abandoned in terms of balance and the meta is extremely restricted (atm if you don't play dragon knight for corrosive armor in high-level battlegrounds you're trolling) Don't even get me started about sets. It's pay-to-win because the best are locked behind a paywall, attainable in paid dungeons and trials. Mythics are pretty much needed for endgame, and you'll need ESO+ to start unlocking those along with a 20h grind to unearth them. If you can manage to enjoy the slow vertical progression that this game offers and at the same time be stranded once you find the ideal setup, and if you manage to circumvent the issues with the NA-PC economy being inflated out of proportion, you can enjoy the excellent questlines (particularly Deadlands) with grey morality and plot twist.I cannot recommend this game because although I've met great people playing it, after a while you get an unavoidable, nagging feeling that there is nothing to do except for micromanaging the many inconveniences that are built-in to make you pay for ESO+"
Negative,"Not without merit, but I've come to realise that it's a profoundly empty experience Cons:- So many invisible barriers while you're trying to explore the world - A trite chosen one narrative that really grinds my gears.- Inventory management is limitedPros:- Music is great- As limited as it is, stealing and pickpocketing is fairly unique mechanic in an MMO- Crafting and class freedom is welcome- Can mostly be played solo"
Negative,"I'm late to the party by a huge stretch on this one, I'm aware. That said, I have some thoughts after having played this briefly: Garbage. It's got the same plastic, rote feel to it that every bad MMO in the past 20 years has had. The illusion of action RPG is heavy with absolutely no substance, it's all just mashing hotkeys for abilities and waiting for cooldowns. What was needed for this game was for it to be multiplayer Skyrim. Instead they opted to ape the existing MMO formula and deprive this game of everything that made Elder Scrolls really cool. One picks up on the continuous gameplay loop within the first 4 hours of playtime: 1) You go into a new area2) You pick up a seed quest with an overarching goal3) You pick up satellite quests that contribute to the goal of the seed quest4) Complete satellite quests which constitute killing enemies, talking to NPCs, or interacting with environmental objects.5) Completed satellite quests roll up into the seed quest and you turn it in6) Move onto the next area.""It's fully voice though!"" Big deal... If every NPC was a Michael Gambon-calibur actor, I might be interested to hear their performance. I uninstalled this after 10 hours of playtime and immediately installed Skyrim and a bunch of visual and gameplay overhaul mods in order to wash my palette of this completely bland experience."
Negative,The Necromancer is not a Necromancer. He's just a guy who swings around a stupid scythe. The only summons he gets are temporary skellies that explode like bombs or stand still and shoot arrows/spells at nearby enemies and deal almost no damage.I see the other classes in the game that get summons. I see them in he market place with their Scamps and their Clanfears and their Harpies following them around. I want skelliebros to follow me around. I want to be able to summons frens from beyond the grave to do my bidding and fight for me :(Don't fall for Todd's lies Necrobros. The Necromancer isn't a real Necromancer. He's an imposter.
Negative,"Very close to being a good game, but the overworld content is no challenge at all, even to a completely new player, and this really ruins what could have been a great experience. The story telling is good, but the complete lack of challenge really cheapens the experience."
Negative,"they do unnecessary upgrades that lock you out of the game, you have to re-install the game and hope it fixes the problem most of the time NOT"
Negative,"developer policies are really bad, too many perma bans"
Negative,Elder scrolls in name and assets aloneActual disappointment
Negative,"The game was really fun and used to be a great MMO. While it still may be if you don't care about dungeons and progressing in the end-game content, the patch they just dropped unfortunately ruined the game in a combat standpoint. Healing is essentially impossible and several fights in the late game trials are impossible now. They ignored community feedback and pushed a combat balancing patch that (at best) can be considered a ""1 step forward and 100 steps back"" approach."
Negative,"Little more than a story filled running simulator. Combat is clunky and buggy at best. Quests are a joke, the endless running and spam-clicking through uninteresting dialogue. The AI is terrible, attacking players while 'Hidden' in stealth or buggy teleporting while they swing their weapons. This game is nothing like the elder scrolls series and that by itself is just sad. Everyone knows Bethesda can make games. I believe it's Zenimax's contribution that soured this game. Even with the Steam special, this game isn't worth the effort to slog through the very common and uninteresting parts of today's MMO rpgs. It honestly feels like the creativity behind the Elder Scrolls games was just mysteriously lost in this title. Sure, it's online. But it's plagued by the same issues as EVERY MMO made. Bots, trolls and lack of creativity. It's depressing, it really is."
Negative,"I don't understand the point of this game these days, I remember trying it on launch years ago, I remember their being progression, mob levels etc.. Decided to try it recently, and now it seems everything is all on the same power levels and I can just go wherever and do whatever, sounds good on paper, but theres not really any ""gear progression"", and any gear u do want is locked behind DLC within the expansions u already paid for... I just dont see the point, only played a few days and instantly want to log off when I log in..."
Negative,"infinite loading simulator. after 30min i still waiting for the game to log me ini dont even played the game yet. it stuck on login screeni even left pc on over night to downloadin the end i wasted my time,money. now i will just wait for a fix and play other game10/10 hype killer"
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THROUGH STEAM.You will not be able to log in. Purchase it directly from the official website.I should have investigated a little more on this game, before I bought it through Steam.Now Steam users cannot log in due to connectivity issues between Steam and Zenimax.Again, I do not recommend buying this game from Steam."
Negative,Well it is a nice game IF you can play it but many people have frequent crashes (including myself) and its not a hardware problem because every other of my 400+ games works flawlessly.Now I will give them a week or so to fix this if not its going to steam support and gettin my money back...Will update if they update...Update: No Update. Will ask for refund.
Negative,"ESO is a game where you run around ticking off check boxes in every area for what you've accomplished. Skyshards, Bosses, and other various markers will keep you busy while you grind the infinite champion levels once you hit 60. Most of the builds from the classes are somewhat the same but others can min/max better. Updates are going to kill your favourite play-style, skill tree/line, or class in general (for me it was the vampire). Expansions offer some good content, but it's best to wait till you can grab a collections worth for less than the 79.99 they charge for a single expansion. Other expansions (I'm looking at you gold road) will offer menial content which could have been changed with a simple patch fix, the upgrade and changing of skills should not be considered a feature when that's what a patch or update literally can do!VIP status gets you a bag to hold your ingredients, more bank space, and a small exp boost. All for the low price of 17.99 a month. By Grabthar's hammer...what a savings...Game is pretty much a inventory management simulator mixed with some combat, vampires, werewolves, and other oddities. Avoid the micro-transaction shop and sort through gear to save space so you don't have to buy into the VIP nonsense.If everyone is VIP, what's so special about it?"
Negative,"Pretty sure this was a nice game. But I haven't play it that much because of the problem that I've got from the launcher downloading or repairing for 25 hours.(Update: People, I gave the game another go and tried to play it for a few hours. The game is pretty decent and enjoyable, and if I looked into it further, which I haven't, it appears like the game provides in-depth coverage of this sort of game. Just like the original Elder Scrolls.And which I have not delved into. I simply give up after the last time I tried the game again. The more games I have, the more I believe I ought to move on and play the remainder of the titles I owned at the time. Took me 5 years, at the very least, I gave the game another chance to pique my curiosity.But for the time being. I doubt I will really immerse myself in the game. And who knows, I could make a return one day, if the server doesn't shut down anytime soon, ironically. I mean, it's meant to be a full-service online game, right? So, if you want to play the game, go for it! I believe the game is running flawlessly for everyone right now.Much love and peace out!)"
Negative,Game is trash now
Negative,Doesn't work with Windows 7 as the system requirements specify ... also it needs 117GB of disk space and not the 85GB specified => System requirements are way out of date.
Negative,the game is good BUT multiple login issues via steam. buy it elsewhere.
Negative,"If you're based in asia you should rethink before buying this game. Server only based at NA and EU. PvP is unplayable because of the high latency and PvE isnt really good either eventhough it has less stutters, but personally it does effect on your gameplay and gets on my nerves eventually."
Negative,"ESO is not multiplayer elder scrolls it is an elder scrolls themed MMO while it has the lore and locations of a traditional elder scrolls game it misses one of the key factors, the world building.Its also full of microtransactions and its very hard to unlock the full game.

Negative,"Any game where you have to buy the game that also has DLC, expansions, subscriptions, and microtransactions is a bad game. This nonsense is predatory and deeply frustrating. ""Fee to pay""However, even if you were to ignore all of those crimes (which you shouldn't), the game itself is so incredibly dull for over 90% of what you would be doing. The ""good stuff"" comes at the ""end"" of the game, meaning if you want to get to it you must spends many hours (my play time for example) just getting a character up to the level where it can compete. Most quests are uninteresting, offer little variety, and provide few incentives to explore the empty boring world. Some interesting designs here and there can not possibly make up for the avalanche of time wasting this game throws at you.As for the ""good stuff,"" I also did not care for it. Feels very ""look up what the right stuff to use is and do that"" and/or ""learn the right combination of inputs and do that on repeat until it dies"" with occasional ""don't stand here"" or ""press this button"" mechanics which you likely only know because someone in your group tells you to do it.Edit for Developer Response:My point is not that these purchases are ""optional"" (even though at this point such a large amount of content is behind chapter or DLC purchases they feel less than optional), but that a person can pay for a game only to be hit with suggestions of paying a subscription to get in game bonuses or give us more money to access all of the content or here's a bunch of microtransaction content. Unless you are adding a substantial amount of new content to a previously finished game, buying the game should get you the game full stop."
Negative,"Wouldn't recommend it. It is dead boring.I bought the game in September 2014, played it through the free month, got bored  and quit my subscription.I gave it a second try with Tamriel Unlimited, but still found the game to be too boring and stopped wasting my time.So far I have reached around level 40. I wanted to reach 50 to be able to revisit Vvardenfell, but I just can't force myself to play anymore."
Negative,Just play Oblivion.
Negative,the most borring mmo Ive ever played to be honest. Its just a single player. You cant really play main quests with friends.
Negative,You know a game is good when it takes care of your mild addiction by shutting down the servers so you can try do something  productive. Thank you.Another one.
Negative,A HUGE downfall for Elder Scrolls games.
Negative,"DO NOT buy this game via Steam. For over more than two years, it has had many login issues which do not let you login for multiple hours and sometimes even full days! The downtime is insane."
Negative,"Dont get this game through steam endless login problems, buy it from ESO website, really good game though"
Negative,Fun but should be called 'Pay Walls Online' instead.
Negative,5 years and still waiting for an OCE server so it can be playable at an end game level :)
Negative,"It's not acceptable in this day and age for this game to not have an Asian server. You need a server in Singapore. I did not enjoy my time with this game. I did spend about $10 to buy the full package. I just think it's not what I expected. And based solely on my experience, I would not recommend this to my friends for the time being."
Negative,"This seems like it might be a neat world to explore - but I can't get my charater to load! After 20 hours of trying I've only been able to play 30 minutes! I HAVE PUT 20 HOURS INTO THIS GAME, 30 MINUTES OF WHICH WERE ACTUAL GAME! The rest of the time was troubleshooting and patching. Speaking of patches, there are some frankly irresponsible levels of downloading required to set up this game. Hope your internet doesn't have a cap!"
Negative,"Don't Expect: Skyrim with multiplayer, or another TES.Expect: Lots of bugs and crashes, lags and problems.Zenimax shouldn't make games you can't play."
Negative,Elder Scrolls Offline
Negative,spastic devs and shit game
Negative,"Buy to play, keep buying to keep playing."
Negative,"To be honest, I got bored with this game. It may show a lot of hours, but that is because there is a lot that comes with this game. If you are a fan of skyrim or oblivion, I cannot recommend this game. After 40 or so hours, every mission just seemed the same. I do not know why I could not get into it and I hope that this is not what the Elder Scrolls 6 will be."
Negative,Don't buy this game through steam it makes you download an old version off steam. Then after that the elder scrolls launcher makes you download the newest version of the game and doesn't even try patching the old garbage version. So just buy it through the bethesda website. Now I'm going to go complain to humble monthly for giving me this garbage.
Negative,"This game is the textbook example of pay-to-win philosophy within game development studios. The fact that some of the best equipment in the game requires you to purchase not one, not two, but three different DLC zones to acquire is a bit much. And that isn't even to mention how overpriced the majority of the paid content in this game is. Over $100 for a player home? Really? How is Zenimax Online Services even getting away with this? This is robbery!"
Negative,"I got this game and i am trying to play 2 days now it says to me AFTER I COMPLETE DOWNLOADING  unable to initialize connection to steam....i done repair,saw almost all the videos on internet how to fix that and still nothing...just fail af i try to play other games from steam and all working like ff14 ech ech but on this just disappointing .."
Negative,"Hate before play, because I can't even play it.1) It says that need 85 Gb of free space, but after download it want +85Gb more! total 170 Gb!!!but ok, I clean my HDD and install it and game stuck on loading screen forever! I tried many solutions from forums but nothing work. What's wrong this problem exsists since 2014!!!"
Negative,So much of in game content is behind a paywall or subscription. It's disrupting and difficult to really sink your teeth into without deep wallets. I also think the quests lack the depth that the other Elder Scrolls games have
Negative,"couldnt connect to the server, what a shittty game"
Negative,"ESO+ states that it comes with all DLC. It fails to tell you that Zenimax doesn't count Summerset as DLC, regardless of the fact that it is content that you download."
Negative,Literally one of the worst games I have ever played.I only recommend this game if you have exceedingly low expectations when it comes to gaming or if you are limited to two fingers and love PvP.
Negative,"Very much meh game, one big deal breaker is the way armors look hated when it first came out and now till hating on it. The combat is also a huge meh consisting of wildly swing your sward left to right - its just a boring game.On the plus side the feel is that if your weapons connect then you do dmg - so no lockon crap but not good enough to redeem the game"
Negative,"I am sorry. This game is not particularly good. I wanted to play this since I like Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim all, and my wife and I are looking for a new fantasy game we can play together after having played D3 one time too many. ;-) However, this is not the Elder Scrolls quality I had hoped for. The graphics are in fact far below the quality in Skyrim, but that I guess can be explained by the need to reduce lag online. What really was disappointing though, is that we don't play together as a team - I have a quest I must do, and my wife must do the exact same quest. So, we run about doing exactly the same thing, and with other players suddenly appearing in our game and doing exactly the same as us as well. I really can't see any real multiplayer in this - we do not cooperate to solve a task; we do the same task, over and over again. Here's hoping for BG3 multiplayer to deliver."
Negative,"If there was a Meh option I'd go for that.The game is enjoyable, particularly the quests. The main reason I am playing it, is due to Elder Scrolls name and that in most cases it actually feels like they have tried to fit an MMORPG to the Elder Scrolls setting.But there are things that definitely drag it down.*Seasons of lootboxes*Wet noodle combat*Too high Crown prices*Inane expansion prices and pricing, cheaper to buy base game again with latest expansion(s) instead of DLC separately (should be parity).*FOMO shenanigans.I have bought the expanions and some crowns, but I bought the Elsweyr expansion for 15 € or so and that was Digital Collector's Edition, and later I bought some crowns when it was discounted. Otherwise, I would not have purchased. I can also ignore the FOMO stuff."
Negative,"Edit: After all this time, they still have not fixed pvp. I am uninstalling this game and removing it from my library. PVP in this game is horribleCompletely unbalanced, some skills are so powerful they are game changers, fights take an ungodly amount of time, etc. I really expected more from someone who was once on the DAoC team, then again Matt Firor's ""accomplishment"" was bringing out New Frontiers which needed major overhauls to become good. When a fight takes an upwards of 20 minutes, you screwed up somewhere in the design process. You know you also screwed up somewhere when you had to bring in limiters to avoid players 1 shotting others, but at the same time made it extremely hard to even do anything to said person. Its very unfun, and honestly I played the game for this and after putting in nearly 600 hours, I am about ready to quit and wait for Camelot Unchained.The keeps always flip, and pvp is never populated, it feels very destitute. All the server choices and flavors does this game no justice. The keeps themselves and strategic points you can capture are through standing on flags? Are you freaking serious? Thats stupid. This isn't tug of war, this is freaking war. I highly suggest the people who designed this crap fest rethink their design on pvp, cause its a joke. Its not just that though, its the skills that cause these battles to prolong, its the gear itself, its the freaking game. Its why they had to implement debuffs to damage and resistances and buffed hp because they have no real solution to this problem.PvP in its current state is very anti-fun. Champion levels and its abilities is such a toxic mechanic, why introduce something that gives you even more of an advantage over someone else? Did you learn nothing from DAoC Matt? Obviously not. I can't wait for Mark Jacob's game to come into fruition, because you sir have no talent.Don't even get me started on Emperor. Why does that mechanic even exist? I wish I could see a constant struggle between all 3 realms like in DAoC. But when someone gets EMP, people quit playing and leave PvP until he is gone, and when we come back, the whole map is one color. Thats the game. The map is always one color for the most part because no one cares about PvP. The big fights are very rare and you never really see zerg on zerg warfare, or anyone really defending keeps for that matter."
Negative,"My review needs an update, so here it is. I recently sat down, and played it  with a friend of mine. The game is so beautiful. The chat is a dumpster fire of toxic players, and nobody will help out. You basically have to solo everything up to endgame, I tought them crafting, the basics of the game, and how to do solo dungeons. But there isn't really anyone in the early game that will help you. Everyone leveling is just making alts. One of my biggest problems that bothered me before, and still bothers me is the armor. The developers make these incredible beautiful skins, and tattoos. But the armor covers everything, and you can't see any of the skins that you purchase. I am a girl, and I don't enjoy my character being completely covered up. I want to show skin, and feel cute. If I am paying money to buy a pretty skin, I want to see it. So me and my friend are going to try FFXIV next, their armors show more skin.I made the last review in 2016! Since then I've been playing FFXIV, and wanted to give ESO another try. Low and behold the armor still covers way to much, I'm going back to playing FFXIV. I'll check back in another 4 years."
Negative,"As much as i like eso, the bugs, lag, lack of support, and cost outweigh ALL positives. if you want to wait, at the very least, FIVE hours for the game to even install be my guest (and do not pull the ""you must have slow internet bs. I always go to my parents house to download games and they have the absolute fastest internet possible. and also no, it has nothing to do with the speed or age or whatever of my computer.) I can't even contact support because I can not launch the GAME'S LAUNCHER. Seriously save yourself the headache, time, and most importantly the money..do not buy eso. Their most recent f-up was an event where you got extra xp for doing dungeons but the dungeon finder did not even work. and guess what? it wasn't ""fixed"" until the event was practically over and they did nothing to make up for their mess! Also they ""fixed"" it twice and its broken again lol. Honestly, buy the game just to see what people say about ZOS in zone chats, thats the only part that is worth your money."
Negative,"Game has a lot of content however its practically a pay to win and anyone who's played the game or some time has a large advantage over new players. Game is also extremely focused on leveling and unlocking skills which takes the fun out of jumping in and just having fun. Kinda feels like you have to be a loser in a basement to enjoy the spoils. Ain't no body got time or that! LMAO! No seriously its too much content and way to many l;earning curves to become good at the game and every patch switches the content so u have to reinvent the wheels of gaming. On top of it all, the company punishes streamers on Youtube and other platforms for speaking on facts about exploits etc because it causes the company to invest in monies to fix the game as opposed to taking it as constructive criticism. They rather invest on more items that require a pay to win approach.  they continuously ban people for shedding light on developer errors and exploits that need help to fix after they have been addressed first to the company and ignored for months at a time. Check out Hoarcrux on youtube for more info on the sad truth behind the game and gameplay."
Negative,FUCKING TRASH. DO NOT EVEN TRY THE FREE WEEKEND.
Negative,"bug that wasnt made of invincible strolled across hot (rock that was not rock anymore), unimmersive cos he didnt stop alive. bethesda can eat all of my human stir fry"
Negative,It's hard to rec this game with it's heavy leaning on a paid monthly perk pack.
Negative,it does not load bruh
Negative,"Can't make use of the crafting systems because the game gives you a trillion useless furniture items to clog up your inventory to make you buy the premium subscription that gives you unlimited space. No-one ever talks except to spam ""crow crow crow"", I have no idea what that means. What the fuck is a plunder skull"
Negative,"Worthless, Dont buy it. Questing in groups is broken. You have to micromanage every quest with every person in your group or you will constanly hit walls where you cannot play together. It has issues where people in the group disapear and cannot see anyone else.  Unless they fix the group issues its not worth it. Playing as a group is the backbone of this genre. Where is my refund? I'm tired of broken games, and if you are as well you won't support them. Its not an alpha, or beta, its broken on full release."
Negative,"MMO, not my kind of thing. Everybody running in all directions. You arrive to the boss, boss is slain, take a number and wait for it to respawn. It kinda eats the whole buzz from the game. Slay gazzillion of one shot enemies. Booooriiing."
Negative,"The game is fine.   I didn't experience any bugs in my few hours.  But the game hamstrings itself from being actually fun by trying to make it annoying to not buy the ""ESO Plus"".   Inventory is minimized and so is some of the customization.Background: I participated in the beta weekends a few years ago, but did not play at release because of the ridiculous subscription.   Now, a few years later, I picked up the game with Morrowind for the $29.99 sale.  As I mentioned, its a solid MMORPG experience with good characters, and voice acting, and overall environment.   But it just gets tedious constantly doing inventory management.   For the tedium alone, I cannot recommend this game.   Unless that's what you're looking for."
Negative,"No innovating, otherwise it's good MMO I guess."
Negative,"they will ""sell"" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising)."
Negative,"it's a fun game - when it actually lets you play. The game is plagued with connection issues, from random booting to not being able to connect to the server at all"
Negative,"To many Login Problems with the Steam Client. If you buy it from Steam, prepare to not be able to play for a whole day once a week. ESO+ Membership cancled because of this. Realy unacceptable!"
Negative,You can't even log in to this game without googling for an hour and a half.
Negative,"Tried several times to enjoy this game. Simply not a game for me, as I haven't liked an MMO since Guild Wars 2.if you are like me, you will find this to be a rather dull and humdrum experience that doesn't hold a candle to literally any other TES game. Certainly not for the cost of entry.just cross your fingers and enter a state of delusion hoping Bethesda will make a good game for once with TESVI featuring a  hop in/out co-op system. I came to this game hoping for Oblivion/Skyrim + friends. It is not that."
Negative,"After over 300 hours the game just decided to not load anymore. Ive done everything... cleared cache, followed the multiple steps on ESO's website, and still nothing. After the game installs, it loads a black screen, never allowing me to force quit the app. Just stays running until the end of time. After months of trying to get this game to work I just have to give up and go back to WoW. Im incredibly disappointed and will likely never play another zenimax game again. i would suggest the same for you."
Negative,"I'm just addicted to this game and I can't help myself, please send help into Tamriel!Update of my Review: 2.8.2020Please someone, get my wife away from this game, I'm already over it, done with this game, done with paying ZOS for it, I have spended way too much of a time and money for this game and now the only reason why I'm still there is because of my wife, but please, if there is some good soul around in here, please convince my wife to step away from this game or it will never stop for me D:"
Negative,"Hi, I'm brazilian and I'm using google translator to communicate with you.I bought the game here from Stream, downloaded it, and when it ran it, an installer called InstallAnywhere fails 99% and tells me to run it from another installer.Look for several ways to solve the problem and can not.Help me please."
Negative,Waste of time. Keep wasting my time
Negative,"quests are bland and boring, and the skill system doesn't feel exciting and  versatile -0/10"
Negative,"Tried to play. Seems boring. After 1 hour of gameplay, was unable to login to server, had to refund. Listen to other reviews, if you're looking to buy this game, buy it from anywhere else but steam."
Negative,Do not buy this game you need to pay real money for almost anything
Negative,"ESO is not a MMORPG its a MMOSPG (massive online single player game) -You quest alone basically if someones 10seconds behind you your on different ""sections"" of the quest and cannot help each other-you hunt alone cause together is not as benificial -everyone can craft their own gear no need for other craftersand I could go on.  It feels extremely grindy for some reason and the adventure you get in Skyrim is missinf I have no idea how they managed to make such an amazing game boring.Plus side if you dont mind spending a few hundred hours lvl and gear grinding endgame pvp is pretty decent"
Negative,"I know this will piss off the fanboys, but this game is ultra-repetative. The combat is bland, and gear seems to be unbalanced. I put all my points into heavy armor, yet medium armor generally seems to have better armor stats.  Someone once said that every new Elder Scrolls is worse than the last, and I agree whole heartedly."
Negative,"This game isn't as big as everyone makes out. In this playtime I hit max level and cp500, got full BIS gear, completed all dungeons at max difficulty, completed all raids at max difficulty, completed all quests in all zones excluding the last DLCS, Earned the 0.1% Titles from PvP, levelled an alt character to max, Is there a lot of content? Fairly, are quests repetitive? Yes. Is PvP balanced? Not in the slgihtest. Are the end game raids and dungeons worth the time? Not really but its the only way to get BIS gear. Getting mount speed is a pain, there is a content drought at max level, but it is quite fun. Note, game has major graphical issues and is CPU heavy causing framerate issues."
Negative,"i played this game for quite some time, it is the nice game, nice story, nice scenery, interesting crafting options and trading systemuntill you get pissed periodicaly with buggs that zenimax/bethesda are incapable of fixnig, bugs that are know for years and they do nothing about them, su here is the list that actualy killed this game for me:- endles loading (instance spawnig) this is on daily basis less frequest areas delves mostly, and some of them you wont simply get into, i tried to get into one quest cave 10x then i simply gave up- some instances are so laggy like they are connected by dial up, you enter new instance you get latency 999+ms even previous instance was performing quite well (60-100ms) you cant blame this on client because you return back to previous instance performance get back to normal  -invisible walls, stuck in geometry my favourite is knockback inside the wall where you cant move or do anything just wait for death- keypress ignore, key release ignore - this is most irritating because when you need react quickly in bad situation you can't      older enderscrolls had some bugs but most of them were funny, online version is pretty much bugg fest that will not be fixed anytime soon"
Negative,"I bought this game back when it came out. It was fun then, but then life got in the way and I quit. Recently I got back into it, and had a blast. Everything ran fine on my computer, early 2011 MBP. I bought summerset last month even. Now they changed the minimum specs to play. It would have been nice to know about that somewhere that they were going to change that, I wouldn't have wasted the money on something I no longer have access to. I am not going to buy a whole new computer, just to play ESO.This computer may be a 2011, but Apple gutted it and replaced everything in 2015 due to a extended warrenty. shucks I guess.... I do recommend the game. but Seriously why up the minimum specs on something that came back then."
Negative,"Three words: no free content. You pay for some kind of demo-version of the game, spend some time in it and finally understand that to play  (not just running around levelling up, but to go dungeons, trials, pvp etc)  you need to pay for DLC's that costs more than the game itself or pay every month an equally big sum of money and sales are really rare.Hopefully, there are some interesting quests and the community is really nice  if you don't play pvp . Also there is a big world to explore and unique battle system.IMO, Zenimax Studios should update base game more frequently. TESO could be a lot better under responsible development."
Negative,now its all about money
Negative,should have just made a good game instead of an mmo
Negative,Appear to only pander to their dwindling core player base - no sense of game balance unless you have a ton of resources as a long-term player.
Negative,Good game but DO NOT BUY THROUGH STEAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  STEAM ARE SH*T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  You will not be able to log in and no compensation for this as not ESO's fault but STEAMS!
Negative,"If you've not played it before don't start now. Servers are terrible, and very bugged."
Negative,"Got the game at official launch, and lost interest right away. Tried again at steam release and again lost interest. As someone who has put absurd amounts of time into Oblivion and later Skyrim. ESO just doesnt feel right and cant hold my attention."
Negative,"It's pretty shitty compared to the others and just a cash grab.   If you like mmorpg's you'll probably enjoy the never ending grind, but I don't like those types of games.  I like oblivion and skyrim.Too bad they wasted their time and effort on this and didn't just make another elder scrolls (a real one) instead."
Negative,"I fluctuate between saying ""this game is the best MMORPG"" and saying ""this game is pure junk"" everytime I reinstall it for a couple of months. And the release on Google Stadia won't change it. For more information, just have a look at the official forums and don't read the comments who got deleted by Zenimax - because you can't!"
Negative,"It won't allow me to log in from Steam. Can't launch without a whole lot of drama, then finally when it does launch can't log in. Won't link to Steam account, can't use an existing EOS account either.  Huge game takes forever to download and then you can't actually play it."
Negative,"Game is pretty good, u can do a lot of stuff, world is alive and looks fucking amazing, questing with friends is a good experience.But i CAN'T recommend this game, why? DLC, u buy the game, then u need to pay for cosmetics, pay for dungeons, pay for areas, pay, pay, pay.Half of the map is LOCKED!I bought the game pretty recently, my friend bought a few years ago, WE HAVE DIFFERENT DLCS, FOR THE BASE GAME, this is ridiculous."
Negative,"Like Multiplayer Skyrim, just worse than Skyrim itself.Spent a long time downloading it, uncompressed huge files then 1.5 hour of dissapointment."
Negative,"I understand it's a thing with all MMOs, but requiring guilds to pay an in-game currency regular fee as incentive to keep players active feels predatory. I've got other games to play."
Negative,"Isn't Cross Platform. 10/10 otherwise. If FF14 can do it, so can ESO. Unger Likes **** games."
Negative,"If you were looking for a different type of MMO this is NOT it. The game basically follows the same formula as World of Warcraft and simply hijacks the Elder Scrolls setting, it offers nothing unique in combat, quests or atmosphere. Personal recommendation is move on and spend your money on somthing else."
Negative,"* Have to wait through gigabytes of excruciatingly slow updates every time I try to play - I usually just give up because I really want to play something, and not wait 12 hours before I can* Why don't updates happen within Steam in the background?* That one time when you eventually get into the game, it isn't Elder Scrolls at all, just a cheap imitation cobbled together by a third party* What happened to controller support?  Did they take it away at some stage?Just an appalling user experience.Not worth the price."
Negative,Recent 'Morrowind' update looks like a joke comparing to the original TES3.It's not worth calling it 'chapter'. Just another overrated DLC that you will have to buy to keep your character viable.p.s. I've played A LOT more hours without steam since beta and I can say that this game is dying. Referring to nostalgic feelings of TES3 players is just another trick to keep subscribers.
Negative,"As can be seen, hours that went into the game are quite a lot for me. The same can be said about the money unfortunately,I really liked this game, gotta admit that the nostalgia of Elder scrolls was probably more then half of the reason, however the issues with the game are quite clear and not few in number:1. Long-term unfixed content/gameplay-breaking bugs2. Clearly unfinished/not properly tested content3. Lack(or near non-existence) of responses from the developers4. If you receive a response for your bug report, you will often be told it is not a bug and forced to play despite it's bovious continuous existence5. If you want to play long term while enjoying current Events, you need to get the DLC as soon after release as possible(which is not cheap).6. If you forgo the Events and decide to keep paying for ESO plus to play the second latest updates, it adds up to the worth of several full new games(again, not a cheap solution)7. The end game, as anyone who played this game for some time knows, is the cosmetics and collections, of which the upper quality part is available only with crowns(not-so-micro microtransactions)The fact, that you constantly pay for content, that is either unpolished or straight out bugged, and issues are being ignored in favor of adding more transactions, is the reason I would warn off any pottential players from time and money wasting as I did.If you still decide to play it, I wish you to have fun. But also have antidepressants ready for when bugs hit you and you remember the price:), see ya."
Negative,"In order not to be verbose, I'll just highlight the points that I think are important:- meta broken in pvp( plaguebreak, dark convergence, hrothgar's chill)- cyro lagging on server side ( big fights = big lags and this is default practice. Sometimes u can't use ur class abilities, sometimes server freezes all players)- pay to save ur time. (just look at the crown store)- black market (another time-saver. U can buy absoutely everything gold, payruns, emperor, godslayer, ebon dwarven wolf, etc)- reports doesn't work. (Get ready to see socrs that are streaking to safe area to avoid be killed to save they telvar stones. Our guild posted edited video where sorcs streaks away from be killed and posted it on forum -> this guys doesn't banned)- Casual players in high-end content. (U can't play dlc dung/trials without friends or guild-friends. U can't find good party to trials/dlc dungeons with eso group finder or chats, everytime u get low-skilled mates and this is normal practice.)- addons is a great way to create UI on our taste.- 2500 gems to get Ram of dark delights.- eso plus is a great way to avoid buying every dlc in the game. But u don't get last bit expansion (for now it's blackwood)- best community i have ever seen in my entire online game experiences.- u can buy everything in the game with a gold, including crown store.- not grindy except cp level. Craftable gear, buyable gear, ppl are friendly to give u items from last boss in dungeons- Story line, imperial city, dungeons for 4 ppl - okay for low grade pc. Cyro and trials - only for ppl with good pc.In conclusion, I want to say that I dunno trust this game. It always feels like the developers are trying to make as much money as possible. And keep old players as long as possible without worrying too much about new ones. Feel free to say what do you disagree with or to ask something"
Negative,sadly i have to say that i give up on this game in nine months of having purchaced this game i have rarely even been able to play it infinite load screens a crash after yet another huge update was almost the last straw but when the repair procces didnt work and the second attempt had zienamax trying to redownload the entire game agin from scratch to my computer  that was the last straw enuf is a enuf for the record it says ive played the game 41.7  hours that is a lie at least 60% of that time was infinite load screens or worse thanks for being the first ES game that i cant even play i know this isnt skyrim but atleast i can play that was so stoked to get this game was so stoked to  get somerset game looks amazing plays great when it works but updates keep breaking it and having to redownload it agin OMG dont waste your money the game works great when it wants to start but youl wear your hd out and waste hours if not days of your life when an update fubars your install imagine just wanting to play oh wait huge update oh wait fatal error oh wait redownload the entire game agin this is your life now the only way i would accept this bs is if at time of purchace zienamax would mail me 2 blueray disks to install the game from other wise its hopless
Negative,"I played the game all night, but when I got up the next morning, I found that the account had been permanently banned. because the game doesn't support Chinese. So I went to the Chinese translation plugin. Because of my poor network environment , I must use the accelerator to play normally(but this may make my IP become abnormal).It was not easy for me to get level 10 in one night, and I was ready to continue playing. but the next morning, I went online and found that my account had been permanently banned. I didn't do anything!I submitted my application,But for a week, my problem has not been solved.I hope it can be solved as soon as possible. I will buy this game when the ban is lifted"
Negative,"its ok, i dont like the quests but the music is very sexyTo the developer response: I am horrified at the thought of this game being like skyrim, pls no"
Negative,40% plz dlc
Negative,"I bought this product january. I played 1 - 2 hours in total. Today I tried to login to eso and it wont accept my password. it keeeps giving errors. After hundereds of pages I say yes and accept your terms bla bla. I changed password from their site. Guess what, it still gives error and I cant login and now they direct me to paid membership links. What the hell we paid money to steam If we cant play the game, its just pain and suffering to play and your account can become inactive or lead to additional membership fees etc..  You pay something that you cant play. thats what I hate."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.the steam install isn't the full install, you can't verify files via steam to fix the game's borked install.ad the game's launcher will freeze on you and simply refuse to work at all as it ""installs"" the game.game is totally nonfunctional broken ass mess"
Negative,Played this since launch via their Launcher instead of Steam. It's a mediocre mmorpg. Very empty and pretty boring to be honest. Doesn't really do anything special for the genre. Story is meh. It really just feels like they didn't know what to do with the IP and just wanted to jump on the mmo bandwagon.
Negative,Buying the collection makes it seem as you are paying for the full experience. When logging in you suddenly see that a lot of story chapters are locked behind a flat price or a monthly subscription. Outright scam behaviour for a 60 dollar price tag.
Negative,"I want to like it, but It's a so-so MMO with a layer of Elder Scrolls paint that should honestly be free to play with the way there's some button for microtransactions on every UI screen. It doesn't feel substantially different from any of the hundreds of cookie-cutter F2P MMOs that have come out in the last decade."
Negative,"What to say? Well i geuss it's a good MMO. Thats all of the positive stuff I can say about this. I'm upset that this is even considered Elder Scrolls. Bethesda simply slapped some Elder Scrolls stuff onto this. Also im angry about refunding. As in you cant get one if your on Steam. The long patch in the separate launcher? That's considerd part of your play time. So i have 2 more hours of playtime than I actually have, preventing me from getting my money back. Even if that wasnt the case the unecessary cd key thing prevents refunds as well.Final Thoughts: Want an good MMO? cool, here you go.Want an ""good"" Elder Scrolls game? ""Sure"" Heres something that looks like oneWant a refund? FUCK YOU ITS MY MONEY NOW!"
Negative,"ESO is a stupid game not worth playing, there are so many bugs and pvp is filled with hackers who can do an entire rotation in 0.5 seconds despite the global cooldown of 1 second on your abilities and 0.9 seconds for light attacks. the dev team do nothing to fix these issues unless the bugs or hacking is effecting the crown store (premium store).I would not recommend this game to anyone, everything is locked behind a pay wall even though you have to pay to be able to play the game."
Negative,"fun deep classes beautiful world outstripped by greed... Been a while decided to give go. Essentially they keep ""inventory management terrible. And charge absurd amounts just to increase bag space and encourage access to crafting bag aka you pay sub fee get double inventory so 15 bucks a month for bag space. All in all would recommend game if it wasn't for make it ""worse"" features to upset/charge you for fix."
Negative,"No Cross Save. So everything on PS can not be transferred to PC. I have so much on PS and I can't even transfer my Champion Points, nothing. Broken game with bugs as old as the game itself. Want more of a player base release the DLCs for free or no more than $20. When I purchase a collectors edition, it should include all current and future DLCs. The fact that this game is non refundable speaks for itself. That monthly sub even when cancelled still charged me over $100 on PSN and was never refunded. I don't recommend games with monthly subscriptions  due to my experience with Bethesda. Welcome to Cash Grab gaming. Its like Early Access games that never get finished but AAA style."
Negative,"Jumped back into the game after several years away. I was a Beta tester back in 2014 and thought it was an unfinished game that was trying to be another World of Warcraft clone using the Elder Scrolls lore. Basically it replaced the core of what made the Elder Scrolls series so special, a classless system, and replaced it with a flawed, fractured and incomplete WOW like leveling system. Not much has changed since 2014, though the graphics got better and the initial character customization is actually very good now. Beyond that it doesn't seem to do anything else particularly well. It tries to take elements from other games but fails to implement them in any coherent way, instead looking and feeling unfinished, unfocused and scatterbrained."
Negative,Purchase Purchase Purchase. Everything costs something now.
Negative,"Boring, clunky, slow. Might as well stick to the single-player Bethesda games. Why are there achievements within the game, but not on Steam? Maybe I'll try it again sometime."
Negative,They removed the ability to queue for battlegrounds with a group. I play this game with a small group of friends and we havn't touched it since they made that change.
Negative,really can't believe people keep playing this trash
Negative,"The best example of modern manipulative mmo extortion tactics, playing anything else has made me realise how much it has numbed me, to the practices this game pulls. do not waste your time on it, go play oblivion or bg3 or something instead"
Negative,"So easy, so boring. I did 20 levels and never died, the enemies are always weaker than you. I bought others DLC's hopping there is any difficulty, same story. Too easy...  Don't waste a tine trying to find any challenge - NOT in this game."
Negative,"Better don't buy this crap, before they change at least something.Just go play LOTRO - it's like ESO, but you can play full for free and your friends will actually have the same amount of content as u! >:DZOS removed crown-gift system. Hardly not p2w bullscit. Now you won't be able to progress further without paying them. Have fun with 10% of actual game !!! :D+Some of new endeavor(dailys) are not possible to complete without buying random dlc's and chapters.All changes done in 1 month, smells like some freaks from blizzard or even EA. Definitely GG!"
Negative,Shit. Just go play Skyrim
Negative,It's not skyrim :(
Negative,"Lame cashgrab, riddled with microtransactions. Dead community."
Negative,to much content... you cant find desire to play this game its not like skyrim...
Negative,"My wifi's decent, but damn.. 999+ ms on EU servers. Should've put Asian servers, Bethesda? The only way for me to play this cess pool of amazing content filled with unique quests is to play with a VPN. Just add Asian server.. please, Bethesda.."
Negative,"I'm sorry to say that even really wanting to like this game it has plummetted on my want to play list. Reasons? The short version is, unbalanced and lazy design. And unwholesome instability, up to the point of being unplayable at DLC launches.Building a character is complicated and largely ineffective, as the difficulty of the game is based on your level. That makes critters like mudcrabs insanely tough yet unsatisfying to crush at level 40. Leveling up before returning to a tough quest where you got stuck getting killed every single time by the end boss will help just a little bit. Fights tend to get harder due to lag even on recommended hardware, it looks like the mega server architecture is flawed. You need to read up on main quests beforehand to avoid getting stuck with ineffective selections - selections that you cannot change nor abandon and restart. This gives a truly dated feel. Limited character deletes and massive attention to in-game purchases all add to the impression that it is built as income generating (for the creator) time sink (for you).Redeeming features? Nostalgia about earlier Elder Scroll games. Some nice landscaping and extensive exploration. Moderately interesting quests. And, certainly not least, the community. Hardy players fighting against the elements, erm, software flaws. What I'm using it for, with my growing number of hours? Crafting, and farming materials, to unwind after a day's work. The music is nice.But it all gets old mighty fast if after that next patch all you seem to be able to do is die, lose money on gear repairs, and slower and slower leveling up, and a growing sense of deja vu because the next town is so much like the last.Only recommended for the truly dedicated MMO and/or Elder Scroll afficiados. But do know that it is NOT a Bethesda Softworks product and this becomes very noticable after a while."
Negative,"So I have tried every fix online to try and figure out why the hell it refuses to launch past the bethesda animation screen and I cant for the life of me figure out what the fucking problem is. The fact that a game can be out this long and actively releases updates that makes it HARDER for players to enjoy it is beyond me. Bethesda, you have really lost all of my faith, and I am never purchasing one of your products again. Thank you for wasting my time, my money, and causing me an insane amount of unnecessary stress all because I wanted to play your game. ESO is fun too, but what's not fun is spending hours upon hours simply trying to get my computer to be compatible with your latest update to no avail. In 2020 I logged several hundred hours on this game with no problem. returning in 2022 it's practically impossible for me to play because I cant even get it to fucking launch. My drivers are updated, my windows 10 is up to date, I don't have any services running that I didn't have running in 2020 when I initially played that would hinder the game from launching. I have wasted far too much time trying to play this god-forsaken game. So to anyone reading this, if you can download the game and launch it free of any hassle, I applaud you. But I recommend not even buying this game because the developers make it impossible to fix any sort of launch issue without scouring the internet for fixes, that don't even fucking work. Complete waste of time and money, I wish I never bought this game from this garbage fire of a game developer. You all seriously have completely lost your way. FUCK. BETHESDA. GAMES"
Negative,I bought this thinking it would be an mmo Skyrim but the lack of a SEA server means 300 ping and an unplayable mess. Highly disappointed and dissatisfied. Only two servers are available EU and NA and both are unplayable for people from most asian countries.
Negative,"About 30 hours in and I'm not having fun. I feel as if the combat is way too easy, and have trouble finding quests without being sent on a 30 minute walk, or paying for teleportation.. I will try and give the game a chance until endgame, but I feel as if It's not the game for me."
Negative,"Core gameplay is fun, if a little easy.  Decent variety of build options you can try.Everything about trading and crafting is extremely tedious and time-wasting.Trying to buy old expansions you may have missed due to not playing the game for a while is obtuse and expensive."
Negative,underwhelming and easy
Negative,Good game but constant issues through steam so buy it from the official website.
Negative,The game is alluringly easy. The trials are impossible. This game takes too much time.
Negative,skyrim fans deserve better.
Negative,"It, was good! Until I couldn't load the main screen any more."
Negative,"I loved this game, but it has gone down the path of paywalls and DLC to access new system and content, which is normal for these types of MMO developers. If you are a returning player, you will find yourself locked behind that wall and unable to do much due to that.Rest in peace, it was fun."
Negative,"This game is Fun yes.. But make sure when you do your 1 month  ESO plus Subscription that you make sure to cancel it before the end of the month if you only want it for a month otherwise it will hit you for one more month and so on till you cancel it yourself... instructions to cancel your subscription.... had to google it... because there is not unsubscribe button :'( ...Log into Steam and click on Account Details. Look for the link Manage Subscriptions on the right side of the page and click it. Click the Edit link on the right next to ""The Elder Scrolls Online: Plus Membership"". Select the button next to ""Cancel my subscription"" and click ""Apply""Hope this helpsI just lost 3 days food money to this :'("
Negative,"The game fails to update and constantly patches the wrong files. This is complete garbage. I am a long-time Elder Scrolls gamer, and this game is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever seen. Pros: Got it cheap during a sale (since it sucks it is now cheap)Cons: S*** install, S*** support, S*** $$$$Let me get this straight? You pay for the game, then you get nothing in return? No thanks, I'm out. I'm getting my money back, and I'm out. Peace."
Negative,"The game's ok until you finish the base game and realise its cheaper to buy the game again and start from scratch if you want to play any of the DLC, even then you'll have to do the same as soon as the next DLC comes out. It's a ripoff business model that punishes its fan base and it stinks of corporate greed - like some sort of drug dealer they want to get you ""hooked"" on their product and make you keep paying a fortune to play."
Negative,"Don't purchase this game through steam, after downloading 66 gb over mulitple days and then launching, the installer opened and began downloading an additional 66 gb without the option to just use the frickin files I just downloaded, so basically u have to download the humungus game twice so yea fck that."
Negative,"Bugs galore. Every 2-4 weeks, there is a critical bug that makes playing this game impossible. Shame on the game."
Negative,"Could not really get into it, just doesn't feel like the other Elder Scrolls games"
Negative,"Pay to play, and poor gameplay.But i guess that's what you should expect when playing MMOs."
Negative,"very very hard to log in the game, waste money !!"
Negative,There is very little continuity between ES-V and ESO. The archer aspect is a sad sad shadow of the skill required in ES-V.
Negative,"It's got the makings of a good game - not a great one. The quest design leaves to be desired, often making you feel completely lost if you're trying to do everything in order. The combat system is a little weird as well, a little hard to get used to. It tries to simulate the feeling of previous TES games, but I feel it falls short. Worth buying and playing if you get a good discount on it, but I wouldn't look at it as an MMO to invest a lot of time into."
Negative,"I am so very sorry about this game... I wanted to like it so bad, I've been a fan fo TES series since 2003 when I found out about Morrowind but ESO... I don't feel anything, it desn't makes me feel anything at all. It is a beautiful world but it feels like ""just a game"". I can't feel engaged with the stories, everything is rushed, the dialogues are intended to feel epic but when everything is epic, nothing really is. More over when you see 3 other guys doing the exact thing as you and being called ""The Hero"". I couldn't take my mind off of it being just scripted dialogues, so I just disconnected from the stories, the interaction with the characters is so weak. I mean, Almalexia, Sotha Sil and Vivec, literal GODS that canonically had defeated daedric princes ask for the help of a freaking lvl 10 character with no noteworthy abilities or gear, it is so underwhelming... I know they're quest givers to give the player something cool to do but it ends up not being cool, it's just bloating the experience. The combat: Grinding. The Crafting System: Grinding. The Abilities Progression: Grinding. I know you have to grind in all RPGs, but this is just not fun, is not interesting, is not engaging, feels devoided of life.  Maybe I'm wrong, maybe all MMORPGs are like this and I'm the one who doesn't gets it but still, I regret very much having such an amazing world trading its heart for the corporate need of keeping players grinding."
Negative,"I like this game, i played at least 1.000 hours while paying the membership fee, but, without it, the more i played it, more unplayable it became, because if you are not paying the membership fee, you will not have inventory spaceAnd the membership fee where i live would be equivalent to $60 when comparing minimum wages, and equivalent to at least $90 (or more) if comparing buying powerIf a player where i live save money by not paying ESO membership fee for a year, he will have enough money to buy 4 or 5 top new released games such as elden ring..."
Negative,Unless you pay for the 'ESO plus' Monthly subscription fee you will be punished by having reduced experience gain and the overall game experience will be diminished with grind. Conditionally free to play. Monthly subscription to actually enjoy the game and not be punished with an intentionally implemented grind curve
Negative,"This game is fun, educational, and can rake in money on it's  basic merits. But does everything in the cash shop have to feel THIS hostile?Don't even get me started on the crate drop rate changes... Crown Crates are gift wrapped insults now"
Negative,"quite a few several garbage quests that glitched / broken prevent progression and or kill you for no reason, broken trash game."
Negative,Update 35 - that is all.
Negative,I hate this game
Negative,I own the game and for some reason it is telling me to purchase it again and its not even in my library i have uninstalled the game and now its completely gone please help
Negative,why i cant play todayyyyy
Negative,the option to play the game has been replaced with a purchace option rendering the game unplayable
Negative,Steam has the worst support of any software I have ever used.
Negative,Purchased ESO about 2 weeks ago and played daily. Log on today and my desktop app forwards me to the store page where I am told to repurchase it....... huh?
Negative,"I bought the game in april of 2020. now, in august of 2020, it's saying i don't own the game, and have to repurchase it. I already have 198 hours played and own an ESO Plus membership. I have no idea why the game is missing from my account.Not recommended.EDIT: Steam fixed the issue of it not showing as owned by me. HOWEVER...I still don't recommend this game. I only play it because my friends play it. I have only had very poor experiences in dealing with Zenimax support. When I played on Xbox, they GAVE MY GUILD TO SOMEONE ELSE, who I had previously removed from the guild for being an awful person to basically everyone. they got invited back by another guild member when I was on vacation, and Zenimax just gave them the guild when they asked for it. I contacted support, and they refused to do anything about it. I even showed proof that they were being super anti semitic and that I was the rightful owner of the guild, and they still did nothing. In short: If you want to play a game where the company who runs it doesn't give a single fuck about you, and only cares how much money you can shit into their mouth (they have microtransactions that cost upwards of $150 in premium currency and like 8 basically required ""DLCs"" that cost more than $20 each), go ahead and buy this shit-tier game. It isn't even a real MMORPG. It's an MMO-Lite."
Negative,"They not gonna fix the game, just destroy the mods that actually fixing the game.Anyone who play this game is a masochist."
Negative,"Login issues, customer/dev support is non-existant for Steam users..."
Negative,"I loved oblivion and skyrim to bits, but this just doesn't click with me. The combat feels akward and quests are quick and trivial, and exploration/ambience is not really engaging."
Negative,7 hours of my life was wasted in this. I feel like the only thing I remember is the bad controls and ungodly awful combat.
Negative,"I've owned the game for 2 years and today when steam rebooted servers, It wouldn't let me play and would open the store page for instead. I've even tried sending a support ticket on ESO's website but in order to send a ticket I needed a config file from the launcher which I couldn't get access to. I don't normally leave bad reviews over technical issues but when there isn't any other option in this case I have no choice. I still enjoy this game and would just like to play it again."
Negative,"It was ok. Expensive for what it is. Being open world and having so many places to explore is wonderful, but it's just too big and repetitive with little reward or drive. I wanted to love it, but it was just ok. Great art, great voice acting and the stories are fun, but it loses its appeal quickly. If you love the Elder Scrolls series and want to enjoy the early lore, it does an amazing job of that. It's fun, just becomes boring and repetitive quickly. GIVE PEOPLE INVENTORY SPACE. That is the biggest aggravation, even with the membership. I felt myself not wanting to play after a month, thinking it was going to have more content, but I think all MMOs are boring and archetypal at some point and it loses replay value quickly. This one, as an MMO, doesn't do anything new or interesting, so I lost interest. Maybe allow more challenges, mini-games, seasonal events and customization that'll keep people playing. I will say the one thing they got right was allowing you to play the game with no repetitive membership. Once you buy it, you can play it non-stop. Good luck doing ANY major crafting without the membership though, because your inventory is EXTREMELY limited. Overall, disappointed and underwhelmed. Maybe create more clear direction of choice and allow people to play offline if they don't care for the social aspect? That way it could be an optional MMO, OR a standalone game which gives players options. Also, idk if that's ever been done before. This could be the first MMO or standalone choice game."
Negative,"2020 Edit: Even though I liked playing this game back then I won't review positively games with a subscription method that give advantages over other players, I know this is not on a competitive side but having an unlimited crafting bag should be free for everyone, plus all the old DLC are overpriced and should be bundled at a discounted price. TL;DR: Fun game overall, timesink game with a lot of replayability.Features & Pros:+ PVE: Vast World with big cities full of quests, mini dungeons called Delves, World Bosses to defeat with a party or solo if strong enough, Dolmens which bring waves of daedra mobs and a little boss, public dungeons which are harder than delves, many achievements in-game to hunt for, such as Skyshards (3 give you 1 skillpoint to invest), or visiting all areas of interest, a lot of lore if you care for it. There's also Dungeon Queues, which consist of 2 damage dealers, tank and a healer, normal and veteran difficulty, each one providing different mechanics on how to beat which makes it fun and unique. Dungeon Trials, which consists of 12 player group, usually 8 DD, 1 tank, 1 offtank and 2 healers.+ PVP: Battlegrounds which consist of 4 players per each of the 3 alliances fighting each other in Team Deathmatch, Crazyking, Chaosball, Domination and Capture the Relic. Alliance war PVP zone, with some PVE quests as well where you have to strategically defend or capture enemy keeps using rams, catapults and so on, in order to gain alliance points.+ Constant updates with new DLC zones accessible with VIP or bought with crowns for permanent access; new expansions bought with real money.+ Crafting system of weapons, armor and jewelry. Alchemy,Enchanting and Provisioning (food).+ Thieves + Dark brotherhood DLC's adding unique gameplay on fun assassination and theft quests.+ Vast Character Customization, with 10 different races + 5 different classes of skills to choose from.+ Mounts, Non-Combat Pets, Emotes, Guilds, Housing, Daily Quests and rewards for logging in, Events and many more.+ 50 character levels + 810 Combat Points Level, bringing it to a cap of level 810 (plus the initial 50) and going up constantly.+ You can install addons (mods) to change stuff in-game.+ Become a werewolf or a vampire.+ Vast equipment to choose from where you can change how they look. (Two handed, Dual wield, Bow, One hand and shield, Destruction and Restoration Staff. Light, Medium and Heavy armors.)+ In-game NPC Guild or factions that you can belong to which grant unique skills and quests, such as Mages Guild, Fighters Guild, Thieves Guild, Psijic Order, Dark Brotherhood and Undaunted.+ A lot of fun with friends.+ You can now have a 12 month subscription plan.+ If you cancel your subscription you'll lose access to all benefits and DLC areas but not skills or items acquired while you had access, and the items on the crafting bag will remain there, new picked ones after losing VIP will not go to the crafting bag anymore though, unless you re-acquire VIP again.Cons: - If you don't get ""Adventurer Pack"" (in-game crown store item,roughly 1000 crowns if I'm correct) you can't choose any race in any alliance. (Meaning there's 3 to 4 races for each of the 3 alliances, if you would like to play 1 of the 3 races on Alliance 1 and your friend picked a race from Alliance 3, in Alliance war you can't group up together, this is bad because race have different racial passives which can influence in making a better damage dealer, tank or healer from those stats, so let's say you choose to be a damage dealer you''ll most likely as I did will pick Aldmeri Dominion which has 3 classes that are very good for DD. And then if you bring your friends into the game they all have to pick one of those 3 races to be able to join together in Alliance war.)- Dungeon queues take too long if you are a DD. (And if it wasn't from the issue above I believe it would take less, all my friends that I brought into the game had to go for DD to be on the same alliance than I was.)- There's no queue for Trials, you have to look for group in chat in the area of the trial or join a Guild which makes it easier.- Crowns are expensive, even if most items are only cosmetic or housing. These days, even crown sales are not as good as they were, less than 50% most of the time, which doesn't make them worth buying, it's even easier to get VIP as it brings almost the same amount of crowns, more benefits, exclusive deals and free on crown store items.- Materials take quite some space on your inventory making it hard on the beginning to handle stash space, almost a most having VIP for a crafting bag which store's infinite materials in it, if you're going to take crafting serious.- Werewolves are somehow a little broke on the early levels of the game in PVP battlegrounds.Final verdict:Having 400 hours on my main character and I still have to complete a lot of quests and zones, haven't even got much into Trials or Cyrodiil yet. If you have a lot of free time you can buy this, it can be played casually as well but if you're a completionist this game will take a lot of your time, making it hard to move on from it to another game.  As all games, it's better to buy it when on a sale. If you're trying it out, on sale right now it's only 9,99 euros and you can refund it if less played than 2 hour or acquire the latest expansion if you liked it, for another 11,09 euros.If you want to play without VIP, the ESO collection at 39,99 euros is a good choice, as it brings the 4 base DLC's, imo some of the best DLC's and both Morrowind and Summerset expansions.If you really like it and you're sure that you will play it a lot, and somehow find VIP useful as I did, to get crafting bag and free access to all DLC zones you can just get both ESO standard edition + the Summerset expansion for 21,08 euros, plus a subscription month plan to your liking."
Negative,"The installer crashes.  It crashes on downloading the patches.  It crashes when you try to repair the files.  It crashes when you apply the fixes recommended by Support.  Thankfully, it does not crash when you uninstall it."
Negative,"You grind to reach level 50 and have limited zone play and content unless you purchase the DLCs or pay monthly. After reaching level 50 you then grind to reach a 810 Champion point system. If you are not ready to be a dedicated player stay away from this title, it's not for the casual mmo players."
Negative,"Amazing game. The steam version? not so much. Every new update steam has, breaks the game launcher and forces you to redownload the ENTIRE game due to a patch manifest error, whose troubleshooting method ALSO changes with every steam update...TL:DR I recommend playing the game, however DO NOT buy the steam version, it's literally unplayable if you get the patch manifest error, trying to fix it is a waste of hundreds of gigs of data, buy it from the official site, here: https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/joinus?gclid=Cj0KCQjwz8bsBRC6ARIsAEyNnvrU4PenkTWo1YB3IFT1QjDeRk0yEn0AigXUwRBbt_ZGYqn2Lq20uLEaAncIEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds  (you can also just search elder scrolls online to find the official site if you aren't comfortable with following my link :) )"
Negative,"I first started playing casually over 5 years ago and took a break but recently got back into ESO. I joined some friends who were new and tried to gift them things using the Crowns in my inventory but now gifting is locked. I opened a ticket then was told to open a separate ticket to confirm my account identity and to request to enable gifting again, which would take between 7-10 days. 3 days later I was told my account is not eligible because there isn't ""consistent"" enough activity. Below is the message I received:""Greetings,We regret to inform you that we are unable to fulfill your request to activate Gifting on your account.Your account must show consistent game play activity and/or be active in an in-game ESO community prior to submitting your application to be considered for eligibility to participate in the ESO gifting program.If you wish to appeal this decision or if there is anything else that we can assist you with please let us know by replying back to this ticket.If you would like to provide feedback regarding the Gifting in The Elder Scrolls Online you can do so here: Feedback and Suggestions about ESORegards,The Elder Scrolls Online Team""This game is very casual and relaxed but I cannot recommend this game while these restrictive policies are in  place."
Negative,"My main concern as a new player so far:-The game is not well optimized.-It cost alot of money (main game, expansions, eso+, crown store, lootboxes) most expensive game I've ever played and I have played all the big mmos/arpgs out there.-It is kind of clunky atleast from a wow players perspective.-Auction house is is not centralized. Meaning you will have to travel all over the map to find the items you want. Which makes the entire process tedious and frustrating.-The classes atleast in the beginning feel kind of boring. There are not alot of skills to choose between. And there are very few classes in the game. This might change at endgame.The pros:-If you love the elder scrolls series you will love this game.-Intresting quests and lore.-Beautiful zones.-Alot of things to explore and collect.-Strong sense of progression.-Nice community (atleast so far)-PvP looks promising."
Negative,Honestly a mess the few months playing this have been the easiest mmo I have played in a while. Get ready to pay 15 a month for a pass or else lose access to important things like craft bags and dlc content that is way over priced. The only thing good to say about the game is the solo questing. So its basically an mmo where you don't have to ever communicate with anyone which is the opposite of the points of mmos.  This game is a huge time sink of easy mode content with a few elitist here and there even though the game has a leveling system that requires you to have 1000+ levels to evenly compete with them. Zenimax try's to drain every penny they can out of the player before they quit. My advice go play Final Fantasy XV possibly if looking for an mmo maybe even World of Warcraft or many other mmo choices. If you want the easy mode experience with little interaction with others and a huge collection of pointless drops overshadowed by the cash shop then this is the game you have been looking for.
Negative,"except for its combat and gameplay, it is a good game."
Negative,"As an Elder Scrolls game, it's pretty good. As an MMO, not so much: combat is very stale, poor and repetitive animations, console-like feeling, you can only have up to 5 usable skills at once on screen and 10 total. It's shallow despite the supposedly action oriented touches with active dodging and stamina, and of course there is a well established meta which means that some skills are simply much better than some others and you have to use them if you want to be competitive. Weapons variety is mediocre and even when they look different, they feel all the same. Classes and their skillsets are nothing revolutionary either. The story lines are fairly good and plausible for the Elder Scolls world, the writing is mostly good and questlines are predictable but enjoyable nonetheless, and the world looks and feels great, but the game design as a whole is extremely dispersive. You are constantly compelled to go everywhere at the same time for all sorts of different reasons: you go somewhere to follow up on a quest and get dragged into several other questlines along the way, you have to stop at 10 to 20 different static spots on every map to collect ""skyshards"", which grant you skill points so they are quite important to get, and it quickly becomes a paranoia inducing chore to fulfill, and so on. You have four, soon to be five guilds, with their different priorities regarding your playstyle, and you want to do all of them so as to not miss out on important skills they offer. There is simply too much to do, all at the same time, it's overwhelming and dispersive like no other game I've ever played. Specialising in a handful of skill trees will penalize you here. A special mention goes to crafting and game economy: crafting is a weird mixture of ""everyone can craft everything"" but also ""it's gonna take you several months to unlock just half of the possible trait and enchantment combination for half of the craftable gear, and they likely won't be the ones you wish for"". It's all made a hundred times worse than it needs to be by the absurd, obtuse decision to not have auction houses in the game but rather mafia like, guild owned, dispersive and chaotic ""guild shops"". To this day I can't understand what where they thinking when they made this choice. Of course, auction houses have their flaws, but this alternative system mantains and actually magnifies all of those flaws, while not having any advantage. This is not a Sandbox MMO and this implementation deeply hurts  small guilds, lone players and people dedicated to crafting. I also want to point out how this MMO is the pinnacle of monetized player engagement. Never before there have been so many different options to spend money on a game. You pay to play the game; you pay to access DLCs of several different sizes; you pay to have an ""optional"" subscription"" that also allows you to access DLCs while it's active AND boosts your charachter in several different, very useful ways. As if that wasn't enough, you can buy in game currency, which then you can spend on costumes, costumes slots, lootboxes, special lootboxes, pets, mounts, and so on. There's even a paywalled race, and paywalled item kits. Play this only if you're an Elder Scrolls fan who wants to explore the world, and go through the questlines. As much as they try to deny it, most of the time playing the game just feels like Skyrim II - sometimes with friends edition. If you're looking for an MMO experience, there are less dispersive, less obtuse, less greedy options out there. It's a great shame that the playerbase is willing to tolerate so many poor design choices for an MMO just because of the game's setting and lore. This game could be so much better, but a complacent user base willing to be milked and treated to a subpar MMO experience allows it to coast on its mediocrity."
Negative,FIX THE CLIENT
Negative,"So I have been playing for a few days, and when I say play, I really mean a few min gaps of game play between DC's.I have had no issues in any other MMO or online game."
Negative,"Constantly game shutdown due to the failure of cooperation between Steam and Bethesda (may or may not involve Zenimax)I encounter 2-3 times of game error in 12 hours of playing.The game is good, the developers are sucks, further sucks that they weren't able to fix the bugs.Either they don't have the ability, or they don't have the intention to do so."
Negative,"Normally I have a lot of words. I like talking about games.ESO is:Monetisation to infinity and beyond;A total waste of money;A total waste of space on your SSD;A betrayal to Elder Scrolls (beloved Arena, Daggerfall, Oblivion, Skyrim etc.);A well designed marketing scam;Inexplicable to your average gamer.I spent a lot of money. I don't even know what I have. Until I study for a Masters in this type of ""game"" and figure what was going on - Don't Buy This Nonsense./rantover"
Negative,"servers too far away, always over 300, I'm in Perth Western Australia .. waste of time"
Negative,"INCOMPLETE game.  Missing launcher file and additional files to actually run the game.  All issues including this occured after the Feb 6, 2017 - Homestead patch."
Negative,Why would you put every dungeon behind a paywall? you fucking greedy cunts
Negative,"So boring, it is so easy and casual. No cooldowns on anything. Just spam skills and kill everything while they can't even damage you."
Negative,zos is just milking this game instead of fixing it
Negative,"UNTIL YOU FIX YOUR GODDAMN SERVER!!! I WONT CHANGE MY REVIEW!!!I love this game and 3 days after i upgraded it to gold edition, it keeps disconnected and sent me to the login menuI BARELY PLAYED IT AROUND 2 MINUTES FFS!!! fix your server then i change my review"
Negative,"DO NOT PLAY THIS GAMEI want to start by saying that I am an experienced MMO player having dumped over 3k hours into wow and 3k into Final Fantasy 14. I am a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls series, having put a lot of time into Oblivion across the platforms, having beaten Morrowind a few times and having countless hours in Skyrim. I can say safely that Elder Scrolls Online is both a failure of an MMO and a faliure as an Elder Scrolls game. ESO is very good at one thing however, taking your money. ESO is the most greedy western MMO I've ever played. Let's tackle the elements of it's greed in sections for simplicity.ESO Plus:ESO has a reputation among the MMO community as being a good deal for your money and taking a passing glance at the fact you get a handful of crowns with your ESO plus subscription, access to it's DLC and unlimited storage for your crafting materials will seem like a steal, after-all it's merely optional right? Wrong. This is NOT OPTIONAL if you are a new player and are planning to stick around for a long time, this is mandatory. Why? Because the content in the game isn't just split up into it's big expansions, it's split up into ""chapters"" meaning that even if you were to pay for each DLC as it comes out you won't be buying all the content that year long DLC has because you have to buy the chapters that contain all the dungeons as well. The craft bag (infinite storage for your crafting materials) seems like a kind inclusion at first until you stop to think that this is how the game should be by default, they've merely taken it out to make the free-to-play method as tedious as possible to drag you back into ESO plus, without it you'll be spending an agonising amount of hours sorting your inventory to the point it's just not worth it, meaning that if you were to go through years of spending your monthly allowance of ESO Plus crowns buying up the DLC you'd still be playing a worse version of the game for all the money you'd wasted. Store Pricing & Pay to Win:In New Zealand 1500 Crowns will set you back around 23NZD and with that money you could buy yourself another slot in the Armoury, a feature they added to allow you to swap between load-outs on your characters. By Default your character is allotted 2 slots, which is a meagre amount if you're someone that needs to swap sets and skill points around. Perhaps you have multiple tanking sets for different content also need a build for PVP and maybe a build for going solo in the open world, well that's going to be 23NZD every single slot you buy AND that's only unlocked FOR ONE CHARACTER. If you care about fashion, outfit slots are also something you'll start off with nearly no slots for (1 by default) and unlocking them is character based, meaning to unlock all the slots on the default character cap you might be looking at nearly 1000 dollars on that alone. You just can't shake this feeling when playing the game that you're at a disadvantage to the whales that just dump all their money to speed the process up. If you want to upgrade your horse well you'll be waiting 6 months, making sure to log in every single day, before that's capped out (ON ONE CHARACTER) oh but lucky for you, you could just spend crowns in the cash shop to speed that process up. Want to work around the limited slots in the armory on your alt by just having an overwhelming amount of skill points, well you could spend hours grinding away at quests and skyshards or you could just use the crown store to buy up all the ones you bought on your main! Want to catch up in CP levels so that your dps is at the same levels of your peers but want to speed that process up? That's easy the cash shop has you covered with XP scrolls! There's more examples here like mimic stones and skill line skips and it all feels designed to bait you into spending money, a lot of it is a complete noob trap too like when you find out that vampire bites can be done in the open world when they're advertised as a shop item. Gambling and Cosmetics:Fashion is the end-game of MMOs and boy do ZOS know this. The game not only has paid DLC, a subscription model but it also has the absolute brazen audacity to offer fucking loot boxes as well. I have heard so many horror stories of people rolling on a bucket load of crates only to be spat out with endless amounts of worthless items like poisons and potions. It's amazing that you can pay for morrowind, which has the Warden class all over it's advertising and then come to find out that you still have the buy the class separately, find out to customise the bear you get with the class you have to fork out cash for that and then open the shop to look at it and be faced with adds for crown crates. The game's early armor sets look terrible so when you start your grind for motifs of the new gear and come to find that a lot of it is time-gated behind unseen daily reward lockouts or timed event exclusives it adds further insult to injury when you find out that you can often GAMBLE for entire motif sets in the monthly crown crates or pay 5000crowns (100NZD) for some. Let's not forget that even on a basic level of cosmetics, changing your hair, adornments, body markings are all things you need to pay real money to unlock access to. And if you dare want to change you hair color, that'll be 1000 crowns for an appearance change token thanks! The moment I realized a god damn name change was 2500 crowns I broke down laughing. Conclusion / TLDR:Earning not only cosmetics but also the gold or experience to crack into the end-game is often a time consuming miserable chore that feels designed from the ground up to force you back into spending more money. The greed of the developers seeps into every nook and cranny of the game and often you get this impression that you're walking around in bad fan-fiction tier theme parks of the old games. Sometimes in rare moments the end-game content lines up to provide you with a thrill. Sometimes the quests reach almost above average quality and are not viscerally cringe re-contextualisations of lore from old games. But that's often let down by how much it really feels like it's not an artistic vision, but rather an excuse to milk you for as much cash as it possibly can. I spent 100s of hours powering up my new character I'd been playing with my boyfriend on only to realise hours later due to how disjointed the new starting zone process is that I'd picked a different alliance to him which might cause issues for us in PVP and then I found out it's a whopping 3500 crowns to change that. There are moments when you forget the game's flaws and just enjoy being able to play an Elder Scrolls game with your friends or loved ones but the mobile game levels of greed feel like this perpetual vice grip lingering over you that eventually tightens and crushes the life out of those moments. ESO is garbage, do not pay money for this."
Negative,"They could have done so much better with this.This game seems to have everything on the surface - A new world to explore, new missions, new creatures, new equipment, new spells, new lore, and all with regular updates.But they fell short.This isn't a true Elder Scrolls game.This is a standard MMO dressed like Skyrim.It's a watered-down experience of a fond memory, and what's worse, it's keen to sell you a plethora of lootboxes and microtransactions.You're never more than a few clicks away from buying one. Literally. That's not an exaggeration.Don't get me wrong, the base game is well worth the price for what it is, if you're a casual fan of the Elder Scrolls franchise and want an MMORPG to invest countless hours into.This does the job, and it actually does it better than many others I've played, with added nostalgia.But to call it an Elder Scrolls game is, frankly, like putting lipstick on a pig.All things considered, I simply can't bring myself to recommend it.Also, I'm not familiar with the prices of ""Premium"" items in other MMOs compared to ESO's, but the cost of ""Crowns"" compared to what you can actually exchange them for is eye-watering.How anyone else spends their money is obviously none of my business, but personally, even if I was a millionaire, I'd book myself in for counselling long before I'd spend $30 on a sparkly deer cosmetic mount in an online video game.***Just as a note for anyone interested:A small team of individuals have spent the last few years creating a free online multiplayer mod for Skyrim called ""Skyrim Together"".It's been released and is playable, but isn't yet entirely stable, and is an ongoing development.Depending on how good the mod ends up, and how well it integrates with other mods, it could potentially render this game largely obsolete.Please bare that in mind before buying."
Negative,I really want to like this game but after getting 3 characters to level 25 this game just feels like a point and click adventure. Mobs and even bosses are a joke and these stories talk up these bad guys like they can destroy whole islands and then you fight them and you are never in any danger of dying. It just takes away from the experience and leaves me feeling unsatisfied.
Negative,"Had some good times.I would consider continuing to play the game and even spend money on DLC and crown store bling.However, its pointless investing more time into it if i have to pay a subscription fee just to login and appreciate  my hard work."
Negative,Couldn't even log in because the launcher was so bad. No other Steam game gave me so much trouble just to play. Requested refund.
Negative,would rather buy WinRar
Negative,"It's not a horrible game... but I disliked 2 things. 1. The inventory. It was extremely restrictive. To the point that I had to destroy a bunch of items every few minutes... multiple times a trip. I had to deal with it constantly, even after getting an inventory upgrade. Not cool. 2. I tried several builds and none of them seemed to synergize well. Nor did any of them seem to work any better even if I put some time and thought into what should work. Sure... I was only able to play less than a week. Still. The synergies were just poor. No matter what I did it never seemed to work together that well. In fact, in the end I came to the conclusion that I did more damage and had more flexibility if I simply did not use most of my skills, just one or two and spammed a staff fast attack while kiting a bit. My skills actually seemed to make my fighting less damaging and more static and thus dangerous to me. Not great when you feel you are better off fighting without all those new shiny skills.Sure. I probably did it all wrong. But that's the point. If it's not intuitive, does not seem to synergize, and makes you feel like you are better off not using all your fancy new skills, that's not great.Not a horrible game... but, quite simply... if it were free, which it's not, I don't think I'd bother. There are better things."
Negative,"Great Series,Good Game.Trash Dev group refuse to buy a real server ."
Negative,didnt get to play it one secondcorrupted file nice game
Negative,this game is literally everything i hoped it wasn't
Negative,Dont buy here on steam. Its shitty on steam. Login problems everyday via steam.
Negative,"Uhg an 86GB payload, and then I make an account and get signed in, and I'm about to playyyy ohh no I'm not. Instead I'm going to download.... an 86GB 'patch'. This made me angry enough to make a negative review - for NOW. When I finally get to play this later tonight, I'll fix this if I'm motivated. An 86GB image size, and then an 86GB patch? Fu$# off."
Negative,"I mean like, its a pretty good MMORPG, but its just pretty boring at times. This game is an Elder Scrolls Game, it have all the lore and stuffs, but its missing the heart and soul that make the Elder Scrolls Game amazing. And that is, because this game is an MMO, it has some limitations on the storyline, and it lacks immersion."
Negative,"First lets look at my old review:Limited character customizations, this is extremely important for me in a MMORPG, ofcourse you can buy more styles with MONEYunlock crafting bag with MONEYAny skill reset or other reset MONEYdo you want to level fast and enjoy pvp? MONEY please want your mounts to go faster for longer? MONEYmy point is you need ESO plus membership to enjoy the game , after paying for the base game and the expansions and it really isnt cheap This makes me really sad and i dont feel like playing eso anymore there is just no point i will miss out on everything unless I paySo this was my original review and critique, after returning to the game 1 year later, it seemed simple all i had to do was pay moreand that i didMorrowind expansion, bought 4 DLC packs,  and ESO plus for one monthNow played ESO for a Day or so and found that i had on average 2-5 SECONDS DELAY WHEN PERFORMING AN ACTION!!!so i searched the internet, yeah turns out they know , everyone knows, everyone lags , nothing new Bethesda & couldnt care lass aslong as people like me keep paying for this game,Needles to say i cant make progress in the game with this delay, died countless times, unable to block , cant loot containers or chest in public areas (other players will arrive after me and still get to loot beforehand) and this shit just doesnt end there, if i do try to play i get constant dissconnections witch makes it feel like Loading Screen simulator"
Negative,A game for rich people
Negative,One and main problem - weaving (ugly outdated mechanic)
Negative,this game is actual garbage
Negative,"Imagine paying for the game just to find out its P2W, f*ck bethesda and every single online game they can release. Seriously, don't buy TESO or F76 becouse both those games are just P2W since release date."
Negative,"bog-standard mmo with a TES coat of paint, and it's the awful post-Morrowind version of TES. Who cares?"
Negative,"My total time played so far is just from trying to get the game to launch.  Steam works fine, it's ESO I'm having trouble with."
Negative,"I would love to recommend the game- however after only six hours of playing the game I felt my character was way to overpowered and I just killed everything instantly, even the dungeons which are meant to be harder were a breeze. There's no challenge at all in this game, and nothing is ever fun when there is no challenge..."
Negative,"There's a lot to like about Elder Scrolls Online. Dungeons are good, Leveling System is okay. But Holy Crap! I can not get over the crafting system, researching taking a month...A MONTH! It should at least take a week at most!  And for that reason, I stopped playing because this game relies on shitty timers."
Negative,"After 1000+ hours played, I don't recommend this game. It isn't the game it once was..."
Negative,this is just a cash grab
Negative,Don't buy this game from steam you are just gonna get timed out every time you try to log in so yea fuck this platform
Negative,It's nice and all but it doesn't fit an adult player. It's simply way too easy and after six hours I didn't meet a single challenging task - everything can seemingly be taken down with beginner gear and the same lame rotation. This takes away my lust for empowering myself and I found myself just running through hoards on enemies speedrunning missions. I'd love to love it but this is not for me. Back to modded Skyrim for now.
Negative,"I've played many MMO's, including a few Korean ones.After a month of ESO Plus and getting a character to 260 Champion level, I will not be revisiting. The monetisation and crown store makes this game one of the least accessible MMO's I've ever played."
Negative,"Really enjoyed the gameplay and story. The problem is that the game keeps breaking itself, i played for a week and launcher suddenly stopped launching the game, i tried repairing, nothing. I looked up the fix, tried fixing it and i couldn't run the launcher anymore. I looked up new fix. Made all needed exes to be run as administrator, restarted computer and played for 2 days. Next day i tried to launch the game and it did but was not connected to steam. I tried to run repair, nothing again. The next days i was suudenly able to play but the same evening it was broken again. This game is literally breaking itself. big no for me"
Negative,Elder Scrolls should focus more on the standalone releases.They make a damn good single player RPG .But in my oppinion they way they handled the online version is poorly the moment they launched a dlc costing more than the game should tell u alot about it.The only good think about the game was when all the factions fought for control but Amazon's New world will be dooing a better job at that and with better graphics and combat.
Negative,"I wanted to play this recently but I forgot this just sucks. The combat is blocking, spam light attacks, hold light attacks, press 1234, and boom dead no passion in the fighting. magic to what I know is just staff wepons .it is just a nice-looking game with a bad company working. it just full of microtransactions"
Negative,"i guess its a good option for an MMO without monthly fee? but everything from the story, the combat, the pvp....everything  is just soooooo.........mehEDIT: Well i  just tried the endgame and is the most boring shit ever, most of it is as easy as spamming aoes until you reach boss. Am not kidding, the fastest strategy in most endgame content (veteran dungeons and trials, vet trials do need strategy) to stand togheter and spam skills completly ignoring weapon swaps for 10 skills rotation and just go for 5. I´ll give the devs the benefit of the doubt and assume its because of the post level cap progression system (champion points) that lets you increase some secondary stats and add other benefits (crit chance, damage over time, reduce skill cost, etc) instead of bad design.I asked on global chat and was told to do specific trials to see the ""true"" endgame experience. If only a couple of trials are ""true"" endgame then what is the rest? Boring waste of time? My opinion about the game didnt change after this, If you DONT want to play an mmo with monthly fees and dont mind an average singleplayer TES experience, then this game IS TOTALLY FOR YOU. You dont have to interact with anyone at all from level 1 to 50 and then CP, you dont even have to do dungeons since they are not mandatory for main story progression and after you reach lvl 50 and have high cp you can solo dungeons no problem. If you want a proper ""mmo experience"" and dont mind monthly fees i´ll say it again, just get wow, even if its just for wow classic or ff14......and i didn´t even mention the shit ton of story content dlc (stuff like the thieves guild and dark brotherhood that have their own skill line and daily quest to unlock, that are not included with any expansion) behind expensive premium currency (the mobile game type, were the minimum you can buy is more or less than what you really need to buy what you want), but according to global chat i can just get eso plus to access all of it for a month......eso plus....... an optional monthly fee........at that point just play a different mmo with monthly fee"
Negative,"The worst combat system I've come across. I've fallen asleep multiple times while playing this snooze-fest. If you like brain-dead console ports, then you may love this! You'll be able to find a community of fellow TBI sufferers here <3."
Negative,"Can't fix the game, but there's plenty of guars being released to go around!Edit: its not the game that's broken, it's steam that's broken"
Negative,"Everytime i install through steam, it will never connect to steam account, therefore can not play"
Negative,"legitimately the most nothing game I have ever play. You have to pay to walk, pay to run, pay to turn left and right there's more value in buying a grimace shake and using it for an enema than buying ESO"
Negative,Good MMORPG but poor server.Updates frequently but still has ping latency issues that are getting worse and worse.
Negative,"Plays like a mobile game, hardly any depth or challenge to it. It pales in comparison to previous Elder Scrolls games. Just another cash grab."
Negative,Too many microtransaction and there is no asia server
Negative,Add Aus servers you fucking cunts
Negative,"Its a decent game...its fun and I would normally recommend except for one issue... the Greymoor DLC and the membership plan.  Those are clearly money grabs and I'm incredibly cautious about what Bethesda plans to do with future ""DLCs"".  If the game turns into a Crusaders 2, or even closer to WoW where you have to spend a ridiculous amount of money to play a meh game...no thank you!  I'll stick to Paths of Exile and other such games that have companies who don't stoop to money grabs."
Negative,"The game isn't that good, there's really old bugs still in the game, quests regularly break and support is almost impossible to contact. Even if you try to make a ticket on the site, the option won't actually be there for most cases, it's just there to look like there's support, you can't make a ticket. They'll just tell you to start again with whatever you were doing constantly and lemme jsut let you know that some of these quests, man they're so grindy and talky that to just restart can be more than an hour of dialogue and travelling while fighting a few of the same monster over and over. I traced quest breaking bugs back several years and there's been no attempts to fix them at all.  I played from beta and when beta quests for khajit's faction were broken and stayed broken for most of the time I played I thought ""it's only beta"" but now, this is the entire product.Levelling and progression tweaks have left me wondering ""Why? This doesn't even make sense anymore."" and seems only to be this way because they needed to shove everyone together since most players left the broken, grindy game. Which doesn't surprise me. I come back every year or so to see what's changed and invariably nothing has. It's still broken and buggy, the auction system is still TERRIBLE, nothing is ever fixed and they only care about releasing more paid for content which, spoiler alerts, is never that good."
Negative,This is more of a review of the installer and not the game. I hear good things about the game. This is to help people potentially buying the game with limited SSD space...Requires about 150gb of free space on a single drive to install (not the 85 as per the min spec).Downloads a 60gb installer which then requires 87gb of space to install the game. I only have around 100gb free on each of my SSDs so ended up requesting a refund. The installer doesn't have the option to change the install directory.Make sure you have 150gb of space on your preferred HDD before installing.
Negative,I have no life now. Why did I do this to myself.Edit: I bought some DLC. Why did I do this to myself.
Negative,its a boring game not worth playing in 2024
Negative,The leveling is fun but the end game kinda sucks.  It might be just me but I run into a lot of toxic players when using party finder for dungeons.
Negative,Servers are permanently too lagy and super long loading times
Negative,"My favorite part or an RPG experience is when half of the doors I find (and pockets in my backback) are magically locked by a significant paywall or because I havn't purchased enough experience yet. I have tried really hard to like this game multiple times since it came out because TES are fantastic games but I just feel bad for the time I wasted trying. I think this might be a cool MMO if you are into MMOs and have a really close friend to play with and a spare $100 sitting around for each of you, but there isn't any retained since of role playing game here for me."
Negative,Quests that never endQuest markers that don't existWhere am I going?No tutorialsNo clues as to what things doDogshit interfaceYour quest log is fullYour Inventory is fullStandard MMO
Negative,"Boring, dull gameplay and story. I wanted to play with friend but this game is designed to be played with randoms. Yes playing with your buddy is possible but it's inconvinient. This game looks like it was made to pass you an online store to squize more money from you beside purchase on steam. I Feel like they make you pay for the game that has freetoplay design model."
Negative,"Very funny game and I would love to give it a better review. The issue is the down times, lack of information and negligence to take care of all users. Pretty much each major update, (Steam users seems to be the unlucky ones and if you play on EU server, then make it twice), Steam users have to wait many more hours for a fix. During this review we (Steam users) are waiting for a fix to log in to the game. When ZENimax/Bethesda/Who ever is in charge of updates, gets around and makes it possible for all users to use the game as intended, I'll remove this review for a more positive one."
Negative,I can't play this game. The launcher is stuck on loading. Zenimax/Bethesda/Steam offer no workarounds and troubleshooting steps online don't fix it. It wasn't an expensive game and I got a few hours gameplay out of it before this bug came up but I'm pretty annoyed. Seems from the forums that this issue has been around for years and they've still done nothing about it which is irritating to say the least.
Negative,"I have spent so many hours in this game, it's got great lore and a friendly community. So why am I not recommending this game? The greed. You are constantly bombarded with in-game purchases, whether it's cosmetics, DLC access, loot-crates or minor improvements (horse riding speed etc). Some of it can be achieved through grinding but it's frustrating how many microtransactions there are, including rigged loot crate stats."
Negative,Devs couldn't give a fuck less
Negative,this game has 0 soul.
Negative,game wouldnt launch and now it is missing from my library
Negative,its not TES neither MMOIT'S TRASH!
Negative,dopes not work anymore after playing for 1000 hours suddenly doesent work
Negative,Stopped playing this game. It failed to capture my interest.
Negative,"This game screams medicore. This game does nothing new, unique, fun, or interesting. The world of Tamriel is meshed together into what equates to a cheese pizza, the kids will love it. Most of the positive reviews are tastless imbeciles lauding this game because their pants can't hold in their spazzing members.I will give it this, I can change the size of my female characters...eh,  ratios..."
Negative,"Yeah idk really - Steam says I got 66 hours played so far, but 65 of those hours was spent downloading 60 GB patches, applying patches, then downloading some more 50 GB patches and applying those patches, and oh, some more patches, but wait! Another 70 GB patch...!"
Negative,"Used to be my favorite mmo.  The 2k+ hours it shows here on steam isn't even close, i played for 6 months on stadia, years on ps4 and over a year on pc not through steam.  I LOVED this game, but they are ruining it and i'm bailing ship and no longer recommending this game.  Instead of just hiding new content behind the yearly chapter release which people on eso plus will get 1 year late like they used to do (with exception of summerset) these last 2 years have been literal pay to win.  And worse this year you don't just miss out on the best items/rewards you ACTIVELY GET PUNISHED for not buying since in their infinite wisdom they decided to nerf everyones damage in hopes that the new companions don't actually change anything but if you have to wait a year to get companions you are just nerfed for no reason.  On top of this all mythics are getting nerfed more and more now that eso plus members will be getting them when blackwood drops making greymore basically useless for eso plus members who are getting it.  I fully expect the same to happen to companions come next year.  All in all ESO is no longer any different than any other game released by a AAA company these days and it's really shitty."
Negative,"I've been playing this game for a few years on and off, got it as a ""Free to play"" game because I didn't have extra money to spend at the time. It was glitchy from the start, Charactor got stuck in place a lot, quests wouldn't finish, path indicators didn't work and ran me in loops. I spend about $50 on expansions, crown coin, and other in game purchase's, Now, all that is gone due to this update I can't log in, Steam just tried to reinstall it, I get a message to create an account again, then get prompted to buy the game! Even though I've spent money on content I now can't access! Hell no I'm done I am deleting the game from my library and all data."
Negative,"Game is interesting and fun, as long as you can login. For 3 hours already steam users cannot connect due to an issue reported back in mid February. This will probably show you, how fast they fix issues :)"
Negative,its faster to uninstall this and install Skyrim while waiting for a cake to finish baking. More fun too
Negative,"boring, devs r greedy"
Negative,"It took about five times of installing and uninstalling to eventually get this game to properly download. Then the issue with the disappearing launcher which resulted in downloading three more times (or every time I close the game then want to play again). Now, I can't get through five minutes of gameplay before the game starts glitching and eventually freezes and logs me out. Not worth the money."
Negative,"Annoying and agressive P2W. I paid for the game, it shouldn't be so filled with microtransactions and FOMO strategies. That alone is enough to not play the game.Also, stupid PVE scaling on par or worst than Oblivion's goblins. You remember a mudcrab you took 5 hits to kill while lvl1? Guess what, at lvl 50 the same mudcrab spawn area will take even more hits to kill. Mindnumbing how ""devs"" agreed on such ill mechanic.I was actually going to give this another try, but I noticed a dubious privacy agreement update, which asks us to agree on selling our data as 1st jan 2022. Sure, this isn't any news on the internet, but hear me out. You *pay* for the game's copy, you might *pay* for the subscription/items/DLCs etc and yet they still need to resort to selling your data? Really disgusting how people manage to make excuses in name of such companies just by the ""status quo of the industry"" justification. Quite the blind sheeps.Therefore, this review is not only meant to you, imaginary reader, but also to my future self to NOT play this shady game ever again, and keep an sharp eye for Zenimax/Bethesda games.EDIT 1: thank you past self for this reminder."
Negative,"tl;dr ESO is like a gumball covered in poo. (read on for context)I came into this looking for Elder Scrolls I could play online with my friends, and it's buried in there somewhere! Unfortunately it's stuck behind a bafflingly enormous amount of other garbage that I couldn't even begin to comprehend, much less care about. It feels like they added a whole bunch of unnecessary messing around to get in the way of running around hitting things with pointy sticks together, and eventually my friends and I gave up. If you have an incredibly enormous amount of free time, just play Skyrim again, I know you own it on about 4 systems already. The fun in this one is just buried too deep.*editing to add this since I got a copy-pasted response from the devs to my review: no, I don't feel that wasting even more of my time looking up guides would help me enjoy the game! It's like saying ""I enjoy gumballs, but I really wish I could have one that wasn't buried inside a dog turd"", to which you receive the response ""well maybe you just don't appreciate dog turds because you don't understand them, here's some literature on dog turds!"" I don't want to understand dog turds! I just want a gumball that isn't covered in poo!"
Negative,"If you don't get the Plus Membership, you are blocked from some seriously critical pieces of the game. They really shaft their current players all the time. At one point they put up a sale for the base game plus 4 DLCs for $20. If you already owned the base game, buying the DLCs alone was $40 - no sale at all. If you buy the base game now, you get the Morrowind Expansion included. But my copy of the base game still requires that I buy it separately at full price. Some very jerk moves from Zenimax. They rely on sunk cost fallacy to keep current players sinking more money into the game, instead of rewarding loyal players and doing other things to attract new players.And the crown crates (loot boxes, mystery boxes, whatever you want to call them) are a huge gambling rip-off. I've never actually paid for one, but I've gotten several given out by various events. And all but 1 of them have contained absolute trash.They were always edging the line of being pay to win by having various items/armor sets that were stuck behind DLC paywalls. But for most of those, you could buy them off guild traders if you really needed to. For a long time, everyone had access to all the important skill lines. Only the thieves guild and dark brotherhood were behind the paywall - and those were RP/gameplay-type skill lines. But with the Summerset and Greymoor expansions, that changed. Summerset adds a skill line that is very important to mage characters. And Greymoor adds a whole new class of items (mythic) that are extremely powerful. If you do not own these, you are just at a straight disadvantage from people who do.The model is flawed, but the game itself has some serious annoyances as well. The inventory system is garbage. The crafting and horse leveling system takes so much real world time that it's insane. It literally takes months of logging in every day to level up your horse - and the levels don't carry to other characters; you have to do it on every character every day. And researching weapon/armor traits for crafting takes moths of real-world time.What makes the interface issues so much worse is the fact that third-party addons are basically required. So it's just really ironic that ZOS continually screws existing players while literally simultaneously relying on them to make the game playable.It's a shame, because this game had a lot of potential with the variety of build options and stuff that you could run. But it's killed in all the little details."
Negative,"While I really enjoy the game and I find it excellent,I'm putting a bad review on the steam page for one reasonSteam's way of handling this game is terribly awful,and issues on steam's side that will prevent you from logging in are very commonIf you plan on playing this game, DO NOT BUY IT ON STEAM,go to the official ESO website and buy it there,without linking your account to steam"
Negative,"I did not buy the ES Online games earlier because I feared what they would be like. This is pitiable. All the imersive elements of Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim stripped away and the game reduced to ""follow the arrow"". Dungeons are public spaces, so half the time you are walking through empty rooms because someone was there before you. Game environment is tiny, many dungeons closed and what are open are just three rooms each. Everything i feared about the move to MMO and worse."
Negative,"Terrible game. Slow, repetitive combat. One pro is that there is a tremendous amount of voice acting.Stopped working after a recent update, and now for some reason I can't log into my Bethesda account from my pc even though I logged in a week ago on my phone. Even resetting my password isn't working. Would not recommend. And with how things have been going with bethesda lately, they've lost a customer."
Negative,"So I bought ESO and High Isles thinking ""boy oh boy I'm going to play as a Vampire Nightblade assassin, this is going to be fun!"" Then I got to the vampire part...-The more you feed the less health you can regenerate, because reasons?-Your strong toggles cost health and prevent you from being healed-The more you feed the more non-vampire skills cost-You can turn into a mist form...there is literally no reason to press this button in PVE-Your Ultimate! you get to turn into a hairless rat-bear-pig for 30 seconds Why? why Devs? you make baby Dracula cry. Let us have fun.I canceled my sub and I'm waiting for the day they completely rework vampire."
Negative,"Do not buy on here. Seriously if you want to play the game on weekends on the EU servers this is the worst move you can make. Its down every weekend and you cant collect daily rewards (And event rewards) because of it. I'm either going to have to rebuy the game and start again (As is my partner) on the ESO servers or just never play again. Elder Scrolls is my favourite franchise and I love this game when it allows me to play, but that is happening less and less now. Im so angry, especially because there is no support or information from either steam, zenimax or bethesda about this, and it takes them about 12 hours to fix the problem every week. By all means, buy the game. Just not on here."
Negative,I honestly thought the controls were weird
Negative,"Do not buy this game from Steam. There are regular login issues that only affect Steam users, buy this straight from Zenimax"
Negative,very bad developer policies
Negative,"I used to enjoy this game very much. They are slowly destroying this game, this last event was so impossible to get the special style pages from hunting bosses, dolmens ect. If you work at all good luck getting it you should not have to spend like 3 hours everyday of event and still not get it with 1 day of event left. Getting kicked from game is getting bad also, so many glitches lately, long load screens."
Negative,"Two reasons why I stuck around so long with ESO1. The rich stories and quests found within the ESO world. The majority of the quests' patterns alternates between fetch quests and ""kill/obtain X number of targets"" but the stories behind each quest is different and unique. My favourite quest by far was following a dog dig up a bunch of human bones, only to piece them together into a living skeleton. Apparently he paid an enchanter for his dog and himself to live on after death so they could continue travelling together, as they've always had. 2. The community - Not to say there aren't any bad apples, but I can say that the majority are great people to interact with. Everyone is generally helpful and receptive to newcomers especially when everyone's being nice about asking. Two reasons you, as a new player, may not like this game:1. The learning curve - Phew, is the curve high. Power to you if you enjoy challenges, because there is A LOT to learn and to do. I won't go into the specifics, but be prepared to pour A LOT of time into this game if you're playing to ""git gud"". Though honestly, even if you wanted to play this for fun, the game's system is somewhat complex and convoluted and it might just frustrate you before you get to breathe easy.2. Money sink - I say this because playing this game is like an investment. I've personally stopped playing this from time to time because I couldn't financially keep up with the DLCs and expansions. This game can become exhausting particularly if you're always chasing after the latest, best gears and items. Even if you were to subscribe monthly (ESO Plus), you still have to pay extra for the expansions. I think the only up side I see is that these expansions usually have a great deal of content that is worth the price on, thankfully they also tend to go half price by the next year so it isn't entirely hopeless either."
Negative,"Let's start by saying I am a fan of Elder Scrolls Universe. I am not that old of a fan, I started my journey with Oblivion. Nonetheless, it means something, I mean, the TES series back there wasn't that much of mainstream like it became after the Skyrim. By the end of the day, I found myself in a world I enjoy, great graphics, effects and music. I want to become part of this world, to explore, to discover, to grow. I want to lvl up my crafting skill trees, I want my own housing with achievements I got from dungeons and so on and the awesome thing I can do all this and more.We have a great mix of pvp, pve and more. This product is complete it's growing and it's improving. And you may ask me, what's the matter? Why this review is a negative one?The answer is ""the combat""For the 1st 100 hours or so, it's Great ---> Normal. It makes sense, once you are got used to combat it lost its freshness and it's something human that all of us experienced at one point or another. All this world with a good combat system was more than enough for me, I was having fun. And right here it struck me.The combat annoys me. I can't take any more of it. I grew tired of it, it lacks something. Could it be because of the awful kickback? I mean there are mobs' reactions when you hit them, but it unsatisfying Could it be animations? Cooldowns? General paste of the game? only 10 skills with no cooldown and only mana requirement? Could it be something else?I'm not sure, I tried to find the answer recently and I failed. There is something boring about it and the combat system in MMO is a key element and if you can't enjoy it even if you force yourself to like it, it can't be helped.p.s. I doubt that my issue is fixable but I really hope one day that still manage to do something about itp.p.s. I am tired of playing a clicker, give me an option for auto-attack or something and I will be back"
Negative,the game itself is great but buy it from its own websitelast week i coudlntplay eso for a whole day and this week it happened again because there is something about steam that doesn't let people log inand apperantly it is nothing new either.and other people on the forum say that steam support is ignoring them.dont waste your money here just buy it from its own website.
Negative,"I'm sure grateful to have gotten to try it for free this week, I would have felt fairly cheated if I bought it.  This game is just not good.  Guess I'll go play Skyrim again."
Negative,"You're honestly better off playing World of Warcraft, that game is so much better IMO"
Negative,Yet another MMO that seems to think cosmetic items are extremely valuable.  Don't support greedy companies like this.
Negative,too much RPG not enough MMO
Negative,"I cannot, in good faith, recommend any MMO in 2019 with a battleground PvP mechanic without any matchmaking capabilities. Putting four random, low-level, low-skill players into the ring against a pre-made group of four high-skill players communicating on Discord is ridiculous."
Negative,"*DO NOT BUY THE STEAM VERSION OF THIS GAME*ProsInteresting progression systemCombat is fun (for an MMO)Good value for $20Intuitive interface and party systemFaithful Elder Scrolls narrativeConsCONSTANT SERVER ISSUESShockingly bad customer supportCrown Store is a bit too intrusiveFormulaic questsGarish costume skins & petsThere really is a fun, compelling game under all the layers of frustration and the shockingly bad customer support. Unfortunately, a number of self-inflicted problems make ESO very hard to recommend on Steam, or any platform, until Zenimax owns up to its mistakes and shows any interest whatsoever in fixing chronic technical issues that are ruining an otherwise good MMO.The main issues I’m referring to are the very regular (at least once or twice a week), hours-long server crashes that prevent Steam users from logging on. I took this screenshot on 4 July 2018  after the most recent server crash for an example-https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/942825011542792558/0543FF82D909342FBAC45B75F39BB3F7BD026009/Most of the ESO and Reddit forum users are convinced that the problem is with ZOS, not Steam, which leads to the second major issue. ZOS customer service is nigh but impossible to reach. Communing with dead relatives would be a much more reasonable proposition than ever hoping to navigate their byzantine customer service portal. They make it incredibly difficult to even submit a ticket, and if you somehow manage to,  you’ll probably get a tepid, confusing email response in broken English 3 or 4 days later. It gets even worse from here. There are loads of other persistent, widespread glitches that prevent some users from even installing and running the game. I wasn’t able to play for 5 months due to a well-known glitch that still hasn’t been resolved for many users. I’ve only been able to play after installing a new SSD and OS. When I first contacted ZOS about the issue, they told me to check my &*%#ing firewall and anti-virus settings and ""try again."" Really?I want to say that ESO is worth overlooking all of these issues, but honestly no game is worth this amount of frustration. If this is what subscription-free MMO gaming is supposed to be, I will gladly offer up $15/month to be able to play my game without constant server crashes and appalling customer support."
Negative,"I truly liked this game till this recent update. Just like when blizzard nerfed the skill trees on WOW to ""make it easier"" ESO has done the same with champion points. Now everyone has the same boring characters with the same capped skills and no unique play style. Congrats ESO... I expected better from you."
Negative,"Shameless, unmitigated, cash grab. MTX's are insanely priced for a below-average MMO.  Graphics are pretty when the connection is stable. Subscription is overpriced and underwhelming and the inventory system was deliberately structured to make you Sub and buy Crown Packs. Grouping system  (pve) is in need of work and don't bother with PVP at all.  I guess it did succeed in one way...after deleting my account in disgust I went and played Skyrim."
Negative,"Do not buy this game on steam. At least since 2014 the installer does not reliably work with steam, but the bug has not been fixed by the developers as of October 2017 (!). Just look online and search for “Steam install Issues”. Apparently the developers abandoned this game and/or have no consideration for their users once they got their money. Saddening."
Negative,The worst thing about this game is you cant even fucking get on it. The launcher just freezes everytime I try and get on. I've read countless people trying to get it resolved but no solution. Like how about you fix your shit? Why do I have to do all this extra shit just to log on. I paid for the game and have played it before but the moment I try to come back and buy the Summerset DLC it just shits on me.
Negative,"A game you pay a subscription NOT to be able to play! PC EU...if you're reading this, I would not buy or get the expansion - High Isle - until their servers decide to work!"
Negative,fked with monetizationif u  wanna play casually sure u can have fun tho  just ignore monetization. community is basically echo chamber they don't want this game to be criticised.
Negative,"This is a good game that is ruined by a garbage-tier company. I'm genuinely not one to complain about the makers of the games that I enjoy, but ZOS is special. In the past 3 weeks we've missed out on about a week of play depending on when you play and where you're at. There has been near-zero compensation for it (not even extensions for the events that we are missing out on while the servers are down or unplayable) and 1 piece of communication saying the issue was fixed, only to have more issues of not being able to connect 2 days later. Still, no communication (and obviously nothing to make up for these constant issues). This is genuinely the most frustrated I've ever been with a game developer. If you're looking for a game to sink some time into, I cannot suggest this game. Not just because of the recent issues, but ZOS's response to them. It shows how they will deal with these things in the future, and they still haven't resolved the issues. If it sounds like it's just me, go check steam charts, this game lost 30% of its player base last month for good reason."
Negative,"UPDATE: For some reason the launcher doesn't work anymore and support gave me the ""check the forums"" excuse with no fix at all.This game looks like it was made in GameMaker. The combat is clunky. The gameplay in general is boring. Lack of UI information and unnecesary information and features in sub-menus. The world feels dull. The animations are cringy af. This is not expected from a AAA game.The only good thing about this game is the expansions and the assets used. Its like the guy who designed this game just placed stuff randomly from mmorpgs and elder scrolls games without even trying to make something enjoyable and well made.If it were free maybe i could recommend it but it would still be a boring game."
Negative,Not a bad game but the constant log-in timouts which can go on for many hours make it unplayable and unreliable. Do yourself a favour and find a stable game. AVOID
Negative,"If you are the MMO player, Who is in mid season replacement just after the last generation of MMO major blockbustersSuch as Second Life EverQuest 2 WoW entropia universe. It does the job for right now, But it can onliy go so fare of a game that it feels to generic."
Negative,"For some time, I was able to play. It was awesome. Truly, the best MMORPG I've played.Most of the time I stare at a screen, at that ""Connection timed out"" hellish message and I think to myself ""Why can you make such an amazing game and then have complete disregard about your customer feedback, not replaying to posts other than simple copy/pastes, shallow replies that don't tell ANYTHING about what's happening"".Don't buy. Wait for servers to be deemed stable. It's a shame."
Negative,"What an absoloute joke, I cancelled my subsription fee through steam and through the actual game to make sure it wouldn't charge me again. Now i got an email thanking me for upkeeping my subscription today?? After I've had a look they have been charging me for a couple of months with no other emails telling me this."
Negative,"I would love to write a review on this game. Long time elder scrolls series lover, but first time ESO player. I decided to finally give it a chance. Well... I bought this on steam around 4 pm on 6/9/18... about the same time they started have steam user logon issues.I can launch the game but get a server timeout EVERY TIME when attempting login. All there is a message saying ""we're investigated this issue.""Kinda sucks to pay for a game and not be able to play it. I'll write a better review if I can ever actually play it. Until then... DO NOT BUY IT. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PLAY IT."
Negative,"Wouldn't recommend buying it at all if you are someone who likes the Elder Scrolls Series, its truly nothing like what it should be and the game mechanics sucks, its not fun to hit enemies or shoot an arrow or use staffs, it feels like an underpowered but oversized mobile game really. At times the game fails to login as well, I like Bethesda but this is nothing great compared to previous Elder Scrolls titles I've played and enjoyed."
Negative,Can get it to work anymore with steam
Negative,"ha ha, funny. Bought 2 copies (here and on official store) because steam version didnt want to launch after an hour of gameplay.They banned both! just after purchase! I did not even played second copy!This is a fraud!"
Negative,"Decided to try this game as it was free to play for a couple days. Rage quit after realizing it's unplayable without the subscription, for someone who wants to give it a shot and try it out not worth your energy & money."
Negative,"Yay it's the weekend. Let's play that game i bought and pay a sub for. Oh wait, your not able to log in... don't worry though the servers will be back up tomorrow, while you are at work....No communication , no information , just silence.Watch us on twitter and play the game ! or not...  Save yourself a hassle don't but it on steam like I did."
Negative,"Steam support has been terrible since the latest expansion. You'd think they'd have spun up their auth servers for a big new release. Glad I'm not a subscriber.Game is pretty good, but unless you pay the monthly fee you'll end up spending half of your time managing your inventory or bypassing crafting entirely, which is one of the cornerstones of the original game series.Basically, if WoW cut their subscription rate in half, i probably wouldn't play another minute of this game."
Negative,First you pay for the game for that you receive the opertunity to run arround and do comon things like picking flowers and killing some enemies.Second (optional)  pay monthly to actuly be able to enjoy the game with 80% of the content including The things mentioned aboveThird (optional) Since you payed for the game you get the opertunity to buy ingame shop currency to also make the game actuly be enjoyable...Conculsion pay play pay more to play like it should be in the first place and pay even more to enjoy the actula game.SO if you love paying simulators look no further theis is the real thing for you. Everyone else move on nothing to see here.The first elderscrols game also first  Bethesda game that I do not recomend to anyone unless they are interested to pay For everything .
Negative,"Awful experience to buy from steam.the game itself is fine, great even.I just downloaded 87GB on steam, for the zenimax launcher to download over 60GB.I read that the steam version is outdated, so the launcher downloads the game, even though you just downloaded it.the launcher for some reason makes my computer almost unusable, even though I have over 16 GB of RAM and a 4.20GHz processor.Avoid paying full price for this experience."
Negative,this game has  terrible pvp. They didnt fix pvp lag since years. at this point i feel like they dont care. So if you only care about pve go give it a try. but if you want to play pvp get ready for massive lags that makes you quit even after 600hours
Negative,I got banned for no reason. I only played for 30 min. The rest were spen afk in my launcher downloading it. I read about that  you could be banned for mic spamming. Is it possible that I was holding down a push to talk key while talking to my friends?
Negative,"to greedy with monitization. why do i need to buy mages guild, darkbrother hood, thiefs guild all for $15 eachand any good fighting pets you have to buy, any other mounts than a horse you have to buy. just buy skyrim it will give you all of that and more for like $30"
Negative,I'm sick and tired of all the unnecessary changes
Negative,Just don't really like it
Negative,"Inventory management is trash, you have to $$ to crafting bag to hold all the crafting it you get in the first hours of playing. That is freaking annoying. Sorry not recommending this to anyone."
Negative,Zenimax *ba dum tss*
Negative,really sad that it wont let me use my controller wow
Negative,Like every other bad mmo locked behind dlc content and when u get the dlc it is not worth the money spent.
Negative,No physics overall 4/10those death animation look kinda outdated to me
Negative,"-Lots of bugs with no fix over several years-greedy money driven publishers-lots of DLC and microtransactions-Loot boxes-Power Creep behind paywalls-bad faction pvp design= unbalanced PVP-huge learning curve-artificially created quality of life issues, (e.g.inventory space) to make you pay ..."
Negative,"DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. I've spent half my time NOT playing as its either down for maintence or you can't log in. COMPLETE waste of time. I'm done with Bethesda who makes absolutley buggy games, release them unfinished; then encourage amateurs to fix their drek for FREE with mods. I'm done with steam, which pawns off its non existent tech support for THEIR bugs on developers. I'm just DONE. I'm only playing console games by legit developers like rockstar. at least their crap works. Screw Valve, screw Bethedsa and screw zos online. I wish they'd all fall dead!Sitting here wondering if i should just uninstall..."
Negative,don't work properly on steam the launcher are broken and the technical support do not help at all.The game don't start this game not work on steamIf you wanna play buy it in other place
Negative,"WARNING! Do not buy this game from Steam.  Period.1) Bought game on sale from Steam.2) Installed game.3) Started to run game.  It requires further updates.4) Let it update, but freezes on the update window.5) Use the update window to repair (which also happens to redownload dozens of gigs).6) Repair function takes all night...and freezes while I'm asleep.7) Get it to finish the next day...but then upon clicking ""Play"" it says it's missing RedShell.dll and to reinstall to fix.8) Google more fixes and find recurring issues between Steam and Zenimax...and the whole undesireable debacle RedShell.dll was all about.9) Request a refund from Steam.10) Steam denies request because they think I've been playing the game for 8+ hours...when it's only been the update window freezing and crashing the whole time.Might be the last time I buy a game from Steam.  Thankfully I didn't get Monster Hunter: World through Steam."
Negative,"I wish I could give this a different review than just yes or no. Overall it is a pretty good MMO. There is a ton of content, the quests are pretty good, dungeons are fantastic, how you build your character is great. However the combat is just awful, there are no cooldown's and you really just spam your skills while you gauge your magika / stamina, and the actually weapon hits feel weightless, so I really have a hard time staying engaged in this game for too long.If your a huge fan of the elder scrolls or combat isn't your main draw this game is great, otherwise I would avoid it. If they ever do a big change to the way weapons feel I would easily come back for more."
Negative,"Didn't have much fun with this, everything was very tedious. Combat was very limited and was all about pressing a button to make your enemies health go down or pressing a button to make your health go up. My friends and I tried to get into the crafting system to see if there was anything there but I think we were too low leveled to do anything? The interesting quests were pay-walled behind the subscription (as is unlimited crafting material backpack space) so my buddies couldn't do anything with me. The whole thing was just kinda bland, but was nice to do in the background as we just sorta hung out and talked. The only fun time we had was trying to take on a level 25 something raid boss as 3 level 18 characters, we tried about 12 times before cheesing the AI to death. Typical Bethesda game."
Negative,another generic MMORPG made only to steal your money don't buy it
Negative,ok i wait for 10 hours for this game buy now i cant play it. when  i join the game it crash. wtf not fair i payed 10.00. i what to play now!
Negative,"[1]Many of Sub-quests are immersive, Even more than Skyrim!Some tidy heist or clearing the dungeon quest is filled with tender details and dialogues along voice.I've spent most of my time on Khajiit's quest line but I'm looking forward to Tamriel quest line andother DLC that is about to release. I guess I'm gonna subscribe this game.Oh and, If you got a friend or more who loves RPG.They will definitely love it.[2]Latency is horrible. Default ping is 600 and It skyrockets to 1299 oftenDon't buy this game if you live in Asia"
Negative,If your downloading this on steam i shouldnt bother... i paid for it through steam downloaded the game ..when i started the game it went to an updating screen ..... 5 hours later the game did still not do anything .. contacted support for a refund and they said i had played for 5 hours so no refund was available ... (didnt even get to create an account so dont know how i played the game.. contacted support again and still awaiting an aswer 2 days later ... if you want to pay for a game that dont work ..go ahead and download this game .... i guess its time to go to  CAB and consumer rights or trading standards ....
Negative,"Two words describe this game buggy mess. Numbers of bugs and wird things in this game is horrendous. And I have good gaming pc. Fight is really weak and look like dota 2 - good  for children under 5. Aiming is even worser you can be blind and still hit target. If u want a bad game with horrible story, monsters which no one want to kill becasue of constant respawn, quest which look like go from A - kill the same boring monsters, go to B - kill the same boring monsters, go to C - kill extremly boring boss. Yes this game is for you. But the best thing is canceling animation something such stupid only bethesda could invent - there are two abilities bars swapping between bars cancel fight animations :DBut the funniest thing is the price 15 £ for base game 30 £? for main dlc, 10-20£ for each smaller dlc which are like 20 or u can buy subscribsion which cost only 80 £ a year. Are u all crazy? You spend so much many and what u get? Buggy game, laggy servers and plasure to grind extremly boring monsters and devs which really give a s..it  about players. You are just throw away 160£ for two years!!!!, 400£ for 5years!!!!. I dont know any so expensive game. But I have better things to buy for such price in real life."
Negative,"When you start playing the game it is very fun, especially when exploring into new regions, and completing quests within them. Playing with friends is easy and enjoyable as well. The game itself is great, and it should be played. Aside from the gameplay itself however, one thing that is frustrating is that after a while of not playing, I tried to load the game, but there is always a ridiculously long update on the game itself. It feels like I can't even play the game whenever I want to, as I don't have time to have the updates install. Another thing I've seen is how the udpates seems to take up over 100GB to install, which is bit of a problem especially if you want to save space on your computer. I feel as if I can no longer play the game because of this, and I've lost my money, simply paying for updates!The game itself is great and I enjoy it, but I cannot go back to playing it because of this update issue. For those of you who hold on to this game for a long time without checking it often, watch out for this!"
Negative,"If you haven't played this for years don't get it now. Constant crashes in every part of the game - dungeons, trials, pvp, just picking flowers; they destroyed pvp so lots of people left already. Devs don't know their game so have no idea what effect certain changes would bring. Was a great game once, would not recommend now."
Negative,no cross platform. that sucks.
Negative,Just another boring grindy game which you need a sub to play fully.
Negative,no filters to find crafting materialsno telling if u have to do a quest or how to get those filters
Negative,"I wanted to like this game, I really did, but the combat, movement, and especially the animations all feel janky and unpolished as hell, even compared to dated games like skyrim or older fallouts. I thought I could ignore it but its just a huge thorn that you will notice at all times. I cant really recommend this unless you really want to play with friends or are super into the lore"
Negative,"I will never buy ZeniMax Online Studios and Bethesda Softworks products again.They are violating their usage agreement. Incite hatred. They cheat and don't provide services written on the site, including in the Steam store. They accept the buyer's payments, call the buyer's payments ""incorrect"", ""inaccurate"", take the money and ban them.All my purchases were made only through the Steam store. First, I bought their standard game for myself and as a gift to my husband. I bought eso+, and a little later a pack of crowns (in-game currency). Everything went well in the Steam store. The payment was made with PayPal. The Steam store allowed me to make this payment.Then I registered an account on their website, and from that moment I started having problems. After registering an account and logging into the game, it turned out that the crowns (in-game currency) that should have been when buying eso+ didn't come. My husband and I wrote to the support service, we had to wait about 20 days, I had to create 19 tickets to be heard, after a long period of ignoring we were banned. Now I understand that this was done so that we couldn't return the products in an easy way. I provided them with all the screenshots they requested, there were all the transactions of buying their products in the Steam store, and, moreover, I took live photos of the computer. The support staff member didn't like the choice of our region on their game's website. We chose the region where we went to rest. When registering, we weren't warned that this would affect anything. There was just a list from which we could select any available region. I thought the localization language depends on the choice of region. An employee of the company, exceeding his authority and guided by personal hostility to the region chosen by me and my husband, accused us of using the difference in regional prices without providing evidence. But this is physically impossible to do! Because there is no access to these products from the region that we have selected on the site, and it is impossible to change the region on the site yourself, without a request to the support service. I asked friends from this region to send me screenshots and sent them to the support service. I asked the support staff to provide a confirmation of the transaction in any currency other than the USD that I used when I originally purchased items from the Steam store, but they ignored my request. I asked to change the region of my account on the site to my home, explaining the whole situation. And again I received a silent refusal. It seems that the people who work for this company do not know how their store on the site and the Steam store work. If my money is ""bad"", then why take it? I have never encountered such a toxic attitude and hatred from the support service."
Negative,"I... don't understand ESO. The best way I can describe it is that it's the Elder Scrolls universe as an MMO - which, I guess, you could've gotten from just the name. But the question I have anyway is did we need that? Plenty of MMOs are out there in other worlds - when I think ""Elder Scrolls"" I don't picture an MMO.No, when I picture ""Elder Scrolls"" I picture a vast single player experience with tons of quests and exploration. Not grinding, not grouping together for dungeons or raids, not comparing stats on several different slight variations on a single weapon, not blatant WoW style ""kill this 10 times"" quests. If I wanted that, well there's other MMOs out there - I mean it doesn't hurt that this is another one but to me it's just so starkly different of an experience that I cannot get into it at all. That said, there are many thousands of people - many of my friends included - that love ESO and play it regularly with hundreds of hours logged. So clearly it has something going for it."
Negative,game forces me to pay more by the inventory system altough i have already paid for the game.It doesnt even make sense.Also graphics are too bad and textures wont load untill you wait for at least 3 seconds of object.Mechanics are really bad too everything moves really weird.Even the skyrim(old version) looks and feel better than this.I would not recommend this game to anybody.
Negative,"I dont know how to review it but dont expect online skyrim after buying this. It can be really fun and can hook you at the begining. For me it lasted 12 hours, then it started to kind of fall apart. Enviroment, graphics, voice acting and all the other things are done good but the flaws are combat and player interaction. I dont think it was a great idea to make MMO from Elder Scrolls Game. When it came out i was excited for it because i was hoping for online skyrim as everybody else i guess. The combat is somewhat bland unlike the one in Skyrim. I know Bethesda isnt known for making good looking animations but these are just bad. I was about to say that atleast the price is low, and it is true but only if you pay for the base game, other DLCs which come out pretty often are pretty expensive. Player interaction is close to non existent from what i played. If you have friends it can be fun but if you are alone like i was it just feels like playing a singleplayer game. If the combat would be good i would recommend anyone to play this. The player interaction is just a minor thing since you can get your own friends to play with you. But the combat is just bland, especially if you play with staffs"
Negative,"I'm not good at doing reviews,but for sure I can tell you,that this game sucks every penny from you.Want to PVP? BUY A DLC so you can get a better kit for PVPWant to do some extra Dungeons or Trials or explore more? Buy those DLCs.If you are here only to look for adventure and not something else,then go on. But if you are here to Play more,then SPEND Everything you have."
Negative,"I have played this game once on console before, and I wasn't a fan. I was begged to try it again on PC, and the launcher won't even work. I have done everything and every online solution short of using ""selective startup mode"", including downloading this ridiculous 105GB game three times, and it still refuses to work. If I can't even get into the game because of a stupid launcher application, then it doesn't get any points or scores whatsoever from me. Absolute 0.0/10."
Negative,"doesnt contain the whole game just the newest dlc and base game, still need to fork over 100$ for whole game, dont buy this waste of money,  this version here on steam is basiclly a online single player game"
Negative,bethesda should just stick to single player games
Negative,"Consistently disconnecting every 5 or so minutes. Different computer? Still there. Different connection (type, ISP, router...)? Still there. Contacting support? ""Fuck you, thanks for the money.""."
Negative,"Would have loved to play this game. Purchased for my girlfriend to play along with me. Launcher would not install or update the game. Researched the issue and found that it has been going on for months, and it was a cumbersome manual process to get it to install that is not at all friendly for non-technical people. Cannot support a game that cannot fix such a game breaking issue in a timely manner."
Negative,"PVE is good. But i'm hear to talk about the PvP. It is one of the worst PVP games i've ever played. Its to the point where you'll see two people fighting for 3 mins strait and they'er heath bar never looked like it dropped. Now imagine it was you against one of those people. Even if your a high DPM player, if they have a healer or multiple at that you will NEVER kill the enemy player. Overall everyone is just a punching bag where the battle last way to long and it almost does not matter about your set up. Which is sad the game gives you some really good stuff for PVP but when its just no fun to play, you just don't want to grind for it. But like I said PVE is good for a MMO and so is the Lore. But just don't think you'll wreck someone if you have not played 500 hours and done you research on how to be good with a set up even then you'll need an over powered friend to heal you like everyone else, then you MIGHT have a chance at fun."
Negative,"Seeing as i couldn't even make it past the character creation due to limits on deletions, i decided to play another game.any game sends me somewhere else because they want to limit legit players to other people is doing it wrong.Long explanation:There's a character limit of deleting 3 times, you get 1 back every 24 hrs, I would agree, not the most terrible of issue's except i was trying to create a character and frankly, the colors and way things look in the character creator look very different when your character is running around int he world.So i'd make a character see something i didn't like and try again, never even got out of the tutorial.  but then found myself unable to delete the character that was sitting on the name i wanted.Left with either wasting time playing a character i already decided to delete, or deciding trying to come up with a different name, i starting playing another game.Considering i played that game for the entire weekend and didn't think to come back to Elder Scrolls... they literally lost me before i even gave it a decent try, that's a 'nope i can't recommend it'."
Negative,"Played for 5 years on PS4. Came to PC and had to start the grind all over again. If this game wasn't a complete joke on console, I'd just go back to that. Update. l am playing again, but keeping a negative review because the grind really does suck. You need X amount of CP to even be considered for vet content. It's stupid. I got a 505k flawless conqueror on my magblade wearing purple training gear and blue jewelry at ~460 CP.Other shitty things about the grind?Want to DPS? You need THIS set, and THIS set. You also need THESE CP, THIS race, etc.Want to tank? See above, add another 4 or more sets.Want to heal? Same thing..."
Negative,"As a long running MMO player... I find this game boring :(. I tried to like it after hearing a lot of praise from different sources, but the game just couldn't hook me into it. The progress is horizontal, which may sound  good at first, but in practice every encounter is extremely easy and makes the feeling of traversing the world pointless and boooooring. The players I encountered seemed very nice though, compared to ones in WoW for example :), so the community might be something to look for. This game just wasn't for me, as I like to have high difficulty on my games."
Negative,"It is a good game, but I do not suggest you play if you expect good future content. 1000+ hours on Xbox, idk why it says I have this few hours on pc but ive played at least 100 hours. The live service is horrible here. Nothing is added but a dungeon or raid/trail every small update, with the ""big expansions"" being one zone, with new dungeons and raids and items. Nothing that builds onto the game. I want to see new systems in place that would reflect the old Elder Scrolls fans, or even new ideas that isnt just grind mobs for items."
Negative,"Its in this weird limbo state of it trying to do both: be a good single player RPG like youd expect out of an Elder Scrolls, but also be a good MMORPG, and i think it falls short of doing both. ESO's worth trying, but it left me just feeling like i wish there was something better."
Negative,"I was looking forward to playing this game with my friends, but the further I got into it, the less we enjoyed it.  I guess many years ago they released a patch called ""One Tamriel"" that made all enemies scale to whatever level you were, or you scaled to them or whatever.  Their goal I suppose was to make it so whatever level you and your friends were didn't matter and you could group up and enjoy the game together.  Sounds great, except that the game itself still has to be fun, and it isn't when everything is laughably easy.The point of MMOs is to have a sense of discovery, progression, empowerment, and teamwork.  You lose the discovery aspect when it doesn't move you from zone to zone as you level.  You lose the sense of progression when every level you gain, you feel weaker than you did before.  There's no empowerment of your character or the time you put into that character getting stronger when in fact, you aren't stronger at all.  There's no sense of teamwork when you can literally do a dungeon (pre-50) as a healer and not need to cast a single healing spell for any fight.Whenever I researched on why this decision was made, I was always met with frothing fans defending it from a ""well you can now go anywhere and do any quest,"" but..... you could've done that anyway when you got to max level.  If lore was important to you, why does it matter if you are overpowered for those quests?  You are a character in this world, role playing as someone who is getting stronger.  If you don't, then you may as well play a single player ES game.  Why can there be no middle ground for difficulty?  Why can't the game be a little more challenging 1-50.  If its such a boring grind, give people the option to skip it.  There's a reason so many people just grind the dolman cycles in certain areas or queue up for dungeons.  Let people play the game how they want, don't fundamentally change the way MMOs are structured.  Our friend group should have to stick together and stay similar levels to play, not literally have to conform to some overarching system for everyone.It's a shame because ESO is clearly a well made game, but the enemy scaling just absolutely crushes the fun straight out of it.  You shouldn't need to play to max level in a game for it to start being enjoyable."
Negative,Only played 12 hours. Looks pretty but game play feels too simple.
Negative,Login fails 95% of the time. If you're lucky enough to log in you can't play for more than thirty minutes without being booted from the servers.
Negative,"go back to skyrim, its better"
Negative,Holy micro transactions batman
Negative,"After three hours of gameplay, i had the least ammount of fun, the quests are a little bit interesting( for a mmorpg) but way too easy, you start level 1 with badass looking armor and 10000 random numbers in each stats, the user interface experience is cancer, for exemple, you can't just pick a buttefly in one key like in skyrim, you have to wait for the animation to finish then the loot inventory open and you have to press R to take the ""Insect part"", The story line is fishy, they don't give you an absolute definite endgame goal, you just the ""hero"" but you don't know why.  The immersion is broken by the fact that there is other players with flamming sabrecat and spirit elk mount, the world iself feels dead, there is a LOT of Npc but there serve no real purpose and you can clearly see they are there to fill the town/village. if you like to grind mindlessly just to have a bit of fun at high level, yeah go for it."
Negative,"I got a lot luckier than most of the other people who bought this game.I bought the game on the Summer Sale. It doesn't work.I've spent hours trying to find a fix, only to find out it's Bethesda's crappy servers that are the issue.Oh, and my friend got in with absolutely no issues.I spent $10 on a coinflip.EDIT: Finally got it to work, and it doesn't seem like a bad game. The Tutorial is long and character creation isn't as precise. The leveling system is odd and skills are really out-of-place. If you go into it without thinking of any other Elder Scrolls game, it's a decent game.If your copy of ESO isn't working, just reinstall Wndows."
Negative,"I have almost  52 hours on this game. Out of those 52 hours I have spent 4 hours actually playing, The other 48 hours I have spent trying to get the game to work"
Negative,Mouse sensitivity glitch
Negative,"(updated after dev response)Well after trying it and interacting with fans of it,  it's simply not my kind of game, and I also wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless they specifically want a new Elder Scrolls experience. I don't get pleasure out of grinding arbitrary experience levels in a controlled system, and always encourage and look for more player driven activities and experiences in online gaming. ESO doesn't facilitate that in any impactful way from what I've seen in 20 + hrs. Getting 10+ people dancing in the middle of Vivec was hilarious but I mean that has nothing to do with what the game is about, and there's almost no reward for doing creative/expressive things.Hell I bet if I made too much money or accomplished anything too efficiently somehow, I could get banned because there's (seemingly) little room for any particular skill or thought process to grow and shine in this game and it's boring. You can't ""git gud"" and accomplish things that impact anybody beyond helping soul-lessly grinding their own 'character' into something that can kill everything about as good as any other character and this mostly defeats the purpose of forming teams.I don't have the time for this, and don't recommend anybody make time for this.I gave ESO my money and time, and it wasn't worth it beyond discovering I don'tlike this sort of thing for the above reasons and more.(which was in itself valuable enough I suppose)-->I'll change my review if someone can clarify what the point of this game is in a way I can understand, because I'm fully open to the possibility of missing concepts that only become apparent after hundreds of hours of play. I'm just currently under the strong impression this game doesn't offer anything I can't find in a more intense and entertaining form elsewhere, with the exception of the Elder Scrolls theme and setting<--Thank you for the humbling response bethesda_murcielago but you devs definitely know your target audience much more intimately than I do, and I'm in no place to say how to improve the game for those people, and from my experience simply can't recommend the game to the sort of gamers that would value my opinion.Perhaps I'll give the game another try in the future."
Negative,"Let me preface this with the fact that I am an avid Elder Scrolls and Bethesda fan.  I was playing Morrowind as a young man.  The Elder Scrolls world has and always will have a special place in my heart.  I've spent many hours playing this game, and ultimately, it makes me sad to say I cannot recommend it.  Most of my time in this game was playing without a subscription.  If you want to enjoy this game, you need to pay for it.  I pushed myself to be very good at getting past the hassles (making extra characters for bank space, only leveling a few crafting skills instead of all of them, etc.)  Eventually, I tired and decided it was no longer worth it because the game was not worth a subscription fee.I thoroughly enjoyed the lore, quests, character customization, and in general, elder scrolls environment (this can all be enjoyed without subscription).  However, the unbalanced pvp was embarassing to watch, the Dungeon grouping tool doesn't work (nobody ques), character customization doesn't seem to really matter, and in general, I feel that f2p players are being punished unnecessarily (for example I'm not allowed to decorate my home with stuff that I've earned and purchased).  All in all, I would say if you like the Elder Scrolls Universe, get this on sale and try it out.  Then decide for yourself if it is worth the subscription.  For me, it was not."
Negative,"Elder Scroll online is a game with huge content and potential even after 15 years. However, the monetizing of the game after the initial purchase is beyond me. It is very difficult to truly enjoy the game without spending additional real money for in-game add-on like mounts (game money price is 42,000 too much) Also special mounts and any good to have items very behind a huge paywall. I do not understand why the publisher is destroying the game this way. I will not last once better games with good monetizing comes out in the near future.  Personally, a game should be enjoying and not a chore. ESO is like a chore. I purchase the ultimate addition of ESO in 2015 at USD$75. That's is a lot of money and I do not think it is worth it. So, before you go ahead and try this game, please do some research first."
Negative,"Step1: Buy Elswyr. (Or any expansion doesn't matter.)Step2: Think u can access to everything the Elswyr offers to you.Step3: Grind to 160CP and try to gear up.Step4: Try to join dungeons and trials (raids).Step5: Realise you have to pay for them too.Step6: Try to do lifeless quests which makes you go from one point to another and sometimes slain lifeless mobs requires no tactics at all.Step7: Get bored at old maps and try to go latest map Southern Elswyr. (Which should be part of the Elswyr DLC.)Step8: Realise you have to buy another DLC for that too. (Dragonhold DLC)Step9: Ask around what to do and get the answer ""Fish and chill bro.""Step10: Accept that devs are greedy and left the game for good.After every expansion release repeat the process."
Negative,"Surprisingly cold, underwhelming and nothing like other Elder Scrolls games. Bought for love of the franchise but now regret ever playing it at all."
Negative,Why do people have to pay for new DLCs when they paid for a whole game already
Negative,i would play this alot but the only problem they have is the servers ... i always end up with 999+mslooked everywhere online for a solution but found nothing... they need to do something about the serverEDIT:i don't recommend people lives in middle east to get this game until they fix the server issue
Negative,"If you like TES games for the gameplay, this is probably not the one for you. However, if you like them for the story, you still might give this a try. Personally, I hated the gameplay, so I would not recommend this game."
Negative,"I love the Elder Scrolls Series and I would also love to like this game as well. However, I can't because my steam account is tied to someone else's ESO account and Bethesda won't help me un-link their god-forsaken account from mine. So until that happens I guess this is one of the games I will never end up being able to play even though I own it.EDIT:I wanted to leave an update about the situation. I am finally able to get access to my steam copy of ESO again. It took me tracking down who had signed into my account. I'm not going to lie about it. It ended up being my idiot brother who didn't dare to say he messed up and linked my account to his ESO account by accident. But regardless, I had him contact Bethesda to make a ticket to un-link my Steam account from his ESO account.The fact that it took me having to track the person down who did it is honestly stupid. Yes, it made fixing the situation easier, but it doesn't help the fact that Bethesda said they were not going to help with the issue unless the person who did it contacted them. Which is honestly stupid because I can prove I own the steam account and the fact I bought the game. To add insult to injury, any DLC I purchased was registered to his account and I have no way to access that content now without purchasing the DLC again.So TLDR is If you buy a game that registers a game license to an account like ESO. Sign into the game at least once to make sure this doesn't happen to you. I now need to re-purchase any dlc I had bought that I don't have access to anymore. As for the review, I plan to leave it with a thumbs-down. Not because the game is bad, but because their customer service sucks when they are not willing to try to help."
Negative,Trash game. the UI dose not tell you where story missions are. or where to go for quests. You have to spend alot of IRL money just to get the things you need. No dungeon group finder. Do not waste your driver space on your PC on this game.
Negative,This game is ok especially if you love the Elder Scroll Series... however if you dont love the series you most likely will not make it to level 50 being a direct result of you not liking the game enough to grind it out and force yourself to play... I have played it a lot on xbox and... its very boring now... I am writing this review mostly to save you money... its a money pit.
Negative,The game itself isn't bad; it's a rather good game. But the community of players are so toxic. I have never played a game that was as toxic as the people who live and breath this game.
Negative,"If you like bugs that stick around and don't get fixed, hit this up. New paid content comes before fixing the game breaking bugs like doing a random dungeon, or partying with players."
Negative,"Fun until you reach the meta, stories range from bland filler to kinda good, grind is forgiving compared to others but in all its a dogshit elder scrolls game and a mediocre mmo"
Negative,"I normally don't write reviews. But I wanted to give a heads up to anyone considering buying this.1. This is a GREAT GAME, and more than worth the money.2. DO NOT buy this game through Steam. For some reason, Steam and Zenimax have a serious disconnect with playing the game and the game is constantly down for steam users, while non-steam users can play without issue. I love steam, they have great PC ecosystem, but Zenimax & Steam just seem to be a bad combination... (I'm guessing it's mostly Zenimax...)"
Negative,"FIrst and foremost, I love this game. I even purchase crowns and keep a sub in 6 month invervals. What I do not like, is that my friend purchased this for me as a gift on STEAM. STEAM has so many problems logging in, and random log outs. It's especially high after a recent patch.What's even worse is that you can't unlink your account from STEAM, as it's tied in for a log in. Anytime STEAM screws up, ESO screws up. Every time ESO is patched, STEAM screws up. STEAM makes it impossible to win with the new addition of daily log in bonus items (leading up to a monthly big item). How can you get the last item, if you can't log in?I highly recommend this game, but again, NOT ON STEAM. Thank you for your time."
Negative,"its a time waster in true mmo fashion, endless grind and artificial roadblocks, limited inventory space, etc. Everything feels like it has been created to waste the players time. Crafting especially. It has some interesting stuff like all the missions being voice acted, and random events in the open world, but all of them feel pointless, progression feels pointless, skills feel weak, group dungeons are a mess since everybody just rushes through them. So many thing to hate about this game, which is a shame because its world is quite interesting. If its the only game you will ever play, sure, i guess its worth it, but if you intend to try other things as well then you wont get much out of this game because you will get bored of it really fast."
Negative,"Well i never updated to morrowind since the login issue and delted the shadercooked file and never being in a dungeon again, broken now you give the DLC for 9 bucks when i paid 20 for the base game long ago.... i would buy DLC but what promises do i have that says it will fix this stupid ""there was an issue try again in a few minutes"" it was fun all the way up untill the friends glitch and now its all hell"
Negative,"I payed a full $60 for this game, and at first, I loved the game and I was hooked to it, then I ended up taking a break from it, later it comes to my attention that my buddy has purchased that game for $10. . . Cool, we can play together.BUT WAIT!*DUH DUH DUH DUH* THIS NIGGA GOT ALL THE DLC!?!?Don't buy in 2014, if you're smart buy it in 2018, thanks."
Negative,"Save your time, don't buy this garbage. It promotes gambling, wastes your time, and makes you pay for every minute interaction. They are worse than EA at this point. We can't even gift things to friends anymore.If something is FREE, then YOU are the product.Save your time, go outside touch grass, enjoy life. Games are no longer for players, They're designed to play us, farm us, no thanks.Don't make the same mistake as me. There's so much more to life then rotting away behind a screen for some peasants who don't give a solitary fxck about anything besides profit."
Negative,"If a car salesman were to sell you a car without the front passenger seat, the rear passenger seats, the radio, the car doors, the fenders and basically everything else that is not needed to allow the car to run. That salesman would be called a crook and forced to stop. Yet when Bethesda does something similar to one of their creations. Instead of them receiving an order to stop they are given the freedom to continue and to tell all their customers to take their complaints and shove them up their ass. It's things like this that stab the sense of aw and wonder to death before anyone can experience it. Which then results in another thing that big corporations try to shove down your throat with no repercussions to them. Starbreeze Studios had the opportunity to do the same damn thing that Bethesda did in Payday 2. Which is to charge the public for every little damn thing they created. And I'm not talkin' about a dollar or two. I'm talking about charging five dollars for one new gun, one dollar for a  paint combo, two dollars for a pattern and another five for a new mask. After one new gun and a fully customized mask, I would be down an additional $13 in addition to the $20-$30 I would have had to pay for a game with only 1-3 heists. However, god bless them, they decided that bundle would could have amounted to $50 worth of content into a $5 bundle. The point I am try to make is that Bethesda is no longer a company. It's a cancerous beast trying to vacuum up all your money will giving as little as possible in return."
Negative,"PSA: TL;DR Don't buy this game if you don't live in NA or EU.I really want to love this game. I've been playing MMO's since I could use the WASD keys to move and not the arrow keys. This game has such potential, it's just a buggy, laggy mess. Using 3rd party lag reduction programs do nothing to aid this either, and as it's combat is based on avoiding telegraphed aoe's on the ground with a very short window to actualy dodge, it's unplayable at anything over 150-200 ms.I'd drop WoW in a heartbeat if this game had an oce megaserver. As this game has thousands of hours of explorational play time, and much like every TES game, each charachter you make is unique and you have a massive level of freedom. What MMo's on the market let you break into some NPCs house and steal everything that's not nailed down to the floor? Or as a final FU to that one guy who only had cooking items in his locked chests, stealing everything out of his pockets?But as is, there are dropped frames everywhere. I'm running 2 1080 TI's SLI Bridged and consistantly my fps drops to below 15. Disconnects are frequent and oh god the lag. If I join dungeons, I either get an infinite loadscreen, or lag horribly. The best part is, I can make everyone ELSE in the dungeon lag also. I can break entire dungeons by just joining them when the stars arn't alligned and make everyone in the whole dungeon spike to over 10k ms. Which breaks dungeon mechanics. It's good fun."
Negative,LOOKING FOR PLAYERS
Negative,Para tuzağı non target çöp oyun. İndirimde bile almayın story sapığı bir malsanızda gidin skyrim oynayın ne buna para verceniz
Negative,"Huge game with great lore. The real problem was the subtle forcing to buy more backpack space after you have spent a long time to build your game. That might work for the uninitiated, but not to a veteran gameplayer who knows what is honest and respectable game building."
Negative,"Its bland, its boring and lifeless. Its mostly just button mashing and plagued by the usual problems of freemium games. Its full with in game purchases and as a new player you feel kinda lost. Not a great experience and certainly only Elder Scrolls in name only."
Negative,"This game does not respect your time at all. Waiting for an item research to be complete in 15 real days - that is cancer. That said, the quests are interesting, lore-respecting and !fully-voiced! so, putting the mmo-crap part aside, the game can be quite entertaining for elder scrolls fans."
Negative,"not sure whether to blame steam or ESO, but either way it needs double the storage space it suggests just to play it. I got past that issue then after playing 10 mins it crashed, and couldnt load that character again, so tried a new character and it crashed while creating it. waste of time"
Negative,"I've played the standard edition with Morrowind expansion. Take that as you will. My opinions can't touch the other three Major land DLC packs, however I feel that I can speak to the core of the game; which I found to be fun at first, but annoying and dull in the long run. The mechanics are okay as far as MMO goes, but it gets pretty dull if you aren't big on community game play. As a solo experience there are far better uses of your money. And frankly I think we should all give Bethesda's MMO the axe in order to drive Elder Scrolls Six development. Make a point. The story is fun, but the execution and game play get in the way of me being immersed in this fun and exciting world. I wish I didn't have to deal with multiple people online parading in their expensive and very lore breaking outfits/pets/power. It just ruins the chosen one experience and I can play Oblivion or Skyrim for that. This alone is enough to say the expansions are not worth playing. In short, the game is enjoyable, but only mildly, and it doesn't spark the sort of excitement I want from an Elderscrolls game. That's it."
Negative,"I wouldn't recommend this game at all. The gameplay is tacky, there is zero encouragement to interact with others, the movement and animations are uninteresting and overall it seems they spendt all their money on voice acting, rather than making a good game. If you're seeking a good MMO, I suggest you look elsewhere."
Negative,"Want more bag space? Give them money.Want to finish researching crafting in under a year? Give them moneyWant the ability to craft a cool looking set that isn't your race? Give them moneyThis game is balanced to make you want to spend money for convenience and you will feel the long monotonous grind if you choose not to pay for ESO+ or the crown store. On top of all of this, the gameplay is extremely average even for an MMO and objectively boring compared to previous Elder Scrolls games."
Negative,id rather have gay sex
Negative,great mmo and i love the story but game companies and companies in general are taking capitalism and consumerism way too far and especially in the middle of a pandemic where millions have died and for some reason nobody cares smhthe prices are just outrageous and price walling their content is shameless if i have a subscription i should have all the content not be price walled ontop of paying the subscription monthly
Negative,Laggy and deeply grindy. I can find so many more productive unpleasant things to do than spend hours farming mudcrabs for the antiquities system. The housing system is visually appealing but infuriating the way it is set up. You'll know what I mean when you get a fully functioning door without a doorway that you just can't line up correctly anyway. The crown store is downright predatory because it is so expensive.
Negative,"It requires around 100+GB to download, last time ive checked. Fine.But it requires another 100+GB to install & unpack itself into your main drive. and then re-pack itself into your actual steamapps folder... That is not fine.                                                                    Bughesda. Please fix"
Negative,"Very Disappointing...The good.Its Elder Scrolls, and it has all the perks of it, love the series! The races are just as you expect, awesome detail. You have classes now, but still have the ability to be a Sorcerer wearing Heavy Armor and a Greatsword if you want. So its every bit the Elder Scrolls you love! Perfect in that regard.The bad.Over crowded. The dungeons and world are free to roam, for everyone. So it can be hard and annoying trying to grind or just have the time to level abilities up with everyone jumping onto your bad guy and beating him down... There is no experience except the ""use of the skill"" type, and just because you hit the bad guy first does not make him your kill. You hit him once, a high level player will walk by and slap him down. So there you are only getting a couple of hits in on things here and there, makes leveling skills up super annoying. And with the over crowded, you are in a dungeon and five other people are there right on top of you, so same issue with all of them jumping in on your bad guy without you being able to do anything about it. I have tried to say fine, I will wait, let them move on, just wait for the respawn. Nope. More players are ready and waiting to take the place of any that might move on.So yeah, Elder Scrolls is just as awesome of a game as the single player ones previously. You guys make some seriously awesome stuff. :)  However, this online version is way too crowded and doesnt allow you any way of getting people off your kill, or from screwing up any fun that might be had.Sorry Elder Scrolls, but I would not recommend this one. Close off the dungeons to just the ones that enter it as solo or groups, and this game would be perfection! But as it is, way too over crowded for the leveling system in place. Way too annoying with everyone rushing in and just killing everything in sight, not even caring about other people trying to have fun..."
Negative,"I tried to like this game. What I found was it isn't remotely like the Elder Scrolls I want. It's a Zenimax MMO that cashes in on the aesthetic of TES without any consideration for what makes that universe so awesome. It sucks people in with the hype of ""explore the world with friends"" and immediately turns into a zombified grinding ritual devoid of clever storytelling or rewarding progression. Certainly zero impactful choice by design, you can't have a couple thousand heroes running around with different opinions shaping the world around them. I tried my hardest to swallow the MMO blackpill but what I realized is, the most annoying part of this game is trying to immerse myself in the atmosphere while a couple dozen Zoomer whales run in circles around wayshrines and quest-giving NPCs flexing their hideous anime bullshit pets and flashy outfits they bankrupted their parents for. I can never get used to seeing this crap in what is attempting to be perceived as the Elder Scrolls universe."
Negative,"The game itself is amazing, if you are patient enough to get through the bullshit of setting up and waiting 7 years for their teams to send you an e-mail response for a simple ""one time"" password (that I've had to undergo a few times already). Sadly, I deleted this game only because of the incompetency of the monkeys at the customer service cubicles."
Negative,I've had nothing but problems with this game. Creating a new character is always an adventure in frustration as it doesn't let me make any choices. Installed and uninstalled the game numerous times but the problems persist. What a waste of time.
Negative,Game is more milked than GTA.
Negative,Can't say I found a whole lot to do. Nice that they let me be racist to bosmer though.
Negative,"So I definitely tried it but maaan its looks so boring and dull the gameplay  is so outdated...,I felt like I was playing a *Risen* style game.(I was only 20-30 min in the game). Its laughable for them to try to sell it for 30 euros(for me) yet alone the gold version pfff pls stop Bethesda, I wont play this even for free. Even the old oblivion engine feels 10x better than this. Good thing you did put it free cause I was going to buy it..,would have been one the biggest mistake in my life. And I'm a huge Bethesda fan I have all of them. People don't buy it its not worth it save your money. Guild Wars 2 is 100x better in term of worth buy it and be happy. :)"
Negative,"I'd go into an in depth review of why I don't recommend this game but honestly I don't want to put any more time than I already have into this, at 5.3k hours all I can say is while the devs are sending out content for this game it really feels as if they don't care about it at all, with the changes they have made to the combat and forcing people into one playstyle, I just don't want to waste time on it anymore, if you want to play this game and ONLY casually play, then do so, you will have a great time, as long as you're not doing the sane 4/5 quest types all of the time which is great, at least they offer more than one quest type. which is more than I can say for other games but if you get into end game be very careful, it can kill your love for the game.Almost 3 years later and I still have not returned, nice owo"
Negative,Necromancer is locked behind a micro transaction separate from buying the different editions of the game.
Negative,"an mmorpg that doesn't let you coop the main campaign missions... utter failure , practicly destroys the whole dam game for us."
Negative,"The reviews are true. NEVER buy this game on steam. You will have login issues that do not apply to other places. I don't understand why steam (the biggest gaming platform) would have login issues where no other platforms do. Super frustating, spend 100$ and upgraded to eso plus and I cannot even play because im launching through steam."
Negative,"I've put many hours into this game. I've been playing for the last 8 months. It has a lot of content to delve into. It can be fun, but it also has many features that are bugged/broken. That's normal in programming. However, game-breaking bugs take literal months for a fix to be pushed out. Sometimes they never put a fix out. Many things have been broken for years.There are instances where they will ""test"" new DLCs on their test server, but when a game-breaking bug is discovered and mass-reported, they ignore it and push the DLC release to the live server before even fixing said bug. The latest example would be skill points completely disappearing and not being returned to the player. They took a month to fix that bug, AFTER it was pushed to live, so I guess it was close to two months total since they were aware of it. They took another two months before they even returned the missing skipp points to players. These things happen ALL THE TIME.The server they use for Cyrodiil PvP is so riddled with lag, it's a sad, sad joke. I know what you're thinking - maybe it's on my end. No. Even if you didn't know it was common knowledge about the server lag, you can tell by the way all player entities behave in the zone. When groups of enemy players are dancing around each other, with no skill executing, but looking like everyone is trying to kill each other without anything actually happening, you KNOW it's because we are all experiencing the same lag. It's the server. Then you have to take into account how imbalanced some builds are in PvP. If 20-30 players are beating on a single enemy player and said player is not dying, and this fight lasts 5-10 minutes, sometimes longer, before everyone finally gets tired and gives up, something isn't right.When exploits are utilized in real time, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get a gamemaster to show up and catch the exploitive player in the act. If you try to report said player, they respond by email a day later (if you're lucky, sometimes they never respond) and request more evidence like screenshots/video recordings, etc. If you happen to have said evidence and submit it, they still ignore it and nothing happens. The player involved doesn't get banned. A fix is never patched in. I've never even seen a gamemaster in the last year. There seems to be zero staff presence. You're essentially going throughout the world of Tamriel with no supervision, and can pretty much do whatever you want and get away with it. It's pathetic.Every piece of content this game has to offer is bugged/broken to a lesser/greater extent. The more I play, the more I realize that the quality control is abysmal. The more I play, the more I am convinced that ZOS does not care about the players. They do not care about fixing anything. They are really good at putting out new content, but they are equally good at making sure it's broken when released, and maybe not ever getting fixed. Their goal seems to be ""keep releasing flashy content so we can sap more money from these unsuspecting fools."" I could go on and on, but this is already too long of a review. The point is, I'm extremely disappointed. I've been feeling this way for months, and the disappointment continues to grow. This could have been a great game, but it is riddled with neglect. Hey, it's pretty, though. Because that matters, or something.I just can't recommend this to anyone. I'm actively looking for another game that interests me to feed my addiction. If you have any other game, play that. This one is a waste of time."
Negative,"I bought this game a few years ago on XBox and then PC.  Between those platforms, I have approximately 3000 hours play time.   It's got a great story along with all the side quests.  The chat and community are interestingly funny.  I'm good by the way.  Really good.  Questing is fun in first person point of view.  But it will make you sick after a while the POV needs to be like 200.The main issues with the game are related to the company's inability to respond to the actual bugs.  Small bugs like my sword appearing at my feat and flames produced from nowhere.  Open War - PVP has a major issue where 20+ people gang up in groups and go outpost to outpost capturing.   If you're in the gang everything works fine but if you are at the forts getting attacked, you die.   1vX is when a youtube/twitch hero arranges a play night with his guild of 20 (bros, dudes, friends, bras wtf).  He begins recording and bouncing around while they casually throw a few skills at him occasionally chasing him around a fort.Raids is more dottz,  if you can 1 2 3 4, spin, shake, and clicky-clicky to make a tool say you got 66,000 points of damage per second then this one guild will take you for a spin.  Also you can randomly find people that will just take you for a school bus adventure.The problem overall with this game is that the company is too busy developing new expansions to stop and fix the problems I've already mentioned.   They fix things that the community didn't ask for.  Team queuing for Battlegrounds - another PVP game type - was removed.  Constant tweaks are made to gear and classes.  Would you shop at a store with a 6% discount?  Keep that question in your mind.  Spell costs 3800 points to cast:  3800 x 0.06 = 228.   So a 228 point reduction with a 6% discount.  They got youtubers babeling about how that adds up.  Controls are barbaric,  playing this game with a keyboard and regular mouse is a gymnastic nightmare of finger crossing.   How good are you at pressing 1 + rmb + 2 + lmb + 3 + ~ + double tapping F for respects because you now have a sprain wrist.I've played for years!  I'm not a Fairy Tail Fire Dragon Wizard nor do I feel like one.  The music in the game does make you feel like you are in the guild!   I like playing Metallica when I used to play.  I don't play any longer.Conclusion,  this game is an old girl/boy/it-friend that shunned you until she/he/it found out you have a few bucks.  All his/her/its' friends had you believing you had a prize when you ultimately did not.  She/he/it is the type that you find in the bathroom with a cigarette or something else hanging from her lips, passed out on the toliet talking to some new she/he/it possibly with a needle in his/her/it's arm.   It's that bad like baddest of bad.  You'll be up at 2am just screwing around with different gear and skill combinations to impress .... noone.Bonus:The inventory is lame.  Crafting requires a subscription  Gear-score game should never be purchased.I own a merchant and a banker.  I had a sub for a while and I still didn't have enough space for the junk."
Negative,So far I cannot play the game and customer support is down.  People have said that ESO is not great and this seems to be confirming that theory.  I will post something more when/if I can actually play the game.
Negative,20 hours authorization does not work!
Negative,Boring and repetitive.
Negative,Combat is so incredibly bad that it ruins what would probably be the second best MMO on the market right now.
Negative,"pay to win is too much in this game. first. to play most(all) events u must have bought summerset.the event now witches festival requires summerset to particuate in the event.u get 1 ticket per day(need 40 for mount) event is not 40 days ofcourse. so if u buy clockwerkcity ddlc or morrowind u get 3 tickets per day instead of 1... so if u dont get mad from this u can enjoy the game. for me its annoying as i HAD TO BUY Summerset TO GET ""FREE Villa,FREE mount,FREE pet.well.. enjoy buying this"
Negative,"So Im sitting here with a game that wont and cant install. Reading through the page of the damn shop site it says ""have 85 gb storage for the game so I deleted a lot of shit and at nearly ""50gb"" out of ""59gb"" it my computer wants to trash old windows for some more space for this game even though I had 110 Gigabytes ready for download. This is the 3rd time I have tried. Apprarently ESO is only for how it looks in the library"
Negative,"Server infrastructure has experienced a lot of down time to fix bug or server instability in recent months. In addition to this, the game developers chose the megaserver approach, which I have found to be pretty awful experience as someone in Oceania connecting to the NA Megaserver.My friends have found it more tolerable, but to me has felt like a joke it has seemed like a joke considering this game has nearly been around for almost 10 years now. Especially comparing it to other similar games like Final Fantasy 14.Bugs that were present in 2021 when I played this the first time are still present and can be very disruptive to fundamental elements of gameplay.End game content is good with friends, did not have a good time prior to Update 40 doing trials if playing alone."
Negative,"A good MMO, but still bad. I've put nearly 100 hours into this game, and honestly... I wouldn't recommend it to a new player. The game itself is pretty awesome- it has a cool story, beautiful world, and fun content! (Though pretty pay to progress/win with some of the microtransactions). The problem is the power curve... It makes any PVP basically impossible, unless you'd like to make this game your new career, as there are a large portion of people who are level 810, with their characters min-maxed to all hell. Which would be fine (As PVP isn't always a main attraction), but due to the way scaling in this game works, the newer content in the game is ""balanced"" for those level 810 players, while the old vanilla content is trivially easy. So, you end up in a position of choosing between mind-numbingly easy dungeons, quests, ect.... Ooooor getting absolutely destroyed by the newer content in PVE, and high level players in PVP. I can only suggest you get this game if you are a very hardcore player looking for a new mainstay. If you're a casual, or even relatively dedicated gamer, unfortunately I've gotta say...  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."
Negative,"Started to get really into the game and enjoyed the quests and storyline as I do all the Elder Scrolls games, all the while wondering if my internet was just having hiccups only when i would play this gamet. Nope. They don't have any servers to accomodate players from Australia. It makes it near impossible to compete competitively against other players in PvP scenarios which is a pretty big part of the game towards the end, especially in dungeons."
Negative,"Typical copy paste MMORPG content, doesn't have the feel of an actual Elder Scrolls game."
Negative,its too far from mmo
Negative,will not run even after repair game files or even reinstalling
Negative,its quite soulless but some fun writing and not a bad thing to do with friends over pandemic
Negative,It's no SkyrimA lot of pay-to-playI am but a humble smith...not investing real money in a make believe world though.
Negative,"EDIT:Lol, the developer reply linked me to a ""monthly update"" style post where the last update was May 2020, and it said that they aren't going to be updating the community monthly progresson statement on fixing things anymore...The other link was to a forum post about removing AOE spells in Cyrodil PVP, which was a universally hated changed to apply a band-aid ""fix"" to lag, that also wasn't effective. It is also from July 2020.The only way for these jokers to stop is to stop giving them money.ORIGINAL:quite grindy. (180 days of improving your mount by 1 percent (character based), veteran dlc dungeon queue unlocked at level 350, etc)the majority of quests are uninspired fodder and are, at times, painful (there's a quest to rotate prisms to direct light as a ""puzzle"", but there is only one obvious path for the light to go, every prism needs to be rotated multiple times, and they take ~5 seconds to rotate after you push the button)pve is stale; classes have very similar rotations (buff up, throw up a few DoTs, spam). all enemies in the open world can be killed with your eyes closed pressing one aoe skill.gambling loot boxes with extremely low drop rates for real money. predatory cash store overall. $100.00 for an in-game house. $1.00~ for a 1% mount bonus (up to 180) long-standing, seemingly actively ignored bugs. (no dev reply to forum posts on certain bugs for months/years)loading screens are frequent and long.  having an expensive computer and playing from an SSD doesn't change much.pvp lag/desync has been an issue for years. minute game information, such as enchantment and poison cooldowns, how armor sets interact, etc, is hard to come by, partially due to different dev teams hodge-podging their work together over the life of this game.  i bought this game to be a healer in pve.  healers aren't needed in the base game.  you have to grind for hundreds of hours to access content, behind a paywall, where a healer is needed."
Negative,"If you live In Australia or anywhere that isn't the United States or in Europe. Save yourself the hours of asking yourself if you can fight the lag or if it really matters. Because i can tell you now you can't fight the lag and it really matters. I got all the way to max level and almost to 160 CP just to be 1 shot in PVP and get constantly DC'ed. Because of my connection I realise now i will never be able to properly experience endgame content or feel i am performing to the best of my ability. Most of the time i can deal with the delay in abilities when doing solo content, but when DPS really matters i feel like a newborn who doesn't even know how to suck a tit. The complete lack of server diversity i find extremely annoying as at least 50 percent of people i encounter also say they are not located in the region the 2 mega-servers are located. The combat is terrible for anyone located outside these servers. Especially considering the meta in this games combat system requires ""weaving"" aka animation cancelling with a light attack in between each ability. This is extremely hit or miss with high ping and feels absolutely broken. sluggish, unresponsive and utter fucking shite. The Lack of achievable mounts in this game also really comes as a downfall as grinding and working your way to mounts in games such as wow are a real status symbol and creates a feeling of desire and community seeing what other players have achieved. This game decides to hide all of the coolest mounts behind loot boxes. Yes, Loot boxes. The most toxic shit ever put into a game. There is legit less than 20 achievable mounts in the game. only 2 of them are actually cool and the rest are all re-skins of the same 2 mounts. Whilst on the topic of micro-transactions. There's a fuckload. Some even for basic things like extra slots of save costume presets in. None are necessary, but it makes the entire game feel disingenuous in my opinion. Especially as one micro-transaction is to buy a 10 days worth of speed training for your mount, therefore spending money to skip in game time gating. As mount speed isn't account bound. i see this as a greedy move. The game requires you to buy the base game which is fair enough. its cheap and there are many hours of content here. However my problem is with the optional monthly subscription. This isnt a problem in itself but by buying this you get access to some monthly crowns to spend in the in game shop, the  (((( C r a f t  B a g )))) and access to dlc content. However, you dont get access to the most recent DLC. Thus making it if you want to experience the latest content and ALSO be able to experience the LITTLE BIT OLDER CONTENT you need to both by the expansion and the monthly subscription. The craft bag, isnt exactly pay to win. Its more pay not to be fucking annoyed. As it saves all your crafting items in one spot so you dont need to constantly sort through what is relevant material. making ESO plus almost a necessity for anyone who wants to craft, as there is limited inventory and bank space. Another gripe as someone coming for WOW is that there seems to be a lot less of a add-on community, as most addons are outdated or buggy and there just generally isn;t that much variety. For example, It was impossible for me to find an addon that would allow me to lower the opacity of my HUD despite finding a SINGLE addon that SAID it would allow this.If you want to just buy the base game for the story content, that's fine. as an MMO the quest system is actually super good in terms of quality and voice acting. Every quest does seem like a genuine story. However i cant recommend this as a single player game would probably still be more entertaining than an MMO in this regard. Also i should mention the the game puts a CP level 10 player in the same PVP battlegrounds as a CP level 800 player.... enough said.... overall i think its clear to say i give this game a 10/10. Would play again"
Negative,"ABSOLUTELY FULL OF BUGS. You get disconnected ALL the time and it's not because of your internet connection it's because of STEAM, and also the GAME. Really sad because if not it would be a great game."
Negative,"Stale combat, unimpresive graphics with lacking design and atmosphere, rather bland story combined with a stale questline makes for a pretty lackluster experience. If you want a good mmo experience with a focus on story I'd recommend Final Fantasy 14, if you prefer grinding and perhaps PvP, I'd suggest world of warcraft. This game I would never suggest anybody to play."
Negative,"the single player experience is quite well. the voicing the story the immersion it is all there as expected of the creators of elder scrolls. what fails in elder scrolls is generally gameplay or direction but here it was handled well in both departments. but I gotta say that I am in no way a max level or late-game player in this game so take it as appropriate.although most of what makes this game it is, is good we still have to acknowledge that this is not a single player game and it should be regarded as an mmo-rpg not a single player game. if you have the drive to play just another single player elder scrolls game this game is absolutely for you. but you should also take into consideration that most of the lore is inconsequential and that is not a matter of grandeur. there are very much grandeur but the story will act as though that simply did not happen in every other place in the story. so yeah...as an mmorpg I watched some reviews telling of how much of a many trap this is and all the ways in which the game forces you to at least get the subscription and they do so by putting very simple stuff that is available in any other rpg behind paywalls I obviously didn't appreciate that then I told myself hey THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT MADE THE ELDER SCROLLS :D so yeaaaaaaaaahhh.............................it is good but it is a bethesda game in the end. I don't know the role of zenimax in this equation but seeing what I saw it is also inconsequential."
Negative,"Customer service is worse than steam customer service. no help at all for anything, been working with them for days not being able to access my home, nothing but more trouble accessing accounts. premium user here. dont spend the money. genuinely hope this ruines their bottom line with how bad this has been for me. BUYER BEWARE! If not resolved quickly, might need to reconsider my sub. V is still good. VI can wait till sale. not interested if the company doesnt care to keep the game playable. Recent update has me (unreliably) able to access my home, but now I have random crashes to desktop with no error about once an hour. can't play with any kind of seriousness and based on what I am seeing in forums this is not a new issue for a lot of people."
Negative,"I personally probably would of liked the game besides the micro transactions. But the install time is to long. After you install the launcher 85gbs worth of downloading, You will be faced with a couple more hours for the updates to install. Which can easily go over steams refund policy making it difficult for you to refund if you do not like the game. I personally didnt take the risk of that happening as if i disliked the game I would want to refund it. I have fast internet but i also got other family on it at once so it makes it difficult to install it at a stable quick speed. Cheers to those who like the game im sure its great. I cant say the gameplay is good or bad do to i havent gotten a chance to play it. I will just stick to fallout 4, skyrim, and swtor for now.I will leave comments open in this review for those who have played the game to leave comments on the gameplay! As my review is mainly only for the installation of the game and not the gameplay!"
Negative,Wish it had Achievements
Negative,"Was considering finally diving fully into ESO this winter but with Tanlorin I will never support this game. Starfield had more than enough of that slop, and now it's infecting TES. RIP Bethesda."
Negative,"I cant even play the game, it says my firewall is blocking the servers."
Negative,"I *feel* like I played over 600 hours of this game, but I didn't even make it to max level. The inventory management absolutely sucks the life out of the game. You have to pay to make the problem temporarily go away, and who knows how much more you have to pay to just get ""enough"" inventory room? It makes me miserable. Other than that, it's a cool game I guess."
Negative,This is by far the easiest game I've played in a long time and i seek a challenge. I tried to endure this mindless combat for 11 hours and can't anymore. I'm not going to put in 100 hours in order to find a challenge in this game.
Negative,I've been playing for over 500 hours and while the story is quite interesting it is difficult for a new player to do in any kind of order for a first time playing without some kind of external guide which leads to a lot of missed dialogue options. I've also found the combat system to be a bit clunky with having to constantly swap between two bars to get the most out of your chosen weapon(s). This by far has been my biggest turn-off for the game as a whole.
Negative,"This game is just a money machine using the good name of the elder scrolls franchise as crutches. Dont trust this ""betheda"" or should i say zenimax, the coorptate a-holes who  exploit the weak minded and stupid for profit. Unlike their cousins betheda game studios they do not care for us or the quality of their games, only money."
Negative,"Yeah, not anymore, shame."
Negative,just play skyrim please
Negative,Game does not get past the launcher. Launcher freezes at 1% and them crashes. Tried everything and still could not get it to work.
Negative,"90 gb with all these bugs and same animations, fuck i was more mad about the fact that it occupied 90 gb than spending 10 dollars on it, this looks mostly like a 10 gb game, fuck this shit, im out refund"
Negative,"Bethesda/Zennimax has turned this game into absolute shit. After 2 years of playing, i found my account banned for using the name Jon Bone Jovi, marked as in some moronic way in violation with their code. Probably a monkey can do a better job than their support. So do i recommend this game? Fuck no"
Negative,"The point I will be trying to make is ""I love this game, but I HATE how easy it is - for the most part"".Just a little bit about myself, so you know where I'm coming from. I played a good bit of WoW back in the day, and I will be comparing it to ESO. I've been playing ESO since ""year 2"", so not right from the start, but I am a pretty old player. By now I have 14 max lvl characters, completed all dungeons and some trials. I am not a good player, but not bad either. I understand the mechanics and abilities, but I'm bad at weaving.With that out of the way, let's get started:2) The overland / questingThe overland difficulty since ""One Tamriel"" has been boringly easy. It used to be decent before everything was scaled. I liked the chance, it's great to roam anywhere, but ever since then, questing is outright boring (combat-wise).To prove this, I've done 2 ""experiments"". Two handicapped characters that still breeze through quests with little to no challenge: a hand-crafted-gear-only guy - that doesn't bother to raise his crafting too much, I'm lvl 20 (low, sure) and still using some lvl 6-8 items, with no class abilities - so just using weapon abilities exclusively. And another hand-to-hand guy (no weapons, so obviously no weapon skills) that uses any item that drops above green (so any time I get an item I use it, no build or focus). I didn't reach lvl 50 yet, but I have no problem at all running through quests with these guys. Some ""bosses"" can be a bit of a challenge, but considering how I handicapped myself, I should have a lot more than a challenge.I remember many years ago the first time doing the fighter's guild quests and facing a harvester (the ""naga""-like lady summoning some orbs). A decent fight, I had her down 50% when she summoned the orbs, which I ignored, they got back to her, and healed her back 100%. Wow, ok, so that's the mechanic. I LEARNED something, and had to ADAPT. Good game design there. And very useful to know for future dungeons I would run. Great stuff. Nowdays, fighting one of these is completely unremarkable. So as I fought one with my unarmed character, I have her down at 30-40% when she summons the orbs. I can kill her without her mechanic kicking in, but I want to see how much they heal if they make contact again. It was... maybe 10%. I guarantee most new players won't figure out the special mechanics going on here, if they even get to trigger. Mechanics you will need to know for later dungeons. Bad design, due to the difficulty now being too trivial.This was just an example, but it applies to basically everything. In WoW, most world enemies had some mechanics. Neat, good bit of diversity, often requiring you to play around - enemies might pull others, stun, silence, debuff, different little quirks you might need to adapt to, or laugh to yourself ""ha ha, I don't care about this"" - as your mage gets -20 strength. Is the same in ESO? I honestly don't know. I've been playing for many years, and the harvester is one of the very few NPC mechanics I am aware of. Sure, we have some that summon an ad, temporarily stealth/move around, but NOTHING that requires you to adapt. Every single fight can be won by ""face enemy, click mouse, click numbers"". There MAY be some flavour, like some doing an aoe attack, heavy attacks, spells, which you are supposed to dodge or block, but even if you don't, they are so weak, it doesn't matter. The mechanics are in place and are ok (not good mind you, they are extremily few and not very creative, but they aren't terrible) - they are just SOO insignificant.It doesn't matter if you get hit. It doesn't matter if you don't understand your skills. It doesn't matter if you plan your fight ahead. You never need to bother with stealth/avoiding enemies. Just faceroll the keyboard enough, you'll win.World bosses are ok. A decent challenge and generally require decent gear to in order to solo, or otherwise require a group. And they're not ""mandatory"", so they're just fine. Thumbs up.3) Normal DungeonsDungeons are stupid easy. And I don't mean delves, which are mostly meant to be soloed. Or public dungeons, also meant to be done pretty much solo (which by the way, used to be quite cool once upon a time. They could be done solo with a bit of skill and random gear, they were FUN. Now all dungeons are boringly easy.Today, nobody says anything (and why would they?). Tank? There's no tank, who needs one? Maybe a guy with taunt, idk. Healer...? There might be a guy with an aoe heal? But we all take so little damage, it doesn't matter. Boss does his aoe attack.... nobody bothers to dodge. It hits us for 10% max hp max. It's much more important to stay in there and deal that sweet sweet dps. Boss dies in less than 30 seconds, didn't even get to do his other special attack. Party leaves, endeavor checked, daily checked, we choo choo onward.Not only is this not fun, we didn't plan, we didn't adapt, we didn't overcome, we didn't chat, but.... we didn't learn. VERY bad game design.4) Veteran DungeonsThis is one I've seen many, many posts about. Noobs fake queuing as tanks in vet dungeons. Or people not knowing the mechanics in general. And I'm here to defend them.How would they? If you read the above, you see how most normal dungeons go. There's absolutely NO challenge. Why not queue as a tank to get one done quicker? Honestly, there's no reason. And indeed people don't mind if you're a noob tank in there, because it doesn't matter. So must people run through those and breeze through everything, having learned nothing and rightfully figuring out ""well, this is too easy. Guess I'm ready for the harder difficulty then"" - and join for Veteran.And what do you know, Veteran is hard. Say hello to the boss one-hitting you if you don't dodge, longer fights where all stages of a mechanic play out, and if you were a damage dealer with 7% in a normal dungeon and nobody cared but now join for a veteran... But how is a player supposed to know? The jump from normal to veteran is WAY too steep. You go from ""I didn't notice the boss hit me"" to ""the boss killed me in one shot"". From ""I had no idea that enemy had a special attack"" to ""if you don't address this special attack in this specific way, you die"". There is no learning curve, just one big step. You'd have to either solo dungeons (group dungeons that is) and take your time to figure things out, but even that can be misleading since you won't gauge the power of an attack properly (ah so the boss has a heavy attack, but it's not so bad, only took like 5% of my health if I didn't block - but then it one-shots you in vet), or... run But you still have the big design problem that people won't KNOW when they are ready for veteran. In WoW when you can reliably do normals with no wipes and no ""risk"" of wipes, you can try heroics (don't get me started on how even if they have 5 players, individual contribution is more visible and significant there than it is here - separate rant on that some other time). By the same standard, here my weaponless character can go do veteran the second he hits 50, because I can do normals with him and boy they are easy.I could go on, but this is already way too long. I've been having this frustrating with this game for years now and just had to vent. I love this game. But it's just so easy that I can't enjoy most of it anymore. I like the little things, the questing. But it's nothing more than ""go there, click things"". I like to be challenged, I like to adapt, I like to feel that I'm overcoming difficulty, learning, improving, and feel good about myself for doing so.With the current difficulty balance, I don't feel any of these while playing ESO for 90% of the content I run (questing and normal dungeons), and that's sad.I really wish the devs wouldn't design for a dog hitting its face on the keyboard to complete all content - and I honestly believe that is the case right now. Congrats on reading through all this."
Negative,"While not being a huge mega fan of MMOs, I have and will continue to enjoy the genre. However, I beg anybody who is considering this ""game"" (and I use that term loosely) to stay far away, as there are vastly better MMOs out there that are massively more rewarding. While I dont have 9k hours like some of the other players, at literally 5 hours in, the gameplay presented itself as if i'd pretty much experienced literally everything it has to offer. This game is the most gruelling game I have ever experienced. The combat felt egregious for a game that has had the opportunity of decades of franchise refinement and innovation, yet it regresses 30 years of industry betterment. The spells and almost everything about fighting was distasteful and just flat out boring and unrewarding. Every enemy was the same no matter how far you go, every city felt the exact same and all the bosses and big mobs were just not interesting. I literally can not give the combat any points if i tried. I want to say the story was interesting but I'd be lying out of my ass that the first 10 minutes of story went somewhere. After that point I could not be assed to read a single line more and any time I payed attention to the story nothing of importance was ever being said. The entirety of the story itself and pacing was a snoozefest as everything felt like a big fetch quest. I know fetch quests are a staple of the genre as most MMO developers could not make a new style of quest or piece of story that strays far from which, but man, is was boring. Charging players for extra ""story"" is just a scam above scams. The constant P2W model is just a slap in the face of the entirety of the industry as a whole. Not only do you have to buy the game, but you also have to buy dogshit DLCs to even experience the rest of the story. Its 100% fine for a game to have DLC, especially one who is over half a decade old. But there is a difference between having a DLC or two, and spitting in the mouths of the players to also have a subscription model intertwined within the game as well. A subscription towards a game makes sense financially for a studio but cant ever be rewarded as it milks players every month even if you dont play for a month. In recent years a skin model for a game is no surprise, but having 3 different revenue streams to milk the ever living shit out of the whales AND a skin system is a joke. The skin system would be no issue if the game was free. I completely understand games need to make money but this is just flat out embarrassing. I personally would rather take $1000 each month and burn it, than continue playing this game. I'd loosely say its worse than the casino that is counter strike these days but thats like comparing two piles of cow shit and asking which smells better. I beg anyone who is even slightly considering the game to just find something better. I'm saving your time. If you love love love any Elder Scrolls game and want more content, just replay them because this aint it.1/10 because the cut-scenes were kinda cool i guess?"
Negative,"They have the worst maintenance service in all industry. Someone at Zenimax thinks that making maintenance on Saturday during 4 hours that is a great idea - who cares. After almost every maintenance patch steam players from Europe cannot login and they have to wait a day, maybe two before they fix it (and this problem continue to happen not the first year!!)"
Negative,"Let me be clear that I love the Elder Scrolls Online game, and in general I have no issues with Steam, but the two of them combined are not working out well. There have been multiple times now where everyone who bought the game directly from the Zios has been able to play while those of us purchasing it through Steam have been locked out of the game. Feel free to buy the game and enjoy it, just don't do it through Steam."
Negative,"doesn't even make any sense considered buying this game , for a poor MMO experience awful mechanics , graphics .if you really want to pay for month just to play a single game go buy world of warcraft instead at least have brand recognition"
Negative,"connection timed out. cant login for 12~hours, dungeon finder broke 2 times. JUST IN 3 DAYS FOLKS. Go play what you came from, wow - gw 2 even metin2-knight online"
Negative,"ESO has been my main for a long time. You could check on my playtime for that.ZOS banned me twice just because they were updating thier algorithm or someting, and restored my account 2 or 3 weeks later, which resulted in my missing out festival event. What did I got for compensation? NOTHING. Not even a free apology.It's not accurate to say ZOS treat loyal players as garbage, because we don't get recycled.-------------------The ESO is phenomenal per se, and it cured me of my heartbreak syndrome years ago.Personally,I regard it as one of the best MMOs I've ever played. Almost every NPC has his/her own dialogues and voices, and the whole scene might change because of what you've done--just as what you experience in an amazing singleplayer game(the Elder Scrolls Skyrim, for instance). Besides, the story, main quests or side quests, are all fantastic. The depth of NPC characters is also complete and profound. For e.g., you may encounter an NPC you’ve once helped in another storyline or at some place with their acknowledgment for what you had done and their chitchat concerning a follow-up development of that story. All those features absorb me into this game for a long time.But ZOS, the team running the game, keeps breaking my heart that ESO once healed. Back to December, 2019. My account was banned for no reason, so I submitted a ticket and, more than a week later, they lifted the ban with an automatically modelled reply. The thing is that I missed the monthly login reward without any compensation even without an apology. Nope. Nothing.Until recently, the same thing happened again. This time I missed the Jester double-exp event due to their frivolous banning spree. While it’s important to remove those player involved in cheats/bots/RMT, it’s of vital significance to protect the player base from being accidentally injured by the banning algorithm at the moment.Speaking of player base, there is something worse than that: they treat their long-time players like garbage. The more time you devote to the game, the more precipitous fantacies you will experience. It’s good to keep a game vigorous and alive, but they go to another extreme: they treat the game as in its BETA and your previous efforts just go to Oblivion. Sometimes I wonder if some Ubi agent has sneaked in to perform massive Ubish nerfs and changes.I've been a subscriber for more than 2 years(basically a few months form where I'd started), and I do hope the game gets better. However, I can’t recommend it now. It may be appealing to new players, but if they choose to stay, they will turn veteran players someday."
Negative,My worst enemy in this game... Trying to log in
Negative,games terrible all it does its crash and the gameplay is really boringand filled with micro transactions when it wants 2 work
Negative,Can't even get into the game. Neverending loading screens after many restarts on a PC that shouldn't have any problems running it.
Negative,"Timeout Lord is not a class, i'd be level 95486938 by now otherwise.(/wave to Dr Who fans)"
Negative,could be worse i guess
Negative,"This is a multiplayer game. If you want this game to play it solo you will get rekt. There are so many items and you never have enough inventory slots or bank slots to keep them all. I've spent 43 hours on it so far and am still trying to figure it all out, but I'm done it's too much and all the bosses just destroy me. Traveling in the map is slower than slow, you're eventually given a horse that runs as fast as you do. It's lame.... sooo lame. And getting help from google is pointless. Every person who is into this game is a total nerd, like the ones that dress up and go to the role playing dungeons and dragons or whatever those things are called. EOS is like a 400+ hour game just to get to a decent level... YAWN. Oh and if you ever need a game that will put you to sleep playing it, this is that game."
Negative,This game doesn't deserve a no.... But it doesn't deserve a yes either... What am I doing here?
Negative,i just dont like it
Negative,"The most impressive thing about this game is how it manages to have worse, less impactful combat than Morrowind."
Negative,"I've never seen such little effort put into a game in my life. I cannot believe I'm about to say this, but I'd rather play Skyrim, AGAIN..."
Negative,"If You do not Pay, Do not Play.The bonuses to the premium players are substancial. On the otherhand, one may say, the base players are pretty much paying to not have the basic stuff every other game actively gives you.Money Grabbing Walking Simulator."
Negative,I've been playing MMO's for about 15 years and honestly the best part is being able to group up and play with your friends. They recently updated pvp battlegrounds so you have to solo queue. TAKES THE POINT OUT OF THE GAME COMPLETELY. I uninstalled as fast as I could.
Negative,"Alluring at first until you hit end game and slowly start to realize how unbalanced the game is and how much worse each patch digs a deeper grave for end game play. Terrible queue times for dungeons and pvp, dead end ""cosmetic"" end game, constant grinding to get new gear sets that heavily impact game balance each patch. NOPE, I'm out."
Negative,"This game was like an MMO if you took away literally all of the parts that made an MMO appealing to the majority of gamers, and left over a bunch of goofy artifacts of the genre that you don't even care about. You know, like weirdly scaling things and numbers inflating, hugely uninteresting quests, and stale gameplay.The truest sense of a themepark MMO, because there is no actual difficulty you can experience. Unless you deliberately cripple yourself there is no challenge to be had. Maybe this changes when you're at the very end-est game, but from what I experienced everything scales up to you and compensates you in the event that you're weak.I've played a lot of MMO's and this one is the one that makes me the saddest."
Negative,"too safe of a game, too much pay to play"
Negative,waste of time waste of energy waste of money trash story trash quests glitches in story missing and the game is exist for more then 10 years
Negative,"cant play in australia doesnt connect to servers, wish i knew that before i bought it :))))))))"
Negative,"Go to place A, press E, talk to Person B, Press E, Kill 2 enemies, press E, Go to place C, Talk to person D, Press E, etc...."
Negative,"Broke my mouse during a vet arena, shit game"
Negative,"Actually pretty good, but my negative review is because they REFUSE to implement oceanic servers. They refuse to implement oceanic servers because ""there aren't enough oceanic players"", but there aren't enough oceanic players because they refuse to implement oceanic servers. You're owned by Microsoft now, harness some of their f-ing servers.If you live in NA or EU this review doesn't apply, the game likely runs fine and is very fun - especially with a good guild."
Negative,"This game needs a Meh rating.  I'm not a hater or fan boy of this game.  Merely has aspects that I both enjoy and do not enjoy.  Problem is neither outweighs the other.  If you want story, this game has it in droves.  If you want unique gameplay with spells and actions that aren't reskins of others, adios.  I haven't played an MMO of any kind in a while, but I did play this and WoW for many years.  I've often said that if Blizzard could dev the mechanics and Bethesda/Obsidian could dev the story it'd be crack.  I guess where the game tips the edge to No to me on is the crafting.  Unless you pay the monthly sub, it's pointless to take crafting.  You simply won't have the bag space.  Now I'm not against paying a monthly sub.  I've done it for this game.  Unfortunately the crafting system is bland.  Do a daily for each, get a skill up.  The vast majority of what you make will serve no purpose to you or anyone else until high levels.  It's a long tedious grind and the payoff just isn't really there.If all you care about is story and don't care that you're just pressing buttons to kill with little to no strategy in mind, this game might scratch the itch.  But then comes another problem.  Other players.  If I'm playing a game for a story, I want a single player game, not an MMO.  Seeing players with dumb names run across is like when your little brother would crash your D&D game wanting to play X-Men and be wolverine in your game.  Just ruins it."
Negative,"OS X version review: Great game when it works. Hasn't worked on my Mac since last update. Don't buy it until they fix it, obviously.UPDATE: Reinstalled the game after the big February update and it still crashes shortly after loading. The incompetence of this company is disgusting and I feel completely ripped off. Don't purchase if you have a Mac."
Negative,They literally told me there was nothing they could do to help me so i could actually play this game 7 days of emails back and fourth just for them to tell me they cant help so now i cant play what terrible customer service and company's that run i can no longer support this game or these companies
Negative,"Great game, but server keeps crashing on steam.Apparently the people who got the game through the main website ""https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/home"" are still able to play the game fine.  Tried both EU and AU servers.Because of the low pricing of original game without any DLC, both steam and bethesda are having disputes and arguments over the profits of the game sold on steam, hence bethesda has held access from steam customers until the dispute is completely handled.If you get to see this review upon many others, then I plead to not to get the game from steam.  Go to the orginal site to get the game, otherwise you'll have to deal with their own b2b disputes."
Negative,7 hour download just to find out I can't play it. I imagine it's a great game but this is a terrible first time for me. Oh Bethesda.
Negative,"Game is great, I love ESO.. JUST DONT GET THE DAM THING ON STEAM!!!! Buy the game Directly thought Bethesda. I, like many others, CANNOT log into the game due to a steam issue. WE DONT EVEN NEED STEAM. Unfortunatlly I am stuck with steam becuase i do not want to have to purchase the game again. The only reason I am even writting this review and not playing the game i want to play is because I CANT! gee wiz thanks steam. I was trying to lunch the game without steam but it seems they inculded a non confirmation unistall file ""ZOSsteamremover.exe"" (DO NOT CLICK ON IT) within the game files that if clicked on once completely removes 74 GB worth of data....  so now I am stuck redownloading the entire game again. WHAT A FACKING JOKE! a simple ""are you sure you want to uninstall?"" would have been great thanks!!!"
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THROUGH STEAM. BUY THIS THROUGH THE ESO WEBSITE!If you bought the game through Steam, get a refund if possible. There are major problems logging into the NA servers if you have an account through Steam. I bought the game a week ago, and I've lost 2 days to login issues. It happens frequently, and on top of that it takes them DAYS to fix the login issues.The game has been fun, but I urge you, if you want to play, please please please do not buy this game through Steam! I purchased a lot of DLC that's linked to my account, and I wish I hadn't! Because now, all I really want to do is buy a new account so I can actually play. :( It's ridiculous at this point, and I just want to warn anyone whose considering, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THROUGH STEAM!"
Negative,Pay to play
Negative,How  to  fix  this  god awful  sens  bug  i cant  even get  past  the tutorial
Negative,the fat cunts wont let me log in
Negative,"Honestly, can't say much about the game, but the support and the company is criminal. Bought the pack of 21000 crowns, and they were never credited despite me being charged. Contacted support, their response was to wait three days for processing despite me having bought a pack of 750 crowns an hour later and it being accredited immediately. After three days, nothing, no help either, still don't have it and it does not appear forthcoming.tl;dr: Game might be fun, but prepare to get robbed."
Negative,I like the game but the EU server is horrible. Iy was down 8 hours maintenance then still log in troubles for many people and another maintenance soon after which should have lasted 2 hours but became 4. Then 2 days later again not possible to connect to the server. And ping jumps around like 70-120 and sometimes in dungeons can reach 300+. I get better ping on other games on NA server than ESO EU server living in the EU. This regular server problem has destroyed my game experience since I can never be sure when I can play or not due server issues.
Negative,"Oh, boy. I was gonna play it again after 5 years, and good thing I never got on it cause I read reviews. You guys selling information to 3rd parties is shady af. No, thank you."
Negative,"The support is so bad its not worth buying/playing. They will take your money and ignore you, and ""update"" your tickets with no update. SCAMMERS!"
Negative,"I bought the game on this Summer sale with 5 euros. It was worth the price, but after 25 hours of playing I discovered that is it not worth to spent more time into it. It's like you play the trial version of the game, you can enjoy it by playing alone, but its a MMO and this is the point of MMO, to play with others. And playing with others is not that fun, because they all are ahead of you, because they heve the monthly subscription. Its a nice game, but if u wanna have fun u have to pay a lot of money.  I'm looking forward for a game that will give me all the content if I buy the game. Here, if you buy the game u get only 30% of it, the rest, costs money. Crafting is a pain in the ass without ""the crafting bag"" and also they dont give you access to jewlery crafting, that is also a DLC to buy. Thieves Gouid and Dark brotherhood are also DLCs. There is to much payed content. Not worth it, and also the game experience is kinda bad. It's called ""The elder scrolls"" but it doesn.t fell like I'm playing an ""The elder scrolls"" game."
Negative,"Let's get something straight here: this is a fantastic game. But the reason I can't recommend it is because of how unoptimized the update process is. A 5 GB update takes nearly 2 hours to install if you're lucky enough to have it install at all without freezing or breaking during that period, and there's absolutely no reason that it should. I've seen larger updates to larger programs take less than a quarter of that time to update, and that's being generous. And from what I can tell, this has been a problem practically since the game's release give or take 7 years ago.Here's what I know about the problem. First, the game's files are scattered practically all over your computer, and switching directories a large number of times slows down the process, more so when the directories are farther apart. Second, the update goes through every file in the game and checks to see if that one needs to be updated before continuing instead of just replacing the old files/adding the new files.If Zenimax actually pulls themselves together and fixes the game's biggest and oldest problem, I'll happily write a positive review, but I just can't the way the game is now."
Negative,"So far playing this game has been nothing but pure fun. I've played solo and with my gf so far and it's fun solo and playing with others. What I love most about this MMO compared to others is combat and questing. The combat feels much more fast paced than other MMO's i've played and the quests aren't bland and boring, they're just like a quest in any other Elder Scrolls game but can be enjoyed with others. I played WoW for years and have around 600 hours put into Guild Wars 2 and I might say this one will top both. (Keep in mind I don't have many hours put into it yet) but so far, from the voice acting to the combat system and questing system, it's been awesome. It also has a very rewarding system and I love that. Sure, a lot of things look like they cost crowns, but it looks like mainly cosmetic/housing stuff, besides DLC content, which was to be expected anyways. There are no Pay to Win factors involved. I also love the idea of having a optional subscription. Sure, others that are subscribers may have more than you in terms of crowns and cosmetics but it doesn't give them the upper hand on you at all. I can't speak upon PvP for I haven't tried any yet and i'm mainly PvE anyways, but I find this game to be a gem within the MMO world and wished I had picked it up sooner. I used to be a big critic of this game just reading poor reviews years ago, but many things have changed since and I'm glad I tried the free trial and ended up purchasing this game. A must have!EDIT ---------------After playing PvP it's a tad fun but seems pretty unbalanced. Like I stated above though, I am mainly PvE anyways and haven't messed around with it too much. After playing some DLC content as well I can elaborate on this game being amazing and a MMO gem. If you subscribe you get all the DLC content, which is amazing. I've played through two of the DLC so far and I found them to be tons of fun and packed with much more content and new zones to explore. There's a few bugs I've encountered as well. but very minor ones, But what game doesn't have bugs? I haven't experienced any that got in my way really, or just a simple fix. I'd easily rate this game at a solid 10/10. One of my favorite MMO's to date already, and I still have many, many more hours to put into it.Second edit -At being 210 hours into this game now I still stand by my previous statements on how much fun this game truly is. I reached level 50 and am currently champion level 285. I still have many more things to do and explore and the game has not and I believe will not lose interest, it just has so much content and the devs release new content all the time, there's also events that happen a lot too. The community is super friendly and not toxic one bit.-------------------Third Edit At 380 hours played, and being Champion level 410 with all DLC completed at least once and completed all expansions, I still recommend.------------------------LAST EDIT I THINK YOU GET THE POINT, GOOD,NOT THE LAST EDIT BECAUSE ZOS KEEPS MAKING DLC SMALLER AND SMALLER. I have not played this game in about a year and a half and glad I moved on. Awful money grab now..."
Negative,So bad. Run!!
Negative,its so fucking boring holy fuck what a waste of space
Negative,Boring NPC shit lame got bored so fast thank god I played it for free feel bad for the poor saps who payed money for this dog fr fr I like games like this this game is cheeks galore
Negative,"After latest update, game's mostly FUBARed. Have to set video every time I log in, have to select server, have to agree to all the terms, and after I get through all that, 9 times out of 10 it still crashes before I can actually get in the game."
Negative,"Most of the map is locked behind a dlc, as well as some important aspects of the game :/"
Negative,"Way too easy, there is no challenge anywhere. Wandering the wilderness at low level is completely boring unlike any other MMO as I have no fear of dying. Countless enemies, all are garbage. Crafting system feels so overly complex it might as well be the hardest part of the whole game."
Negative,"""The Elder Scrolls Online"" is a performative modern art project that seeks to test prospective ""players"" to go ever lower with each step of the sunken cost fallacy they decide to continue downwards and then demean them further for daring to use their time on this poor excuse of a ""game"". It asks the question: ""how do we take the p*ss on the MMO player at their expense and still keep the 4th wall somewhat intact?""Right off the bat, you'll immediately notice the way experience works in the game, compared to other similar titles that give you rewards proportional to what you actually do. Here, you get 1k experience for simple back-and-forth fetch quests (you have no way of telling these apart from regular quests except to suffer through the mundane writing and monologues (yes, you cannot affect the story in conversations in any way through except in a few instances if you have a Fighter's or Mage's Guild perk, so they cannot fairly be called ""dialogues"")), you get 1k or sometimes 2k experience for serious story quests that usually require 30 minutes or even 1 hour to complete, sometimes with no or almost no creeps included in the quest areas for extra experience, and then... you get about 100 experience per creep/monster/PvE battle in the world or more in dungeons (only relevant at later levels though)...  each of them takes you about 5-10 seconds. Without doing the math, it is needless to say a HUGE imbalance in time investment.But alright, you say then, I found the quests somewhat dull so far, and the rewards are garbage compared to what I could randomly find or make myself... so I'll just grind, right? Well OK then, but since not even creep difficulty is completely imbalanced with experience rewards, you'll need to find the best grinding spots (do NOT stay in Elsweyr, the creeps there are a waste of time and the quests very inefficient with a lot of on-foot travel time - I do not have any clue how this was OK'ed as a starter location other than possibly sadism) with the easiest to kill creeps, probably zombies  - but it also has to be a place that isn't cleared and chosen by other players. So go trek half way around Tamriel for no reason again until you find that. Sound good? Right, now you're still not ready to level up for real. You still need to have all the possible experience boosts you can possibly get simultaneously. No problem! You just need to go on a literal sh*t-throwing merry goose-chase around several gated areas, do pointless quests that are a complete pointless time-sink and not worth your while, again, and then you're rewarded with... more trekking around until you get the experience boost (New Life Festival). You suffered through all of that? Wow, you're a really special person - now for your long awaited reward, you finally get to do literally the same thing over and over again. It's like watching paint dry, except you might also get carpal tunnel syndrome (oh yeah, the way the game handles abilities (short spammy cooldowns and only one action bar) almost requires an MMO mouse with extra keys on the side unless you're a great contortionist with your (unnaturally long-fingered) left hand and the keyboard).That's experience and leveling, then there's gold, which you'll need to use every day not be slightly as much of a slow-as* sucky horse rider on your unnecessarily long treks through Tamriel to get the best grind loadout possible - of course you do (oh and the final speed boost you'll need is also gated behind PvP, of course). Gold is hard to come by in the beginning, and you almost get nothing for grinding, but there are exploits and repeatable quests you can do to remedy the problem. No, fanboys, this does not make the reward system balanced or not badly designed to begin with.Finally, I'll just add that the visuals are again very imbalanced - very poor in some areas (especially the architecture where leathery and grainy textured monolith style stoneworks dominate almost every city) and great in others (that you might see for 10 seconds (i.e. the Main Quest)). Not that graphics are a dealbreaker to me, but poor prioritization were made, MMOs should focus on making the stuff you see repeatedly pretty. The game seems to lack direction overall, other than guiding the player through one piece of meaningless gated content, quickly to be followed up by another - it's very consistent in that aspect.With all of this said, I have seen a GLIMPSE of an endgame here that could almost be considered fun, I'm just not willing to go through the soul-crushing tedium to get there when other games allow me that kind of fun from the first minute...and without a damn subscription or  copy-and-paste DLC, too. I'm sure somewhere in the nether-realms of this game there's fun to be had - in any case, I'm confident upper management at Zenimax is having a giggle all the way to the bank."
Negative,Had been playing for over 3 years. Then with a new update game would't load. Followed instruction to delete from stream and re-download ( I did this twice ) then ran game consult as instructed. Sent tickets ( 5 times) to customer support and NEVER GOT AN ANSWER OR ANY HELP! Done with them and any future games they develop.
Negative,"combat is just garbage, no nicer way to say it.i thought the combat in previous elder scrolls games are bad, but this one is just a whole new level of awful.its unresponsive, slow, clunky, and worst of all - requieres no skill:just mash buttons and if you have higher stat points than the enemy - you win. if the game's main focus wasn't combat, it shoudn't have had real-time fighting."
Negative,"I kept getting insane sensitivity spikes, so I Googled the issue and found a Reddit post from 8 years ago complaining about the same thing. Apparently this game doesn’t like my 1000 Hz polling rate mouse, but I'm used to it so to play this game I have to lower the mouse polling rate every time I boot it up. This wouldn’t be an issue if it weren’t an 8 year old bug that still hasn’t been fixed which doesn't leave a good impression. I’m sure it’s a fun game, but I’m done excusing Bethesda's flaws."
Negative,"I like Skyrim - lots of fun, but you can't play with friends.  I thought Elder Scrolls Online would be good for that and you can play with friends except Elder Scrolls is so grindy.  They give you lots of mindless quests.  People spend their time crafting items in game for money instead of adventuring.  I'd rather be fighting and exploring, not making a sword for someone.  Skyrim is story and adventure.  Elder Scrolls is grind and grind.  They don't give you enough storage for stuff so you spend time manipulating storage instead of playing the game.    With Skyrim, if you kill someone, they stay dead.  Elder Scrolls on-line have the monsters come back to life while you are still clearing out the place.  Why do I have to kill you again?  I just killed you, let me walk over your dead bodies on the way out.   You can work around the game's defects by paying more money.  The game treats you like an atm.  PvP is a mess.  Don't go into PvP expecting to do any damage to a player.  Players are overpowered and can kill you in a second while taking no damage.  it's very unbalanced."
Negative,Don't get me wrong the gameplay is fun. And maybe even above my expectations. But even though this is NOT a free to play game. You get exactly the same as a free to play game. I get that money has to be made with ingame purchases but only having a few of mounts available without paying real money for it just sucks. And the costant pushing to buy a subscription is getting irritating too. It is not like the game was free to play so why push so much to pay even more money for it? As a player you get treated like crap even though you already put 20 bucks into it. The game would've been fun if only it wasn't so greedy
Negative,"I went back to play the World of Warcraft recently, the graphic is so old, but the Bllizard alway did a great job on the pvp balancing. I like the high end pvp gameplay, ESO has so much better grahic, better combat system. But they are so bad at keeping the pvp balanced. From right now, Accending Tide patch, Mag plar is always a problem, I have never seen a class has so much burst damage and insane heals, this is just a example, and you have no idea about the magsorc buff, now spells grinding with the max stats or damage, you know what it means? It means magsorc only needs the max mag and also has the insane spell damage and insane shield as well. Like this ZOS team has no idea what are they doing about the pvp balancing, and the necro class and the vampire passives is just tanky af ! Game is so unfair just wanna pushing pvp players away ! Why we want to always following the meta? Like I can't even play my stamclass anymore, why I couldn't use the dizzyswing in pvp because it's not the meta anymore so I have to lose in 1v1 all the time? You want to learn how to fix the balancing, just keep nerfing the strongest meta, just like the leaguge of legend or World of Warcraft did it before, so you can have ur pvp customers back, but if you don't want them in ur market anyway, do it in ur way, if I'am the head of the company, I would fire any decision makers in the ZOS."
Negative,"I like the idea of an online Elder Scrolls game if it weren't for the fact that the Bethesda Launcher-thingy refused to work for me after only about 10 minutes of actual gameplay. And since Steam counts 'hours played' from the moment you open the launcher, and includes the time it takes to install the game, I can't request a refund anymore. So, all in all. Like the idea, liked the little time I actually got to play the game. But due to Bethesda being whatever they have become over the last few years, I can't really recommend it."
Negative,"This game doesn't even starts, as it always gets stuck in a loading ."
Negative,Painfully boring. Play Morrowind instead.
Negative,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FROM STEAMGreat game but too many issues when logging in via the steam client. Save yourself the frustation and buy the game directly from the publisher.
Negative,It used to be good.
Negative,"Extremely expensive for even the most basic of content. Three hours of playtime costs up to $30. Basic DLC, like a single dungeon, costs up to $10. It's not even like this game is free to play, either, considering you have to pay to get it."
Negative,"""I downloaded almost 120 GB, but when I tried to run the game, the game launcher would open but the game wouldn't run or would crash.I tried all possible methods in the community and on YouTube, but it didn't work.I hate this launcher, I hope the creators are happy for making such a crappy launcher.All my excitement for playing the game was ruined, and I ended up deleting it."""
Negative,"There is a distinct lack of polish on this game that, when I play the single player Morrowind, the aesthetics are comparable.  Morrowind released May 1, 2002.  My main complaint is that this game plays like a AAA game from 2002, 15 years ago.The mechanics from the single player campaign of TES to ESO are well done and thought out.  But fetch and gather quests are still at the heart and the story is on the periphery.  There are other MMO options that allow their story to shine and I feel like at every turn, the game is urging you to pay to play, and you definitely feel like you are playing an incomplete game if you don't buy the expansion or pick up the DLC."
Negative,"Game worked fine until I purchase ESO PLUS now it constantly crashes, 307 boot error, and constant restarting of game and steam. What a piece of sht game this has turned out to be. Also: The beginning tutorial is pretty worthless to newer players, several quest are broken and you wont be able to complete them, the quest markers don't work most of the time. if you like exploring and getting lost and spending lots of time on google, reddit, youtube looking up stuff with no one giving direct and clear new player advice just to end up stuck & figuring everything out on your own than this game is for you. I've spent more time looking stuff up sadly instead of actually playing and enjoying the game. All the guides are directed towards veteran players. Crown store is overpriced as all online bugthesda games are, dlc are way over priced to force players to purchase a monthly sub in order to player, Its a rather scummy tactic but its bugthesda you cant expect them to do anything correctly. its a beautiful game ruined by terrible developers and their crappy in game quest markers mechanics but sadly its still better than most online games out there so im stuck playing it. Positive side is no auto battles, no gender locked classes, and more pve oriented instead of pvp and not very pay to win but its mostly pay to play"
Negative,"Never played the game before, tried to get into it this year - the leveling experience is a nightmare.  Boring, uninspired, clunky, and a cash grab (you need a monthly sub to do parts of the game, like crafting due to inventory space).  What little crafting I did was a joke, the mounts are slow and useless unless you train everyday for 60 days.  I wouldn't play this game if someone paid me."
Negative,"I didn't like MMOs before, when loot boxes and pay to win weren't issues.Now I can't stand them.It's a beautiful game with rich lore, but it's not great and it's definitely no Morrowind.They messed up the tone big time."
Negative,Fun game until you realize after you hit max level none of the content matters in the slightest. play it if you like a single player game masked as an mmo.
Negative,"First of all - I do recommend this game - at a sale price ($10 or less)TLDRAs MMO - the game is sadly  repetitive, bugged and unrewarding.As Single player's game - any other elder scroll game is way better.Why?It is presented as MMO - but your interaction options are poor and limited, sharing items is limited, splitting mission goals is impossible and trying to coop with another player is sadly useless, since you end up either stealing each other's harvests or breaking up each other's quests (You talk to an NPC and the other player has to wait for it to respawn since sometimes his quest updates and sometimes it doesn't. You kill some BOSS and sometimes your friend gets the chest and sometimes he gets nothing - not even the update). You find yourselves in different phases of existence and spend time to run to your ""party"" etc..There are tons of bugs - which might have been forgivable if the game wouldn't literally make you PAY for them (you get STUCK IN A *** WALL and have to teleport to a shrine (and pay for it). You ""fall"" through a rock and spend 10 minutes waiting to find out if you end up on the floor or  beneath the bottom of the world. Your controls lag during fights and sneaks causing your timings to get you killed or ""disreputable"" over and over again - and so on.At the game's current status, it is not ""pay to win"" so much as it is ""pay to not be a second hand citizen"".The world is huge and beautifully made with huge amounts of content, but it keeps reminding you that to experience everything (be that races, mounts, map zones, chests etc..) - you need to pay and pay more and more."
Negative,"Great game, terrible servers. But a great game you can't play is useless."
Negative,"""Kill 100 bestial daedra."" What kind of quest is that? I'm not buying your loot boxes and certainly not grinding for them."
Negative,"The reward system in ESO is bloated and unfulfilling. Character locked features should be account bound. Combat is interesting, but ultimately it feels janky--worse than tab target games. There has been ""pay to win"" crown trading for many years instead of developers coming up with their own exchange system to prevent system abuse. Group finders are usually broken a few times a year. PvP sees very little effort or love and is broken every major patch. Level scaling makes the game feel boring and lessens the impact on story content. Many things could have been restructured but they are not because of (probably corporate) greed. The longer you play, the more you realize you shouldn't play."
Negative,"You need to buy base game, you also need ESO+ subscription ( because of inventory limit ) and without subscription u cant access the DLCs and some dungeons ( without sub, u must buy them ), and finally u need to buy Summerset Chapter, because there is a new jewelry system, and u cant even use the crafting bench without buying it. You want all races? Then u need to buy imperial race too. Check your package if it includes warden class, if not then u know the rest.   So this game is expensive, very boring combat system ( especially with stamina characters ), animation cancelling has ruined the game, end game community is toxic, u cant trade without guilds, crown shop is very expensive, every year devs want more from us without fixing pvp areas, some bugs, lags, balance issues and group finder tool. I'm done with this greedy system."
Negative,"Piece of shit keeps getting stuck in infinite loading hell now for over a Week now. While this bug has existed for years as is tradition since bethesda is know for the bugs, it's never been this severe. I've tried all possible fixes and nothing have worked, wasted a sub and the new expansion for nothing. If you are going to buy this keep in mind you may draw the short stick like me and get screwed over. While majority of players don't get this problem, the risk is still there. Recomend getting ESO on Todd Howard launcher if you don't wanna take the risk. As for me i'm done with ESO for good."
Negative,"Probably one of the worst games out there in terms of optimization and just in general even trying to run the game, Zenimax is an incompetent developer where problems that has been in since 2014 still exists today. Amazing"
Negative,"No, because I had no feeling of progression. Also, new abilities were not game changers at all. In the end, it also felt like all Magicka versions of classes played the same and all stamina version of classes played the same. What was the point of the classes if the only difference was the visual effects between them?"
Negative,"The game takes up way too much space. 117GB to download and another 20GB to install, absolutely ridiculous.Don't buy this if you care about your hard drive space."
Negative,"Catastropy ...Got the game free for 5 days and this is my experienceFirst waiting 2 hours for steam to download 80GB of game filesThen the Launcher fails with a java errorAfter a manual installation of the Launcher, the Launcher downloads and installs another xx GB of data which took about 7 hoursand FINALLY started the game, it did not have any sound except in the videos of the logosThe launcher also does not have a repair options (as suggested in the form).Conclusion: are you kidding me? This is not a F2P game that everyone can try, but a subscription game you want me to pay money for ... and it breaks 3 times before i even create a character?No thanks"
Negative,"Late 2018 and this game is still a solid nope. This game was on the failing lane to becomming a real elderscrolls game the moment it decided to put on MMO pants. an MMO world has zero hope of being able to support the assets needed to give it that polish. The models and texture work in my personal opinion are very lack luster. The animations are choppy and clumsy. Multi-player would og been amazing... An MMO? Now you've lost me... The (Orignal) dream of skyrim was to spit on the imitations of your typical RPG and now this Tod Howard SPUD comes in and dumbs shit right the hell back down. Screw you Tod Howard... Skyrim was pretty but.. greviously over simplified and hand holding. I don't feel much agency when i've got people dragging me from point to point by my nose. There are plenty opf sheep games elsewhere, Elderscrolls was supposed to be bigger than that... but nope... Tod howard wants us to hide in that ""KISS"" bubble because it means he can do less work and still chisel a full price out of you. ""Keep it simple"" just means ""I don't want to work that hard"" from the lips of Tod."
Negative,"I really wanted to enjoy this game, but I honestly can't even bring myself to play it. The combat is just so clunky and it doesn't even matter, everything just dies.Apparently it's more interesting in PvP and late game PvE but I can't even get there, the world just feels so awful to travel around. Maybe it's just me.I also don't like how the class you're playing doesn't make that much of a difference, the weapons really define the role, and I think that's a poor choice. It makes every class feel the same. Sure, there are mildly different playstyles, but it's really not varied enough to make every character feel exactly the same as the last.I'm not particularly thrilled about how the guilds were implemented either, but that's honestly just my opinion and I'm not basing my review on it.The writing is good-great depending on where you are, and if the combat, exploration, and class fantasy didn't feel so bad it'd almost make the game worth it for me.TL;DR game feels bad so I can't play it even though I really want to"
Negative,"Fun game, but it refuses to start when I tried to come back. Been at it for @#$!ing hour and a half after reinstalling and STILL wont start!!!!!"
Negative,"Don't bother, when you finally get set up and understand the game they change the combat system. Don't waste your time go play something that isn't treated like its still in Beta."
Negative,I hate leads
Negative,"Unhappy with the $79.95 purchase of all DLC Deluxe bla bla bla ""on sale"". This was the max priced version available. 50% of the map objects can be unlocked ONLY with $14.99 monthly subscription, otherwise it is like Warcraft trial version. The world is so huge you cannot even get an opinion in 1 hour limited by Steam for refund, and I am on 8th hour. Absolutely non-intuitive items collection - there are too many different items (supposedly for crafting) and the backpack can handle only 60 slots in the beginning. Looks like a complete rip-off for me. Well, I lost $80 for nothing, no fun."
Negative,"Continously have trouble with trying to load up the game. A lot of people might say its my connection or my hardware, neither is the case. My game is simply not wanting to load past me hitting play. Then it crashes and i have to close out. This has continuously happened for over 2 to 3 months now. Honestly its quite disappointing that a company I once praised and highly recommended to other players or even new ones, would allow this sort of thing to happen. Bethesda you need to fix your game."
Negative,"neverending problems with steam log in, i cant play since 3 days, waste of money, noone gonna give me back money for eso plus, im gonna just come back to WoW"
Negative,Do not purchase this game through steam.
Negative,Game does not start. Just crashes to desktop a few seconds after hitting play.
Negative,"Feb14 Steam users can no longer log into NA...Feb15 Steam users can still no longer log into NA...No updates, Issue was said to be resolved..Kinda feeling a bitch cheated."
Negative,"As a new player, the monetization of this game is also extremely off-putting. I have no issue paying for a game, expansions, or DLC but when you're selling what most developers would consider quality of life updates there's a major issue. As of June 2020, you would have to spend nearly 30,000 Crowns ($300) in addition to the game base in order to catch up to veteran players, or commit to paying for a monthly subscription.I will update this review in the future, but as of right now its a no for me."
Negative,This game is linear and repetitive. The lack of auction house is pointless. I got bored with the game within a week and went back to my mount and blade mods. People who claims that this game is better than the launch version are lying to themselves. This game is BTP because people don't stick around too long so it's pointless to offer a monthly subscription.
Negative,"Game is fine BUT don't buy this on Steam !Steam's launcher isn't working AT ALL, look at the forums, dozen of people complaining about that. HAd to re-buy my game from Zenimax's website to play the game. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM"
Negative,"Here's a scathing review. I gave this game a serious chance. I wanted to like it because I love the Elder Scrolls series but The Elder Scrolls Online really is just terrible.Decide for yourself based on these examples:• Cyrodiil isn't a jungle like it's supposed to be, even though the setting is before Tiber Septim's time and he hasn't CHIM'd the land into meadows yet.• ""Dwarven ore"" can be mined from random rocks in the world despite Dwarven metal being an alloy which doesn't occur naturally.• Ayleids are represented in-game as indistinguishable from Altmer, rather than bird-like elves who, according to various established sources, possessed (or adorned themselves with) talons, beaks and feathers.• Various books can be found in-game which, in the game's timeline, hadn't been written yet.• Surilie grapes and Surilie Brothers Wine can be found in-game, even though the Surilie brothers are born hundreds of years in the future.Books can be explained by Apocrypha, but grapes? This is pathetic and demonstrates the true reason for these inconsistencies: a shallow investment in the series and poor attention to detail on the part of the so-called ""loremasters"" at Zenimax. This is just a handful of transgressions. It's no wonder that a large chunk of TES fans reject ESO as being canon.Default controls are unintuitive. The combat has no weight. Combat mechanics like dodging, blocking and interrupting are clunky. It feels like you and your opponent are swinging wet noodles at each other. The world levels up along with you, so there is no sense of growth, and levelling up actually makes you weaker if you don't find new gear fast enough.Is it at least good in the context of being an MMORPG? Well, the social aspect is practically non-existent. Nobody will talk to you. If you talk to people, they will ignore you. If you're lucky, someone will call you a noob in a dungeon group. If you've played other MMORPG games, you know that this isn't the norm. It's a problem with the game itself.Speaking of dungeons, the game has a ""dungeon finder"" system which matchmakes you with a group of players. To call it ""matchmaking"" is generous. You will invariably get a group of high-level players who rush ahead and leave you in the dust wondering where the hell you're supposed to go.The world and the people in it just feel empty. All people do is stand around in cities and zoom around the world on their flashy store-bought mounts at incomprehensible speeds.The game's monetization strategies rub me the wrong way.• Up-front cost to play• Optional subscription for major quality-of-life improvements and temporary access to expansions• Additional cost for permanent access to expansions• In-game currency designed to psychologically manipulate you into spending even more money• LootboxesConsider that they wouldn't need a whale-centric monetization system if the game was worth playing.Those are my biggest criticisms. Positive aspects? Hard to say. Gathering herbs is relaxing."
Negative,"I tried, but with the odd disconnected tutorial not connecting to the main story (at least as far as i got, and is only for character tutorial according to some players) nothing in the game sunk its teeth in and I'm just not interested. Crafting seems needlessly complex for creation and amount of material needed for 1 piece of ore. yes i know its an mmo but even still needing 4 resource points to even get enough wood to refine the logs to get a usable material."
Negative,Best mmo by far. It has so many good things. Only bad one is its hard if u want to be like good at pvp but good part everything including if u want to play solo so much to do so good story telling and storu keeps updating with every dlc. Enjoy with ur friends best way to play mmo is this one. Just too have to see it for ur self cuz every one can find fun in this one.I decited to change my review to neghative just to bring attention how bad necromancers as a class. they are not true to theyre class at all. when i play sorccerer i feel more like  necroamncer then a so called necromancer. and i hate it so much since i always main necormancers in all games. and to be honest that is enough for me to forget about this game despite how much money i have putten in. Also i hate how this game has become to big for try hards. i play games to have fun not to have 2nd job.
Negative,"As an Elder Scrolls game, it isn't. As an MMO... it's not great. The game is stuck in limbo between the two in a completely dissatisfying way. The spirit of the Elder Scrolls series as a whole was lost on this title and I must say I don't really recommend it.EDIT: Upon further review, the developers decided to back their policy of ""who would want to play cooperatively?"" The entirety of the new expansion was plagued with PVP. Trying to play the story of the city? How about instead, you get stunlocked repeatedly until death. Want to just SEE the city you loved playing oblivion? How about enemy factions that stand near where you respawn? That would be great, right? There isn't really as much PVE as there should be for an Elder Scrolls game. It's like PVP, with a handfull of daedra. DO NOT spend money on this expansion if you dislike the broken-ness of this game's PVP system. For PVE outside Cyrodiil... It's alright."
Negative,"This game is so far removed from your classic Elder Scrolls experience it doesn't deserve to have the name. I've tried this game twice, years apart, and have rapidly become bored both times. Why they felt that it should be class based, and then give you so few classes to pick from, and making them all so much the same, I have no idea. I just can't get into this game. Say what you want about Fallout 76, and there's a lot you can say about it, but at least it feels like you're playing a damn Fallout game. There aren't classes in Fo76, you can make radically different characters, and while there are always going to be some options that are simply better than others in no way are you forced to use them in order to keep up and be useful. If you want to build a chef character that uses a rolling pin and a flamethrower you can do it. ESO feels like they took a poor to mediocre MMO and ladled enough Elder Scrolls lore onto it to let it pass inspection but somehow missed the fun game play and replaced it with an over developed cash shop.This game is awful and I wish I could get a refund."
Negative,"unplayable from SEA region due to high ping , feels bad man :("
Negative,Downvoting because one of the DLC packs are misleading and they wouldn't let me refund it to purchase the proper one.
Negative,"You have to pay for everything that would have otherwise come standard in an Elder Scrolls game. you want factions? paywall. you want skills? paywall. you want sneak attacks? paywall. There isnt one single aspect of this game that isnt hidden behind extra payments. which is fucking insane considering the price of the game itself. ""Oh theyre expansions"" no they arent its content that they clipped out of the game before release and sold to you piecemeal because they knew you would buy it. This game is an absolute embarrassment to the name, and it is the reason I wont be buying Elder Scrolls 6."
Negative,"I've played other MMORPG like Aion, Tera, Black Desert, FFXIV, WOW, Guild Wars 2, Lost Ark. But definitely the questing in this game is awful, in this game you have to search a lot to find the main quests, such a waste of time, the first 10 levels were pretty good."
Negative,Graphics are great and you can tell the storylines are thought out! Characters are quite entertaining as well. One can tell there has been a phenomenal amount of work put into this game.  But........  Game will not allow you to move when engaged with an enemy.  Even when you are under a spell or are rooted the tips the game provides do not work and you can only sit there until killed.   Quests are so drawn out and rewards given  are rather pathetic and this makes the game of little interest.  The game will randomly log you out for no apparent reason or quit working altogether. Played it for some time but am quickly losing interest as the bugs are so frequent and so debilitating.  Work them out and you will have a really fun game.
Negative,"Very disappointing. The Elder Scrolls element of this game is paper-thin. It immediately feels more like Perfect World or one of those free-to-play, buy-to-bling, land-fill MMORPGs. There's no immersion, no connection, no love. An over-crowded mess of ludicrously gaudy players spamming, griefing, rushing around on endless grinds whilst you struggle vainly to find some way to get immersed in a story-line or give a cr@p about your avatar despite being constantly pulled in a thousand different directions by a cacophony of competing and distracting micro-plots.If you love Perfect World and want a slightly Skyrim flavoured version of that, then this is perfect for you. If, like me, you love Elder Scrolls and were dreaming of the day that you could finally be totally immersed in Tamriel, well... sorry... this is just teleporting around a map of Tamriel, clicking buttons, finding ways to filter out other players until you finally accept you're not having fun and uninstall."
Negative,"I just bought Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.  Played it again after playing this game, and sadly ESO has a lot to do but none of it seems to matter.  Missed the mark in every meaningful way, The only thing ESO has is building your own house which is actually fairly cool."
Negative,dont play if u want pvp (balance is getting worse)
Negative,There is not a single Asia server. It is just NA and EU.
Negative,"This is probably the most poorly designed ""open world MMO"" I've ever played. The world is shockingly linear, the monetization is horrendous, and completing quests—the entire core of the game—is super confusing and flat out boring. Granted, I didn't subscribe, but the Standard Edition is practically useless unless you like to wander aimlessly and kill low-level enemies. I see now why they are about to re-release Skyrim for the tenth time."
Negative,I loved Skyrim but I never quite warmed up to this one. The world is vast but you are kind of lost in it. Combat just feels like button smashing and using abilities as soon as the cooldown wears off. No idea how the experience between two similar games from the same publisher can be so different.
Negative,"I deleted the game. Mail adress was hacked and the acocunt was stolen. Bethesta support is the shittiest support i've ever seen. They even replied one of my tickets like; ""Hey! We had a storm so we couldnt checked your ticket, lol. We won't give a damn and ignore this problem of yours but if it still persist send another ticket"" Seriously. Don't even consider the game, a mmo with shitty support is just a torture."
Negative,"This game had the best PVP I have ever played. The decline in the games performance was one of the deciding factors for me in switching to pc.The recent and proposed changes made by zos are devaluing not only the PVP and Veteran trial groups hard work in learning the game over years since its release but the work of their own team.In short they have decided that people who have  mastered, animation cancelling for buffs and skills are now too skilled for new or bad players who have zero interest in learning the tricks of the game. The Block changes have made it so certain very useful cancels no longer work reducing the players toolkit to stay alive and fight outnumbered or stay alive long enough to learn something from a better player in a 1v1.I lie somewhere low in the ranks skillwise despite being a longterm player but the draw and rush of this game is winning an outnumbered fight or improving against someone who just rips you a new one.Zos no longer have pride in what they created and have been slowly destroying their game since they stopped Dragonknights being able to leap onto keep walls. To make money on an ageing product they have opted to fix problems by removing the people most loyal to the game as they are the ones most pationate and likely to push when there are issues with core mechanics.Zos is now pushing the black desert route of milking their playerbase. Not for gear but for digital real estate, pets, buffs and easy gearing via bought skyshards ect. If this sounds appealing just remember what you are buying and how they reward loyalty.Enjoy your garbage PVP where skills barely even work due to the lag and Low input zombie rotation trials where angry, spotty, sweaty people with 1 finger blame you for their mistakes.""Aspire to nothing and aim low in ESO turnbased"" ~ ZOS 2020"
Negative,"What seems dumb and counter-intuitive is I will continue to play this game, whilst not recommending it. My friends play, and it is fun sometimes. However, the heavy heavy time-gating and pay to win aspect are something I can never recommend. I can also never recommend a game that continually comes out with new purchasable content while never fixing the game breaking bugs scattered throughout. Can't open doors, bosses freeze or disappear, mechanics don't spawn.... These are bugs that are well known and have been in the game since launch, yet still aren't addressed. I'm sucked in and playing but if you have not started this, don't.Update to comment on the completely false, horrible response developers decided to post on my review. Don't address the fact that bugs are still in it, or time-gating. What you chose to do was to make a FALSE comment about your micro-transactions. Also didn't even read my review as they said they hope I give it another try.... Actively playing, just won't recommend. Crown store items are not ""convenience,"" as they like to claim. They are pay to win. Reducing the amount of time it takes to research an item DIRECTLY buffs your character to be able to transmute gear you need for better gear. That is straight pay to win. Buy potions and food, pay to win. You can buy experience, pay to win. You can even trade crowns.... That means you can buy crowns and sell them for gold to literally buy anything you need. PAY TO WIN!""Greetings,Our philosophy when it comes to the Crown Store is to ensure that players' experiences are not disrupted or stunted to the point that they feel that they need to make a Crown Store Purchase.Crown Store items fall under one of two categories: customization or convenience. We do not sell Crown Store items that offer players an advantage over others aside from convenience. ESO has tons of awesome equipment, weapons, and more available outside of the Crown Store including Unique Set Pieces from content such as dungeons.Thank you for your review and we hope you'll give ESO another try.Best Regards,The Elder Scrolls Online Team"""
Negative,"Used to be a fun game...until this latest crop of moronic combat developers got hired. If you're into housing, dressing up, questing, trading, lusting after little pixel prizes, you might find some things to hold your interest for awhile. The graphics are outstanding. But if you get into combat and want to progress into vet content, save your money...and your head...because you'll be beating it against the wall with all the stupid crap these developers come up with. They don't listen to players and make game altering changes every 3 months or so. I don't think I've ever experience a company so dead set against their players, insulting them on social media, and basically ignoring anything they have to say. Lots of pissed off people. They don't get anymore of my money. I give them another couple years and they will have run the game into the ground. Couldn't happen to a more deserving crock of meatheads."
Negative,"Tried to give this game another chance after almost ten years of not playing it. Maybe I've been spoiled by the combat systems of other MMOs, but this game's combat just seems so slow and clunky. I decided to play a Dragonknight to tank for my friend group and I felt like all I was really doing was standing there doing nothing. Questing felt like more of a chore than an adventure, often having to travel across the entire zone just to speak with someone just to walk back to the other side of the zone, and if you dared try fast traveling you would have to pay half a fee equaling your payout for your last four quests. Mounts are slow and sometimes feel slower than just sprinting. Much better options if you're looking for an MMO experience."
Negative,"Not a good game, combat system attempts to be mix of mmo and single player game but fails at both. This combined with animation cancel and other exploits turns PvP into trash and PvE is not enough engaging.Had it not gotten Elder Scrolls in name this would have been just another dead mmo game you never heard of and would been dead game year or two after it's launch."
Negative,"Overall a good addition to the elder scrolls franchise/universe and hands down the best MMO I have ever played. With all that being said I would not recommend playing this game unless you have endless free time on your hands considering they completely change the game/core elements of the game every patch. A set could be best in slot one patch and useless the next. To reach and continuously perform at a high level during endgame content requires way to much time with all the unnecessary changes that are made. And on top of all this the devs find someway to break core mechanics of the game and introduce new bugs every patch. A lot of the time they wont fix these game breaking issues, leaving certain content unplayable until the next new patch/update/chapter which could very well be up to 3+ months away."
Negative,not challenging... they scale the whole game to your level. not my cup of tea.
Negative,"game was running 60 fps stable, logged in after update and now constant stuttering and huge dipping"
Negative,The game has an absolutely massive download size. I wish I was willing to give up that much space to play.
Negative,worst combat ive ever experienced in an elder scrolls game...
Negative,more appearance than reality! animation cancelling makes coolness a farce. game-breaking bugs and exploits + overwhelmed servers make cyrodiil (pvp realm) actually unplayable.
Negative,Waste of 116gbs 👍
Negative,"Can`t start after an update, WIndows 10, repairing, uninstalling, installing, deleting addons, cleanong download cache doesn`t help at all. Tech support doesn`t help at all too. You can`t play its your problem only and nobody cares."
Negative,"Customer support is absolute ass. They currently don't let you change your own UserID. They link to contact customer support, which leads back to the article saying to contact them - an infinite loop of getting fucked. There is no way to contact customer support regarding this issue. Waste of money, do not buy."
Negative,"No matter how much I wanted to like this game playing it feelt very off.. Everything great about elder scolls is not in this game.. The quests are pretty boring, combat system is pretty horrible.. And if you buy the game you won't get a refund. Luckly I tried it out on a free weekend so I skipped a bullet since I planned to buy it at one point which gladly I did not."
Negative,It's a con. You only get to play a little bit then have to hand over more cash.
Negative,"didn't start with ""Hey you, you're finally awake"" so 0/10"
Negative,sucks slow slow bad graphic interfACE
Negative,Horrible game. Played it for 2 years and will never get my money back for all the lag and bad programming. Don't even bother. Play something else. They are very money hungry company. F&&cking useless. Just want your money and don't care about you. Really. Play something else :)
Negative,"Too many updates (and huge size), servers too often down, invetory management even worse than Skyrim, fights still as boring as Skyrim (most of the time, just stand and hit same button non stop), downloaded files location and installation folders not properly managed with Steam (basicall it downloads 80GB for installer, then uses 80 additionnal GB for installation, does not let you choose properly the installation folder, so if you have an SSD with less that 160 GB available, you may encouter issues).Huge deception for me."
Negative,"I don't know what happened to this game lately. This have been my go to MMO, the one I always come back to from time to time. Now, as a healers, I just feel useless in dungeons. There's no need for healers as tanks and DPS rarely take damage or just self heal more than damage income. It might be different at end-game but I'm not there and I'm not in a rush. Sadly apparently the devs want you to be in a rush. I used to love this game and the monetization is actually good. Now, I'm not so sure. I guess if you want a MMO with fair monetization and OP pre-end-game content this is for you. I'm probably done for not though."
Negative,"This is a fairly nice game with a lot of nostalgic potential. If it comes to boolean recommend the game or not, then it is not.I never cheated in the game, and I am so novice in fact that I don't even know how others cheat or can cheat. I am not having fun with this game anymore unfortunately, and for the past 4 to 10 months the only thing I was doing is daily logins for free rewards. But I assumed (and probably still do) that one day I might want to return to the game, and truth be told that the daily rewards in ESO can be really very valuable at times and you can amass them over time. 3 days ago there was an announcement full of pride - ban-hammer was used on some 300 accounts banning or suspending account accused in cheating. Mine was among those and I got a 72 hour suspension. I tried to figure out what was behind the 2 linked rules they said I broke since I wasn't using any exploits or 3rd party tools, like, ever.They have many ways to submit a ticket, and surprisingly none of the options assumes they could have taken a wrong action themselves. I submitted a Bug which landed on ""Feedbacks"". Then I created a technical issue ticket since I needed explanation. And then I created a 3rd ticket (the next day) on Account Recovery. 70.5 hours since the first notification email my account got automatically restored and I never heard from anyone, neither human nor even bot.Back to the question, do I recommend this game? No, I do not recommend supporting ignorance.Edit:After a few weeks they replied with apologies for a delay and said they will investigate. After another month+ of back and forth communication (where they requested and I even provide my cell phone) they replied this:>..After a thorough review of your account with the UserID: XXX, it has been determined that the account did in fact violate our Code of Conduct. More specifically, the account with the UserID: XXX was identified with very specific identifiers that determines whether or not the game client has been tampered with (hacked). We regret to inform you that your appeal for an account suspension reversal is denied due to the evidence within our system for Cheating / Exploiting...<My ban was in affect for only 3 days, and not being an active player that didn't hurt me. Yet the only thing I ever did with ESO was install it via steam, waited for the 10s of gigs to be downloaded during updates, frequently updates killing the game and thus I was forced to delete the game and install it anew; and hitting a start button in launcher. So, whatever evidence they refer to - they either don't have it, or they found their own crap from broken updates of theirs.So, my updated review - worst customer support I ever dealt with. I don't care about a record with cheating accusation in my history. I wanted them to freaking admin their fault and they never did.I strongly recommend you to stay away from this game even if you are huge fun of Elder Scrolls."
Negative,"If you want to pay literally several hundred dollars for a complete game, then buy this. You need to buy access for individual dungeons, regions, classes. Pretty much anything they can parsel off and sell as a DLC, they have. The big work around of course, is to subscribe to ESO plus, which you'll spend over a hundred dollars a year on. There are better Free to Plays out on the market, ones in which you can play the entire game without spending an absurd amount of money on."
Negative,Sadly At this state i´ll not be recommending this game to anyone who is unfortunate enough to play on the PC-EU servers. This week alone the game was unplayable for several hours 4 days in a row and it will not become any better anytime soon.In steam i might have a bit over 2.1k hours played but outside of steam i´m totaling way over 3k by now and it makes me sad to let this game go after so much time( and sadly a LOT of money) i´ve invested in it. DO NOT subscribe for ESO+ unless the Game works like it should by now and not like a Pre-Alpha version. Or even better DO NOT even buy this game!
Negative,"Way too hard to cancel the plus membership, criminal."
Negative,"DONT subscribe, cant cancel it."
Negative,SO far I think this game would be better if Steam would allow me to play it after I purchased it.
Negative,this game has not worked from day one..... please can i have my money back
Negative,- Too many DLC to get- Buying expac doesn't include any dungeons and trials.- Have to buy DLC dungeons and trails- Some QoL mechanics is pay wall with subscriptions or pay DLC
Negative,"I started to play this game but now I have to stop and uninstall it. To ZeniMax and Bethesda you want to put real world politics your video games, then I will not support you. I will never buy another product form you. I play video games to get away for the real world, to place myself into a different one for a while. It seems that you need to current day everyone, so I'm done with you. One more nail in the coffin of the games industry. I have a good amount of games in my backlog, I will be playing them instead of yours, maybe i will start supporting indie-games."
Negative,"I do not recomment this game for other players because:1. Gamedevs care only about money and making stuff to sell it for real money2. Gamedevs always waiting for really long time to fix TONN of bugs in this game3. Gamedevs don't care about their subscribers (so if you got sub - you're still nothing for anyone)4. Every big update game becoming worse in perfomance (so if you had 60 fps this patch - next one will drop it to 40)5. This game deserve better gamedevs, so don't buy it, you will be disappointed after some time in this game.6. Tonn of bots (no bans for them)7. PvP in this game in Prime-TIme just the most horrible PvP ever in the worldAnd many other things i can tell, but first 4 is enough to explain everythingEnd of 2019 - still worst MMORPG to play2021 - even worse than before."
Negative,"Downloading 100+GB only to find that the launcher encounters an error right ""out of the box"" and won't update, so I try to launch the game from the files. That works. I finally manage to create at account at the official website, but now when I log in the game tells me I'm trying to use an old game client, which...brings me back around to the launcher error. For a game that expects its players to invest in a 15/mo pass AND is several years old and had enough time to iron out its flaws, that sure is a great first impression.----------------------------------------------EDIT: After a couple hours of googling and reading through an absolute ton of posts on Reddit and the official forums from people who had/have the same problem I did, I finally managed to find a solution from a Reddit post that's a couple of years old. Again, this is not something you want a first-time player of your game to experience when they just downloaded the game, and the fact that there are literally hundreds of posts on various sites from gamers experiencing this shows that this isn't an isolated occurrence."
Negative,"like skyrim but requires an internet connection, has nowhere near as many mods, annoying menus and UI, immersion breaking players running everywhere with flaming green creatures following them (other players can alert enemies to your presence btw, making stealth runs completely impossible in this game), awful robotic dialogue, and a very limited inventory that pretty much forces you to pay for their subscription service.for players wanting more of skyrim and oblivion, just play those games again... it's better than this crap, even if you have played them a hundred times before."
Negative,takes to long to set up and a lot of GB
Negative,do not buy it on steam
Negative,This game is great **BUT** Don't buy this game through Steam but through the ESO website.  Way too many issues with login through Steam
Negative,"Unable to login, making the game literally and completely unplayable."
Negative,Great game but login queues are way too long at busy periods.
Negative,"The servers are at Level 3 Texas, expect your ping to sit at 500+ on an average day. The client has multiple memory leaks, ToS recommends you don't idle on the character select screen. ;) All short-comings are expected to be patched by community made addons, but there's not a lot of support there either. ""Thought I weapon swapped, now I'm dead!"" Random  frequent disconnects. The BS never ends, but maybe you'll find it fun. After you buy ESO plus so you can actually use your inventory or pickup loot."
Negative,"Let's be honest here. Elder Scrolls online is really similar to World of Warcraft. I liked the Skyrim gameplay much better. What's more, there's simply not enough spells and the spells aren't quite awesome enough. However, I can't say Elder Scrolls online is complete fail, as it did encompass some new, exciting features."
Negative,"A bland, expensive MMO. Does not respect your time or money. 150 days (not hours, days) of wait timers for the fastest mount and no amount of playing will change this timer. $15 cost to change character appearance OR name ONCE.Do not play without friends."
Negative,"The game is amazing. Buy it.Don't, for the love of Pete, buy it from Steam. I bought it. Then I found out about the infamous Steam outages. I though Steam is decent for other games. Let's wait and see. I waited. And I saw the Steam Outage. Steam players simply get a worse product and worse service. You can't email Steam. You can't call them. You can try to get a refund, but if its got 2 hours playtime or more than 14 days, they'll refuse you. No appeal process.By all means get the game. But Steam really screwed the pooch here."
Negative,Im sick and tired of the game constantly kicking me out. I wouldnt recommend this game for nothing.
Negative,Quite possibly the single worst game I've ever had the displeasure of playing.
Negative,"After the purchase, I said WOW. But after a week I got tired of it. Sick of the same locations, tasks, monsters that constantly run after you. INCREDIBLY BORED!"
Negative,"Don't buy this game on steam if you can, but overall, I spent like 500 hours on this game but I'm not super happy about it. I mean, playing without eso plus (12E/$ per month) is pointlessExtremely annoyed at incorrect use of english grammar in this game. The game uses singular they to describe folk of extremely obvious gender, in a situation where it is pointless to obscure a subject gender - case in point - Mirri second quest. For this extremely bad use of english language I rate the game as 1/10, since only extreme laziness can produce such mistakes"
Negative,"60G of download then a separate launcher download then a separate 3G patch download cuz that couldnt be included in the game download. 5 licenses to agree on Choose your server (out of 2) Login problem restart Make an account (cuz steam credential isnt enough) Whats your user name gonna be? ONLY 1 OF EACH - _ , . Whats your country? Whats your e-mail? (Steam credentials dont matter to us, give us more e-mails) Character creation now Whats your country - again Crash Restart - no sound. Imperial race - pay Quit game - crash. Good start..."
Negative,"Elder Scrolls Online is another fantasy grinding game pure and simple. I really dont have anything positive for this game other than the beautiful game world. Outside of that though, there isnt much gameplay here if your looking for a game to sink in to. There are quests and resources but they dont plunge the player into the world. However; there is a very dedicated base of players for ESO so they must be doing something right. What it is though, I've not figured out as of yet."
Negative,"First off, I was super excited when this game was announced and even with the footage of the gameplay.  I thought that in no way they could screw it up.  But they did.  Really bad.First off I always play as an imperial so I was devastated to learn I'd need to shell out a lot more money if I wanted to play my fave race.  They also made it so that if you paid them more you'd get a horse and other craftable items.  So I vowed I wouldn't buy this game.  However I got it through a sale and I wouldn't forgive myself if I missed an Elder Scroll game.  When I started playing I noticed that the game had a lot going for it, and I was impressed for the first few hours, until I released that everything seemed 'copy and pasted'.  It seemed really open but it really wasn't.  The class customisation was amazing but having a game tell you that you are too high a level to pick up profession items while travelling in a low level zone sucks.  There is hardly any PVP except for in the PVP zone.  There is no Auction House (You have to be in a guild to use something equivelant to one).  First person mode can be weird at times.  Subscription fee was too much for me considering what it offered.  Free to play (P2W) was probably going to happen at some stage.  It had the look of an Elder Scroll game but not the feeling.  You can do far more in Skyrim, Morrowind, and Oblivion.  So you end up playing a few hours listening to the music and trying to do somethign you could do in those games and it makes you sad to the point were you turn ESO off and boot up Skyrim.  Very sad because it had so much potential but it turned into a cash grab right from the start by not allowing me to play my race without paying more money.  Bad decisions all round by the publisher and developers."
Negative,i have played more then what is displayed and i can say  for sure stop wasting money on that crap and give us elder Scrolls 6 with all the continent  and off with the micro transaction  crap  you are killing your franchise  slowly but surely
Negative,"Started off promising, but became hopelessly tangled, and lost the plot (so to speak). Unclear how to do much of anything with the materials clogging up my limited inventory, Which of the 100 HUD targets to follow or not, how to make any significant amount of money, upgrade skills, I also *really* don't like the skills for the magic classes. It *IS* free, and it *should* be a great game, maybe it's just not for me, maybe I just don't have the right brain for it, right now, but I can't recommend it."
Negative,"It's not really an Elder Scrolls game, just an MMO.  At least Fallout 76 feels like bad Fallout but with friends.Items are scaled like most MMO's (though I do appreciate the variety of styles for base armors) and feel boring and too quickly replaced, enemies are just out in swarms randomly across the landscape and will just boringly come up and attack you as you attack it and maybe use your abilities, dungeons just feel like overworld enemy fights until the boss, classes are a fixed progression tree and allow very little choice for unique builds, and there are an inestimable number of DLC's that feel basically like paid updates at the rate they're released.I guess the concept of Cyrodiil's sieges and fighting over the land there is cool, but at low levels it's very difficult because the scaling they give you to compensate doesn't include your abilities, which are a HUGE deal in the fights there."
Negative,This game really is not as fun as it should be. It's just copy pasting the same grind and lackluster interaction. you might as well be playing a grindy single player game
Negative,You can only hold 60 things. any inventory item. Only 60.
Negative,"Wouldn't  recommend this game.First of all I'm a great fan of all the Elder Scrolls games (Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim) and I believe they are truly genius.But this game was a real disappointment in my opinion.Main reasons:1st- Incredibly easy!!! Gave me no challenge at all. I was laughing while surrounded by 8 mobs my natural health regeneration completely negated all the damage. It's like your chances to die in this game is just 0.000% What a joke.2nd and the main reason - there is no immersion in this game. I've literally had to stay in a line of other players in front of the boss cave to complete the quest. Oh and remember that thrill in Skyrim when you open the door in an ancient forgotten dungeon which was sealed for thousands of years? Forget about that! It will be more crowded than a pool on a summer day.3rd and final - Brain dead quests. Get that thing that I highlighted on your map bring it and repeat till you lv over 9000Oh and apparently your starting weapon can deal 10 000 damage at the start of the game nowadays. Like really?!"
Negative,"Obsolete game, too many broken features. They are unable to fix an old bug because the devs doesn't know how to fix them. Old  and stupid system, parsing is based on attack/spell rotation creating more problems. Overall it meets below 2023 gaming standards.Too many toxic players in ESO pve raids, don't mind the pvp that is a given.Pros:HousingCosmeticsEmoteCons:Too GrindyLimited players for endgame content even for 4manEndgame content leads to toxicity regardlessNot enough inventory/storage spaceToo many sets required for template that you will only use once a weekToo stressful for little happinessEndgame content equipment non shareable (only mats)"
Negative,"A mess of a game,  sure it can be fun to play but its severely buggy and heavily monetized.   The ""free"" to play method is also severely restricted, making it so if you intend to play you need ESO+ subscription - without it you are heavily limited in bag space, bank space..yada yada. The bugs are fairly severe and it seems the publisher don't give a crap about fixing them (what else is new?) Mobs knocking you through the world are common, or being knocked to the other side of the zone are also common,  the players have just settled on calling these types of bugs as 'features' now instead of complaining,  another common bug is mobs disappearing completely especially when too many players are around.The auction system is also terrible, requiring you to join a trade guild if you want to sell....even the simple fact of searching for new gear isn't easy, its a terribly convoluted system and even with addons, barely helps and then, we come to the heavily monetized aspect..Pretty much here, Beth/Zeni wants to sell you 'everything' // every major advantage you can think off has a price tag, some of the more major advantages like mobile banks/merchants clocking in at $50 each.   I forgot to add that the monetization is essentially a triple threat -  #1 Monthly full price subscription #2 Crown Store #3 Loot boxes......that sends a clear message of greed on behalf of the publishers. The positives are few to be honest,   sure there is alot of content and ESO+ subscriptions get all the DLC for free (Consider the subscription as season pass) and a bunch of crowns each month, so you could get some of those major advantages if you sub long enough.."
Negative,"Aside from the first Section, this is review is totally subjective.That infamous first Section:  I and most friends of mine are gamers since the 80's era. We started with Xaxxon, Prince of Persia, Oldest ever Street Fighter in which you couldn't choose your character and only play the game where 1st person is Ryu and 2nd person is Ken. Since then we had been through a lot of games. Why telling all these? Because in this hardcore gaming community, 2 or rarely 3 people out of dozens could bare to play this game with me. Maybe 12 people I recommended to start ESO and they left after first few hours. Infamous subjective Section: Why? Because the game isn't fun. It's a boring rinse and repeat game. It's as if a group of skilled developers who has no idea what gaming is or what the ESO is all about are given this story to code and while they did their best, there is nothing a gamer should want in it. Not a single person who attended to progressing of this game has ever looked and seen what the other succesful mmo's have done to become so popular. There are even some free mmo games out there that are a thousand times better then this one. In fact, I'd like to avoid giving any names but a certain mmo which has random RIFTs opening around the whole map can teach this game how to be a good game and entertain people instead of frustrating them and driving it's player crazy over stupid and still not patched up bugs, terrible decision making proccess which does not add challenge but only annoy the player for how it distracts them from reaching their aim. I mean we once fought a troll boss with over9000 hp who did nothing special. It was literally one hour mouse click fest between 3 players and 1 npc. Who the hell thought that would've been a good idea to put a gigantic sized version of a common troll with mass of hp that does absolutely nothing to make that fight fun? I lost yet another friend on that fight and he is not coming back.This game lacks everything; it's not Elder Scrolls, it's not fun, it's not tactical. It's just better not be so I, or we could've saved our money for some other game. Stating every one of these aforementioned bugs and terrible design decisions would take a week to finish so I'll skip them but there is something quite BIG that needs mentioning and it is, after you purchase the game for a high ass price, you still have to buy crown coins (cc for short) for most of things you want. Sure the game is still playable with mere gold coins you can find in game but that can only take you so far. If you want something solid, you have to pay for cc which is sold in for more high ass price. Personal belief is that the developers nor the publiser do not care if you love the game or hate it, they do not pay a thing about whether you have fun or get bored while playing. They just want you to buy things, more things and even more things. Hell, you are allowed even not to play the game as long as you buy stuff. That's their approach and that's disgusting as well.So a third Section for the future possible comments: Well I can think only one right now. ""If you're so irritated why do you still play"" and I can state is two different opinions in that; 1) I still hope to find some fun in that, being an eso fanatic and such... 2) I payed a hell lot of money for a game which I intend not to let rot. I put my word here thou, There are two well made toons in game with most quests done and lots of experience earned and despite that if I can somehow get that money back even partially, I'm ready to toss this game to garbage. Return it, destroy it and all of it's existance at whim. If I had known better earlier I'd stay far far away from this game."
Negative,Quests are repetitive and there are too many random bugs for the price of admission. At least keep the main quest line bug free for how much you're charging for expansions smh.
Negative,"Played the game for some time and I wish I could give it 👍, but I just cant.The thing is, literally every skill in the game has some kind of visual effect to it attached, which means that every battle is a constant flashing with bright colors. And after playing for some time with flashing like this my head goes dizzy and numb. And there are no way to significantly reduce the amount of visual effects (particle settings doesn't do much).I've seen the issue addressed on the eso forums for years, but still nothing is done. So until the situation is changed I'm giving the game 👎"
Negative,"TES O is a beauty game. Graphics, questing is good enough. My biggest grip is lockpicking minigame. Its timed which sucks big. Tutorial doesn't show clearly how it is done. Other thing is- when you star new character you spawn latest chapter like Greymoore currently, instead of start main quest."
Negative,"Many of my friends have  bought crowns for this game, including myself. They seem to double charge every time. I have had minimal trouble with it, however, one of my friends was banned for several months over this oversight, and has not been compensated for his ESO Plus time lost. He bought a year subscription. Don't spend money on this game."
Negative,26 hours in and only 1 thing that really bothers me and makes me not want to play is there is no enemy lvl system. Enemy scale with you so when you get to ebony and shit mudcrabs can still kill you somehow. The one thing an MMO needs is lvls so if you wanna solo stuff you can just grind a lvl or 2 to do it. Also the new class I think guardian is pretty much P2W in PVP. I have used him and he is so OP it's insane don't know how that got past them. If you can ignore these problems it is fun especially with friends but I dont recommend unless you can overlook everything bad. Best part is stealing shit only reason I'm stickin with it honestly because nothing drops gold and equipment dropped sells for nothing but costs 10000% more if you straight up buy it from a shop. One last thing they try and shove their dlc down your throat even though I already spent $80.
Negative,"It's very immersive and I love the in-depth story telling of this game. For someone that loves discovering all the quirks of a game, ESO does this really well.However, having already played it on console, to come onto PC and discover that there is no in-game voice chat is incredibly disheartening. That was one of the highlights of the game, to just jump on, start doing a mission or whatever you're doing and meet people from all over the world by just talking and saying hi. Stopping mid-way what you're doing to type is tedious (and costly if you're in a fight). I don't want to have to troll though forums to try and find a guild that will suite my schedule so I can talk and play the game with people.It's 2021, online gaming is how people interact these days. Almost all games that are multiplayer have a in-game voice chat option available to use.... it's available on console, why is ESO on PC behind? I'm already penalised for wanting to play this game in Australia (Ping never below 200) If I can't play silly buggers with randoms easily, I might as well just play an offline game."
Negative,"I played for 145 hours. I had some fun, but I did not not find it worth my time for me. I found the game not hugely engaging. No stories or quests that I cared about,  I joined a number of guilds (you can join 4 at once) and even with the extra help and activity I don't find myself encouraged to undertake the grind.Its art style is a bit bland and I would have loved to had something a bit more like Tera I had ESO plus and beginner DLC. if your starting out ESO plus is needed because you don't have the bag space. Once you purchase more space and build up homes maybe you could do without it. Don't forget to cancel the subscriptions once you call it quits."
Negative,102 GB launcher that does not even work
Negative,Great game.... if you can get into it and stay in it without disconnections.As other reviews say.. DO NOT BUY THIS ON STEAM.Will change review if they fix it up.
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THROUGH STEAM! They will screw you over with the membership and its very complicated to unsub from it. Just buy from the website itself because once linked through steam, you can NEVER play without steam. 0/10. Kept getting charged after multiple cancels to the membership"
Negative,"Tamriel Unlimited, is it bad, is it good?As an Elder Scrools, it's bad, just bad, some of the lore doesn't even makes sense, it feels like this game has been made by someone who has never played any Elder Scrolls in his life (i'm exaggerating a little).But still, it is a not a good Elder Scrolls game so why does it has the name ""The Elder Scrolls""?Is it good as a simple game if you don't consider it being an Elder Scrolls title? (let's be honest here, it is not an Elder Scrolls title), yes, somewhat.Is it worth playing? No.Not if you are a loner/solo player or if you are already busy on another (better) MMO.What would make this game better?Offline mode/solo.Real loot system (the same as the previous The Elder Scrolls games), even though this is an MMO, I find it kind of stupid to not get the stuff we're supposed to get, but that's just me I suppose.Better gameplay, In my opinion, it is better than some of the other MMOs in terms of combat  but it has its flaws, such as hit detection, I could hit a guy from far, my sword didn't even touched him, yet he died.The story doesn't seems too exciting nor too bad after what I've seen, if you want to know if it is good or bad, then you'll have to discover it by yourself.I know that this is an MMO, but why not making real loot? Oh and for those whom they lack gray matter. Some MMOs can actually be played offline.While some others can have private lan servers, sure, the first option is better, but this would be better than what we have here.If you're a MMO diehard fan and you don't care to look for enemies because there's ust so many players, being scammed by a bad deveoloper/publisher making you pay for the game with a ridiculous price, microtransactions and a monthly fee subscription, sure, it is OPTIONAL, but it should not be in there considering that you already have to pay more than 60$ for this game, let's not forget about the microtransactions and so called ""DLCs"".So if you want to show the World how dumb you are by encouraging such developers then by all mean, go for it.If you are a real gamer who loves the real gaming industry, what it was before it became all of this, then do not buy this game or you'll regret it.Now, the mmo's fans will probably come and say the crap almost any dumb mmo fans would say.""ten dont play tis game go play someting else""I play what I want.""mmos are meant to be online""Oh yeah and does that matters to you? Really, If i want to play offline, let me play offline, it's not your damn bussiness and it should be none of your concern. It wouldn't be the first time that an MMO would actually be playable offline.But anyway, even if it had an offline mode, It wouldn't be good enough for me to put that much money on such a game.Such a shame, it could have been something, so much more than this.Imagine the complexity of Morrowind, Oblivion, Daggerfall, with an enhanced crafting of Skyrim, enhanced and better gameplay, items from each location.But after what I've seen, it failed miserably.I want to say ""hopefully that we get The Elder Scrolls VI soon"" but it will be nothing like it should be, don't get me wrong, I love Skyrim, but the more far it advances, the more developers get mainstream and because of that, they miss on a lot of potential.Sometimes, it's just laziness, or incompetence.If you have played The Elder Scrolls from Arena to Skyrim, you'll understand, if you have not then you should play the other games to see how amazing they were, both difficulty and (rpg) content wise.Note: Played during the free week, I spent 20 minutes on my character creation, 2x less than in the previous Elder Scrolls, it doesn't have a lot of customization but some of them do look good, then I spent the rest playing the game until it got too boring to even continue.Note #2: I don't care if you call me a retard or whatever brainless insult you have, do you really think that I care about some random dude hiding behind their monitor to tell crap about me or my review? No, seriously, get a life, critics are good but calling people names over the internet doesn't really shows that you are smart, it's more like the other way around.Anyway, it's always like that, some just doesn't like the truth/facts, isn't it sad? this particular message only aims to the brainless people who try to tell bullcrap on the comment section, if you don't like my review, that's your opinion, dislike it and that's it that's all.It's time to grow up people, I have no time to waste with some random people that has low IQ and  the maturity of a spoiled child, I just don't.Any who encourages such practice should just not be playing games anymore, those who pay for the crowns (premium currency or how they should be called, ""we're too greedy and incompetent, feed our greed more"") or such things are really dumb, you do what you do of your money but please, stop making the gaming industry even more cancerous, yes, it's because of you, of course, anyone with a brain knows that.Just one pet could cost you 16$, oh but nevermind that, you already paid 60$ plus 20$ each month plus the DLCs, so what 16$ will do at this point...?Make the gaming industry even more cancer and incompetent because they'll see how well it works being incompetent and greedy, congratulations..."
Negative,"When I first got this game I had so much trouble getting it to work right. I had to scroll through hours of forum posts, and support guides before i could actually play the game. But when I finally was exposed to the game I loved it, it really did feel like Elder Scrolls. I played I think 100 or so hours, when I got involved with other games and stopped playing for a few months. When I came back from those few months I really wanted to start playing again. For some reason my hours reset after I came back so now I only have 30? I am unsure. Anyway, When I came back and logged in, I assumed I could go jump right back in and start playing. Nope. After I choose my character and press play, it gives me this error message; ""There has been an error. Please login and try again in a few minutes."" No matter how many times I ""wait a few minutes"" it gives me the same bullshit. I tried googling or even posting discussions on the forums, always getting the same generic answer. Yes, I have tried the repair option, 3 times. Yes I have uninstalled and reinstalled, twice. The most frusterating part about it is that Bethesda doesn't actually have a real support page.... it just redirects you back to community forums. It is so frusterating to be offered ""support"" but then given the same 2-3 solutions that won't work. What I really need is someone to actually talk to me and help me fix the problem, so i can play the game. I really don't want to refund it because I genuinly enjoy the game and want to play. If anyone has any idea what might be causing the problem, or know where I can find legitimate support, I would appreciate it."
Negative,"Edit: I played 17 hours into this. I understand this game is fantasy and magic is involved; however, unlike Skyrim where you can choose how far down that path you go, ESO shoves you face first into it. And its not magic ""skills"" - this is oozing with demonic overtones. Example: A quest had my character knocked out, taken to a sacrificial chamber, sacrificed with my soul removed, then transported to a pit that I needed to escape from. The demon in charge of this pit known as ""Molag Bal"". Among the many descriptions on Elder Scrolls wiki, it states ""King of Rape"" - seriously? You put this in a game?! Where the real demon names of history are ""Moloch"" and ""Baal"" - known for child sacrifice and other horrendous practices. Sorry, but I will never recommend your game to anyone.https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Molag_Bal""Molag Bal (Daedric: Daedric M.svgDaedric O.svgDaedric L.svgDaedric A.svgDaedric G.svgDaedric B.svgDaedric A.svgDaedric L.svg ""Stone-Fire"")[1] is the God of Schemes[2] and the Daedric Prince of domination and enslavement of mortals. He is also known by the titles King of Rape,[2] King of Strife,[UL 1] Schemer Prince, Harvester of Souls,[3] Father of Coldharbour and Lord of Lies.[4] He is the creator of Vampires and Xivkyn as well.[5]""_ _ _ _ _ _ This game had the potential to be great, but all it screams are money hungry devs. The scenery is awesome but you create scenes with little interaction or purpose to them, combat is not a challenge, NPCs respawn so quickly it a drag, and playing with friends is pointless with any form of quests because things don't share consistently or with any sense. I'll spend my game time on another game that is more rewarding than talking back and forth with a bunch of meaningless NPCs."
Negative,"**Warning for anyone playing on an M1 or M2 Mac**Despite insisting that ESO runs on Macs from mid-2017 onward, that now only applies to Macs that use Intel, not Apple's new silicone-based chips. If you plan on playing ESO on an M1 or M2 Mac, make sure you have a workaround like Bootcamp or Stadia, because it's not going to run on your Mac."
Negative,"don't buy this game if you're from the middle east, unless you are fine with +200 ping."
Negative,"Too expensive for an old game. DLCs are mandatory, no one plays base game content."
Negative,Game has bugs? its ok. Game have lag issues? its ok. Months and months later there's still random days people CAN'T PLAY? CAN'T LOG IN? No way. Its just a joke.
Negative,"Buy from the ESO website, not from Steam.The game itself is quite good, but for some reason the Steam version suffers from persistent connection problems (at least in the EU)."
Negative,"DLC, the game."
Negative,"game feels much slower then any other elder scroll, its more like final fantasy game. idk how i have 50 hours on this, half of that must of been sleeping. If an Enemy shoots an arrow at you, u jump behind a wall the arrow will still pass thru the wall/ rock / world and still hit you,its almost turn base combat. not your regular oblivion or skyrim fighting"
Negative,"This is an odd review to write. The game itself is good, like really good. As a single player, I would give a thumbs up without any doubt. But it's an MMO, so its servers have to work in order to play it, and the infrastructure is awful. With ridiculous and oddly timed weekly maintenance times. The weekly maintenance can take up to 8-14 hours, during those the clients can't play at all -other nowadays MMOs like Guild Wars 2 have servers that update in the back end, so that players don't have any downtime at all-. EU maintenance time is set on every Monday during day time (which is an extreme odd decision). That translates in the fact that many EU players can't play on Mondays at all. Never in my more than 20 years playing MMORPGs (since Ultima Online) I have experience such an awful infrastructure. Bear in mind that we are talking about a triple A premium MMORPG, where a lot of people pay monthly subscription fees. So it deserves a better technical care.I really can't understand how this could happen, because the game itself is good -with an insane amount of content at quite an expensive rate-, and definitely fun. Feels like the guys at maintenance want to kill the game the devs and artists created with so much care."
Negative,"First of all: This game has the potential to be both the best MMO on the market, as well as being a stellar RPG on its own. I'd normally recommend the game, but for the time being can't do so.ZOS, the studio behind ESO seems to have abandoned many of the core ideas of an MMO. Large-scale PVP is subject to unplayable lag, small-scale PVP cannot be done with friends, Endgame PVE is only about speedrunning content which thanks to very poor performance of servers also isn't viable.Thanks to far above average story lines, decent graphics and a massive world this game may still be a decent RPG for some people but in it's current state it's a disappointing MMO."
Negative,"Elder Scrolls Online has been out for several years now, and still has many issues. I'm unable to currently play the game for more than 5 min before it kicks me back to the login screen. No error message, no warning. Bathesda and Zenimax have continued to drop the ball on supporting and resolving issues with this game. Submitting a ticket is worthless. The game has so much potential as well to be a good MMO..."
Negative,"I like Skyrim and Fallout, but the MMO part does not work for me.  It makes the game feel more pointless with high respawn speed of enemies.  I also don't like enemies becoming immortal when you lure it outside its spawning radius and simply walks back to its spot.  So all interaction with enemies felt like a pointless grind.  I seem to be alone in this, because everybody else likes it - but oh well.  There's lots to do in the game, but it all felt pointless to me.  I noticed Fallout 76 uses the same formula, so I will skip that one and wait for Fallout 5 instead."
Negative,I just... don't. most of the hours on the counter were of fucking loading screens and of the game downloading and updating.
Negative,"i thought i would be playing this game allot, a mistake to buy this game, not much fun, not good graphix ... it is fine many people like it, its just not my taste."
Negative,so after a long time of play i see the real community of this game its horrible and bad people doesnt play as team with randos so dont quest in dungeon and so highly recommend playing ff14 instead of this crap
Negative,"Played it during the free week which is probably the only time I would play it.  Considering the game has:-DLC expansions-Micro-transactions-Payed, random loot drops -a ""Plus"" subscription that doubles as a season passit really should be free-to-play by default. I understand running games like these is financially demanding for the company, but it can get a little out of hand.  It really feels like it is banking off of the Elder Scrolls series for a cash grab. Overall, the game itself is not bad, but the amount of money one needs to put into compared to the amount of enjoyment I got is not worth it."
Negative,"I would just like to warn people regarding the content mechanics for this game.DLC is server based.. if you buy the content on one server, you have to RE-BUY on the other server.   DLC does not connect to account.   I am more than angry regarding this  because I have bought every DLC out there and i am expected to purchase over $2000 worth of crowns to buy it all over again.  Not happening.   I'm stuck on the EU server where I'm lucky to get 4 hours per day with people before the server population dies off.   The NA server is not much better as I am situated smack-bang in the middle of both server population off-peak times as I live in Australia.  the fact that I have purchased every house storage chest on top of the dlc content as well as 3 houses off the crown store - these are also server bound.Do not fall into the same grief that I have found myself in.  I utterly refuse to rebuy content for a different server when I've already bought the content and should have access to it especially since there is only two servers.  Subscription means you have access to all content regardless of server as its account bound.  Greymoor and Elsweyr are account bound also as they are steam store purchasable.   This set up is utterly ridiculous."
Negative,"Great game Steam and bethesda just dont give a !@#$ about steam player , dont buy it from steam"
Negative,"Downloaded the game, then downloaded and installed the launcher, launched the game and was told there was an update. downloaded the update. update would not unpack, repaired the game, then told there's not enough space update was 76mb (55GB free). Uninstalled the game! Waste of time download simulator."
Negative,"Awesome game, if you ever get to play it. After purchasing the game the only way I could get it to update was a stupid trick that involves disconnecting from the internet to keep the launcher from freezing then turning off automatic updates, this took me hours to figure out. Now I am unable to play the game again because it will update to 2% and the launcher freezes. I wish I could just refund it at this point but I have too many hours into it. Don't waster your money until they actually fix this problem, which won't be any time soon."
Negative,"Tried this during the free trail. In no way is this the worst MMO, but it's not great either (coming from FFXI, WoW, and then FFXIV background).  It does feel like a simpler version of Skyrim, yet with a convoluted user interface.  For example, the first thing I do with any MMO's is to change the settings and key bindings.  There's a function for literally every single key on your keyboard and then some (dodge rolling is preset only for controller).  It's simply overwhelming!  I just want the few keys I'll be needing around the WASD and then skills/magic from 1-9.  I don't want t, y, u, i, o, p, [, ], \, g, h, j, k, l, ;, ', b, n, m, ,, .. / to all have their own useful function!Being a completionist/pack rat, my bag was full after wading through the intro area They only give you 60 slots unless you buy the upgraded version (surprise.. surprise...).  When I get to a shop and try to sell the junk/crafting items, most of it sold for a whopping ZERO gold.  Well,I thought, maybe I can combine some of these mats to craft something.  That would open up a few slots. Nope. Don't have all the mats nor the recipe.  Enchanting is vastly different from Skyrim and provisioning (why not just call it cooking?) requires a recipe at every single turn.  The crafting system seems like it's geared more for mid to late game.  Too many variables in the crafting system different from Skyrim, and different means more new things I have to get use to.  I'm not going to do that when I'm still learning a new game.  I was like,""OK, as long as there's an auction house, I can still unload these without waste.""  Nope.  No auction houses.  How is that possible?  I went digging around online and it seems you need to join a trading guild to sell your items in their guild bank.  Why, Bethesda? I'm trying to enjoy the game. but it seems like they're slamming a wall into my face at every turn.By this time, I've had enough.  I just uninstalled the game.  Like I said, It's not the worst MMO, but it's not really ""polished"" either.  Maybe give it another year or so before trying again."
Negative,Do not buy this product from steam its better to buy thru the main website or something cause steam apparently have shitty servers cant connect at all. It is a great game though just not threw steam dont make the same mistake i did.
Negative,"Single player: THUMBS UPGroup questing: SO, SOGroup dungeon running: THUMBS DOWNI play MMOs to play with my friends that now live across several states. At first I was excited about this game. When it launched, playing in a group sucked and the wife and I had to leave it alone. We came back to it a year or so later and group questing had been mostly fixed and we enticed friends to join us. We had a good run for a while until we decided to run dungeons. We tailored our characters to have a dedicated tank, healer, and the rest for DPS. It didn't take long to figure out that there is no real aggro control in the game...or that aggro is horribly broken. Your healer could be around the corner and down the hall from the tank when he initiated combat and still half the mob would run past him and the DPS to engage someone they wouldn't have known was there. No buffs, no active heals, nothing! That is called broken. That is called poor design. The developers don't care, therefore I'm out. I like many things about the Elder Scrolls world, but good execution is necessary as well. I'll wait until something comes out that me and my friends can actually play together comes out that meets our interest and desires."
Negative,"""we collect your personal information"" that right there i cant recommend spyware to people, why you would ever need that instead of looking at in game statistic through your game for balancing purposes etc is beyond me.Which is a shame because the game wasnt overall bad, has a nice atmosphere and large world to explore with an okay combat system. Questing system was nice too and you even get daily login rewards to keep you playing the game and ease the grind. But that eula, that spyware eula is a big red flag for me and i am not recommending this game because of that. game devs/publishers need to stop this bad practice, collect data about the game from the game, not spy on people."
Negative,"Do I recommend this game? No, but it's still probably one of the best MMORPGs out there along with World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, Guild Wars 2, and others. However, I no longer play MMORPGs, so I cannot give a proper review.What I can say is that it's possible to play this on Linux via Proton, though it may require tweaking.See: https://www.protondb.com/app/306130PS: This game originally required a monthly subscription fee. Since going buy-to-play the developers have been focusing more on monetization and less on adding high quality content. There are multiple negative reviews from players with thousands of hours due to the direction the game has gone in. Take note of that, and do your own research before purchasing. The lowest recorded sale price (at the time of this writing) is $5.99 @ -70%."
Negative,"updIf u travel, dont buy GAME IN HOME REGION U TAKE PERM BAN I have it full version with all DLC.Zenimax answered for two weeks and refused to unban. Just lost money, pay for 18h gameplay."
Negative,Awful. Bland gameplay. Graphics worse them some of the oldest ES games. NEeds over 150GB to install. Then when you boot it up it needs another 100GB of updates. Now this week is needs ANOTHER 100GB of updates.
Negative,Its not that I do not like the game. It is just the fact that the game is a pay to play all around.
Negative,"Crash crash crash crash crash, months later and crash crash crash crash crash, never got to ever play this and money wasted, days and hours gone an thousands of help videos, blogs, even the official site to no help in any way, useless and just miserable time waste"
Negative,Was a great game! Until the login issue that was started 1 week ago https://steamcommunity.com/app/306130/discussions/0/3051633726587473775/Fix the login issue such similar issues cant continue 1 week for such a game.
Negative,"Lag, desync and constant disconnects make it unplayable so be warned.I have many hours in this game and this is mostly solo playing, as soon as more players are close by, game becomes unplayable and ping goes to 999. In the last few weeks it became orders of magnitudes worse. You can not make a few steps in game, most of my play time in last few weeks is spent on login screen or waiting for desync to pass so i can play normally.If that is fixed this would be a very good fantysy mmo and elder scrolls game.When that is fixed i will update my review and spend more time typing more extensive review.Just to add, in todays world where developers want to push games as a service, the least they can do is assure that their customers have good service, because like this its just taking money for no service. And i implore other gamers, no matter how much you like the game do not tolerate nothing less than spotless and perfect service. Would you tolerate a shoe store selling you ripped appart sneakers or a clothes store selling you hoodie with a torn sleave ?"
Negative,Overall I like the Elder Scrolls franchise but this game severely  left a bad impression for me I had to wait 3 days for it to download and I don't mean like on Steam I mean once I had the game downloaded it had to do an update so I had to run the game for 3 days so that ended up counting towards my refund time and by the time the three days were up and it completed the download my computer wouldn't run it and my computer at the time was far above the stats that were needed to run the game and now I've downsized and have a computer that definitely can't run it so all in all I would say don't get this game because I ended up spending 20 bucks on a game that I never got to play end this isn't like the day after I bought it or something this is like two years afterwards I just felt like ranting about something so oh well
Negative,I want to like this game but it's super boring and feels like a chore to play/level up. I might change this but right now it's just kinda meh for me.
Negative,crashes on loadup LUL
Negative,ITS VERY BORING!
Negative,It leaves you wanting to go play a real Elder Scrolls game.
Negative,"An overmonetized game built for MMO fans and not Elder Scrolls fans.If you like MMO's, give it a try, if you are a fan of the single player games, don't bother."
Negative,"""The servers are temporarily down for maintenance""""The servers are temporarily down for maintenance""""Please buy 5 minutes of content for 10$""""The servers are temporarily down for maintenance""""The servers are temporarily down for maintenance""""Please buy 5 minutes of content for 15$""""The servers are temporarily down for maintenance""""The servers are temporarily down for maintenance""""The servers are temporarily down for maintenance""""Enjoy this global update that has...nothing"""
Negative,I enjoyed it at first and it is a decent MMO but if you are looking for the stories and quests of previous Elder Scroll games you will not enjoy this one. The quests felt rushed and I wasn't satisfied with the progression. If you enjoy MMO's this will probably be up your alley but it does not compare to the other games
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME VIA STEAM!Great game but regular log in problems for steam users after an update. These happen quite a lot. If you want to play ESO just buy it directly from them, and save yourself the frustration."
Negative,"You have to buy the game, but then also pay for a subscription to gain access to the basics of buying housing and furniture. The combat in the overworld is far too easy and not challenging at all. Honestly as a person who grew up playing Bethesda games, I am so disappointed that they created such a money hungry game even though for years people have been begging to make Skyrim co-op."
Negative,"out of all the many MMO's i have played, this one is one of the bad ones.the combat feels so hollow.the quests dont really feel like there worth the effort.leveling your skills takes a long time.gaining levels doesn't really feel like there is a point.the fact that when you enter a dungeon, other players can also be there and kill everything in the way for a quest really ruins dungeons.overall, i dont think this is really worth playing. if the end game is better; well, i dont think its worth having to slog though all the grind to reach it.glad i at least got a chance to try the game."
Negative,They done F'd it up!!
Negative,"garbage, clunky boring combat, lack of content, and dull look."
Negative,~85 GB Download to then get to the Launcher and have to install every patch that has ever released for this game (70 GB patch = 1%) describes that quality and value of this game...It has none!
Negative,"A Pay to play. Lore is locked behind crown purchases. Waste of time and effort,"
Negative,There's a dog sitting on his master's grave located in the Alik'r Desert and you can't even pet him.0/10 would never play this game again.
Negative,*downloads game*Gaem is 78gbs woah das kinda biggame gets done downloadingyaygets ready to play game and have a good time*starts game* more downloadsi cri2 hours of downloads latererror downloading and have to restarti cri againprobably just gonna play more skyrim now
Negative,"I want to love this game, I really do, but I just can't. There are a number of reasons for my inability to recommend this game but the primary reason is that actually playing the game is something you rarely get to do. I may have about 20 hours 'game time' as of writing, but I've probably only actually played the game for 10 hours at most. It is simply impossible to log in without an error most of the time, and you're disconnected after an hour at most, rendering you sitting on the login screen for several hours before you can get back in. This is, quite simply, utterly unacceptable.Another reason for my negativity is the price of the game. You might think it's a bargain to get a game for £15 with an expansion, but it includes only the base game and that single expansion. If you add up the prices for all the other expansions not included, it will easily run you over £100. In any other MMO you get free content updates every couple of months, but here you'll be expected to shell out £15 to access the new dungeons/zones/quests EVERY SINGLE TIME. There's a sub fee, too, which gives you the 'full experience' - by which I mean it gives you temporary access to some of the expansions but NOT THE LATEST ONE, so you have to pay £20 for that on top of it all. Oh, and I forgot to mention that there's also a slew of real-money cosmetics including a whole lot of stuff locked inside £5 loot boxes that usually only pay out garbage. It's clear that the developers wanted to squeeze every last dime out of their whales for this. Whoops, I forgot to mention that there are also exp boosters and pay-to-win items in the store, too. Oh well.Yet another negative is that non-dungeon content entirely scales to your level, meaning that outside of level-locked dungeons, you are just as powerful at max level as you are when you begin the game, give or take, and you can decide to immediately go and fight 'legendary' beasts from the outset without being at a significant disadvantage. This has led to another issue which is that it's laughably easy for people to create accounts and immediately set up bots that can farm world bosses, devaluing your accomplishments further.There's a lot of good to be spoken about in the game, but until the most prominent issue is fixed - ie. the inability to actually play most of the time - it's not worth mentioning and I just cannot recommend this game to anyone."
Negative,"Servers are super laggy.  Customer Service does not exist.  You need to constantly spend money to stay competitive.  Not a little bit of money but thousands of dollars.  Playing without ESO+ isn't an option due to all of the crafting items so you HAVE TO PAY.  There is no way around it, you will run out of bank space.  Even if you had 1 main character and the rest bank alts you'd run out of space without ESO+.  Did i mention the Customer support sucks?  Also bots.  Lots of bots.  TONS OF BOTS.  If you are a pve'r or an rp'er you're gonna have a bad time with bots.  Pvper?  goodluck in the laggy pvp zone.  You'll die to invisibile things."
Negative,"Hope you like the look of the launcher, because that's where you're gonna be spending most of your time if you wanna play this game. Take a break for a month or 2 and expect to have to do a complete re-install. Then once you have downloaded the latest 50gb patch, wait for it to verify integrity and then redownload 40gb of it again. And again. And again... Applying patch? Not a chance. Gets 50% of the way thru, freezes completely forcing you to shut launcher down. Re launch just to have it start the download from the start.Says 565 hours played but I can say without exaggeration that around 150 hours of that is trying to download an update and get the bloody thing to start"
Negative,"Not seeing the quality to justify the price tag here, thought maybe it might have been updated considering the lack of price drop. Game past its time or something, the art style and gameplay aren't doing it any favors. Lit a guard on fire by accident, that was fun. I guess if you really liked skyrims combat give it a whirl otherwise I don't really see a reason to pick this up."
Negative,"""Okay you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?"" - Dagoth Ur"
Negative,Ill change it when they un nerf biting jabs.
Negative,Skyrim is better lol
Negative,"Game looks good, until you get into combat, which is just horrible. I cannot describe my disappointment enough, it completely lacks impact and skill selection is very boring (Do you want to deal 100 damage now or 80 damage now and 20 damage overtime). And it doesnt feel any different which skill you are using. My fingers actually started to hurt after smashing same 1-2 keys after just 10 minutes of combat.Edit: Developer has responded that they have changed combat, I have checked out the game again and nothing what I have talked about have changed, so I dont know what they are talking about."
Negative,"Plenty of content, lore, quests, areas to explore... but also plenty of grinding for gear.  And when you're done grinding, your build is complete, and you're confident and competent enough to get comfortable - time for a patch, update, or otherwise complete undoing of core game mechanics that forces another month of grinding.  Pure meh of a game.  Excellent if you like mindless grinding, because behind the quests and the mini games... it's just grinding with extra steps."
Negative,"This game is so slow!!! Half the time I get a server time out message after just trying to log in. Might be fun to fool around with for free but definitely DON'T SINK ANY MONEY INTO THIS!!!Update: Started a new character the other day and every time I enter a zone for the first time I get DC'd. Servers are crap, heard they have no plans of updating them, and they still release DLC that is the cost of a full game (around $60 US) all the time that has features you cannot access unless you pay, even if you are a subscriber. So my revision would be... they aren't concerned with their supporters, just trying to milk you for $60 here and $60 there all the while hoping you eventually break down and pay them monthly on top of that! DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME!!!"
Negative,"It's just another MMORPG only it happens to be in the Elder Scrolls universe. I tried to get into it but then my account gets randomly unlinked and I can't log back in no matter what even though my account isn't banned or anything. I contacted Zenimax/Bethesda Support and the best they gave me was copy-paste responses from Forum posts that were not the answers I was looking for in the first place. The conversation was essentially ended with ""I don't know, go buy it again I guess.""So, summary: if you like throwing hundreds of hours and dollars at MMORPG's you'll love this, no shortage of purchases here. Just hope you don't ever have to contact ""support"" or if you do I hope it's better than what I was given."
Negative,"I?m just not recommending for a couple of issues, even if I actually like the game beneath these 2 non-game issues:1) The launcher cheats on playtime: When you close the game the laucher will anyway  stay open, not really hidden yet easily unnoticed in the tray, inflating articially as drammatically your game playtime.2) Double dipping B2P (... F2P) and subscription costs, and also involving gambling mechanics!: even if you're a fully paying customers, you bough all the expansions and/or all the DLCs, and too you paying your subscriptions there are still items which can't be bought with neither the in-game earnable (F2P) currency (endeavours) and neither with the premium curency (crowns) included in the sub.Indeed there are some items sold only for ""Gems"", and you can earn  Gems only by first buying f!#*ing Lootboxes, and then wait for it.... losing at them! I mean that in the ""disgraced"" possibility you won't find anything useful inside that lootbox then you can convert those items from the Lootbox finally into Gems. This is a bit like those derivates finacial products from the 2008 financial crisis which betted on people not being able of paying for their mortages: Thank you, BUT NO THANK YOU! And f@#! your game shop too! There is already a subscription, I'd like to pay a subscription so I don't have to deal continually with a freaking game shop!Pity because the game even if old now is quite well crafted, there are a lot of details, like random critters here and there everywhere, and the bards songs is a thing I kinda learned to love."
Negative,"Heavy monetization for what should be base features, too small inventory that inconveniences you within the first few hours.  For a buy to play game, it's not worth the cost of admission, the fact the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild are DLC and not base game is insulting to anyone who has played the Elder Scrolls series.  Combat is bland and boring like an unmodded Skyrim but worse somehow. Graphics are nice, it's TES so the world itself is interesting to move through, there's stuff to do but always a microtransaction/DLC lurking behind it.  Crafting Bag as Sub only is cancer.  Worse monetization than SWTOR somehow which is funny considering one is F2P and the other B2P.  For B2P to B2P comparison, GW2 has much more relative inventory space and cheaper/easier/faster expansion of inventory for FAR less time/grind/real-money than ESO, and the default amount given for free is so sufficient many vets claim inventory upgrades a waste of money.  Compare that stance with ESO where crafting bags are the number one reason people sub to ESO according to many players.  The one thing that should never happen is running into cash shop derived inconveniences in the first few hours of gameplay.  Basic Elder Scrolls factions being DLC such the Thieve's Guild when stealing is a base game feature is ridciulous.  The fact DLC hides skill trait lines for such a basic mechanic behind paywalls associated with such is just icing on the cake and especially egregious for a B2P game like this.  Game just feels low quality in the most important aspects and is being propped up by it's IP similar to SWTOR, but nostalgia and thirst for more Elder Scrolls content/story let's them get away with milking their fans unnecessarily and in service to a lower quality game because they have no incentive to improve.  Stay away, wait for TES6 or mod Skyrim for the hundredth time."
Negative,"The game is ridiculously large. After downloading, has further patches to download. While downloading these patches, it counts towards your play time, so if you don't have a fast internet connection, say good bye to your refund window.The game itself - it's nothing like Oblivion, Skyrim or any of those titles. Yes, the lore is there, and there is a lot of content, but it doesn't share the play style of the original games. This feels like World Of Warcraft in a Skyrim setting. The world is huge, many things to do and quests, it feels like a WOW 2.0.I got the game as I was a fan of the original titles, and adding ""online"" to it made me believe it's literally Skyrim with multiplayer. It's far from it, and although this game will suit many people, it's just not my cup of tea."
Negative,"Update:  Customer service is now terrible, game balance is not their concern, only selling crown store items.  Most people who played for a while have quit due to lack of meaningful content. The whole if you want to be a super good invisible pvper is still relevant as one of the devs babies the class they play in pvp. Oh and they also nerfed the new class when they said the weren't going to and it was how they wanted it.  Must have hit their sales needed. Customer Service 10/10, However the developers are probably the dumbest people when it comes to content and game balance.  Fun till you're max level/CP then the ""Play how you want"" turns into everything is nerfed except the current meta then that gets nerfed so everything is uselsss.  If you like thinking you are very good at games playing a rogue however, this is the game for you."
Negative,"Just bought the game and right off the bat I had an issue. Can't run it for some reason that eludes me. My issue is a common one and has been happening to other users for some time now however Steam and Zenimax found it best to leave it to their customers to fix this damn game for them.The first time you download this from steam you'd think you can run it at once but no, Zenimax will make you download files from their server that will consume a good amount of time (in my case 4 hours). And to add insult to injury, I found out that I can't issue a refund for this faulty game - the additional download time from Zenimax, made me uneligible for a refund which sucks.Now i'm stuck with a game I can't run and I can't refund. My review - 0/10Avoid this like a plague.Update: Managed to fix the buggy launcher of this overrated game all thanks to the players who posted the solution. I'd give this game a positive review if they fix this for the future players who'll buy this game."
Negative,"Game that is being sold but then additionally basicly requiers you to buy a subsrciption to enjoy it properly. With its DLC hell rivaling Paradox interactive and nearly non existant story and very boring story telling that exists, this game is not a good Elder scrolls games, it repeats the same issue TES franchise had since Oblivion up untill Skyrim. This game has nothing special going on for it other than multiplayer. Combat is borderline like in a randomly generated mobile game, grind is reaching War Thunder levels and a lot of stuff being locked behind a paywall that is either DLC or subscription. If you want to buy this game to enjoy the world of TES? Dont buy it.If you wanto buy this game to have fun and enjoyable MMO RPG? Dont buy itIf you want to spend a lifetime before your PC just to get on a proper power level to have ""fun""? Feel free to buy it.If you are a whale that will suck a dick of a corporationa and pay them monthly just for existing? Feel free to buy it.At the end I just want to add that this game represents EVERYTHING wrong with TES franchise, and its one of the many games that emobides corporate greed and is cattered to people that are willing to spend shitload of money just because.Im not the poorest person, and Im not the richest, but this game will assume that you are working a rich enough to afford all DLC's subscriptions and all additional payments. The real price of this game should be a combined price of all DLC's, 10 years worth of subscription and then what ever the price is currently on sale. That price you see while looking at the game in Steam Store is a lie, dont fool yourself."
Negative,Pls add oceanic server
Negative,I wish they would go back to the single player versions.  Skyrim was a classic.   MMORPGS are not fun to play any more.
Negative,some how worse then Destiny 2
Negative,This is a great game but do not buy it through steam if you actually want to play it.
Negative,"Just a big time suck with little in the way of true excitement. I've loved other Elder Scrolls games and the Fallout series. But this, yawn. 30 hours in and very little accomplished. This is like watching and NBA or MLB regular season, no drama and just a slog to get through. I don't have time for that, too many things to do."
Negative,"So far Tamriel has been quite boring. Other players kill enemies on your quest whilst they are doing the same one, so it's so easy to finish them which is highly irritating. The only good thing I have to say, is that the music is good, as well as visually, but nothing spectacular and definitely not what to expect if you have played the original Elder Scrolls games. Will update when I've played more hours, but so far, I am not impressed at all."
Negative,Terrible connection and game support. This is the second weekend the servers are offline for steam users. And I bought this game only 2 weeks ago. Money wasted...
Negative,"Unengaging combat, boring story, terrible devs, dogshit gamesave your money"
Negative,"I wish i didnt spend 20 dollars on this, i couldve had a month of game time in WoW and some money left to buy icecream.The game is stale, slow, buggy, boring, laggy, terribly unbalanced, heavly dlced, shows slight signs of pay to win and so much more. Usualy i dont post reviews but i do only for games that i am extremley dissapointed in.Saying that alot of aspects have been covered in other reviews so i wont repeat them, one thing no one mentioned tho is how the developers legit cut the content from the base game and offer you the shit you payed for as a fucking DLC.Want to craft all your gear? nope gotta buy dlcWant to visit thiefs guild? nope gotta buy dlcWant to do dark brotherhood thingies? steal stuff and assasinate people? nope gotta buy dlcWant to visit all of the zones that YOU PAID FOR, nope gotta buy dlcWant access to all available spells and passives in the game? nope gotta buy dlcBut atleast they dont cut your charracters bags,stamina and mounted speed and offer them as a ""subscription bonus only"" right? WROOOONG!They time gate your mounted speed, your inventory space and your mounted stamina behind a 1 skill per day and there is 180 of them to max it, they do this to encourage you to buy ""tomes"" from their shop to speed it up.And your inventory space is pourposefully rigged so that you will never have enough space no matter what, unless you pay up or play atleast 2000 hours or buy subscription offcourse.But atleast they dont go as far as to force you to buy expansions with so much transactions  in the game already right?  WROOOOOOOOOOOOONG!They even dare to lock the class behind an expansion to trick you into buying it. And all of this and so much more, is just a cherry on the top.i dont feel like wasting my time any further on this poor cash grab of a game, so i wont go into too much detail about the unforgiving nature of the game to the new players, unforgiving grindfest to the point where it rivals mobile games with its micro transactions and time gating with absolutley no fun involved.Never has a mmorpg made me ask my self the question ""why am i doing this?"" so god damn fast. I absolutley do not recommend this game.wEDIT:I forgot to mention the community. Immagine league of legends community on steroids.Toxic childish and borderline mentaly handicaped."
Negative,"Although this game has many great features, there is a basic function that should be in the game to keep players knowing its a balanced MMO RPG, the function I speak of is the Cross Purchasing Format between character's you created. The Pay for Currency in Elder Scrolls Online or what the game calls ""Crowns"" is a simple way to just get a lot of unique looking items but the only way you can get a reasonable amount of ""Crowns"" is by online transactions. Paying for this in-game Currency will be sent to your Elder Scrolls Online account but this is the part that makes this system very unbalance and makes the game look, ""Money Grabby"". The Online Currency is sent to your account but purchasing items that you should be able to access to all your characters that you have created on the game is a great way to keep player playing. For example if you have played the Elder Scrolls Online for a long time and you have spent a fair amount of money on the game and you wish to start knew again, you will suddenly realize that the term ""Role Playing Game"" has become a lot harder to do in your own way because the game dose not have that Cross Purchase System for you to enjoy the money you spent on the game, which would lead to the boringness of players that can't use there well paid for items and would eventually lead to players not playing the game anymore. The game has a lot to offer but its the small details that people will notice and will lead to the biggest problems. Therefor I recommend not being the ""Pay to Win"" type of player on this game for the fact that you cant manage what you should be able to control, simply just play the game like any old original Elder Scrolls game but online and with friends."
Negative,"I really love this game, i'm a new player from asia and it sucks because every time i try to go in a building it always has an error afterwards, that's my only problem with this game, i don't recommend this game if you're from an asian country.I would absolutely be glad if you make a server for asia, i deleted this game for now because the lobby error is frustrating"
Negative,"This game is well worth its money, JUST DO NOT BUY IT FROM STEAM!!!!!!!!!!Go to bethesda/zenimax directly and buy it there. If you buy it on steam you will encounter weekly bouts of not being able to log in with no other option than to log in through steam. Getting to the point I am actually thinking about just starting over and abandonning steam all together."
Negative,"The game ceased to be fun for me after Morrowind. Also, with how often it breaks, I can't really get back into playing it. It will not launch on my mac or gaming pc currently. It is playable on Stadia with mouse and keyboard right now, but controller support is badly bugged and of course, stadia is gonna disappear soon, so thats about worthless. Ultimately, this is a game that died years ago. they just keep making dumber and dumber expansions to grab more money in classical Bethesda fashion. Its not horrible, but its not great, and you may or may not even be able to play at any given moment."
Negative,This game has nothing to do with the original.It is repetetive and money sucking game.When i started playing it was a full game but now they cut it in few pieces and if you want to play it you need to buy all the dlc'c otherwise you wont be able to complete many quests.How much more money does this company need.People already paid for the game and now you need to buy dlc's and other stuff.No thank you....
Negative,"Great game but NOT RECOMMEND it because:1. Crashes a lot (only this game from my whole steam library)2. Dozens of bugs, really, almost everything is bugged here.3. Problems with login to server (not only for me)."
Negative,"been playing this game for over 7 years and 2022 appears to be the poison pill. Servers are down way too often, error messages (and support staff) all suggest problem is on my end, despite a plethora of people online reporting the same errors at the same time. The game has gotten too large where their customer service is too afraid to rock the boat and put the breaks on releases due to identified bugs, so error after error gets promoted to production, causing untold problems, and when that happens time and time again, at some point it has to be the final straw. The game has consistent and neat ""events"" with cool objectives and prizes, but half the time you cant log in, so what's the point. I get this game has been around a long time and aging infrastructure and yada yada yada, but I know they have enough money that shouldn't be an issue. The downtime and lack of professional support might make this the end of the road."
Negative,"DO NOT buy this on Steam:You will likely not be able to refund if you don't like it or can't play it.  The game will download via steam and like many other MMOs will use it's launcher for patches and such....despite having a 300mpbs internet it took roughly 4 hours to download the recent patches from the launcher, it then took about 2 days to finally log in as there were odd steam issues when I bought it.  By the time I got to play it and wanted a refund my time limit had lapsed.I am a 15 year Steam user with a large library that I have purchased throughout the years and have never asked for a refund, I figured this would not be a big deal having only bought it 2 days with 6.5 hours on my library of downloading and getting it to launch.  I was denied as was my appeal.Actual Game Review: I eventually bought this a few months later from Amazon and use the official launcher, runs a lot smoother no issues connecting so definitely go that route.  As far as the game itself I still personally would not recommend it as it feels like a clunky, more paywalled, non-cartoony version of GW2.  It also feels as though ESO really tries to nickel and dime with xpacs, subs, AND a shop that has some P2W aspects to it.  I think their current fans have the ""frog in a boiling pot of water"" effect regarding defending the current business model."
Negative,"Too much money is asked for the content provided.This ""game"" is more akin to a paid marketplace for microtransactions.The dialogue is incredibly poor, for two reasons:1. World Breaking Language (i.e. using ""certify"" and other variations of the word to effectively prove that I am a capable craftsman of a trade) 2. Tonal inaccuracies in voice acting (i.e. loudly speaking or shouting in a normal conversational setting)*The Crafting Certification NPC in Davon's Watch is a perfect example of both these issues*After purchasing the better of the two options for this game on Steam I was unpleasantly shocked by how much content I was not privy to without more financial transactions."
Negative,"OS X ISSUES:Since Morrowind, ESO has been ported to Metal. Thus the requirements listed on this page are inaccurate as of 08/2020. It will NOT RUN on an operating system older than Mac® OS High Sierra v 10.13. Furthermore, ESO does not run reliably on Catalina at this time, though an update is said to be upcoming.Bought this for an older Mac workstation after checking requirements. Turns out, can't play it either way for now. Not fit for purpose, and neglected - it's not like the requirement switch is a recent thing if you look elsewhere for info.Feel free to comment and update this note whenever the situation changes, or if you have a work-around."
Negative,"If the reagent bag wasn't behind a subscription, so that I can loot a bunch of crafting materials, I would throw this to my friends and play with them. Other than that in particular major upset, 7/10."
Negative,"It's a Skyrim-lite MMO. The quests are a mess to play with friends and boring to play alone. The content scaling makes everything feel pointless. Endless inventory shuffling and mindless combat.The lore is nice, but you can easily find it elsewhere.Really not fun."
Negative,"Currently the worst Elder Scrolls game I have ever played, and I've played almost all of them. This is what happens when game developers only care about squeezing you for every dime in your pocket and have no respect at all for the fans of the franchise their project is a part of. ZOS and Bethesda should be ashamed of themselves, but they are not. And I have begun to doubt we will ever see a good Elder Scrolls game again..."
Negative,"TLDR - If you play exclusively within a guild, do not mind the obtrusive monetization and can deal with the combat which at times resembles more dodge ball than MMO, this might be a game for you. [EDIT]---Mixed feelings about this one. This review is written from the point of view of a solo player, being part of a guild will obviously greatly change your experience.On one hand it is a very mature MMO, which provides tons of content and has had ample time to work out most its kinks over the years (some random bugs / bad design decisions notwithstanding). There is plenty of lore to explore and a variety of time sinks to choose from.On the other hand it is barely playable as a ""free-to-play"" (or at least requires very high levels of discipline) and its monetization model seems to be based (more or less) on selling more power with each new chapter / DLC that is released. As a results the power gap between the average player with good gear and solid build vs. the elite 1% (or maybe 0,1%) is something like 3-5 X. To make matters worse, the power gap between relatively new max level player and an average player can be another 3-5 X. Having players with power (mainly DPS) differences up to 10-20 times being exposed to the same content (as is the case if you get the ESO+ subscriptions) creates its own issues. It appears that the only solution the developers have been able to come up with the upper end of the power creep scale is to pepper boss encounters (at the veteran level) with one-shot mechanics. The problem is that these mechanics are challenging only as long as you do not have the needed reflexes or do not know the choreography you are expected to perform. So at the end to the day these mechanics are either trivial or impossible, depending on your skill level and knowledge.One ESO community specific feature seems to be that many players are fine with queuing to random dungeons as a tank or healer even if they have no intent to slot any skills or gear needed to perform the role. So each random dungeon with a pick-up group truly is a box of chocolate."
Negative,"I played the original beta when that came out. I bought this game back when it was Tamriel Online, didn't touch it much for a while and then just got back into it because a friend wanted to play. When he just bought it, it came with Morrowind. I don't have Morrowind DLC because they decided people who already bought this game don't get it. I went to go check how much it would be. I'd have to buy crowns and it would end up being $30 worth of crowns to get this DLC. I bought the original game for $10. My friend just bought the game plus Morrowind for $20. So, now I'm paying more than my friend because I bought this game years back? Nah. Calling this a loss of $10."
Negative,"Hmmm... I have a problem with the description of the game.""Join over 18 million players""......Clearly they can't count.""No game subscription required""You won't enjoy the game without a stupid subscription.""Experience limitless adventure in a persistent Elder Scrolls world...""They misspelled lag... it is not spelled ""adventure"".""Battle, craft, steal, or explore, and combine different types of equipment and abilities to create your own style of play.""..annnddd watch your style of play get nerfed to the ground."
Negative,Still riddled with disconnection issues and long queue times to re enter the game.
Negative,"cant get past loading screen, make sure you have a pretty good setup before you buy. My pc can play most things but this just seems to not work."
Negative,"Bought the 4 pack DLC. Set up my account, got an activation email then tried to log in.  ""Access Code required""   Supposedly sent to the same email account I just set up my TESO account with.  Nothing after an hour.   Went to TESO support page, and ironically you need an ""access code"" for Support, whihc I requested and got immediately.   Sent in my support request and tried a dozen more times to genreate an access code.  Nothing,  Now we're 12 hours later and no response from the tech support people other than the silly ""check your junk mail"" responses.  I get thier email.  It's not on my side.  Pathetic customer support as I can't access the game I paid for."
Negative,When you take a step back and look at this MMO you will realize its the worst game ever made. Its not the worst game ever made because of the gameplay. its the worst game ever made because of how Zenimax and Bethesda have cherry picked the worst MMO grind mechanics and incorporated them into this game to make it feel like a soulless DLC and paywall ridden garbage heap. How am i supposed to like a game that cant even have stable servers for PVE content let alone the lag nightmare that is PVP. But they will still keep advertising PVP double xp events! because PVP isnt broken! just forget that the end game PVP is trash and broken and do these double xp PVP quests! you will continue to love this game because you cant stop playing terrible MMOs! (that is how the company thinks of you when you pay to play their broken trash game) the PVP is some of the worst MMO PVP you will ever experience. If i have one solid piece of advice it would be to do everyone you know and yourself a favor and get a life instead of playing this game that makes you feel like a worthless troglodyte.
Negative,"Game crashes constantly and every time I start it, it plays the intro videos and cinematics and makes me accept the TOS. Very annoying. Not worth the trouble trying to make it work."
Negative,"game sucks, not at all what they advertise in the trailer"
Negative,Dead community. Proabably not a wow killer.
Negative,"The game is more broken then ever and has hit an all time performance low.  Unfortunately, we are all getting so used to how shitty performance is, that we have become happy when it sort of works.  Do yourself a favor, buy something else in the mean time and enjoy, wait for them to finally fix the performance issues before playing.  Updated, believe it or not performance has actually gotten worse since I posted this review.  You could get many more hours of fun from other games for less than it costs to play this game anymore - don't waste your money."
Negative,"I've tried this game twice. Once several years ago, and recently in 2024. If I were to try summarise using one word, it would be boring. I really don't get the catch of this game. The new player experience is very confusing, there's a lot going on with the inventory and UI, and will have you looking up if you're even doing the main quest. The combat feels floaty and very repetitive. It seems to have different moves like a counter and dodge but it literally doesn't matter. You go around killing things in about 3 hits and the poor enemies tickle you to death after about a minute of standing completely still. All the enemies feel pointlessly placed around as well. They just stand there, you don't even have to attack them, just run past. They only seem a bit concerned if you get within a couple meters of them. Especially when doing any side quests. The rewards are rubbish, and so it all feels like pointless busy work, running around not actually achieving anything. This didn't used to be the case when I first tried the game, but now the main quest has this really strange feature. You finish a main quest and the prophet will be like, ah yes I need time to think this over, come back to me later. So you leave the cave, walk away about 10 meters and then he appears again saying the time has come and he is ready now. Like what? Bro I was just standing next to you, but everytime I want to move onto the next main quest I need to leave the cave and then come back in. It also has an egregious cash shop. It has a massive catalogue of absolute rubbish you can spend real money on with price tags that are laughable. Being a mmo I know it's not really comparable to the previous titles but it lacks any of the charm of the previous games and feels safe, far too easy and pointless busy work without any engaging gameplay."
Negative,"This is the most unstable mmo ever, constant lags, people cheat in pvp and the developer does nothing, except waiting for you to spend your money."
Negative,"What a disappointment and an upsetting, boring game."
Negative,"PvP is absolute garbage, crafting is overly complicated. Cash grab is insane for DLC that barely gives you anything. No CC break, which is standard in all MMOs. No mass taunt for dungeons. They failed this game. Hard."
Negative,If you wanna play WoW but not feel as ashamed... but you still should be...
Negative,"The game is average at best as long as you are a ""Member"", if you are not this game is just a big pile of micro transactions, and they are not cheap in the slightest..."
Negative,"I got this game with humble bundle  monthly, It's not a bad game, but I don't feel it has the same magic that draws you in like other elder scroll games\ bethesda games. I'll continue to play it to see if I change my mind, but for now unless it's on sale, I don't recommend getting it."
Negative,"Sadly WoW is batter and I was hoping that this would replace it.  I have leveled every type of character and still the game is unbalanced between the classes after a year of play.  They made it free to play and yet the game still suffers from low player numbers.  The graphics are amazing and the combat is simple, but the game has nothing for end game content."
Negative,"Great game until you get to max level. It is one heck of a journey up there. Really enjoyed experiencing everything the game had to offer. But, once you get to end game, it turns into a diablo 3 style grind, where you are doing highly repetitive grinds in order to reach higher champion levels. Not worth it once you get to the champion system."
Negative,"Wouldn't recommend - Even with ESO Plus, you still have to buy some chapters to unlock them. Play Guild Wars 2 instead."
Negative,"maybe if the game fucking worked it would be good, had to troubleshoot it for two hours before getting the launcher to open. get your shit together"
Negative,spent 2 hours downloading the game and cant create an account. the UI is so scuffed and bad. refund incoming
Negative,The only game I've ever had removed from my Steam account
Negative,"Pretty good game. One Tamriel kind of ruined it for me, no challenge in any of the sprawling huge and beautiful world that you want to explore, except dungeons that arent made for solo players. Good quests and pvp"
Negative,"It's not a bad MMORPG, but it is a typical one. If you are looking for an elder scrolls experience you will be disappointed. If you are looking for an elder scrolls themed typical MMORPG then you may like this one."
Negative,after not playing for 3 months due to computer issues i can no longer log in using both my steam details or my eso details i have reset my password and still nothing paid 50 quid for this and now they dont even pick up the fone to answer
Negative,"Just a typical TAB-targeting themepark MMO with a TES skin. Overall pretty mediocre in all regards and offers nothing that other games haven't done better. Also features a predatory MTX store and a basically required subscription on top of it, a downright insulting combination."
Negative,"I really want to like this game. It makes MMO style questing fun, with expansive, interesting and well written stories, along with great voice acting. It hits upon a lot of what makes the Elderscrolls universe fun. The skills system is interesting, and fairly unique to ESO. However, this is yet another game with some good potential, ruined by greedy out of touch publishers. Everytime I log in, I'm bombarded with ads for the in-game store, reminding me that it's still there. The exploitative loot box system is steathily hidden behind F3, with a ""Shadow of War-esque"" character tauting you to buy more loots boxes. To make it even worse, the vast majority of cosmetic microtrasations are of poor quality, and not worth the hundreds of crows reuqired to purchase them. Although the cosmetics count for little, the numerous quests that are shut off behind DLC walls is absurd. The base game gives you a taste of questing, only to reminds you everytime you log in that a good portion of those quests are behind pay walls. I can stomach MMO releasing a large expasion once a year, but story based DLC is frustrating. I really want to like ESO. But if you hate everything about exploitative business models, then your time in ESO should stop at this review page."
Negative,If you liked Skyrim and you think that playing ESO as a single player might give you a similar experience.  It wont.  Whilst some of the stories are of a similar type the combat is awful.
Negative,Why full game + morrowind is cheaper than buying morrowind as addition?
Negative,10/10 would buy to not play again.
Negative,bullshit failed login simulator. Impossible to play. just dont buy. fuck this!
Negative,"It is Stupid that you need the base eso online to buy eso Plus. However you can't just buy eso base game anymore, you need to buy 39 dollar morrowind edition. The point of hjaving eso plus is to get the expansions for free. Why shouldn't have to buy an expansion to get eso plus."
Negative,"The game has many PROS but also many CONS. I will start with the CONS because everyone usually wants to see what is deal breaking first and formost.https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-whales-of-microtransactions-and-the-elephant-in-the-room1, Combat is slightly better than that of world of warcraft, but it still has some nonsensicle features world of warcraft has. For instance, projectiles, attacks, spells, all have some sort of auto guided mechanic which can in essance chase you down, go through walls or even around walls to still hit you. It is not a combat type of game where you get headshots, shot placement matters, or revolves around skill. The combat winner is basically who is semi competant and has the best gear or and stats.2, CRAFTING BAG. ESO non subscribers do not have it. Say you buy the game and even some of the DLC, guess what. You still get hit with SCUMMY F2P inventory management tactics. Talk about nonsense and dirty. This simple thing, will make non subscribers have to manage inventory in such a way you spend more time deleting items out of your inventory than you do actually playing the game itself. This is a hardcore slap on the face to everyone who bought the game and DLC. If they changed just this thing alone, I am sure many negative reviews would change and it wouldnt be ""mixed"" on the market. Hell Id even change my review. Yes you can increase your inventory space with gold on your hero and in your bank but it is extremely expensive and there is a limit to both. You still run out of room and have to keep ""deleting"" items.3. The game does not resemble Morrowind, or the other zones from the franchise. Sure there are similarities, but most things are either taken out of the game or shrunk down immensely.4. Housing again, hit with F2P mechanics that limit what you can do in said housing5 Stats. You have Health, Stamina and Magica. You will most likely ONLY pick one of them do to how the game is made and the mechanics within it, which is insanely build limiting and feels like it was made for a more ""casual audiance"".6. BOUND ITEMS.... Seriously, companies still try to push bound items? Yes this is one of them, unfortunately. A shady thing especially coupled with ""loot"" only found in certain DLC dungeons you cannot even trade to people outside of the party you found it with. Whys this an issue? Well you need the DLC to be able to wield this gear and it is becoming a trend that new DLC dungeons have better gear than previous dungeons.7. Bugs, there are lots of bugs, everywhere from visual bugs to things not rendering or things rendering incorrectly, to technical or even server dropping bugs. One minute you can be shooting your bow, the next minute your bow is visually on the ground and you are shooting arrows through your hands, another minute you get feared through a wall during a dungeon boss fight and your team dies because you were the tank and you are now stuck behind a wall outside of the level. Doing a boss fight and the boss teleports outside of the bosses fight range? Well you get to do the entire fight all over again because he just healed to 100% Health points. Boss mauled you with its bear skill even though you are 10 feet away from where the skill actually hit? Too bad, you just got one shot as the tank, now your whole team dies because they arent tanks. Its a sad predicament because these bugs have been here since release but bethesda feels its more profitable to ignore bugs and just smash out lazily done shallow DLC for the fanboys/whales.8. Queing for dungeons takes insanely long if you dont pick tank, or dont form the entire party yourself. Anywhere from 30 minutes wait to over an hour if you que by yourself without being tank.9. Some people, a substantial number of them are unable to log into their game, and has been like this for quite a while. This usually happens via STEAM but it may happen outside of steam. This is a huge problem if you were foolish enough to sub for ESO+. You waste your subscription time and they do not reimburse you, nor do they attempt to fix your login problem. There are numerous posts about this pretty much everywhere.PROS1. Graphics are pretty decent, frames run pretty great2. The game is very large, although not anywhere near as large as the ""original"" franchise zones, and the maps feel like they just randomy plopped down mobs to populate areas. But there are dungeons and stuff to keep you occupied.3. Its multiplayer4. You can occasionally get free skins, mounts and houses from daily's and events. Also in november they will give you a free DLC, so these here are HUGE pros, but in my opinion the pros so far do not outweigh the cons."
Negative,"This game is ridiculously outdated. Graphics came from the last century. Characters look ugly (not only mine, but also other players). Everything more or less decent (not even good) is hidden behind a subscription. Monetization is off the charts. Very annoying crafting system. The stories are no worse or better than other MMOs. Completely lost interest in this game after 100 hours."
Negative,"Time/Life sucker.  Hours melt by so quickly that you won't notice how long you've been online.  The character customization alone could take an hour if you really scrutinized.  Lots of land to explore, quests to solve, levels to gain but this type of game goes beyond mere entertainment.  This because of the time requirements a player needs to level up and play through the content.  And, after all of the hours spent, when you look back will you say ""I'm glad I spent my life on this.  It was worthwhile.""  ?The game direction is very dark and oriented around factions with cult worship.  The character race choices are really cheesy.  Humans with human heads,  humans with lizard heads, humans with feline heads.  Take your pick.  The world feels very instanced and there are lots of loading screens.The PvP play types get boring very fast.The paywall in this game is bag space.  You will fill your bags with junk very quickly.  The only way out is to subscribe monthly to get unlimited bag space.  That's the hook.Loot boxes galore.And this has, hands down, the most insidiously vile group of players I've ever experienced in decades of online play.  There are lots of friendly only on the surface people.  Very politically motivated almost cult-like personalities here.   Maybe the cult-like personalities are attracted to the cult-like faction and lore in this game?"
Negative,I Own the game through Steam and the actual the actual Website. It's even in my inventory on Steam but some how I have to purchase it again it's amazing!! I even have Crowns I purchased in game while I was playing. I cannot play it through the actual websites install because it freezes. This is so far a crappy experience. I never had this experience with Steam before It's either the publisher or Steam that messed up. I will not be recommending it.
Negative,"I've put 45 hours into this game and I am going to quit now. I'm pissed. It's mechanically broken. You get to level 15 and they give you the option to have second line of active useable skills. In order to use that line you have to swap your weapon to a weaker weapon (or use a weaker weapon as your primary) . It ruins the whole combat system . It's a pretty game but, wide as an ocean deep as a puddle i guess. Don't bother, they want you to pay for every little quality of life enhancement too."
Negative,"This is the most aggravating, glitch ridden game I have ever played. Two hour loggin queue's , crashes at critical points. The pvp is full of cheats and bugs with no one monitoring it."
Negative,"Came back to the game to give it a try again, hour long que times for a game that is how old by this point?"
Negative,Over 2 hour login queues. You cannot play the game. Support is cursing at the paying customers. I will never buy Zenimax games again.
Negative,"The monetisation sucks, you shouldn't have to pay extra to unlock the full ass game when the game isn't even that good in the first place. The base stuff isn't good enough to justify buying the rest."
Negative,"Speak to X, fetch X, kill X, go back to X, ad infinium."
Negative,"This game isn´t worth playing until they add a class change token.Nothing Zenimax does is consumer friendly.They won't listen to the community.They don't care about you.This game was once great. It isn't anymore, and no expansion will fix this unless they become more willing to listen to us."
Negative,"When they came out with the trailers i was hyped then, like a gross cafeteria lunch lady they handed me this puke on a platter. graphics shit, gameplay like any other mmo, i was one of the unlucky idiots that bought this thing full price expecting ES but getting a WoW wannabe."
Negative,"Well, I could not even get this game to load past the first screen, and i spent two days downloading and reinstalling twice just to get the same issue. When I tried to refund the game, they said because i waited for it to load for over 2 hours total that i had ""played it"" for too long to get a refund, thanks alot For less than nothing bethesda and steam by wasting my time and money. So I cant really even rate the content of the game other than to say there must be a whole lot in the 50 somthings gigs this game is. I could not even create a character, but I guess being able to stare at a loading screen for over 2 hours is worth at least 20 dollars to steam"
Negative,"Developers do not care about their end game players. They spend time and resources dumbing the game down for the lowest common denominator within playerbase at the detriment of the majority of long term players. Also if you are a pvper they view you as a filthy peasant lmao. Never experienced devs outwardly showing disgust towards me as a player. I left nov 2021, just popped back in a week ago and balance has gotten even worse. Wild meta swings happen every 3 months that render all of your gear useless, and performance is isckkkkyyyyy. Hopefully they get back in touch with their core player base soon, but ive lost all faith. marketing degree 101, 80% of your business comes from 20% of customers. In gaming that tends to be your long term, loyal players. Should prob cater to that group."
Negative,"This game is changing rapidly.  It has become a pay to win game.  Apparently the lure of money is something most companies can't resist.  They have recently nerfed many items and brought in more powerful ""Mythical"" items that is only available if you pay $39 to upgrade.  Sounds like a too familiar script for gaming developers.  I will not be upgrading and I strongly suggest you find a different game that does not require you to pay to win."
Negative,"Its a great game if you can get it to load, i've been trying for a 2 weeks"
Negative,"the numbers are way to high i have 23,000 health at lvl 7"
Negative,not recommended for asian people. If you an Asian better not buy. Too few player playing on Asia. Unless you are close to Europe.
Negative,what the fuck
Negative,this game costs way too much for me to enjoy
Negative,I don't recomed cash shop games.
Negative,"I used to love this game but all the nerfs and changes in update 35 have destroyed the way I experience the game.Tried to give update 35 a fair try but combat has been frustrating and I no longer want to run around and retool my skills, armor and play style. unfortunately these changes have killed my desire for this game and I have canceled my menbership and uninstalled the game."
Negative,"Forgive my unenthusiastic tone, but I am quite disappointed. This game may be fun at early levels, but the lack of immersion brought by mundane writing quickly gets boring and eventually the only important thing on your mind is leveling up in a game that constantly teases you with ever increasing tedious quests that you couldn't be less bothered to understand. I believe what makes quests so lackluster, especially compared to this game's precursors, is the lack of choice. It is extremely rare to encounter a dialogue that enables you to define your character/personality and chose a path you want to take. On the occasions that you are provided a choice, it does little more that reveal a little bit of dialogue, with the option chosen not having the slightest significance on any future outcome of the story.This may not sound too bad, but as I stated earlier, it practically turns you into ""zombie mode"", where you cannot be bothered to know anything or why you are doing the things you are doing- because why would you need to if you have no control over anything other than through combat and the things you are directed to combat? You see my point?This may not be an issue for those who want an almost ""beat 'em up"" styled game with quite an interesting set of spells, but for those looking for immersion and a place within a grand story... this is most certainly not for you. From personal experience, whether you are the two types of individuals I mentioned; Divinity Original Sin II will provide you with superbly better structured combat and balance, no money-hungry developers, more out-of-the-box content, options for single and multiplayer, configurability through mods from the Steam workshop AND third-party sites, and most importantly, in my opinion, a reason to care about a world you genuinely feel like you are a part of, have reason to care for, and have a degree of control over.Ah, I almost forgot. Going for the suggested alternative will also have you free of the occasional loss of hours of work due to server issues or marketing greed, the ""grind"", micro-transactions, the seemingly random bans due to networking issues (many, including myself, have gotten banned for having a high latency. Resolving a ban is not difficult, but absurdly tedious and aggravating, given appeals are answered by a damn answering machine and left pending for a minimum a week. Unless you are lucky enough to speak to a human on the first email), and the ability to play anytime since it has singleplayer."
Negative,"i played the beta for this game and was dissapointed because of the quality of a game you would get for a premium payment and a monthly charge but when i heard about the monthly requirment being done away with i thought it was worth giving another shot. first the mouse drift on this game is so annoying and happens with the slightest moevement on the mouse making any immersion i had with this game non existant also the game really should be just called Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel limited because if you kind of have to pay to get the imperial race while not required it is a great starting race being well balanced and also one of the iconic races secondly i had many issues with crashing randomly while not in combat or in a combat zone, it just happens when it feels like it. while this game does have potential i cant reccommend it because why pay 70+ dollars to get the whole experiance when i can go to a game like black desert online and get every class and every part of the world unlocked with the same ingame shop as ESO."
Negative,Finally leaving the game after years. The dev team is extreme on changes. Changes without informing anybody. I enjoyed this game for years but time to move on.
Negative,It's like stepping back in time to a series that even then had dull gameplay.
Negative,"Really bad DLC buy methods, expensive, not worth it."
Negative,"I was really thinking about subbing to this game again, but when I saw the cost of a sub + the new DLC and realize that it cost more than New World, I was like ""Nah, that's way too much""... All DLC should be free when you subscribe. If they want to charge for a DLC they shouldn't be charging the entire cost of what a full game costs. They're shooting themselves in the foot, really. Would have subscribed if they we're being so greedy."
Negative,"This game is not an mmo its just an rpg with a bunch of weebs saying ""rEaD tHe LoRe"" and participating in super cringe housing competitions. After 300 Hours, I have only been grinding during events and pvp is gross. PvE gets very stale and easy. I want a harder challenge. I get burned out after playing 10 minutes of this game. There is no end game lmao. The only end game is housing which is cringe and grinding achievements. Better off playing FF14. Update 35 destroyed the game and nerfing damage for no reason. Don't bother wasting your time. Destiny and FF14  are so much better and is actually fun instead of a complete yawn of a game. Also the 21 million players they talk about is not true they only had a 50k peak and the game is stuck around 14k people playing which shows this game is dead af"
Negative,"Don't buy, this game was disappointing in so many ways. The game felt too slow. Exploring takes way too long to do anything. The missions are too easy. Just talk and run, talk and run. I don't recommend this game. Played for 6 hours and hated it. I know a game when I see one. This is irrelevant but I did not get my refund even though i filled the requirements. Save yourselves the trouble and don't buy this game."
Negative,"I never felt such a strong depression playing a game. Since the game's release, no matter how many times I try to be optimistic about it, The Elder Scrolls Online with this engine simply just doesn't translate very well. I don't understand why they keep milking this outdated engine to this day.The game approaches a prequel story with the franchise in the worst possible way by making it into an MMO with very uninteresting dialogue and story. It is very boring and has the least satisfying overall progression that I have ever dealt with compared to other MMORPGs. Combat feels floaty and disgusting without any kick or proper feedback. Enemies are often scarce. Leveling feels very slow (emphasis on feels) and is not satisfying. It isn't just a simple walk to hostile and spam click abilities like ""other"" MMOs so props for that at least.It honestly feels like the devs, when making this game, just tried to translate Skyrim's gameplay to an MMO (which is a poor attempt at it imo). And yes that means you can do the normal stuff an Elder Scrolls game let's you do (with the MMO limitations of course). You can loot most objects, steal, do stealth, purchase housing, have specific builds, and more just as expected. The downside to all of this is that the world immersion just... isn't there. It feels lifeless and restricted. Of course, this is just my opinion. If you love Elder Scrolls, at least check it out.  Otherwise, there are much better MMO options currently."
Negative,"The game (story, lore, music, gameplay) itself is gud but there are so many predatory monetization.Be ready to pay more than listed price tag on steam for complete experience (materials storage for only for premium user - ESO plus, additional dungeon which locked behind crown store purchase (in game store)*).*Check crown store in wiki for complete list. Useful to estimate the additional purchase you need."
Negative,Game always feels consistently bad to play and empty. Have came back to the game 3-4 times for different DLCs and I always leave shortly after.
Negative,"You spend all your time running around looking for places that the maps don't show or loose when you change maps. Platform is fragmented, frustrating,and crude,"
Negative,"Account constantly getting locked or hacked or what ever.  Taking me months to work with ""support"" to even find my account.  What a scam!"
Negative,If you're going to put PVP in a game maybe don't make it brain-dead. There's no point having it in the game how it is.
Negative,If you're going to buy this game; do it from the ESO website. I have not once been able to login to the server through the Steam launcher once and none of the fixes suggested by the Bethesda technical team such as flushing the DNS cache and repairing the launcher worked. I have also been unable to get a refund from Steam because they believe I have played it too much. All of these issues combined mean the game is not usable if purchased through Steam.
Negative,"So, when the game launches it works great, but haven't been able to play in while do to some Unable to Load Skin error. All I see is post about it, but no answers. Either Steam or Zenimax don't worry about fixing it. So I would recommend getting it not on steam if you want to play it."
Negative,"Crash at start everytime after they update thieves DLCvery very dissapointed, already do everything recommended. even reinstall 36gb (my zone internet connection less than 1mbps so it means about 40 hours)i dont understand whats the point of submiting crash report if nobody contact meluckily i havent spend any money at crown store"
Negative,"Not recommended for people in Asia/Oceania due to lack of nearby servers.Players in those regions should expect > 200ms ping. There are a fair few reaction/timing-based components to general gameplay, but with the high amount of lag the whole experience ends up feeling clunky/janky. A pity, as it seems like there is a decent game and world to explore - but the network issues really put a damper on the whole experience."
Negative,"I have given it a try. It's really monetized right from the get-go. Like, I'm just trying to learn the key functions and it's like ""Buy all the things!"". The graphics make everyone look like they have garden gnomes in their lineage. The Gameplay makes me want to just play Skyrim instead. Skyrim is a far superior product (even with it's bugs). I may give it another chance after a while, but it definitely isn't scratching any gaming itch at all."
Negative,game does not launch launcher from steam. known problem that is not fixed.
Negative,Can`t log in again!!! WTF?! And it`s only for Steam Users...
Negative,really cool cinematic trailers but that's about it
Negative,Combat is awful feels like you are using inflatables to attack with
Negative,"bad, constant problems"
Negative,Boring garage with pay walls pay ceilings and pay floors. As bad as it was ten years ago.
Negative,Unable to launch the game since initial download. Steam says it running but nothing happens. I've exhausted all the fixes i can find and steam has denied my refund request. Might be a great game when it works but this has been a terrible experience for me.
Negative,"Unfortunately can't recommend it. The maps and such are very nice, but combat is flaky, aimbot AI, and everything needs tokens/coins and what not.. even changing your characters appearance.. it's too much greed that has sneaked in an Elder Scrolls game."
Negative,"Nope!  They lied!  Never playing this game again.When it 1st released it was pretty good because there was very little competition and for the times the graphics and gameplay was OK.They offered a subscription - something like $15 a month and for that you got to play all the DLC.  But after they released a few things they lied to us all - they started calling the DLC ""Chapters"" and claiming it wasn't actually DLC.  So all us subscription users who had paid out $170 per year were just out of luck and if we wanted to play the new DLC it was like $50 to us. HUGE BREACH OF TRUST!!!Then shortly after that they started in with loot-box gambling, micro-transactions, and pushing nearly full-screen ads in our face as we logged on, off, and even mid-game.  NO WAY!  This game is terrible for all those reasons and even though I have like six or seven THOUSAND hours in this game, I haven't played it in over a year and NEVER will again.  I dislike dishonesty!"
Negative,"EDIT: I loved this game until I started having problems accessing my champion level character......... I've done everything from reinstalling to tech support to fix it. Once, the game even uninstalled by itself once I exited it. I don't know what's going on. I've never had these problems before with any other game. It's definitely not on my end."
Negative,Cant login for days
Negative,Haven't played it yet because it says the server's have timed out every time I try to log in.
Negative,If i could turn back time and buy this game from Zen shop...2/3 days in week you cant play cuz the server is down
Negative,"Elder scrolls offline, or at least if you bought the game through steam. At least 4 long downtimes this month for steam users only."
Negative,"It's a fun game, but you should definitely get more free content if the game itself costs money."
Negative,so sad game ever :(((
Negative,"Have to say after 100s of hours playing that the God persona people get have made me want to give up on the game you need to have a minimum 44k damage you need 1000CP well if your a realist that's easy to get on a thing that does not hit back does not throw down poison or lighting or just hit you, so you drop your Shield and heal for two other Damage attacks, knowing you need those 2 to survive."
Negative,"So... I've played a lot more of ESO now and I feel that I can write a better review now that I'm more familiar with the game.It's an awesome game when it comes to quests and storylines. It does fill the gap between Skyrim and TES 6 for me, personally. I love how big the maps are, how different regions are from each other. Truly amazing. But I still don't recommend it full price. And here's why:- ESO plus exists in a way that I think is kind of unfair. Not that the subscription itself is bad, because it's really not. I do recommend anyone who wants to play this game to get ESO plus instead of buying Dlcs. I'd even say don't buy any DLC and cancel the subscription once you feel that you're not playing the game enough, because you can always go back and subscribe again when you're more active, and you'll still have access to every DLC ever. But locking the craft bag behind a pay wall is not really fair in a game that works in a way that you have to buy it to have access to it. If ESO was free, that would make it okay. But it's not. That means that if you are a new player and decides to buy every DLC + the base game, you'll still be left without the craft bag, because you're not an ESO plus member. And this sucks. That's why I advice everyone who wants to play ESO to forget about DLCs and just get the monthly subscription instead.-Combat is not enjoyable in itself. Base combat animations are too basic. There are worse MMORPGs out there with better combat than this. But I do like ability animations, those are pretty cool.-There are way too many things that are overcomplicated just to keep you in the game more often, which, alright, most mmos do that, but it really isn't necessary here. Like, it's a good game, why do I have to log in everyday just to update my horse speed instead of logging in just to enjoy the game itself? This feels a lot like a chore. The 20 hour cooldown is way too much. Not to mention the research mechanic, that I do think is dumb and not necessary. It is all to make sure you log in everyday, which makes it all really annoying. Specially because I would log in anyway to play the game! But I don't want to have to do that or get some kind of progress punishment for not playing ESO for 1 day.-Also, and this is more personal now, making the vampire and werewolf bite thing have a cooldown is pretty scummy. Specially when you see that they sell the skill-lines at the crown shop. Like bruh, really? Do you need 20 dollars that much? At least decrease the cooldown time, because one week is too much and it would make it look a bit less greedy.-At last, I would like to have the option to add my other characters to my house, not like State of Decay 2, in which you can just switch characters at your base and stuff. I don't really need that. It would just be cool to have my other characters just living at the house I bought while I'm not playing them. But this is really just a suggestion, not anything wrong with the game.Well, TLDR: Buy base game on sale, not full price, don't buy DLCs, get ESO plus and cancel when you don't feel like playing. Oh, and it's a good TES."
Negative,"I'm a huge Elder Scrolls fan, and this game just seems... hollow? Having the whole world available to you at level 1 leaves you with no stakes when it comes to exploring, The microtransaction system is annoying and allows players to advance crafting by paying real money. I'm hoping that they pump the brakes on ESO and focus on developing ES6 as this game is no replacement for the others in the ES series."
Negative,"If you are looking to play an MMO where you would level up and explore different skills as I was, this is not the game for you. You get 5 skill slots only and from what I can tell you are as strong at level 20 as you will be at level 250. The story and first person combat is engaging, but looking at the future of the skill trees, I just couldn't find anything to keep me engaged in continuing to level up (what with the rather low-quality graphics as well)."
Negative,"paid 20 euros for this game, can't make a proper review because i constantly have to be sitting in queues that never end. you wait out a queue of 1hour40minutes and then the server crashes or some s**t. you try to log back in and then you get a middle finger to the face with another 2 hour queueI'm gonna say its not worth the money.Edit: the game does not support Linux natively and you MUST download their game launcher through steam to play the game. But once the game is running through some tinkering and hacking around (without hacking the game ofcourse) - PVP is an absolute grind, there is no equality or fairness. One game you might get absolutely demolished, other PVP match you might be the doomslayer.PVE content is a bit repetetive, if you want the good stuff pay more - no thanks.As for the story mode, thats probably the best thing - if you have A LOT of time to spare."
Negative,Continuous disconnects and problems with the steam version of the game. Buy it directly from the ESO website to get a version of that game that at least usually works. AVOID.
Negative,"Great game, but login issues make it impossible to play. Would suggest buying directly from website, only steam players are experiencing login issues. 1/10 simply for content, although it is unable to be accessed."
Negative,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM. Unable to login via steam after 8 hours and no communication on a weekend. And there is no way to migrate away from steam so you can login. Pathethic.
Negative,time out errorsDon't buy on steam if you want to play. great game though WHEN you can play it.
Negative,"Fun game, BUT DO NOT BUY ON STEAM.you wont be able to login to the game. The steam version has some issues."
Negative,WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THROUGH STEAM UNLESS YOU WANT CONSTANT LOGIN ISSUES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO STEAM USERS! BUY DIRECTLY FROM THEIR SITE!
Negative,"worst game ever. try pvp you'll be level 10 placed into a game with level 49 and below players, you walk out of your spawn you insta die. All you do in this game is spam your ability's till run out of stamina or mana because there are no cooldowns no nothing all and all in my opinion needs work."
Negative,"I would really love to play the game. but the launcher just will not load, so many people have the same problem, tried everything people suggest and nothing. You would think by now they would have fixed this. So for now its a thumbs down for me."
Negative,Don't buy this game from Steam. Something is broken with the login implementation. Steam users are unable to login frequently while Bathesda purchasers blissfully ride fire horses and slay Dark Elf bandits without a care in the world!
Negative,"DO NOT PURCHASE THROUGH STEAM. BUY DIRECT FROM BETHESDA. you cannot unlink the game from your account, and if steam crashes, you cannot login."
Negative,"Steam version is total garbage, fails to login. Avoid this mess..."
Negative,"meh... yeah, just meh!"
Negative,no hatsune miku
Negative,"This game is like Skyrim minus the fun. When you are on the fence about buying The Elder Scrolls:Online there is a shit-ton of options to choose from and all of them are not very well explained. There is an abundance of DLC both for content and cosmetics. In order to lure you into the monthly subscription your vanilla-item bag can hold only so many items. The monthly subscription on the other hand awards you with a bag that can hold an infinite number of ingredients and stuff. Story is bogus, character development is intriguing only for as long as you don't understand how it works, after that it is just irrelevant - who cares where to put your points because this game has you spam skills and mash buttons until the enemy is dead, and that is it. I play the game to see the content through and get my money's worth if that is at all possible.I do not approve."
Negative,"I can't believe I let Bethesda scam me out of my money again. This is criminal. There are no redeeming qualities to this game, like I'm not gonna sit here and list every individual problem I encountered, but the navigation stands out as the reason I just cannot give this one more minute of my time. I thought I was buying the package that gave me access to the full game, I didn't know there was ESO+ or microtransactions until I startedd the game. I guess that's on me, I could've done my research, not to mention I'm just fresh off getting scammed into buying Fallout 76. I'm done with Bethesda. They took two of the best franchises in the industry and turned them into wet garbage. It's horrible. Todd Howard is a plague. Bethesda is bad for video games. But it doesn't matter. They have my money, and they're never going to actually release anything again. There is no future for Fallout or Elder Scrolls, but there's a lucrative future Bethesda in the scamming business. They are the death of creativity, the enemies of artistic expression, they want to suck as much fun out of the world as they can, while they can. I wish we could all just decide together to never touch their products again. There's no future for video games if we keep giving money these people."
Negative,"This game has great potential HOWEVER it is absolutely plagued with and endless cycle of bugs being ""fixed"" only to be replaced with more sometimes game breaking bugs. Sets and skills get changed, nefed, buffed so you're almost constantly grinding for gear/materials just to compete. Overland questing can be enjoyable for the story/voice acting but the combat is so easy it's a joke... huge build up for supposed epic villain to get smacked down in like 5 seconds flat is hardly entertaining. Dungeons and trials are fun until you get good enough to struggle to find a good group to prog the veteran hardmode content with, and even then there will be times when your effort is wasted because the game is broken with bugs! PVP has many of the same issues as pve (bugs, balance, grinding gear/skills because of a bunch of combat changes nerfs/buffs), but with waaaaay more lag. The game is already super grindy so to have time and effort thrown away over something the developers ought to have prioritized fixing sucks. i Really, Really wanted to continue enjoying this game but it's just too much bs to deal with."
Negative,"Boring. Does not engage me as an RPG fan. Also Bethesda thinks this is a good substitute to tide us over until elder scrolls 6, which it isn't. We've been waiting for over 10 years for the next elder scrolls game, and still going to have to wait for several years more and this isn't what we're looking for. Would be awesome if another company like obsidian got to work with the IP."
Negative,"imagine locking something as basic as "" inventory space "" behind a MONTHLY paywall if i knew this before my 2 hours limit i wouldn't have bought tbh the reason this review is this late is because steam wouldn't let you evaluate a game unless you had an activated account and i didn't at the time"
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL YOU HAVE READ THISDO YOU LIKE DUNGEONS? DO YOU WANT TO PRESS F FOR 40 MINUTES WHILE YOU ARE TOLD THAT ONE OF THE MEMBERS DECLINED THE DUNGEON INTIVATION? I WAS (PAST TENSE) A HEALER IN THIS GAME AND I LOVE DUNGEONS, THE EXCEPTIONALLY LONG WAIT TIMES FOR QUEUING FOR DUNGEONS HAS MADE ME UNINSTALL THIS GAME!!!OFF TO WORLD OF WARCRAFT I GOI DO NOT RATE THIS GAME ONE BIT, HOW CAN YOU LET PEOPLE PAY FOR A SUBSCRIPTION AND NOT HAVE THIS FIXED, THATS AN ABSOLUTE JOKE!REGARDSFANATICAL PROPH"
Negative,"Zenimax doesn't care about its players, I was one of the beta testers and even after 6 years, the game continues with the same bugs and a horrible performance in pvp."
Negative,Really buggy and laggy full of strange glitches. Great game otherwise but zenimax doesnt vare about players its all about the money.
Negative,"Downloaded the game. Made an account. Tried to log in. ""Connection to server has timed out"". Tried again. ""Connection to server has timed out"". Uninstalled.EDIT: Since I got a comment from the developer on my review. Let me rephrase what I said earlier:Downloaded the game. Made an account. Tried to log in. ""Connection to server has timed out"". Tried again. ""Connection to server has timed out"". Restarted the game. Tried to login. ""Connection to server has timed out"". Closed the game. Restarted my whole PC. Ran the game again. Tried to log in. ""Connection to server has timed out"" and then. I uninstalled... :)My honest opinion: Games should work ""out the box"". Not restarting my PC and still getting the same error. :)"
Negative,"Confusing garbage.You can't even buy basic weapons from a vendor - EVERYTHING must be crafted.If you're after a revamped Morrowind, as I was, look elsewhere. Vvardenfel is shrunk to like a tenth of its size.The world just doesn't have the personality or depth you'd expect from an Elder Scrolls game, and the gameplay is nothing special, so there really isn't anything to recommend itself. This isn't ""Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim but online"", it's more like an extreeeeeemly stripped-down, bonsai'd version of the setting of one of those games with very rudimentary RPG quests added.The charm of TES games is, in my opinion, the rich detail of the world. Here, that's just gone completely. Quite frankly, if you like TES games then just don't play this at all because it bears no resemblance.It doesn't stand on its own merits either. There are offline RPGs that have more character, and there are online RPGs that have more gameplay (and, quite frankly, more character too)."
Negative,Please add Russian localization!
Negative,"played for 4 hours ran into a game breaking glitch, had to redownload the whole game.... 3 hours later, now only getting errors when I try to log in. 0/10"
Negative,I hate this game and will never play it again
Negative,Came back after a ~6 year break but was driven away again by aggressive and predatory monetisation schemes.
Negative,ive spent over 24 hours trying to get this game to load. im turned off of this game. i want my money back and put on my account but i dont know how to do that. take it away from me im so mad
Negative,"try multitude of fix a lot since the new upgrade cannot play this game  and from what i read to many people also , the game that you paid for is bug in the launcher it  if stupid that you just cannot press play  to get it going like all other game  this is an irresponsible  game  co.  be advise"
Negative,Words fail me. What a travesty this version of the Elder Scrolls has turned out to be. Graphics quality is great but for me there are so many negatives compared to the stand-alone versions.
Negative,"This game would have been good if Bethesda game studios did it... we wanted a clone of skyrim but on a larger scale with all of tamriel, but we got this game... no just no."
Negative,"Skinner box, I have sunk over $200. Don't be like me, play Skyrim or something else."
Negative,The game used to run fine then suddenly stopped working and started giving me crash error on startup and hasn't worked since. No support seems to be coming my way either
Negative,Actually would invest time into this game again if they had Aus/OCE servers but 300 ping just aint it
Negative,"Download 75 Gb, download 20 Gb, download/repair several times for 50+ Gb, repair for 60+ Gb, shut down from PC. It can't ever be played, dont waste your time guys, I havent ever seen such a game which only downloads some shit but does not allow to play.And I have absolutely no idea where steam took those hours of play - I've never seen even start menu of this game."
Negative,dont buy through steam if you want it. 66 GB download just to download 88 GB from the installer and replace everything you downloaded. cool. thanks for the streamlined service.
Negative,"UI is non helpfull, menu requires exstensive training to navigate. numbers are arbitrary. and if you choose to go any route for a spec and you decide you don't like it you must either spend real cash or an ungodly amount of ingame currency to reset."
Negative,"Crashes consistently on the Bethesda Logo. Completely unplayable even after following troubleshooting steps. Turns out it's MSI Afterburner/RivaTuner Statistics Server, and it's been an issue since like 2018. I'm not uninstalling such a useful program just to play this. Crazy that an actively developed MMO doesn't have the resources to fix compatibility with one of the most widely used PC utilities."
Negative,"If I could ever get the game to launch, I bet it would be fun to play."
Negative,Goofy and boring quest lines. Very bright maps.
Negative,Bought the game tried everything online nohting works DONT use steam it doesnt work
Negative,i use to be able to play this game have about 75 hours in it but after stepping away from it for a bit i come back and cant even launch the game no matter what i do i delete files verify integrity and even go to the files to launch it from there but steam wont run it even as an admin i wouldn't recommend this until they get their shit straight and fix it
Negative,"The game crashes when i try to open it referencing an issue with ntdll.dll.Support says my graphics card is not supported when their own ESORequirementsChecker shows all green.I play fairly large games with good graphics without any issues so it seems the support is trying to find the easy route here.really liked the game but the lack of support on a new purchase has me asking for a refund now.Update: ended up upgrading to a different PC. Steam does not refund post 2 hrs gameplay it seems although the game never started, so how did i reach gameplay hrs.The game is good. support is not. ESORequirementsChecker should also be updated."
Negative,"You get good at your class, learn the rotations, get the gear and then some snowflake gets you banned because your better than they are. Great game, great everything however get banned for nothing, and given Bethesda is a dumb woke company they always side with the sjw's or the snowflakesUpdate:: Bethesda never got back with me and acted as if this review didnt exist. Well its still here and they cannot hide the fact that they removed heir customer support link to speak wth them. pathethic Bethesda, really pathethic."
Negative,"It blows. The combat system is extremely clunky and overall a major stats check when fighting everything. The numbers are extremely inflated. You start the game with 20000 health, a skill deal 8000 and leveling up gives you 100 extra health.The story is forced and unnatural as well. I immediately lost interest 10 minutes in because of how stupid the tutorial character is designed, decided to give the game a second chance with other quests and they blows as well."
Negative,"Hello AllI have put in 20 hours into this game, 20 painful hours hoping that gameplay would improve. I have no idea what the dungeons are like but I can describe the grind involved with leveling up your character. Very very frustrating…Let's start with the map system because your going to spend a lot of time looking at it to orientate yourself. You get a world map, town map and compass. The compass would work fine if your destinations where all in a staight line. Since you cannot fly you will be forced to navigate around the countless obstacles like towns, mountains, bridges, water, and the like without the aid of a mini map and to make things even more difficult to arrive at your destination, 50 percent of the time it will be dark…The inventory provided with your character is extremely limited which really adds to the frustration of continually returning to a town to unload. You will spend a lot of time, running, walking and riding.You are also required to learn all the trades and skills as a level up option which is confusing due to the limited storage space. So after you learn them all, you can only concentrate on one due to limited space. So what's the point of giving them all to you ???????The fighting is slow and awkward with no real sense of when you're in danger until it's too late. You will have a very difficult time playing this game alone. I have better luck with the mouse and keyboard as it is not controller friendly on any level of this game.The quests are found randomly by exploring with no real or believable indication that you're ready for this quest.The colours green, yellow orange and red next to the quest title are what you get….you'll get you’re a** kicked on yellow most of the time and some green are impossible alone and by the time you are strong enough to combat it alone the items and quest will be useless to you. Its just hard too hard to lvl up alone....This game does not hold up to its cinematics, not even close...it is free to play however with no catch of additional purchases to win. So if you like spending most of your time exploring, crafting and riding thismgame is for you.MichaelPART2:With additonal 20hrs added the game, half of which was contributed to locating the destination indicated on the map and btw when you get to the Wood elves  ""Grathwood"" be prepared to multiply your travel and frustration by four as you will never be sure if the destination is up or down the multiple levels of trees your going to need access too. They capitalized on the poor compass and map option provided in this game. WOW! .....I did several dungeons and most are very dark so if you fall off the trail, good luck getting back on....I just was not impressed with the level of game play required to conquer the main objective, very boring indeed..."
Negative,"Can't even play this shit I've updated my GPU for this and can't even start this shit, I did every fix for the launcher on google on nothing even fking works this is bullshit"
Negative,"Login issues on a daily basis. The game itself is good, lot's of fun too. I'd recommend buying through bethesda instead of steam to bypass the login problems."
Negative,elder scrolls but almost none of the fun parts
Negative,"Purchased the Elsewyr combo and decided to hop back in after some time. Reminded just how much paid content there is in this game. It's overwhelming. Most of which is not listed on the store page here. If you went by what the store page tells you, there are like 4 or 5 content updates. The store in-game has like 10 or 15 additional dungeons and DLC you have to purchase.If they want people to get ESO Pro so badly they should just make the entire game a sub model and get rid of the entry prices."
Negative,"While there is a lot to like about this game, the quests are too numerous and have an extremely generic feel.  Unlike the previous Elder Scroll games, this one has no soul, no real sense of adventure.   Elder Scrolls Online is sadly similar to Blades, where you keep grinding away until you get sick of the monotony.I also don't like the feeling that I am constantly being hit up for more money in order to have a better experience.  That is also similar to Blades.I do enjoy the experience of exploring Tamriel and viewing the amazing graphics."
Negative,"From the outset, I hoped this game would give the same feeling as Skyrim -- one where the world is yours, but also alive and full of things to discover.  Unfortunately, that feeling was shattered the first time someone ran past me to agro a group of mobs while I was sneaking toward them.Still, I had a pretty fun time for the first few dozen hours; I did the main quest chain for Vvardenfell, did some crafting, joined a guild and starting making money selling my excess inventory, then started wandering the world (or the accessible parts, anyhow), seeing what else what out there.It turned out, however, that ""what else was out there"" had a real more-of-the-same feeling, despite the aesthetic change with each zone.  And the fact that so much of the game is behind a paywall is really off-putting.  I wouldn't mind unlocking new content if the price were reasonable.....but $20-$40 xpacs (of which there are many) make me roll my eyes.  In hindsight, I probably would have enjoyed my time with the game more if I'd just gotten a subscription from the outset; that way, at least I'd have full access to the game during the time that I played.  Fool that I was, I went into the game assuming I'd be playing it for years to come, and that the one-time expenses of the content would wind up being the more frugal choice.  But it didn't work out that way.Crafting was a nice distraction, but too schedule-driven and 'grindy.'  That makes a game reek of 'MMO.'  I would never really head out specifically to farm mats....rather, I'd head out to explore a bit, and that always meant farming as I went.  For a few months, that was about all I did....and while it kept me hanging on, it got dull in hurry.The last few months of playing consisted of me logging into buy another spot of inventory from the riding trainer, start new crafting researches and do crafting dailies, if I was in the mood.  This was MMO drudgery at its worst, but I had even less interest in doing anything else.I'd classify the game like this:  There's just enough 'elder scrolls world' to lure you in, then a heavy sheen of unrefined MMO devices that keep subscribers around (by making sure there are still teeny, tiny rewards awaiting them if they log in), all wrapped up in a system of aggressive monetization.Count me out."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY, STEAM WILL NOT GIVE A REFUND FOR THIS GAMESo I read the reviews, I ignored the bad ones thinking that won't happen to me, 200 gigs later 1 week later, more than 3 attempts at re-downloading it from scratch and nada. It keeps crashing on me, to the point where I can't play longer than 3 minutes at a time before it dies which is a hell of a lot further than login crash i kept getting, i went through and found all the forum soultions and tried them off the offical website, i also contacted their support which was useless, they sent me a link to their soultions page, i already tried it all but my game still didn't work, and then after 3 days i finally gave up and contacted steam for a refund how ever, despite the fact that my play time was maybe 2 minutes and 45 seconds, my steam time says 10 hours because it took that long to patch it from the steam cilent. DO NOT DOWNLOAD STEAM'S version it's fucked. Go to their website and download the ""offical"" client there, this way it also won't add time to your steam account so if you do experiance errors, maybe steam will be nicer to you, i was simply told NO, despite my explanations, so now we've come to a 2 weeks later where i tried it again and this time i last a few minutes before crashing, and i mean full BLACK SCREEN no ctrl-alt-delete commands will work, i mean you need a hard physical reboot to get your system to work again. mind you i bought this during the christmas sales for $45 AUD NOT WORTH THE MONEY. SAVE YOUR SELF THE HASSLE DON'T BUY THIS PEICE OF SHIT, I wish i listened to the other reviews."
Negative,"I recently bought ESO and was really looking forward to playing it.  I've played all of the previous Elder Scrolls games going back to Morrowind and they've been great.  But I've spent the past 4 days trying to install the damn game and have yet to enter the game itself.  It took most of a day to download the game, then when I tried to run it, the launcher kept stalling on the updates.  I read all sorts of supposed fixes and tried all of the ones I could understand.  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling.  I tried manually downloading the updates.  I tried changing permissions in the host.developer.log.  I'm throwing in the towel.  It was a massive waste of time and a minor waste of money.  I'm sure it's a lot of fun but I'm not a computer expert and shouldn't have to be in order to play ESO.  I may try again in a few months in the hopes that Bethesda has fixed these issues.  In the meantime, I wouldn't recommend how I've spent the past 4 days to anybody!"
Negative,I give up playing this on Steam. I keep getting login error problem. I don't know which one is the problem; Steam Launcher or Zenimax server. I don't want to know either. I refunded. I bought this game directly from Zenimax. I don't recommend this game not because the game is bad. It's because of the login error problem. Enough said ....
Negative,"The tl;dr version is: It's not Skyrim, AT ALL. Not in the slightest. If you LOVE Skyrim like I do, you don't need this game. Go back to playing Skyrim. Maybe try some new mods.I'm really glad I got to try Elder Scrolls Online for free. I can't see spending money to improve or expand upon the experience, when I haven't especially enjoyed the experience.They should work on making it more SUPER FUN UP FRONT, and to orient new players to make it clear what ANYTHING is (the tutorial area prepares you for combat, and how to click on things, and that's about it). To be clear, they have NOT done that, in six years. They have spent those years devising ways that the game might potentially BECOME fun, IF you spend the money - but haven't provided an incentive to do that other than by giving you a frustrating experience, in the familiar Elder Scrolls world that you would probably love to not be frustrated by. If you love Skyrim, you will be frustrated by this game.It doesn't look as good as Skyrim, it doesn't play as smoothly as Skyrim - it is BIGGER than Skyrim, to be fair, but the world is so big that it's more bland - even places with a lot of ""character"" like Vvardenfell, the character of the place seems kinda stapled on to a bland heightmap, so exploring isn't much fun. It's a BASIC MMO world, with Elder Scrolls seasoned lightly on top.It doesn't have a clear storyline or forward thrust (even though I usually avoid the main storyline in Skyrim anyway) or any sense that you're supposed to be somewhere, or what you should be doing, or why you should do it. It doesn't have any clear tutorials about how or why to do any of the things available to you, or what to do with any of the items you find (there's certainly no helpful blacksmith who'll tell you ANYTHING about what any type of crafting is or how it works in this game). Most of the items you find are crafting supplies with 0 gp value so you can't even sell them, and your inventory space is SEVERELY limited. Even spending tons of in-game money doesn't meaningfully increase your inventory or the amount of space in the bank.Mostly, I just never had a sense of what I should be doing aside from following a few quests, I had no way of even setting personal goals for finding the right crafting supplies to create or improve equipment, because it's not clear where to look for supplies, and crafting recipes you need to actually use them are random loot drops... so if there's something you want to craft, there's no guarantee you'll ever find out how to craft it, even if you do collect the supplies (if you somehow know what they are, without the recipe), which are few and far between from gatherables in the game world - there's about one flower per square mile. No one in the game world will give you any information about how to proceed.If you think ""Just BUY better equipment from the shop"" well... there is no shop. THERE IS NO SHOP to buy equipment. Monsters and bad guys don't drop equipment, and no one sells equipment. About 99% of what you can buy from traders is consumables.Also, hardly any things that look like containers can be interacted with. Most barrels and crates are just decorations. BUT, once you know which things you can interact with, you'll fill your limited inventory space in about five minutes. Then you can go back to town and put the extra stuff in the bank - it took me 10 hours to actually fill up the bank space with crafting ingredients that were worthless to sell, and that I didn't have enough of, or the right combination of, to do anything with. You'll find tons and tons of crafting supplies and never get a clue what to do with 90% of them or whether they're worth keeping.You'll spend most of the game finding recipes and crafting supplies for making FURNITURE.One of the most common crafting supply items I found was for making ""alchemically treated furniture"". Not the WOOD required to build the furniture, or the schematics to build the furniture if I had the wood. Just the stuff for alchemically treating it. Great. In 10 hours of play I found fewer than 10 alchemical ingredients - because most of the stuff you gather or harvest is for crafting, not alchemy - and never a matching set (of effects, like how it's done in Skyrim) to actually make a single potion, much less meaningfully increase my alchemy rating enough to make alchemical furniture. There is a quest to get a free apartment in the city. It's a tiny empty room. Too bad I had all those recipes for furniture and all those supplies to make furniture, but never the right combination to actually make anything, so much as a CHEST to store my junk, or something (which I don't think is even an option, you can have crafting stations in your player-home, but I've heard you can't even have storage containers).You can't even BUY INGREDIENTS, because as I said before, THERE IS NO SHOP. You can buy consumables, and that's about it. You'll already have 18 DIFFERENT consumable items (not convenient stacks of the same item so that your inventory doesn't fill right up, you'll never find more than a few of the same item to get stacked up, so if you're interested in consumables, you have another way to fill your inventory in five minutes).I'm not 100% sure about all this, you see, because right from the beginning the game overwhelms you with a dozen menus and 1000 options for ENDGAME content that means absolutely NOTHING because a starting player doesn't know what any of it is or even what the context of it is. Maybe I missed some amazing content because I didn't want to scroll through the collections and crown store and guild stuff and mounts and all the other things that are probably really useful menus for high level experienced players but meant absolutely nothing to me, and no helpful NPC even mentioned any of it, let alone guided me through a tutorial to orient me to what the hell I was supposed to be doing. The game shows you that 10000 things are available - but you haven't unlocked or discovered them yet, and it doesn't explain what they are, whether you should want them, or where to get them if you do -  you know, instead of showing you the 12 or so things YOU THE BRAND NEW PLAYER need to know about and what those things are and how to do them.I did find a stable, to buy a mount. They cost 40,000 gold or more. I had 400 gold, and by the time I stopped I got up to 800 gold.Of course, you can spend real-world money $$$ to get more storage space and get more stuff and even get some wacky colorful mount and/or pet. I'm sure it improves the experience. Maybe it improves it all the way to a ""mildly interesting"" experience, though it's not clear that it does. But for free players hoping to be enticed into spending money, there's... just really no incentive to keep playing, let alone INVEST money in playing. It would have to be fun to begin with. It's not particularly fun.I wish there was more of Skyrim in the world, but this ain't it. It's everything boring, bland, and frustrating about Oblivion (including the lock-picking).I don't know why you read this whole thing, but thanks for reading! I hope you have a good day! If you've played a lot of Skyrim and it has gotten a little stale, I recommend Enai Siaion's various mods that really add a lot of content change the way the game works (e.g. new spells, enchantments, race abilities), also the survival mods like Frostfall, Realistic Needs, Hunterborn, from Nexus Mods etc. make it a completely different game, about making campfires, getting drunk, and nearly freezing to death.That's in addition to essentials like Item Recycling, Fishing In Skyrim, Convenient Horses, Unread Books Glow, Immersive Armors and Weapons, and my personal favorite Practical Female Armors. If your computer can handle it (mine can't) and you don't mind a lot of tinkery set-up you can even try the ENB lighting and weather overhaul mods - check those out on YouTube."
Negative,Played a while and it's just a big pile of performance issues. Only reason for me to keep playing is it's a damn addiction these kind of games.
Negative,wenn mein acc gehen würde könnte ich es wenigstens spielen
Negative,stuck in the first load page. does anyone suffering from this too?
Negative,will not launch
Negative,"The game is an old mmorpg, clunky, weird version of Oblivion basically. For the lore nerds there's a huge wealth of content, for the mmorpg enthusiast there's a lot of sink your time into, but for general gaming, skip. It's a convoluted mess, with way too much content to wrap your head around, and nowhere near as satisfying, or as polished as Skyrim is as an experience. Play Baldur's Gate 3 as a co-op or something, this isn't really worth your time, unless you're already super invested or live and breathe mmorpgs."
Negative,Basically you won't be able to play the game if you can play only on weekends or evening hours as steam version of the game  have troubles with connecting to the server in peak hours. So if you want to relax by playing some game stay away of this one as it will bring rather stress and anger than relax ;/
Negative,"i'm returning to my poorly written review of ESO to change my recommendation from yes to no.while ZOS has been doing a banger job with churning out content and making the game LOOK and FEEL incredible, i feel that there is one big elephant in the room that has forced me to try and distance myself from the game (more on that in a bit) while i do log in each day i now play ESO very casually, i have all 16 character slots used up i've tried every class, reached CP 1300, and done a lot of the dlc dungeons, so i can login every day just to faff around a bit and then log out, i mostly just do events as they pop up.back to why i don't recommend the game any more, while ESO as an MMORPG is pretty solid, the monetization here is incredibly bad. no you don't NEED a sub to play but without the craft bag you can practically kiss crafting goodbye, what with the hundreds upon hundreds of materials you need to craft. beyond that, the crown store, additional character slots cost 1500 crowns, cool you can buy that with a month of subbing to the game, but then you also have your mount training which will take you 180 days to complete on each character, so if you're like me and you have 16 characters i guess it sucks to be me right?ZOS added the outfit system some time ago, allowing you to create an appearance for your character to wear at all times similar to transmog system in wow or glamour system in ff14, but you can only make 1 outfit for each character, if you want more options to switch on the fly you have to buy more slots in the crown store and get this it's 1000 crowns per slot PER CHARACTER, that's right, the outfit slots cost that much and are not account wide. recently they added an armoury system, allowing you to change your build on the fly without using addons, you get 2 slots per character, and yes additional slots are expensive and are not account wide, and it gets even better, in order to actually change your build on the fly you need to buy an assistant for 5000 crowns.and we can go even further, made a new character? don't want to grind mages guild to 10 again due to how mind numbingly horrible the grind is? well you're in luck if you have lvl 10 mages guild on another character you can buy the boost for your new character from the crown store! what's this? you also don't want to get all those skyshards you worked hard to get on your main AGAIN? you guessed it, more crown store solutions. you may be noticing a theme here, ZOS creates a problem and then sells you the solution, and while that's not necessarily pay to win, it is unacceptable in my opinion as a monetization scheme.all of this on top of the fact it has lootboxes means i cannot in good conscience recommend this game which is a HORRIBLE SHAME because this game is genuinely fun with the best questing experience i've had in an MMORPG to date."
Negative,"The PvP balancing killed this for me. This was my mmo home, but it got neglected. You will see 1 chad player solo 30 newbies. While its base version used to be great value, there are items from expansions that are straight upgrades or better than comparable equipment. I crunched the numbers on some of them and that's when I decided to quit, since it means the game was power creeping at player expense. I had immense wealth... but it wasn't worth much in the end when you quit...The PvE is fine casually."
Negative,"It doesn't feel like an elder scrolls game at all, as someone in love with skyrim it was a huge let down finding out just how weird this game is. Honestly I feel this game never should've been made, the elder scrolls should've stayed a single player experience."
Negative,"I tried to play with my friend and we were enjoying. The best someone can after playing dark souls and final fantasy. Until we found out the quests are completely broken. I have no adjectives to describe the piece of unfinished thing this is. Also no reason to be online, and it takes the immersion away. DONT BUY THIS"
Negative,"Eh, same problem I have with DDO, not enough inv. space, too much crap to collect. Because it's an MMO you have to buy more inventory &/or storage; not hoarder-friendly, so much as exploitative. Don't hate the game, but it's just not my thing. Having to hit things more than once to kill them? I don't get it. I can kill elder dragons in Skyrim with one shot. If I have to shoot at anything more than once, it's because I missed. Also, what's with things I killed respawning while I'm looting?  Another odd thing; in DDO, when you enter a quest solo, that's it- only you are there. In this game random people enter the quest you're on. It's confusing when a bunch of people that have nothing to do with each other are running around the same room, apparently causing more enemies to spawn.(or maybe they just auto-spawn every 30 seconds, I don't know) I like the fishing...I dunno, guess I just don't like MMOs. Skyrim rules, this ain't Skyrim. No mods, no cheats...what's the point in playing? Oh yeah, so devs can make money. Sorry, forgot what gaming was all about for a sec. Tried again on another free weekend. A short time in & again I think ""nope"". My old character is still here, but inventory is full. I see buildings nearby, but no merchant. At least in Morrowind I could give myself infinite feather. In Skyrim I have a ring that gives me ludicrous carryweight. Oblivion is more of a pain. But this? Again; too much crap, not enough inventory space.  Also, I don't like how the bows work, & that's my primary weapon. It's unlike all other Elder Scrolls.(well Morrowind, Oblivion & Skyrim. I haven't played the other ones.)"
Negative,"ForewordThis review was written by a Christian, and is addressed to persons who have an ""Abrahamic"" moral foundation, whether for religious or ideological reasons.I felt compelled to write this as a warning to both newcomers and existing players. I know it will receive little attention, but even warning half a dozen players is enough for me.I also understand the review is unnecessarily long, and my thoughts are randomly written do with no rational order, so I am obligated to give you a TL;DR: The game's lore is immoral and intentionally pushes a take on sexuality that I disagree with. Furthermore, the designers/developers chose to literally erase any differing view on this matter while pushing their own view, which I consider more sleazy than portraying such ideas through an ""evil"" cult or faction. Finally, the deep lore is sickening and twisted - ancient Greek mythology pales in comparison.___________________________________________The Whole ReviewInitially, I gave this game a positive rating, because, technically, it is indeed a good MMORPG. I am a former WoW player and have been searching for a replacement for a long time now. All MMORPGs I tried so far felt cheap or had a meh lore. ESO didn't feel like that at all, and I returned to it several times to try new characters and areas.However, after some time, I started noticing how frequently NPCs discussed something about their sexual life, especially when compared to other games. Soon, I realised that the whole lore is drenched in sexual material.The main issues with this ""material"" are two.1. The deep lore is rich in it and it is very twisted.2. The basic lore, as seen in the games, features a considerable amount of sexual references. These references all fall under the same agenda - i.e. they all tell the same story through the same point of view.The Elder Scrolls universe is supposed to be vast, and cultures clash on several levels, with intense racist remarks being common. However, no differing views are given on this topic.I won't discuss the details here to avoid a removal of the review, and because it's  disgusting and lame. I can say, however, that when I finished reading the stuff I found on the various Elder Scrolls wikis and forums, I uninstalled the game. Just as an example: look up the relationship between Molag Bal and Vivec. Look up ""ŁĞBŤ people"" in The Elder Scrolls, and tell me if it is just inclusion (which is fine by me), or pushing and pandering. Isn't it funny that a world that is filled with social, cultural and racial strife, miraculously portrays a universe where no debate exists about what marriage and sexuality should be like. In the real world, though, such strife exists and not just due to the ""abrahamic bigots"". Unfortunately, most people will shrug at the ""deep lore"" or even commend it as original, while praising the basic one for the inclusion and diversity. The main issue here is how the franchise pioneered this new trend in games from more or less the beginning.My regret is that I found out how sick the deep lore is only after investing hundreds of hours into Oblivion, Skyrim and ESO. It didn't help that the explicit references increased exponentially with ESO, which I played last. Look, there are many games out there which put the player in weird and controversial worlds, and allow him/her to take moral stances in both ways, and most games simply take no stance on anything, avoiding controversial topics. The Elder Scrolls games aren't among those. They ask no questions, they do not make you think. Rather, they have been the pioneers of this new way of making games: using them to do virtue signalling and pushing ideas.To sum it up, this is yet another fantasy world drenched in whatever modern society believes, where there is no room for believing anything different. If you want interesting fantasy worlds check out Tolkien's work or the Warhammer Fantasy franchise. The older Warcraft products are of good quality as well. Why? Because those games show different societies with differing ideas on everything, and there is strife on all levels. You will have to choose where to stand. In TES, and ESO in particular, you don't get this. You only get their view, whatever path you take.Thus, I ask you this: how can a fictional world be true to itself, when the current mainstream agenda in the real world dictates so much about its content?I rate it 0/10.Stay away."
Negative,"I find the core gameplay boring, the combat is just not fun."
Negative,Laggy trash unless you live in America or Europe. Dont bother playing if your from anywhere else. If you live in Australia PVP is horrible which is 50% of the fun. In pve you can not weapon swap to get your maximum DPS penitential because the almost second lag makes it not even register the key press. They are willing to take the money from the east but they dont want to bring a server to make the customer get what they payed for. Do not buy this trash!
Negative,"Pay-To-WinGame offers in app purchases.by purchasing in-game currency (""crowns"") you can get various upgrades.By purchasing ""premium subscription"" you also gain unfair advantage.This model is unacceptable, especially for PAID games."
Negative,"this game is absolute trash, enemies respawn behind you 10 seconds after you kill them, the economy is nothing like other TES games, the grind is ridiculious, the tutorial is next to nothing there are waaaay to many dlcs. i can go on and on, but the put it short. this game is absolute trash and nowhere near worth 10$, as most its worth 5 or less"
Negative,Your steaming pile of excrement launcher has corrupted itself for the 3rd time now since I've had the game. Every time I take a break for a few months & come back this POS software is broken & wants to download another 60GBs. Game over.
Negative,"For me, as a guy who detests Bretons... Imagine making an ENTIRE chapter about the most boring race to play; seriously, you have Nords, Imperials and Redguards to play :D  ""Understandable"", devs may make chapters about every race and fulfil lore, etc., but they repeat the same mistakes.  The game scarcely has new mechanics. It still has a weird auto-attack after a skill, poor animations, broken PvP. Besides the aforementioned, you neither get new classes nor skill revamps for the chapter.  Unfortunately, Blackwood was a tiny barren-populated swamp with a too-brief storyline; yet fortunately, the game already has many other chapters to explore to get not bored."
Negative,"This game is for babies. I have spent over $1,000 in this game to get what I want. And in every update, my armor gets ruined and I have to spend another $1,000 to pay people for what I want and to get carried in trials. This game has caused me to become broke and shoot drugs into my arms so I do not feel about anymore about all the money I have wasted. I will not play this game anymore as I think World of War Craft is still better and the play style beats whatever this game is. Please save your money and do not play this tencent game. I give this game a 0/10Pros-I like to think the horses are from My Little Pony Friendship is MagicCons-Not fun-toxic people-someone stole my credit card information twice on here-stinky poo poo-I still wear diapers-The RNG boxes in the game have bad skins and are not worth the crowns-I wasted a total of $2,943.23 on this game alone-The graphics downgraded-I sold my bike by meeting someone here"
Negative,"The game is ok. A hard downside for me is: i messed up in the character creator wich i first didnt noticed, only after getting a significant levels. Now it will cost me almost 20€ to buy a token to change the appearance of my character. Hell, the whole crownstore and its tokens is a rip off."
Negative,You might as well get WoW! This isn't the Elder Scrolls I Know and Love...
Negative,"Account banned for no reason.  Didnt bought ingame items or money. Didnt use any bots, software, hardware. I didnt even talked to anyone (i mean alive humans). P.s. Account restored by support."
Negative,"Fun gameplay! I'll probably keep playing it. The quests and lore are interesting, several of the recurring NPCs are genuinely fun to interact with, and I haven't really gotten bored yet.The real shame is how much they try to wring every dollar out of you -- basically anything you want to do will likely have a DLC/expansion attached to it. Be prepared to see a bajillion reminders on how you can spend money on this game.The community is awful. I have to mute the chat 90% of the time so I don't have to see slurs and hatred being thrown around. I literally saw someone unironically try to defend human trafficking in chat. Oooor the time someone tried to defend slavery. Or racial slurs. Or plenty of other completely awful things. Probably the least friendly in-game chat I've experienced (I'm sure other games are worse, but that's not exactly making this game ""better"" in any way).I'll keep playing, for certain. I just have to mute the chat and ignore all the ways the game wants me to open my wallet. If your MMO requires you to ignore other players to have fun, then there's a problem."
Negative,"The game is fun to play - if you manage to login. Today i'm placed in a 'Login - queue' with a wait time of 10 minutes! Sometimes I cannot login at all; usually after they patched something. It may take a day until they fix it. If login succeeds it takes a good minute of your time, then another minute to load the character into the world (with the Hard-drive being idle most of the time). Of course loading into an area or a dungeon also takes some time...Another annoyance is the very limited inventory you have without the subscription. And there's a good amount of different resources you want/need to pick up for the crafting + all the loot you want.These are the reasons for me to stop playing this game. I cannot recommend it."
Negative,"Been craving to play a new mmorpg for a while and have heard about good things for ESO. Decided to give it a try and so far, I am not satisfied with my time on ESO.Given that the game has fantastic story line, combat, and community. The 1 negative part that is throwing me off the most is how ESO's servers run. They use mega servers and a ddos protection that reroutes your connection causing you to have higher latency. When going to zones with a dense popution, ping would spike past 500. Normal ping for a NA - East player would be around 120+. There are countless times when I'm doing a solo dungeon, my ping would spike to 999 for a few seconds causing me to lose the fight. The issue isn't ISP based, but it is on Zenimax's end for being a client towards the ddos protection service. On their forums, there have been multiple users reporting the issue and their typical response is to contact the ISP.Until then, I want to give ESO another chance once the latency issue has been fixed."
Negative,"6 hours and I still can't get this game to work. One of if not, THE worst support I have come across."
Negative,so much damn storage required fuck you
Negative,jams and cumron big gay
Negative,this game is a cash grab
Negative,Has no feel as to the Elder Scroll series. I was just expecting it to be a little more like the old ones and not like a completely different game. I would not recomend this game unless you have seen video footage of someone playing on YouTube and feel like you would enjoy this game.
Negative,"I love the game so far, I only regret buying it through Steam. It's a shame really, that there is problems with connection through Steam so often.  If you want to buy this game, buy it from the official store, not Steam."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THROUGH STEAM, THE GAME IT SELF IS GOOD BUT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LOG IN DUE TO SERVER ISSUES WITH STEAM(LOGIN ERRORS) BUY THE GAME FROM THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE"
Negative,"Solid MMO mechanics, drab art, forgettable story quest chains, subcription model is decent, the loot boxes in the shop are ofc bullshit."
Negative,WARNING!! Don't buy this game if you dont live in Europe or America! They bullshit you. Pretty sure the dev's don't care about this issue. The server is on a endless loop of downloading files. I downloaded 160gb of this game and it still doesnt work. I would love to have my money back. I am very irratated it tells me I played 20 min. this is not true the game doesnt open at all. Don't waste your time and money
Negative,"Theoreticaly fun game, but so stale and boring. Compared to any other MMORPG of equal AAA quality, its just lost in its own open design.Classes dont matter, as there is way too much freedom in chosing what skills you spec in. Everything ""epic"" looking is behind a paywall, aswell as having decent inventory, bankspace requires real game payment vs way too much time farming ingame....Problem is also, you have to be at least level 50 to reach a rather fun gameplay, but still it doesnt change much to the positive. Having played this game at launch, aswell as now a few years later, it certainly is a worthy competitor to games like wow and lotro which havent aged like fine wine aswell. But for an Elder Scrolls Game, this isnt what you're looking for. Meaningless progression, non rewarding gameplay and just inifinite gameplay loop of doing nothing enticing."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, and if you do, DO NOT INVEST YOUR TIME INTO IT!!!First month playing, completed 27 daily objectives in 27 days, daily objectives timer reset and did not grant the opportunity to get 100k gold, customer service was completely uncooperative, they do not value their consumers.  They first closed my ticket before I had a chance to respond to their request, then closed my second ticket under their claim that it was a duplicate of the first ticket.  I would STRONGLY advise against purchasing an ESO Plus Premium subscription or Crowns through their Crown Store.Zenimax and Bethesda should be ashamed of themselves for having piss-poor customer relations."
Negative,"I am very impressed with the fact that they managed to make what was already an boring combat system with little to no feedback or depth even worse. Perhaps it is a simple fact that I am not an MMO man, but with Bethesda being reknown for making aggressively competent, albeit increasingly more soulless titles, one would be forgiven to think that this would also be aggressively average. And honestly, any combat system that isn't Ye Olde Tab Targeted Taskbar Combat should feel like an improvement. But instead it is a boring slog in a boring world with a boring story and boring characters. It doesn't even manage to achieve the infamous Todd Howard seal of 'Okay I guess.'Maybe I was wrong for expecting too much from an MMO, but frankly this belongs in the Fus Ro Dumpster."
Negative,"Console style controls, inventory. Bad combat. Utterly uninteresting and boring pile of <insert expletive> money grab. You don't want to waste your time on this !@#$%^&* even if you'd get paid for playing this."
Negative,"idk why i paid money for this. very shallow game. the only depth is the existing Elder Scrolls lore. lame quests that seem like they're meant for people with room temperature IQ, and meh combat. Non-existent economy. Feels like a watered down Skyrim, and it might as well be because nobody interacts with each other in this game. You will basically be playing singleplayer with random players running around you."
Negative,"I cant even get past the first menu cause every word i put is inappropriate, i actually typed in Hello as my character name and that was gate blocked, i cant even play it what so ever"
Negative,lowkey dont get if alone only with friends this shit mad boring without friends
Negative,"There is elder scrolls lore and some quality writing but that's it. As a rule of thumb with all MMOs, they're all garbage."
Negative,"This game is fun but jesus christ, this shit crashes more than drunk drivers do"
Negative,"As an old school mmo player I find this just a bit too easy really, its not nearly challenging enough.All the mobs seem to scale to always be the same level as you, so you can go anywhere without real fear of dying, its just a bit carebear imho, no higher lev mobs that can scare you.Its pretty but ultimately just a bit meh."
Negative,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!Endless loading screens, unresponsive devs. The game is pretty great the two or three hours I've actually gotten to play. But since launch (before Steam), the same problems have plagued this game, as Google will show you. The devs simply do not care. They will blame your computer instead of fixing the issue. Doesn't matter what computer you have, its still your fault.Its a crying shame Steam won't refund me for ESO: Loading Screen. So I offer this warning to others."
Negative,"I was curious. My curiosity satiated. While I've enjoyed The Elder Scrolls since Daggerfall, there is something off in ESO. The other games offer grit, challenge, and struggle. I found none of that in ESO. I didn't like micromanaging my inventory--and I'm not about to pay a sub fee for the privilege. The dialog felt so polished that it failed to match pain and struggle the characters should/would be going through. It's also odd to me how uninterested enemies are in the player character. This definitely reduces the tension felt in the environment. All this said, please note that I'm not a huge MMO advocate--Diablo 2 being the closest experience that I've enjoyed. Perhaps if you liked MMOs you'd like ESO., or if you had a group of friends to party up with."
Negative,"This game is not fun, most of the quests are bad (usually fetch quests), the story isn't immersive at all, and grinding ain't fun.It *can* be fun with friends, but most of the actual good quests (main storyline) are solo dungeons.My friend also had to delete all other games so he could download this, and now we can no longer play other games until he re-downloads them.Also, download times suck."
Negative,This is a great game but either Bethesda or Steam can't get together to allow you to log in.  This lastest bug has kept me from a game I truely enjoy for two days.  Now I'm having to go through the uninstall / reinstall drill once again.  Maybe this is why Bethesda chose to dump Steam for the Fallout 76 release?I have almost 500 hours in the game and I am teetering on the brink of walking away.  A shame really because WHEN you  get to play it's a great game.  But I want to play when I want to play.
Negative,"I used to really enjoy the game, but now its getting way too expensive. Dont fall for it."
Negative,"If you are a fan of the Elder Scrolls universe then there will be details in this game that will infuriate you. After 5 years the dev team decided to throw out Elder Scrolls lore and just do what they wanted, even if it removed legacy features that have been present for 25 years in the Elder Scrolls universe. Its a great game, I just don't know if it deserves the Elder Scrolls namesake anymore.If you aren't a fan of the Elder Scrolls universe, then this is actually a wonderful mmo full of exciting and engaging content. They have regular events and an active community. The quests range from simple fetch to thought-provoking puzzles. They really hit their stride during the Clockwork City expansion, story-telling wise. Some of the additions have been extraneous grinding (Psijic Order) but not ""asian mmo"" levels of grinding. Crafting and the player economy are well integrated as well. You must be part of a player guild to sell, but there isn't much worth selling until you reach the first level cap (cp160). You can play the entire game without the subscription. They've also allowed ""gifting"" so some of the game store content can be acquired through gold trades with players (use discretion). I recommend getting the subscription eventually because it unlocks the DLC (and gives you an infinite craft bag). If you don't subscribe, you just have to be aware of what crafting materials are worth keeping, use a lot of alts for bank space, and maximize your inventory with housing storage. Some DLC has replay value (Orsinium, Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood etc), but the dlc dungeons and raids/trials require dedication and training so you might only play them once or twice for an armor set and be done with it. Better to have that bundled than to pay separately for something too tedious to finish more than once. Even if you find the dungeons fun, it can be tedious finding a competent group. PVP is actually great if it works. You put down trebuchets and ballistae to knock down walls/bridges. You kill other players and npc guards, you turn flags and you repair fortresses all to win a 7 day or 30 day campaign. Another pvp map has player drops enabled for a special currency acquired and used in that specific map. They also have 4x4x4 battlegrounds (capture the flag, land grabs) if you want a quick bout. As years go by, the pvp servers get laggier and more frustrating, but when it all comes together you can have massive sieges and battles that actually require strategy, teamwork and timing over ""twitchy clicking"". There is a game store but luckily nothing in there is pay to win. Its cosmetics and conveniences, nothing that will make you more powerful and nothing that is unattainable in game. There are a few cosmetics (pets, costumes, mounts) in the game itself but not much. All the shiny stuff is in the store. They've also made an outfit or ""transmog"" system so you can essentially make your own costume regardless of the default style of dropped armor.If you like the classic mmo experience of tank, healer, damage dealer, then you have a large variety of options to accomplish each role. Of course there will always be one build that is, mathematically, the best but if you learn your role and game mechanics well there's nothing in the game you can't finish.This game is also good because it has a long learning curve. When you start it is pretty simple (put on light armor and staff and cast some spells for example) but as you learn more (use online guides, the game barely teaches you) you find depth in the combat system. There are numerous factors that go into making an effective character such as attributes, active abilities, passive abilities, armor sets, armor weights, potions, holding attacks, weaving basic attacks between abilities, group synergy, blessings, and much more. Once you've mastered it you'll begin to see the massive amount of power creep and become aware of the ever changing goal posts. Until then, its good clean fun and a satisfying feeling of progression.I recommend this game only if you don't care about the Elder Scrolls universe/story/lore and you don't get attached to characters/characteristics. If that's the case for you this has all the theme park activities you expect from a world class mmo and plenty to keep you occupied for years."
Negative,This game block IRAN players   only can play with VPN  and Never buy this game in iran
Negative,boring af lol
Negative,"After spending nearly 3 hours downloading the game, I couldn't even get past the launcher's initial loading screen which I waited at for all 79mins of my ""play time"". Bullshit."
Negative,"Thank the gods it was 15 bucks. And you must just not know about other mmo's to play this as your first choice. Did you just hit level for pvp, well go to cyradill oh wait u need to buy that area or sub.......... Did you want to make a awesom archer like in skyrim.... well instead we use the archery blows engine from right here in 1996... because why make it as good as in skyrim or oblivion... Games dog carp, buggy ugly turd."
Negative,"Pros.Very attractive game.Has one of my favourite character creation options in a game ever. Very nice.Cons.It's all looks.The game is pretty shallow in actuallity.Made to look like an elderscrolls. Its not an elderscrolls.Combat is pretty dull. Mash any of your attacks and just steer out of the way of obvious danger. Its a fetch quest after fetch quest. Bet every personality void enemy. Mash any speech options you get given, you will end up doing the same thing regardless.You genuinley dont have to read a damn thing to play this game.(if you can call this a game). The lore is just thrown at you. A lot of it is butchered versions of the actual ES lore. The factions makeno sence.The Awe of the environments and mystery of deep forgotten ruins are ruined by usual mmo bullshit. Just bundred if other people running around 'forgotten dungeons with their weeby little pets. Kind of just makes a clustered ugly sight.So much dialogue. So little interest.In game purchases are thrown in your face all the time in all menues. I dont want them. Leave me alone.Basic functions such as actuall inventory space for all the ingredients you might want is a PAID for feature... as in, i have to pay a subscription to carry more than my encumbrance worth in tiny minor things. Its not measured in minor weight kike  an actual ES game. Its measured in encumbrance points which every item will use at least one of. But with the PAID SUBSCRIPTION. A butterly wing wont take up a major percentage of my carrying capacity...i can have as much as i want. Sort of a basic function really. The menues are ugly. Too much crap chucked in your face.Just feels like Elderscrolls the disneyland ride. With cutsey mascots and gift shops plaguing every nook cranny and where you look.Played the free weekend. Not paying  for another mmo turd rolled in glitter. Uninstalling. Huge Waste of time and drive space."
Negative,"Disclaimer: I am not a MMO player. Aside from StarCraft back in the late 90's early 00's, I do not play this genre of games. However, I have played the Elder Scrolls from Daggerfall to Skyrim. 300+ Hours on Oblivion and 200+ on Skyrim. While ES Online looks like Elder Scrolls, thats about it. The menus, looting, skill trees, RPG intricacies, and overall feel of the game is something totally different. If you are a big MMO player and are comfortable tossing aside a lot of what has made Elder Scrolls what it is, then this game is worth a shot. I do not think that ES Online is horrible per say, it just lacks that true Elder Scrolls feel, for me. Because this has the ""Elder Scrolls"" name attached, I cannot recommend."
Negative,"All of the microtransactions of a mobile game with none of the heart of the Elder Scrolls stand alone games.  I've put thousands of hours in to Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, and over 4000 hours in to World of Warcraft.  Couldn't get in to this game at all."
Negative,for the 10 year anniversary celebration i uninstalled it again
Negative,"F-tier game, S-tier friends."
Negative,"A soulless boring waste of time. Nothing you do matters. Everythings is a meaningless waste of your time. The areas are designed like Knight Online or an MMO from 2003 with a small budget. Its an ""elder scrolls"" sight seeing game. You are an unkillable god running around doing meaningless tasks for character you do not care about. You are hoarding meaningless items that just make skill number go up for no reason because the good gear is found elsewhere. There is no weight to my attacks. There is no meaning to anything I do. Everything looks extremely ugly and boring. Everything is generic and lifeless. Its like you explained Skyrim to someone fresh out of school for a game design career that didn't actually play games and they gave you this inch deep skin of a game. I have never felt so alone and bored and meaningless in an MMO before. The abilities are meaningless they are just an explanation of an ability on a button and my dude just does another meaningless weightless attack for a different set of damage numbers. I waited a long time to play the game and damn I understand now. I was really hopeful. I was really interested when I bought it. This game is essentially the same as every cookie cutter early 2000s game that just tried to jump on the MMO band wagon. If you like walking from one place to another to hear sub-par dialogue this is the game for you. Half the quests are just worse version of Skyrim and Oblivion quests too and the lore is just told to you.. its just told to you... here in year blah blah blah blah blah happened to blah blah. Is that fun? Is that anything like exploring a crypt in skyrim? No its not. This fucking sucks. I wish I could refund it but I waited too long."
Negative,The game is pretty much unplayable if you do not have a subscription just walk away now its not worth the time or effort.
Negative,Game is fun when you aren't have a ton of bugs and crashing all the time. 9/10 when working and 0/10 when the game decides to shit itself.
Negative,"You need a patience of a saint for this bugfest. The more hours you put into this game, the more annoying the new patches and dlcs will become. Don`t get me started on the ""monthly subscription only"" dungeons and the never ending money grabbing this game does. Don`t get me wrong, most of the quests are fun, except the repetitive ones when you have to hold the line against 3-4 mobs in 3-5 waves. That thing happens too often with the main quest line, and frankly lame. So don`t make the mistake I did, and waste more than 1000 hours on a game witch keeps you in a hamster wheel. Buy skyrim, or replay skyrim with mods."
Negative,"Huge solo pve world...PvP is complete garbage. No Risk vs reward in this game.  No Challenges, The Race and Class system is pointless as all races and classes can heal and cast. All classes are casters. Tanks are casters. Stealth is casters..all magic driven.  Went from 0 to 46 in 1 day of playing died 2 times. If you like doing quests and chasing story lines solo this is a good game. Everything else is just a horrible mix of flashy graphics and spamming the same spell all day."
Negative,Just dont buy from steam I did and every week we get a patch and you cannot log in via steam unless you mess about or they fix it a day alter DO NOT BUY via steam if you wnt to play this skinner box of a game get it via ESo direct
Negative,Do not buy off of steam.  The server disconnects you then reconnecting times out repeatedly for a prolonged period of time.  Apparently this is common for the steam version and has been a recurring issue for a while.  Buy directly from Zenimax or take your money elsewhere. :(
Negative,"Common MMO. Nothing special. For TES fans maybe this game will be good.  I think MMOs in 2017 should be far more than this type of game, which already old as hell and looks more like cliche or parody of itself."
Negative,"hangs when running ""install anywhere"" on Linux (proton experimental), with a modern graphics card. No idea if it's any good because it won't run."
Negative,"This game keeps crashing.  We tried all the possible solutions and the developer's website says it must be an ISP issue and so it is not their problem.  That is a weak excuse from a poor publisher, imo."
Negative,"boring game , many quest about talk talk talk talk talk talk"
Negative,They ruined Battlegrounds
Negative,"DONT BUY VIA STEAM !!!the game is ok game rich lore and interesting combat system. But its buggy sometimes dungeon finder is always broken during events. Login proces  x10 times longer if its bought on Steam, so buy from ESO store!!"
Negative,"Wow, I played the game for three days and got my first ever permanent ban in many years of playing online games.  Apparently playing the game is ""cheating"".  I'm currently waiting to see just what I did that they call cheating, but anyway this is really annoying. That said, I find character creation ok, but the class system feels very limited. It also pushes buy upgrades from the game store a lot. DO NOT leave your child access to making purchases while in game or you could owe a lot of money to this game."
Negative,"Interesting story & lore, flushed out large maps but let down by 'Meh' Combat & crafting paywall.Every quest NPC is fully voiced and the storyboard for the main quests of each area are very fascinating for fans of the Elder Scrolls franchise.  The large landscapes look beautiful and their inhabitants are well placed and feel authentic.  Some of the more populated towns can come across as small in scale compared to some of the stand alone Elder Scrolls titles.The combat can feel very slow and cumbersome, it's almost identical to the combat gameplay of 'Guild Wars 2' but less engaging and the movesets can become stagnant very quickly.If you want to craft then you will have to pay for the monthly subscription as it's essential gives you unlimited inventory space for crafting items, without it your inventory will fill quickly leaving you to spend most of your playtime managing what your carrying.I rate this game an £8.99 ESO plus membership out of ten."
Negative,"As much fun as the game is, if you have the 334 error problem you are not playing this game without a struggle. Dont bother contacting support.....not sure why they have that function though. Playing 10 other online games with no online connection fuss, then there is ESO.....334 this and 334 that. Now i must use a VPN to play and it sucks. My advice, wait till they have a FREE weekend, and see if you can login with no 334 error bs, only then consider buying the game. DO not buy this before you tested it."
Negative,"Honestly, it could've been promising, but the game was gimped by having to deal with Console-level control schemes.  That is my second biggest gripe, however.  My biggest gripe has to be that all of the big updates are PURCHASED DLC.  That's right, in a game you have to pay for, upfront, and you don't get everything in it unless you THEN pay an extra subscription fee.  And if you stop paying, well, then too bad.Its just...  So bad.  Its disappointing.  And, well...  For an RPG, there is very little R."
Negative,"what a crap, all my 3 hours of ""play"" are download and ""repair"" times. Bethesda has stolen the time for refund, I wasn't able to start the game once.what a piece of junk"
Negative,"Graphics: coolCombat: pseudo action - sucksSkills: much glowy glowy blowy stuff but no effect on enemies which is sillySkill tree: cool, nice freedom and nice leveling and upgrading skillsThe surrounding and lore: ubearable for TES fan"
Negative,Although the game is good i keep getting systematic errors out of nowhere i tried the other methods besides uninstalling the fucking game bethesda please fix your server also there is toxic groups who attack newbie players and sometimes out of nowhere
Negative,"just spent money on it and it doesn twork, im getting error code , i cannot manage with any work around i googled and its a reocurring issue all the way back from 2017, I tried to log in to customer support which does not work ... so , amazing experience, game could be good but zenimax is incopetent, this is a massive fail for one of the biggest mmorpgs."
Negative,I didn't like the combat mechanism and was dissatisfied with the overall gameplay. The combat compromises of smashing with number buttons to do certain attack and power you have aquired correspondeting with the number. Inventory management was very bad and acquiring more space is costly. Crafting mechanism was complex and some aspects was difficult to understand. Also big portion of the content is behind additional paywalls. Good aspect of this game is that the map size is very big and lots of interesting locations to visit. Also the graphics was decent with interesting enviroment. This game has lots of quests and some of them where interesting. However many of the quests where very repetitive and boring. The story narrative was very bad since they used lots of fantasy terminology in a way that made it hard to follow and the story eventually became uninteresting and boring. I would not recommend this game.
Negative,"I dont know where to begin. If you like a game that focused on making sure they always have new stuff to purchase while not fixing any of the game breaking issues, this is the game for you. They will not let you down in making sure you can spend more money if you want but dont expect to be able to use the mounts you just purchase because you will be stuck in combat and not be able to mount like I have for the last 10 years. Also they will give you more new sets even though 85% of them are already useless, But wait theres more! they wont fix a single flucking thing in pvp because pvers make them more money although this game was origianally a pvp focus game. Anyways dont waste your time, if your not in a form of meta you cant make it far.UPDATE!!!! So when you tell them the truth in the forums they ban you, forums and in game. Telling a business that they seem to always have new shit to sell every other week but wont fix server performance that they are doing it wrong to them is wrong that I spoke the truth, A 10 year player that has seen this game decline, I have 12 accounts all over 1000 CP just on PC, MAX CP 3600 on PSN and XBOX EU and NA. They only care about sucking the cash from you.... FIN"
Negative,"This game was fun at first, but the combat is clunky and intuitive, and there is not much to do in the game beyond trying pointlessly to do harder combat with groups where it is literally just memorizing some overly punishing mechanics and trying to heard cats, this game is extremely money hungry with its appearance loot crates not actually letting you buy any of the cosmetics that are decent directly but instead having to roll on incredibly low chances to get a bunch of trash to turn into gems and maybe if you spend a few thousand dollars get a skin that you want. Loved it at first while the over world was still somewhat of a challenge but after a few milestones that changed and most of my time in game was spent aimlessly wandering while waiting for people to get together to do a half hour to an hour of content. was my first mmo that I really sunk my teeth into and for that I am grateful but much better games out there with long term playabilty and that don't beat around the bush for your money."
Negative,"Everything good I once thought of this game is gone.Devs are in profit mode.They have a chat AI reading ALL your chat windows and banning you for using 'no-no' words like something out of 1984.Don't waste your time, they're just trying to destroy their own game now."
Negative,"It's kinda ugly, the quests are boring, the combat is boring, the exploration is boring and all the systems are so clunky with the lag since I have no region servers(Or maybe they are suppose to be that way).I was expecting a seamless exploration game of the entire world but the map appears to still require zone loading. This is not a ""Everything the light touches"" kind of game.-I can't level any or every skill that I want.-I'm picking up materials that have no value and I don't have the skill to use them and I do not have the bag space to store them so they get deleted.-Bag space, full before the tutorial sequence finished. Cannot upgrade bag space from the start and it caps out at double what you start with.-Players and NPCs look alike. I'd like to remove players from rendering on my screen (this is an mmo so egg on my face when I expect the ability to delete players from my game).-The camera itself feels very clunky in first person. There is no segregation between Vert/Horizontal mouse speed, there is only one speed for mouse speed.-No Oceania support. Yeah it feels like attempting to pilot the rovers on Mars. Everything hits me 15 mins before I see the animation.-An incomplete experience: I was interested in this game because of the ""One Tamriel"" trailer. Bottom line is that it is not. What I purchased was a ""Quarter of Tamriel"".Absolutely dissapointed."
Negative,"Dont make a magicka character cause you gonna be farming one specific dungeon till you wanna just preffer to be dead, you gonna be hunting snakes for 70-100 runs for one freaking inferno stuff. Just ridiculous 0/10 this farm is in no way fun"
Negative,"Alt+F4 doesn't kill the background process.Inventory space is extremely limited, with virtually no storage options until you get to late game or if you want to purchase MTX.Generic enemies and fairly repetitive combat, until you get to an enemy that you simply cannot solo.Many missions seem to be in the format of:1) Talk to person A2) Go through 3 loading screens and 10 minutes of running3) Talk to person B4) Repeat Step 25) Repeat Step 1 6) Repeat Step 27) Find these 3 things8) Repeat Step 29) Talk to person C"
Negative,"I have played the game on PS4 for about 4 months hardcore, I tanked and ran all vet dungeons and did some raids. Recently I tried on PC to get back into the game and like before, I lost interest in the game pretty fast. I would recommend waiting for Amazon's new World and save your money for that, that game will have much more to offer then ESO.My opinion/issues with ESO are:1 .The game is a overall major cash grab, if you start to play you will see what I mean. I believe ESO has one of the worst micro-transactions in any MMO every, in fact there are regular popup screens advertising there Crown store its that bad. Storage is a major issue, which if you play the game for end game content then you will need to buy storage chest's at some point to hold all you gear, which you purchase with real life money mind you.2. The game's zone's are garbage, why, well you can travel most zone's in the game and not ever once worry about being in danger, there is a Emptiness in the open world when your traveling around. I found it troubling for example ""Blackwood"" when that released day one I was traveling around the zone and almost nothing to fight, just open world. Every zone has enemy npc's, yes, however are they tough to kill, absolutely not, again when you encounter enemy npc's there is really no threat at all. The game's open world is not challenging, left me feeling like BLAAAH.3. The Dungeons: this is a tough one for me, I loved the dungeons in ESO, however also hated them for a few reason. ESO dungeons are easy mode up to DLC vet dungeons and in no what shape or form prepare new players for proper fight mechanics in a dungeon or how to play one's character to there best ability, sorry unless your in a completely brand new low level group of new players which you might never been because the game is not attracting new players much anymore, then maybe the dungeon might be difficult. and most of them are easy with the exception of a few, that's if you have a good group that knows there class and how to play there class then some vet dungeons are truly ever difficult.Most of the time people smash out a normal/vet dungeon just to get it done, they rush thru ahead of the group and sometimes makes thing more messy and worse then if they had stayed and properly fought with the group, you will see A whole lot of elitism types in the game as every mmo, ESO overall game design breads it due to how not challenging the game really is and self healing. Team work is not much of a thing in ESO, Now are there guilds and people that care about team work, yes and I always loved running dungeons with them, it was a epic rare find though lol. The second time around I did not guild up because I wanted to wait and see if I could get back into the game. SO 12 person raids, I did not do much so I cant really touch on that, however at the end of ESO is only 12 person raids, again leaves the game feeling empty. unless you love the quests, after playing MMO'S for so long, quest are an absolute nightmare for me, the Elswayr's quest's with the dragon were only my favorite.There is some more,however I think I hit the bread and butter of my issues that have turned me away. I just hope to save you money, maybe. I realize games are subjective and you may end up liking the game. The issues I pointed out are my opinions.Forgot to mention PVP, I did not do much at all."
Negative,"My 4483 Hours of Play in ESO....This was an awsome game but now it its filled with overpriced crown store items, Vegas style RNG loot boxes, numerous game breaking bugs, Bot trains, exploits a plenty, and continous broken patches. The last patch was so broken that it enabled people in Imperial City to get 2million exp points per kill. Intead of taking down the server immediatly or giving a warning they chose to Ban the people that  were in Imperial City for 2 weeks. There are numerous Utube videos that show the Bot Trains farming in zones for 2 years. Even videos of players trolling the Bot trains by pulling mobs onto them to interrupt the bots....ZOS is completly inept at and enforcing a stable anti bot anti exploiting game play. The amount of bugs have increased with each ""Bug Fixing Patch"". They have had terrible LAG in the Cyrodiil PVP Zone for over 3 years now such as weapon swaping, using abilities, and rubber banding issues. All the while solving nothing but adding an ever increasing amount of Crown store items and more buggy DLCs. I can now see the writing on the wall for ESO. This kinda of neglect and a completly useless response from ZOS is the same thing you see in all MMORPgs that fail to address thier problems and end up with a mass Exodus resulting in the end of the game. I would not recommend anyone waste money or time playing this buggy mess...they will not fix it...they are not capable of fixing the game but rather they can only try to suck more $ out of this ever increasing buggy pile of garbage."
Negative,"Ok this game looked quite good in the trailer. But in game nah, didnt like it. I have played past Bethesda game like Skyrim, Fallout NV, Fallout 3/4, them games where outstanding. It is probrably the MM0 feature. If you like MMO'S get it. If your looking for an other skyrim well this isnt that. If you want another Skyrim just go back and mod skyrim a butt tone. I would not recommed this game."
Negative,"When I first installed the game, it didn't work. It had to run 81 minutes to check and repair the entire download. The next time I tried to run it, it spent hours downloading an 1GB update to the game. I never even got to try the game. Steam says that I cannot get a refund on it since I played it for over two hours already. The Steam game timer says I've played for five hours now, and there's no way to contact them to ask for any kind of help. I feel that you would be better off going to the original game company and buying it from them since you would at least get better support there.EDIT: Half of the game is locked, and can only be unlocked if you pay the monthly rental fee for premium services and features. That's not listed in the description, either."
Negative,hey can we set the damn EU server maintenance for a different time like lets say i dont know when most people are at work and not when most people are getting off work. FFS i barely get to play as it is. would be nice to be able to play when i get some free time to. maintenance from 5pm to 11pm or till 4am are not ideal times for maintenance how about starting the maintenance at 14:00 UTC
Negative,I had been playing about a month before this latest update and was enjoying the game on PC. I was even preparing to subscribe. But after this update the game is horrible. the layout is ridiculous and slow. I have to push E to do anything instead of click. Can not find and compare weapons and armor easily. I really hate it. They took an excellent system and screwed it over. Really sad. All I will do now is log in to get the rewards and wait for them to change it back. Not wasting my time trying to play this now.
Negative,"no one erps :(I am appalled and quite frankly disappointed at the lack of erpers in eso. I came from skyrim in hopes of erping the lusty lesbian argonian maids with somebody special and cuddling as we do so. Hopefully this can be fixed in the later updates and more people can erp together to the lusty lesbian argonian maids. i, a lesbian, loving lusty lesbian argonian maids. ;("
Negative,"Grindy and not that cool gameplay. The loot is better as new content comes out so it can basically become pay to win. The Elder Scrolls universe is interesting and it might be worthy playing for that and if you are a fan of games that you play cause they give you loot and not because they are fun. I only play it anymore cause I got it for free on the PSNOW subscription, which also gave me fallout 4 which is far more interesting, I think the xbox pass gives you skyrim but not sure about eso."
Negative,"Meh combat, didn't feel immersed in the universe."
Negative,"I wanted to update this, old one used too many words to say: IF you can play this game completely free, so you are only taking server space from them go for it. There is no point spending money to support them because they do not invest it back into the community. Every time I come back to check the state of the game I am more disappointed. Could have been so good."
Negative,"It has some very nice scenes and a huge amount of quests. You can't finish some missions because you have to buy the DLC. It suffers from what other regular MMOs are typical for. - Hello there, you are the foretold hero! *surrounded by literally 5 other so called heroes.*- * Kills dangerous foe * phew, that was some fight. *dangerous foe spawns again for next players to kill, attacks you again* - enemies are just spawned randomly, doing nothing but waiting to attack you once noticed. The newness of the quests wears off after a while and it gets a bit bland. If you grinding this game is for you. I loved the artwork. I truly do. But with the typical problems of MMOs this is no Skyrim."
Negative,"Reviewing negatively because the changes to Battlegrounds, and the fact you can't play anything but the new BGs, pisses me off.The change from 4vs4vs4 in a Big Area to a 4vs4 in a Tiny Area turned BGs into a first-person shooter. This is not to mention the awful 8vs8 mode which is also played in an area the same size a World of Warcraft 2v2 Arenas are played. Absolute insanity.There's no point in playing anything but a glass-cannon build, because whatever you build, you are going to die withing 1-2 seconds. The only way to prevent yourself from dying is to kill the enemy faster.There's barely any room to maneuver since the area is so small that there's always an enemy nearby.This review stays negative until battlegrounds are playable again."
Negative,"This game does have fun moments, I have played most of it solo. Completing the quest and leveling up my character was fun to do, but it seemed like it didn't matter overall. As soon as another player is nearby the enemies just respawn immediately and have a difficulty spike. I understand because it is an MMO but this takes away from the immersion of being in elders scroll. For example i walked into a cave for a quest and see someone farming it , as soon as i defeat a group of enemies and walk ahead 10 meters, they respawn right behind me. This game also creates a roadblock through inventory slot and low experience  gain and tries to force you into elders scroll plus. There is also a loot box system. I didn't care for it but there is no way to get back into your menu unless you proceed onto next loot box menu then back out. There is also a limit to how many active quest you can have"
Negative,"Game will not launch. After creating an ESO account, it requires you to link your Steam account. When you accept this (because you have no choice), the game freezes. Every time. After 7 attempts, I uninstalled to go play something else."
Negative,"Tried just about every class up to about level 10... once you hit level 10ish it just feels like another boring MMO grind. Absolutely NOTHING like any of the Elder Scrolls solo games, which is what I was hoping for. ""But that's not possible..."". FO76 did it, same company, so it's possible. Given took almost a year to make it playable but it's amazing now and exactly the same style of play that the solo games are but with online features and mass online play weaved in. If ESO was like FO76 is to the solo Fallout series, I don't think I'd ever play anything else. Huge miss. I really hope they revisit ESO kinda like FFXIV did and have like an ESO Reborn that is more like the solo play we've known and loved for decades and weave in mass online play like FO76... and maybe test a bit more before launch. *chuckles*"
Negative,"I think online players know in the back of their mind that there are creepy not good things that happen on the internet and in some games, well I know where it lives. If you have kids or teens they should NOT be let anywhere near this game. I am SHOCKED that Steam is okay with some of the chat or role playing that happens in Elder Scrolls Online. There also seems to be a HUGE bias that is happening in guild and player identification, if a players name or guild identification is not with a worldly narrative it is not only removed but all guild chats and notes are pilfered and removed as well. If you are looking for an Online game that allows for ALL peoples of ALL types to come together and enjoy group raids or questing and team building this is not that game. I am really just shocked Steam has let this go on for so long, very disappointing and really sad I have to leave this review."
Negative,"If you like battlegrounds PVP you will be rolling the dice here. There is a bug that keeps the match from starting and from what I can tell they've had this issue for a couple of years and have still not fixed it. They have absolutely no problem updating the crown store with 100 paywalls however. Good game, terrible updates and service.If you are like me, you might spend most of your gametime getting to endgame so that you can PvP where you'd like. Turns out in this game you get to grind for countless hours until max level, and then apparently you can go screw yourself."
Negative,10 connection to server timed out / 10
Negative,I tried to play the game but i couldn't link my steam and es account.when i made a new ES account it said that my account that i just made does not exist.Why do you make it so difficult to try and play the game?
Negative,"Not really Elder Scrolls. It's an MMO with TES theme. It's alright. I've had better. Should you try it? There are better MMO games. There are better TES games. I'm 50/50 about this. Can't really recommend it or not recommend it. I like the TES part of it but hate the MMO part of it. Idiots running, sprinting jumping around like goats on coffee, Very big (and sometimes empty) world, idiots ruining my sneaky dual wielding gameplay in dungeons. And general MMO bullshit. You, the only one who can kill this unkillable beast go into the dungeon to find the beast had been killed by a jerkbag Nord. Then you wait for the thing to respawn in order to kill it. Nope still someone managed to kill it or helped you kill it. OMG GO AWAY!!!!!!And the allianses don't make sense. How are the Argonians allying with Dunmer? Dunmer had Argonians as slaves for thousands of years. Why are the Nords allying with Dunmer? They are elves aren't they? Nords hate elves. And what about Orcs? Allying with Bretons? Really? Do you know how cruel have the Bretons have been to Orcs over the centuries? None of the alliances make sense. I hate MMO. I hate this game. I regret my decision buying this.Fuck this game.Edit: OK I regret typing the last two lines; I was just disappointed. I knew this wasn't TES VI but I was thinking this was less MMO and more TES. Maybe if I play more than 50 hours I'll change my review to recommended.Edit 2: I guess I have to give points where it's due. I do like the crafting system. Lots of scavanging for a full set of armor but I discovered I can destroy iron weapons and get some iron back so that helped a lot.Edit 3: More due points. Awesome crime system. I had to look for a fence and sell or launder the stolen items. I got discovered and started running away from Ordinators. They caught up to me and killed me. I lost an awesome stolen sword I was planning to keep. This game has it's moments"
Negative,999+ ping noice
Negative,No! No! No! Reset the mechanism and try again!
Negative,This was almost the best elder scrolls game I've played since morrowind. Nbut that's not a high bar. Wanna guess how they managed to have so many quests and dialogues in the game? Sadly the answer isn't chatgpt. The game needed a combat overhaul 6 years ago and the story can't carry it anymore. So don't recommend it unless you like a combat system like if you're playing league of legends in high elo being shoved into a heavy adventure rpg.
Negative,"Honestly cant recommend, The world is lovely and the lore is great but its over shadowed by the toxic end game players, anyone over cp1000 is bitter and toxic ruining the game. Also over-monetized completely, its really a cash cow. Save yourself some time and hop on FF14 even if its not to your taste you will enjoy it more than this game.Also the different versions of the DLCs not saying what your actually getting feels like a scam"
Negative,"The two good things: It has more meat to its questing than most other MMOs, and the developers are pretty liberal with allowing (MUCH NEEDED) UI addons.And that's about it. Any other MMO has better combat, gear, animations, endgame content, class/skill systems, crafting, housing, regions, sounds, music, PVP (PVP in this game was bad to start, I can only imagine the mess it's in the with new overpowered, unbalanced, paid-for class 'arcanist'. I'm sure other reviews can get more in-depth about each of those specific things, because I don't got all day. The biggest issue, level scaling. To kill a god at level 5, but still get facked by some regular enemy at level 50. You'll never truly feel powerful with level-scaling. And nothing short of trials/vet hardmode is in any way challenging. The developers WANT you to float through their quests and content. Like I was saying about addons, the base UI is crappy and not intuitive. Addons really help with, well, all that, easy fix.  I have no issue with ESO plus, but don't believe those that say you don't need it. You'll be tearing your hair out soon enough because every 10 minutes you'll need to spend another 10 minutes selling/deconstructing/tossing stuff from your inventory, going back and forth. Or when you find there's a ton of expansions to buy on top of the base game.As of writing this interview, I have over a hundred hours in-game from the bethesda launcher.It won't be worth your time or money. Bethesda probably isn't worth our time or money when I really think about it."
Negative,"The Devs have completely lost interest in their customers outside of the wallet. When Zenimax Online Services released an update that hurt their revenue, the patch was handled in no time at all; but for 2 months now, a game breaking bug has been stopping late game players from progressing, and ZoS couldn't give a shit. Buy the game on an extreme sale if you like Elder Scrolls, but never give them another dollar, absolutely nothing is worth it from these pieces of crap"
Negative,Be wary of buying crowns from steam with a linked eso account. Bought crowns and they never turned up. Logged two support calls and nothing. so the moneys wasted.  The level of support for this game is diabolically bad. Guess I wont be wasting my time or money on this anymore.
Negative,"I am a returning player, wanting to see what has come of this game that I loved once but just moved on. So I started a new character, but within 5mins I was hit with the backpack/crafting loot wall where ""fun"" was quickly removed with inventory management.I think this is a huge miss of this ""free weekend"" that really isn't free. I had the feeling if I started without the inventory problem and the ""free membership"" went away, I would of subbed...but hitting me straight in the face with it has just made me walk away.Bad call and not with modern times, you are either f2p+membership or you are purchasing a game. This has the worst models of both, an entry fee and subscription. Total 2010. Next thing they'll have in-game purchases too to nickle and dime...and loose out on the big money they could of had.Unless you want to throw $100 at it...and need to keep monthly fees going...don't go here.Jan 2024 - Wanted to go try the game again after a long time, left for 30mins for it to patch and found that it downloaded/applied 350g of data to a 126G game.   Immediately made me remember why I quit as the dev is clueless on running a modern mmo.   Uninstalled this time, updating this review so I don't forget."
Negative,"It's just one of those titles you can tell the studio has no love for their own game. It's unfortunately very common in MMOs, but there's no passion, love, or thoughtfulness in decisions being made and as such the game has suffered. I enjoyed it for what it was, but they make excuses for their mistakes (the light/heavy attack weaving is a feature & their base will legitimately defend glitching the game as a fun combat mechanic.) and just pull shady moves like Arcanist, Oakensoul, etc. I own all of these things as a byproduct of buying expansions, but it genuinely makes me not want to buy the new content any longer versus feeling rewarded for my purchases or support. We know customer service is a dying industry, but I feel like Zenimax is a corpse already in that department.They release an expansion make something overpowered you have to pay for, nerf it, and repeat. Instead of just creating decent looking cosmetics (the worst cosmetics in any MMO, yet somehow great graphics, figure that out?) they focus on trying to squeeze out money by taking it out on their playerbase with bad design decisions.It has so much going for it, but it's a mediocre title due to just the lack of love it gets. I log in play a game of cards to get xp and log out these days, just putting it in the back burner in hopes they do something positive with this."
Negative,As you can probably tell i got this game from the Bethesda summer sale (2023) after years of putting off giving this game a go i decided to jump in despite my hesitancy due to being disappointing with fallout 76 at launch back in the day. I am not even an hour in and i am locked out of my account because they need to send me an access code which could take up to a day that's a full 24 hours not to mention 125GB of space on my HDD. I have not even played an hour and i am locked out of my account i created a password the whole nine yards yet i have to wait for an access code to login to my already created account ? i bought the game i want to play when i want to play and now i have to wait an entire DAY for a code ? i don't have an entire day im an adult who has stuff to do. the support page said wait 10 minutes its been two hours. glad i only wasted 5$ this is why i do not play MMO's
Negative,It is trash :((
Negative,"Don't But this game through Steam, severs are not stable. Buying it directly from the website seems the best bet at this point if you actually want to play."
Negative,no oce servers :(
Negative,"This game is boring. I loved Skyrim, but not this one. This is is bad."
Negative,"This is a fun game to play,it is too bad they dont keep up maintanance on the server though. The ping rates reach some of the higheast I've encountered and sure bring a great game down to just a good one.  When I spend the kinda money for a game like this I expect the people serving the game to keep up on maintance."
Negative,"Eso is just a cash grab with awful bugs and zos refuses to even acknowledge them, we have zero communication from the devs/comunity maneger and they just keep giving us more stuffs to buy with cash instead of fixing the game, dont waste your money on this."
Negative,"The elder bugs online. Instead of fixing bugs and creating a normal balance in pvp, they release the same chapters every year"
Negative,This felt more like a generic MMO experience than an Elder Scrolls experience.
Negative,"No asia server. Very laggy. I dodge 10 meters away from an enemy melee attack and it still hits me. Also feels very clunk. Also if anyone expects this game to be like Skyrim, its very fucking far from Skyrim."
Negative,I can't even login to play this game. What a joke.
Negative,"IF YOU LIKE TO RP AND DECORATE, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU, IF YOU WANT A GAME WITH SUBSTANCE, THIS IS NOT IT. Do you like doing the same quests over and over, yeah this is for you. Do you like a game that prioritizes the fact that it is cross platform so console usability takes precedence, this is for you."
Negative,"having this game is hell, i don't know why is that when steam detects an update, it deletes all the  game files and redownload the whole effing thing. man that was a solid 59 GB of data. this time it happened again, for a ""Free Week"" event or something. eff this shiit."
Negative,"I have been on the menu screen for 12 hours and I still can't get in If im lucky I get to play the intro, but when it loads into the next area the game will have a problem connecting to the server and put me back to the title screen. Please fix your servers!"
Negative,"I bought The Elder Scrolls Online ages ago, but never got around to playing it. So, I recently decided to pick it up and try it out. After browsing through my available class and race options, I settled on an Argonian Templar, so I could be a healer.That was a mistake. Dumping my skill points into healing abilities completely locked me out of solo PvE content. For the first ten levels (when the Dungeon Finder is unavailable), every single last fight consisted of me either mashing LMB twenty to fourty times, or holding it for an extended duration until whatever I was fighting eventually died, with no other options available unless I wanted to gimp my healing abilities.Okay, so I slogged through the two boring, monotonous introduction areas at a snail's pace, avoiding combat as much as possible, mostly just running through enemies to get to objectives. I finally reach level ten, and unlock the dungeon finder. Surely this is where things get better, right?No. You see, unlike healing in World of Warcraft or Guild Wars, most (practically all of the ones I interacted with) healing spells in TESO can not be manually targeted. They have an area of effect, often centered around you, in which they either heal everyone, or automatically pick whoever needs heals the most and heals them. This leads to a very braindead style of play, where you just end up pressing the same button over and over again, letting the game automatically decide who needs to be healed and who doesn't.To make matters worse, in the four (five?) dungeon finder instances that I played, barely anyone in my group ever required healing. Since every class and every playstyle has tonnes of self-sustain and regeneration options, a healer is practically not even needed in these low level dungeons. Yet, you can't start a dungeon without a healer, so one out of four players will always end up being bored out of their minds unless they play a DPS character and queue as a healer.There's a bunch of other stuff I could rant about, but suffice to say there is no fun whatsoever to be found playing as a healer. Maybe this changes in endgame content, but I'm not going to bother to stick around for a hundred hours mindlessly grinding through levels to maybe have a smidgen of fun at the end of the road. If healing is your main interest in party-based games, then stay far away from The Elder Scrolls Online."
Negative,"At a low price (like the sale) it may be worth it for the quick foray to complete the story, but as a whole unless you love MMO's in general and the grind that comes with it, i wouldn't recommend.One of the reasons i enjoy Oblivion and Skyrim is because the worlds are beautiful to experience, (or atleast on release in Oblivions case), however due to the type of game it is, you lose beauty in favor of performance and so visually your almost going back to Oblivion's now empty looking landscape.--Now the grind, now unless you just skip everything and run through too the finish line to then grind it later, you'll otherwise end up with a full storage within the first 2-3 dungeons, which is a nightmare if you like to plan and prep for future forays, upgrades and levels.You'll be left wondering how rare is some of this stuff, non of which you would really want to find out it's rare as hell and you got a lucky find, nor would you want to spend hours grinding it later, so you collect as you actually ""play""... but that brings you back round to a tiny backpack & bank space... with each 10 point upgrade the cost doubles.. to the point you find yourself contemplating the subscription so you can get the extra crafting bag to store all your ingredients in.Like many games these days, that item hogging part of your inventory that you just want rid of, you wish you had kept by the time your half way through the game, which again is another kick in the arse when it comes to storage.--The crates & crowns, unless you plan on spending more in the game than you actually spend on the game itself, i would just put them to the back of your mind.. some of that stuff looks mighty nice, but for what? the cost of another game or double?The question is, is all that really worth it? i mean yeah people work to make this kind of stuff, but the majority being cosmetics they probably add up far more than if the cosmetic was a DLC available for purchase on steam, but when translated to crowns it doesn't look like a whole lot. Ontop of that some of these things ar elimited to the season they are introduced in, so once that season is up it will no longer be available, again forcing the hand of those who may try to work up to getting it, to instead make a quick purchase of crowns in order to get it before it disappears.But even then, it isn't that simple, as most of these items are purchased with ""crown gems"" which from what i gathered are gained when you purchase ""crates"" with your ""crowns"". So it ends up being a gamble for how many of these ""crown gems"" you can actually get and could mean the purchase of what? 8 crates or more? and these things are like 400 crowns each... and just look at the price of the Crowns on the steam page..Intruth people will spend far more than it's worth to get this gear, now it's their choice, but at the end of the day they will refuse to accept that it makes it much worse for everyone else, as their willingness to purchase virtual items only gives Developers and the Publishers more inclination to introduce such systems within the games they make, many, many of which are far from worth the purchase price. This especially for a virtual item that will become redudent when you no longer wish to play the game, or when the servers are eventually shutdown as the cost will outweigh the income earned one day.--Probably no worse than any other MMO to be honest, and in some cases probably way better, being an Elder Scrolls game i had to try it. I wouldn't consider it much of a team game though, as most of it you end up playing solo as everyone seems to go about doing their own thing and the only co-operation you really get is if you're all going the sameway or if you goto a Dungeon with 3 others, inwhich they all rush through and then complain you're not helping while you were trying to clear inventory space for a few other items you wanted to collect.If you're an Elder Scrolls fan, and arn't really into MMO's in general, i suggest to stay away and wait for a real Elder Scrolls game.Edit:A quick quote from the forums;""Without crazy luck you need about 30-40 crates per APEX mount. Sometimes more, like on Wild Hunt season, when i got only 1 APEX mount from crates and got enough gems to purchase 3 more mounts. You get 120-150 gems per 15 crates pack.""Then from the website;""You can purchase a single Crown Crate for 400 crowns. We'll also offer Crown Crate bundles, where you can get four Crates for 1500 crowns, or 15 Crates for 5000 crowns. ""At the time of writing i can purchase a 5500 Crown pack for £29.99.So ask yourself this, is a cosmetic ingame mount really worth the price of a full game?"
Negative,"TLDR: if you are looking for a story driven game set in the elder scrolls world, this may be the game for you. if you are looking to progress into end game MMORPG raids, this may not be...This game is my most played, I loved the game play, the progression of combat, and friendship that was facilitated through guilds. however the most recent patch (update 35) has left me disenchanted with the dev team, pushing me to focus on other games were my progress as a player is not completely ruined at a moments notice. I was an endgame PvE player, a fairly average one at that. I was working towards all my hard mode clears of the 12 player trials, some of the most challenging multiplayer content in the game. however update 35 reduced DPS, and healing by a significant amount, making it so most of the groups i was in disbanded, leaving me unable to work towards my goals. I really hope they fix there mistakes, and I can start playing with my guild one day, until they address how badly they f-ed up, and fix it, I will be playing other games :("
Negative,"Hard to recommend this even though the main game on sale is worth the money.-Countless pay-walled features seamlessly integrated into the world-Longest response time of any authentication or customer service communications in any game I've seen-Is a mockery of the elder scrolls games even considering the downward complexity expected of each titleWhat is most damning in my eyes though is the micro transactions they have set up.  Yet its not just that they let you pay to win in some ways, or that their digital funbux are expensive as hell at like $10 for a pet, but whole formal content packages which should be part of the base game, or a DLC at a minimum, are locked behind their micro transaction pay wall.If you can enjoy the game with limited features and get it on sale then it really is well worth the money and not bad among lower end MMOs.  Good way to spend some time, but they clearly JUST want your money."
Negative,"If you intend to play on European servers do not purchase the game through steam, server connectivity issues lasting for hours are consistent and support non-existing."
Negative,"Game is great, but consistently can't play it for long streteches due to steam login issues. Buy it elsewere if interested."
Negative,Game servers are down more often than they are up. Avoid purchasing on steam until the problem is resolved. Unacceptable for AAA game.
Negative,The artwork is better than the game.
Negative,REMOVE THE DAMN 3rd party system-crap steam!Let the players enjoy the game like every other one who bought the game outsite this platform.I can't acept it that everybody besides me (The steam user) can log in.
Negative,"They should change the name of this game to Elder Scrolls Offline - Bought it through Steam three days ago and am still unable to play due to constant emergency maintenance. No communication from Steam or the developer on the issue or when it will be resolved. Not recommended, take your money elsewhere!"
Negative,"Despite the (relative) high number of hours I've spent with this game, I cannot recommend it.  To me it confirms all my worst impressions of MMOs in general.   A lot of fetch quests, a mediocre story, and just a general formulaic feel to it in general.  That being said, I found the graphics to be good and the combat to be fun (formulaic but fun for a little while).  I played a lot solo but also had a few friends that played which made it much more fun."
Negative,"ESO Gold top seller in Steam? oh boy some people didn't do their research.-Graphics are very good, lightning is amazing. Sounds assets are ok.-Leveling up is meh in ESO, quests are your default run of the mill, fetch/kill quests. At least there are spots where you can grind mobs for xp.-Collecting stuff like, motifs and achievements is fun, if not a bit grindy at times.-Level design, costumes, effects are ok, most of the time.-Dungeons and exploration are mediocre, nothing really interesting or different from what you've propably already seen from an Elder Scrolls game, or any MMO fantasy for that matter.-Gear system SUCKS so bad. You will have to wear very specific pieces of armor/weapons if you want to get the max out of your gear and aquiring those pieces is VERY grindy, which lowers your enthusiasm for experimentation.  Also no 'transmogrify' here, your character will never look the way you want him to look, despite the myriad of awesome styles of armor the art department has created.-Also, like the above, Racial unique stats suck, each race is focused on being better on a certain stat. So if you want to focus on stamina for example, a Redguard is far superior when compared to other races and you would be just gimping yourself by picking something else.-Very, VERY grindy mount upgrade system. It literaly will take you 6 months to fully level up the stats of your horse. And it's not even account based, you have to do that for each character you create. -Unless you spend some extra real money of course--Which brings us to the next awful system. DLC. The game is sliced into DLC pieces that cut some serious content from the base game. Some examples: Cyrodill PvP area is DLC, Orsinium province is DLC, Thieves GUild? DLC. Dark Brotherhood? DLC. Imperial race??! DLC!Why would they make those core content elements into DLC when they already have extra COSMETIC DLC? if you want to ""support the devs"" (despite you already bought their game, it's not exactly free2play), cosmetic DLC like mounts, pets, costumes etc would be sufficient one would think? Well the devs think like this obviously ---> $$$This is what made me quit the game in disgust. PVP is simply unplayable. Firstly, you can only PvP in this huge area in the middle of the map, which you enter through... a menu system, because screw immersion.Secondly, the map is so damn huge, this makes finding fights almost a quest on itself. Especially when you ride on a low level mount, which you will most certainly do when you first start playing.But hey you can always spam ""LFG"" in chat and hopefully get an invite to a larger group, which in this game is known as a Zerg. And more of a fitting name, could not be given to describe what you do in a Zerg. Mindlessly running from point A to point B killing anything you come across. Skill? tactics? strategy? nah this is THE ZERG. This is how EVERYONE plays in ESO PvP and the reason is following:This game is so damn laggy, the framerate drops SO low and on top of that, there is this weird input lag that no one can explain or fix. In big fights, all these problems get multiplied and you get the feeling that you're playing in a half-baked beta version of the game.So the only logical solution? Run in Zergs and get kills & assists by the numbers. MEH.To top that awful PvP system, the devs have created different kinds of PVP campaings. There is one for levels 1-50, one for maxed characters with no champion points, another for maxed characters WITH champion points (here you will discover how much unbalanced the game is), another that lasts 7 days and all of them have 1-3 extra duplicates of themselves!! Way to keep the community separated guys!!Finally, there are no PvE raids. So if you bought this game thinking you will do some PvP action, then you are screwed.If it wasn't for the insane lag+framerate drop+input lag in PvP, the game would worth a try, otherwise stay away, this is not playable."
Negative,"The absolute worst customer experience I have ever had. I put in the wrong ESO account to my steam and wrote to the support team to correct the error. After waiting 2 days they get back to me and tell me there's nothing they can do for me. Now, I'm unable to play on my original account on which I have 100 hours on. Don't waste your time or money on this company."
Negative,game sucks tbh
Negative,if you want to do basically the same thing everyday and no life a game eso is perfect for you
Negative,"Dont buy the game, just a money grabber now!"
Negative,"Cookie cutter MMO, massive grinder, every six months they change the best in slot; only pursue if you're unemployed. Pretty damn big disappointment coming from Bethesda."
Negative,"Not great, not terrible. Just a mediocre mmo"
Negative,"DONT BUY THE GAME FROM STEAM, BUY IT FROM ESO STORE!!!!!Its an amazing game but you will face a lot of Login Issues, if you buy it from Steam. You wont be able to play the game whenever you want to due to these Login Issues! So save yourself the trouble and buy it from the ESO STORE."
Negative,"Good game but bad servers.Wonderful quests, lots of dungeons and trials, amazing PvP modes and fascinating lands are waiting for you in the ESO. It's a pleasure for me to play this game most of the time... But when you playing a lot already you acrually can see the opposit side of a coin.You can find plenty of desyncs, lags, latency problems during big well-played PvP fights or defeating bosses in Trials with end-game groups. Servers cannot handle tons of clicks in a second. And this is a huge problem for me. What about you? I know that devs trying to solve it right now, but... I'm done, I had to say about it here.I do love this game and hope someday this problem will be fixed."
Negative,"Really wanted to like this having been a huge fan of Skyrim. But I think that's the problem, having been a huge fan of skyrim this didn't meet my expectations at all. All it feels like you do in the game is go back and forth between quests which are almost exactly the same; with little variance and imagination. It gets boring quite quickly."
Negative,Glad I only paid 10 bucks on steam sale for this heap. The game is mediocre and feels old as hell- and not in a good way. AI and aggro is bad and comes across as poor design. Spellcasting and combat in general is trivial. There are countless MMO's that have better PVE. This isn't a PVP game.
Negative,"I can't review the actual game because I was unable to succesfully install it. Steam itself at the time of Downloading on 5/24/18 wanted about 67Gbs. After steam gets through downloading, ESO has it's own >Installer/launcher< outside of steam, which will be important in a moment. This launcher may want an additional 13-15gbs, all the while you are technically ""Running"" the game while it installs.  However the game failed and crashed the install and now terminally wants to go in a never ending loop of repairing and wanting to install a 13gb patch.  After about 3 attempts that ran me up to 5-6 hours of ""Run time"".  Steam will normally not refund you if you go past 2 hours of run time. So you are PUNISHED for trying to fix this broken POS game.  I was never able to get it to launch, it crashes, and demands that I reinstall the 13gb download again and again.  I've requested a refund and explained my situation.I eventually did give up and I bought the game through the online ESO store.  Don’t buy it, it’s a rip off. 1.)You Pay for the base game.2.)You pay for the expansions.3.)Additional content like dungeons and raids are locked behind a monthly pay wall.4.)ESO thinks they’re a “Free to play” game and they actually charge you for loot boxes and BANK SPACE which is without the monthly subscription crap, complete crap.  You won’t be able to store anything. The game is super similar to Neverwinter but Neverwinter is actually a free to play game. You never have to spend a dime, and it has a better store system than ESO.  This game is a fucking rip off skinned as Elderscrolls."
Negative,Don't buy this game. Plenty of better MMO's out there. If you need to cancel the subscription they're located under your account page.
Negative,"yes i played over 1k hours, no i do not recommend it lmao"
Negative,Poor indie studios Bethesda and Zenimax can't afford to do server maintenance in a quick manner or without shutting off whole regions of the world from their game (that punished people for not playing it everyday).
Negative,"I am a huge fan of the game and have been playing for years (just look at my time played), but I genuinely cannot recommend anyone play it. When the game clicks for you, it's a wonderful experience. It is very fun and feels rewarding to complete the harder content and achievements in the game. When it doesn't click, it's frustrating and it can be very hard to get help for your issues.As an example, I have had issues with logging into ESO in the past. I tried troubleshooting on my own and couldn't get the game to work, so I submitted a trouble ticket and went through the steps with the rep who was assigned my ticket. Unfortunately, this consisted of them asking me to run the diagnostic tool and informing me that my laptop cannot run ESO. I let them know that that made no sense and that I had been playing ESO from said laptop less than a week beforehand and the laptop exceeded the minimum PC specs listed on Steam *and* that the ESORequirementsChecker tool in the game files returned all green. I was met with silence from the other end and it was legitimately one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had with a game and I was locked out until I could get back to my regular computer.Recently the game celebrated it's 10th anniversary. The in-game event should have been a huge celebration, but the part of the event unique to this year was extremely grindy and caused a lot of burnout, resentment, and jealousy; players got locked out of the game; and a maintenance window was announced right before the end of the event that cut off the last day of the event. Based on the official forum thread/poll asking people's thoughts about the event, only about 11% were completely positive. 47% combined responded with ""It was not OK. I found only a small part acceptable."" and ""The worst event ever. I hate everything in it."" It is a shame to have marked the 10th anniversary like this.Unfortunately, when issues arise and feedback is given in the forum, the devs/community managers often leave the player base in the dark. And I don't want to make this review about the blame game, the devs/CM do a good job for the most part and have improved a lot over the years. But the (lack of) communication, accountability, and recognition that the decisions that were made about the game and how they impact both the player base and the game runners lead to stressful outcomes for everyone involved."
Negative,"Somewhat fun but regret the buy. Really strange systems and weird interactions.I didn't like it, but it is not bad."
Negative,"It's fun and I love Elder Scrolls, but it has constant connection problems. I drop all the time. Sometimes everyone in the dungeon will drop. Don't do this with any other online games. Save yourself the headache."
Negative,"Pointless, zero story, why am I here? After the novelty of running around Morrowind, there was just no real reason to continue. This is a PG, but not an RPG."
Negative,"I bought this game awhile back (in 2020 i think) and didn't play much due not being a huge MMORPG player. But i decided to return because of my newfound interest in the genre. I installed it and for some reason, the installer after downloading the files from Steam doesn't work. It keeps telling me to get a new copy of the installer and tried so many methods to fix this. Cleared my temp folder, reinstalled the game and even updated my graphics driver. Alas, none of it worked. I'm not the only one going through this problem but zero solution has been found for this and even the devs don't seem to be looking into this issue. It's unfair for me to not recommend this game based on this issue alone but i have no choice but to do so cause the next person that buys it might go through the same issue after spending money on this. Can't refund this as well cause i'm way past the two hours mark. Welp :(EDIT: I finally got the installer to work after digging deep into the possible fixes for this issue. A few players recommended creating a new user profile on WIndows and giving administrator rights. Once that's done, you run the installer through that user profile. I did this and it worked. After running the installer through the profile, you can go back to your main one and play the game. Glad i got it to work but it's honestly the weirdest issue i've encountered for a game. Not gonna retract my ""not recommended"" rating until i play the game to the fullest or up to a point where I've made some significant progress in order to see whether or not the problem were worth it to get through."
Negative,Just do not recommend
Negative,E A SPORTS ITS IN THE GAME
Negative,"A game made by s'wits, for fetchers."
Negative,i want to claw out my eyeballs
Negative,broken gamezos is just milking this game
Negative,i bought this game and refunded it...because i tought they have an Asian server..
Negative,"This game really goes out of it\s wy to nickle and dime already paying customers.The game heaps inconveniences on you, and then lets you pay to get rid of those inconveniences, buying extra bag space, extra bank space, extra mount speed, faster tradeskill levelling etc.Like, I already bought the game, stop making the game inconvenient on purpose to milk me for more dough please."
Negative,"Really love the game, just a shame that there are no SEA servers. I would love to play with low ping. Playing with 300ms+ is a bit challenging. Would recommend it if there are SEA servers but as of now, I would refrain from doing so."
Negative,"Thought i was gonna get to play as a necromancer but like most games these days Elder Scrolls Online is just nothing but a cash grab. You have to spend additional money to get the necromancer class (and a huge list of other things that make this game desirable.) I bought the game on sale for $8 and have to pay twice that ($16) to be able to play as a necromancer!!??! Seems a little backwards, but then again not at all surprising. Like everything else in society the video game industry is becoming tailored to the ""haves"" at the expense of the ""have not's"", which is unbelievably disappointing to me. I've been an avid gamer for over 25 years and have easily spent 10's of thousands of dollars on the hobby, but it's to the point where i'm sick of spending money on half games. In a time when games are better, more abundant, and easily accessible, in my opinion, it's the worst time to be a gamer and less and less of them are worth time/money. If you don't want to spend a $1,000 on a video game, this probably isn't for you. Always been a Bethesda fan until now"
Negative,"I see potential in this game but I'm an oldschool gamer. Don't come to me with any stupid ""crown"" store. It really ruins the mood. Am I expected to ignore it if I don't like it, or am I allowed to just outright not like it?"
Negative,"update; Flipped to a thumbs down. Game has only gotten worse for the past several years. If you like the ""game"" part of this game then ZOS is just completely unconcerned with your experience. Instead they seem to be trying to target the kind of mopes who bought into the Metaverse and things like it. -----TL:DR 4/10, could be dominating every other MMO but held back by spending too much dev time on hunting for whales.  I originally got into this game for the TES lore as I am a lifelong TES fan. There is a lot of it here, most isn't that great. The plots themselves are also very boring and dialogue quite bad. There is no challenge posed by any mob that isn't inside of a veteran difficulty dungeon so narratives always ring hollow when the god tier enemy you're fighting goes down in a handful of light attacks. Dungeons and trials tend to have better stories but you'll have to have a group of other people who also want to sit and listen to quest NPCs with you. You also can't go back and redo quests on the same character so you're likely to blow through a quest on normal mode for the rewards and then never get to hear the plot again. 2/10 for story content.PvE combat is about as fun as you get from MMORPGs, that is, as long as you're in veteran level content. The core mechanic it revolves around is animation canceling so there is a pretty high skill cap depending on your build. This is the best part of the game but the devs sometimes release patches that mess with core stuff you'd think best to be left untouched. Overland content is also absurdly easy, to point of it barely classifying as a ""game"". Mobs are often physically unable to kill me while I afk on my easy to kill dps character. This means that, unless a pre-existing player power levels you, the first tens of hours will be mind numbingly boring. This will likely kill this game for you before it even begins. Why devs do this in MMOs is beyond me. 7/10 for pve combat but really depends on if you make it to end game and if the devs want to do un-requested changes that patch or not.Open world PvP is nice but rather obnoxious to find fights in, especially during off hours. The instanced pvp is fun but easily ruined by kingmakers due to the 1v1v1 format. The Imperial City pvp is awesome but mostly dead outside of special events. The mechanics of pvp can be really fun though. It's interesting to go from the sustained damage PvE game to the burst heavy PvP side of things. That being said, the balance is all out of wack. You'll still be able to have fun if you know what you're doing but expect a lot of cheese to present when playing PvP. The devs sadly pretend that PvP doesn't exist so you won't be getting new stuff. 6/10 for pvp simply due to a fun base hampered by many years of neglect.Monetization is horrid. The game is advertised as a 1 time purchase, this is disingenuous. There is a lot of unpleasant design at play to get you to pay up. You will want the membership for easy access to the vast majority of the game as well as the bottomless bag for crafting ingredients. Without said bag, your inventory will constantly be bombarded with items that eat up space. You'll also be spending hundreds of dollars to 1 time purchase each dungeon/DLC pack individually so the sub becomes a no brainer. Your mount also takes 180 days IRL to fully train per-character thus encouraging you to spend money to circumvent this. The latest expansion is also not included in the sub so you'll be upgrading for 40 dollars every year. There are very few items you can actually earn in the game, of those items there are even fewer that are worth obtaining. Earnables are often bad looking, hardly noticeable, or too easy to get to really represent any kind of accomplishment. There are a handful of standout items that break this mold but will often be very far from the grasp of your average player. If somebody has something cool looking then they likely rolled for it in a loot box or farmed enough gold to simply buy it from a trader. As for loot boxes, they are here and the game does have the ""earnable in-game currency"" option for you to circumvent the RNG as per EU law. However, it will take you a little under a year of job-like play to earn a good reward. This is coming from somebody who actually has access to said rewards. 1/10 for monetization, I'd rather just pay the upfront sub of other MMOs.Now for the elephant in the room, why do I have over 4k hours in this game? Because of good combat and good people. Doing dungeons/raids with a progression team and getting clears is super satisfying and not something I'm going to do in many other places due to my dislike of typical MMO combat systems. The world is also still interesting to me. Despite ESO's often boring interpretation of the TES world, it is still TES and the game provides a nice backdrop for my dungeon/raiding. Would I have gotten into this game without originally being a lore nerd? Absolutely not. My pre-established interest in this world carried me through the terrible parts of this game so I could get to the good parts."
Negative,"BUY THE GAME ELSEWHERE, NOT THROUGH STEAM!CONSTANT ISSUES CONNECTING ON STEAM!"
Negative,"Bought this game 2 days ago.  Gameplay is interesting but good luck trying to connect.  Had a long weekend from work and havent been able to connect in over 8 hours.  Game will not connect, I will be asking for a refund."
Negative,"Great game. However, there are a few bugs, well known to veteran players, that have been around for YEARS that are destroying the gaming experience for anyone playing during peak hours (for EU servers it's around 16:00-00:00 BST during weekdays, longer hours during the weekend) -1. The group finder bug that causes can you to waste hours trying to get into a dungeon or battleground.2. Battlegrounds bug that (even after you eventually manage to get into one during peak hours) causes you to repeatedly get stuck in a battleground that doesn't ever start if you leave the battleground you get a ""deserter debuff"" for 20 minutes during which you essentially can't participate in PvP.There are numerous other bugs, but the ones mentioned above are the most annoying IMO and ""Bugthesda"" have been ignoring this for many years, to my opinion because these bugs actually *reduce* server load during peak hours, making it not worth it for them to fix them.The only way to make them fix it is if it would start hurting their pockets, hence this review."
Negative,"If you decide to buy this game, buy it through the game's official website, do not buy it on steam. Steam clients have login problem that prevents you from login in for several hours on weekends."
Negative,CONNECTION TO SERVER TIMED OUT
Negative,"ban ban ban.after you buy this game ,play for about 2000 hours ,and you will get ban.good game"
Negative,PVE is playable.PVP is not.
Negative,"LAST STRAW TODAY, logging in problems cos of steam AGAIN.Cant even find where to cancel my plus account on the steam website.I  wish I had seen all the reviews advising buying direct from ESO when I started in January."
Negative,"I really wanted to like this game, however the only thing worse then the combat is the community. Anytime you bring up an issue with the game your are attacked. Honestly this game is just not fun, unless you want to play the same game with a friend but not actually with them because every member of your party has to do the same action to progress thru the story. at that point why even party up? you can still do everything you did before with out it."
Negative,Subscription systems are for cucks.
Negative,11 hours of me trying to launch the game and months of me contacting unresponsive support.So I didn't get to play the game even after all of this so I don't recommend purchasing it.
Negative,"not fun, almost no exploration."
Negative,Ive waited hours to repair download it and still didnt work this game is crap dont waste your money
Negative,"A lot of things in this game makes no sense to me, like:-all this high number right from the start of the game, the abilities deal like 5000 dmg, the cost for those abilities are like 2500,  your health/mana/stamina are around 20000 (or 200000). Whats with all these high values when my character is a level 1-I got the impression that every creature is ""adjusted"" to my level (which makes no sense), but then I googled it and I found that actually you are scaled up to the enemies? (which makes even less sense). So, from what I got, to allow everyone to play togheter, no matter the level, they made every enemy the same level (cp 160?) and if you are bellow that said level (cp 160) you get buffed by the game up to that level so you can play, as you level up you get buffed less by the system so you stay pretty much the same in terms of power until you get over cp160 (I pressume you can get over it, didnt check). For me, this takes away the feeling of progression-Light attacks with your weapon dont drain any resources (mag/stamina) and Heavy attacks give you resources back? I dont really understand how swinging a two handed sword as hard as I can gives me stamina back? maybe I am not getting the point of this-There is an ""aim-assist"" for projectile based weapons. Wanna aim your bow to the left of the enemy only to see the arrow make a turn in the air into the enemy? This game is for youAtm I have 14 hours into the game, I dont think I will play anymore. I had really high hopes for this game since I liked the ElderScrolls series very much, but no. This game does not feel like morrowind, or oblivion or skyrim, so if you are looking for that, move along. If you are looking for a classic mmo rpg where you have to grind like a mad man, again, move along.I dont recommend this game."
Negative,"Maybe my problem is that I'm a fan of WoW (classic, of course), but I didn't find this game fun. Many of the quests seem grindy, which WoW isn't unguilty of, but ESO takes it at a much greater degree. I didn't really enjoy hitting a couple of buttons to attack enemies over and over again, but again, that might have been my fault. I dunno. It's been a while since I played, and it was for a free weekend.What I'm more upset about in this game (and fallout 76) is what it represents for Bethesda. Both of these games have shown me that Bethesda's goal isn't to make good games, it's to make money. Which is fine, so long as you make alright games. Take EA's creation of Jedi Fallen order as opposed to Battlefront II. Sure, FO still had microtransactions, but it was for purely cosmetic items. If I remember correctly, the game didn't even have DLC. Battlefront II on the other hand was purely pay to win, with characters being purposefully wildly unbalanced against eachother and locked behind paywalls as an incentive for you to spend more money on the game.Godd Howard (No, I did not misspell) is trying to turn Bethesda into EA.Scroll up and you'll see what I mean. You have buttons to add to your cart:ESO base game, DLC including The Newcomer Pack, The Morrowind Chapter and the new Greymoor expansion, A Plus Membership and Crown Packs. CROWN. PACKS. What I can only assume is this game's second currency, the kind you use to buy stuff you can't normally get ingame, going all the way up to 21000 for $145.99.The reason I don't recommend buying this game is less about the quality of the game. After all, it's got a Very Positive rating. No, it's because every single dollar payed to Bethesda because of this game encourages Todd to make less games like Skyrim, Oblivion, Fallout 3, New Vegas and 4, and more games like Fallout 76 and this one, which are made to squeeze every single dollar out of their players as they can. Please, for the love of Godd, don't buy this game. Not because it's bad, but because you want to see good games. Let's try to get it through Godd's thick skull that Bethesda makes amazing single player RPGs (Maybe even with Co-op. I'd like to see a Co-op Elder Scrolls game, personally. With NPCs this time, please?) Go spend your money on something that really deserves it. I hear Doom Eternal's pretty good, except for the final boss battle, and Divinity II Original Sin is apparently an amazing RPG, and it supports Co-op."
Negative,how can a game soo full of lore feel soooo cheap.everything from the combat to animation just scream cheap.say what you want to say about Asian games they bring the awo and spectacle.I had a ghost quest (high elf starting area) where the npc was fight a ghost for control and the ghost was pulled out of him and just walked to its freaken cage not dragged not sucked it just started walking…As someone who can lose emersion really easily it just sucked everything from me and not to say the dramatic sealing of the ghost that was just a joke of a red circle.Its just feel cheap.And if you can play past it then im happy for you but for me it killed any fun I had.
Negative,"This game sucks please save yourself dont buy it. go here spam though dialog then go there and spam more dialog then go back to the first place and spam through more dialog and back to the second place. 99% of the game hell yeah so much fun. Edit I asked for a refund and was denied by steam. its a scam dont buy this!  you have to have the luncher open to download updates instead of normal updates though steam i belive so you cant get a refund and it works perfectly.  this is what i said when trying to get a refund ""So i know i have 6 hours of play time is what steam say but thats not fair. the game makes you download the like 80 gb updates though the launcher so it says your playing it. Thats Not cool i bet they did that just so people couldnt refund it! it took me like almost 4 and a half hours to update though the luncher. and the game isnt even fun."" and steam still deined it"
Negative,"Updates, Oh no a file is  corrupted pls repair, Ok repair, 8 hours for repair to be done, Last second installer crashes and repair starts from scratch, Entire day goes by repair is done OH NO FILE IS CORRUPTED PLEASE REPAIR"
Negative,Not worth the $6 I paid on sale. Main story is not linear.  You'll see characters that are supposed to be locked away / available in one area completely fine in another. Combat is trash. Lots of paywalls. Low quest gold payout (made so that you can buy more gold). Don't even bother with this.
Negative,Trash. First of all. This is the worst interface i've ever seen. and you have to pay for everything. im good. ill go play something else. trash. trash.
Negative,will don't get it twisted the lore is something else but the developers can care less about you after you buy it  for example i have a glitch that doesn't allow me into the game anymore because there own launcher cant unzip there own patches there own updates do you know what that mean   that they care only about the majority of people sometimes because even those people have this glitch but in different ways mine is 206 glitch and I'm glad  that i didn't subscribe in eso plus that would've  been charging me for something i cant access because they decided that they will not bother themselves with it   happened only for the update  to fix a minor  issue and they say we're working on it are you kidding your the reason of these issues to begin  so if you  have a lot of patience buy it  and wait with us  for the magical fix of the glitches  that they make on purpose
Negative,"After purchasing the Summerset expansion, my account was flagged incorrectly, and is registered as owning Summerset and Morrowind, but not the base game.  Because of this I am unable to log in to the game whatsoever, and after a week of waiting for an online support ticket, I am going to seek a refund. Their support section needs to hire, or have an overhaul.  I would think that customer retention would be at the top of the list, and an issue that is keeping someone from playing their product would be flagged as urgent.  Still haven't received a response whatsoever.My greatest concern is that a refund transaction is now ALSO going to take weeks to conclude."
Negative,Only for hardcore fans of ESO. It's nowhere near a Skyrim experience. It's dull.
Negative,not really the best game i was expecting a more skyrim play but its more dnd its starts out slow i hate the talking really i dont think this is the best game ever i would understand if u would like it
Negative,"Why this game so boring the combat is meh...., I think i made a mistake to buy this game"
Negative,Seems like a really good game! Just wish I was able to play the game without the constant lagging and logging in difficulty!
Negative,"Don't play this if you're Australian/NZ or Asia pacific. The ping is horrible at the best of times. They aren't ever going to fix it either. Played enough to know it's never going to be good. Sadly, I've had enough. Time to download something else"
Negative,"I played some when it first came out and I attempted to play again today. I still feel like this game is unfinished. I just got out of the tutorial for the second time and the first quest where I have to go to a temple, the marker marked a empty space. When I looked up what to do a NPC was supposed to be nearby. But for me that NPC wasn't. I want to like this game so bad but it's really a huge disappointment where I can't get through the first quests."
Negative,"Rating: 6/10  The Elder Scrolls® Online (ESO)  offers an expansive world and the chance to explore the beloved universe of Tamriel in an online setting, but it falls short in several areas that prevent it from fully living up to the legacy of its single-player counterparts.One of  ESO’s  strong points is its world design. The game does a commendable job of bringing Tamriel to life, with detailed environments that capture the essence of the various regions players have come to know from the Elder Scrolls series. The game’s visuals and sound design work together to create an immersive atmosphere that draws you into the world.The flexibility in character creation and class customization is another plus. Being able to mix and match skills from different trees allows for a high degree of personalization, giving players the freedom to build their characters in unique ways. This aspect will appeal to those who enjoy experimenting with different playstyles.However,  ESO’s  combat system is where the game starts to show its age. The combat feels clunky and unresponsive at times, lacking the dynamic and fluid action that many players expect from modern MMOs. The repetitive nature of the combat can make long play sessions feel like a grind, rather than an adventure.The quest design, while faithful to the Elder Scrolls formula, often falls into a pattern of fetch quests and simple tasks that can become monotonous. The main storylines are engaging, but many side quests lack depth, which can make the overall experience feel less compelling, especially for players who are used to the richer narratives of the single-player games.Another downside is the game’s reliance on microtransactions. While the base game offers a significant amount of content, many of the more interesting or convenient features, such as certain expansions and cosmetic items, are locked behind paywalls. This can be frustrating for players who prefer a more straightforward purchase model.The pacing of the game is also an issue. Progression can feel slow, and the leveling system sometimes drags, which might deter players who are used to a faster progression curve in other MMOs. Additionally, the PvP content, while offering some fun moments, often feels unbalanced and can be frustrating for new players.Overall,  The Elder Scrolls® Online  has its moments of brilliance, especially in its world-building and character customization. However, it’s held back by dated mechanics, repetitive quest design, and a monetization model that can feel restrictive. While it’s worth a try for die-hard Elder Scrolls fans or those looking for a new MMO to explore, it might not be the best choice for players seeking a polished and engaging experience from start to finish."
Negative,if you're going to get this game on pc don't buy it through steam the company cares less about the steam port then any other port of this product it seems. customer service over trying to get issues fixed is terrible.
Negative,i can't play
Negative,"The price for this content seems ok.BUT anyone considering dumping time into this game need to know they have to use much money to continue enjoying this game. For example new dlc costs twice as much as the base game with way less content. They are using a decent made game to rip off people who put time into the game. Anyone consider buying this game to spend time with it, get ready that you need to spend much money to enjoy the game in the long run!Ah and what I totally forgot. You chose a race for your character and the race your chose binds you to certain parties in pvp. So when you have the wrong race and want to play pvp with your friends, no chance. Except there is literally a no racism dlc that allows you to join a different pact than your race normally allows. So ESO inventing ""pay-to-not-being-discriminated""."
Negative,"Excellent game, however it has one big deal breaking issue for me that makes me not want to play it. I have to buy individual furniture for every house I own. When I got my first home, the inn room in vivec city, I was extremely happy to learn that the game had a fallout 4 style decorating system. Now I absolutely love the building in fallout 4, and I love to decorate player owned homes you can get if the game lets you. Now I just learned of something terrible that ruins this system entirely. I must purchase individual pieces of furniture for every single home I own. This wouldn't be too huge of an issue for me, except its for the fact that you have to use real money to buy crowns to buy the furniture. You don't use coins, you use your actually money. Now, in an ideal world this wouldn't be a problem, you buy something like a bed and you can put it in any and all homes you own. But not here, you gotta buy that same bed again for a different home. Like I said, I love decorating and base building mechanics, and I loved the fact this game had it, but the fact that the furniture isn't an account wide thing you can put in all your homes (each home has the same bed I bought for the first home for example), is the big deal breaking quit moment for me."
Negative,"Game engine feels clunky.  Gravity feels floaty.  Combat is poor.  I do not recommend this game, after 3 hours I couldn't bring myself to want to log back in."
Negative,"launcher is terrible, horrible download speeds"
Negative,Meh. People rushing through dungeons skipping bosses killed it for me. Forcing myself to have fun with the combat. The min maxing and morphing skills is dope. miss when the enemies had levels. Uninstalling. May this MMO begone. 1/10 needs more Dagoth Ur
Negative,"I managed to sink 7.5 hours into this game during the week to play week. I'll start by saying that the only other mmo's i've played was WOW from 2005-2007 and phantasy star online back in the dreamcast days. While I really enjoyed playing this game during the free week, by the end of the week I still couldn't decide if this game was actually worth the $10 dollar discount price. Although the voice acting is a huge improvement over the WOW I've played, some of the quests didn't impress me at all for a newer generation MMO. Many appeared to be a very shallow story and busy work based on keeping you traveling quite a distance to complete the task, rinse and repeat. Inventory space seems extremely limited in this game (and from what I've read, this is by design to force you into a subscription), but it's kind of sad to already start having inventory space issues 4-5 hours into a game in which I've barely obtained any gear. I was also a bit confused as to the different editions available for this game, as the base game contains the Morrowind expansion now, but then another expansion exists called summerset. A summerset bundle is available through zenimax, but that bundle doesn't appear to contain morrowind??? A very confusing product offering which seems based on getting money from you on additional expansions which are already out no matter which purchase you make. It likely would have been an easy purchase decision for me to make during this steam sale if it wasn't for the fact that basic game mechanics and the game editions seemed geared towards making you spend additional money after buying the game. Positives:Graphics-Environments seem fully populated with not too much emptiness-Quality voice acting-Combat (I actually really enjoyed skyrim style combat compared to point and click style like WOW)-Community (Seemed extremely helpful, and very little trolling/chat spam)-Didn't have any of the installation issues I see on every other review hereNegatives:-Inventory space is geared towards forcing subscription purchase-Some story quests seemed written very shallow, all side quests were very repetitive-Questing in general seems to follow pattern of go to this place far away, do this, come back, repeat.-I was plagued with some serious lag issues a few nights of this free play week. Don't know if this was due to added stress on network from free play week or typical.-Sometime's trying to login initially required multiple attempts, or even game restarts.-UI is initially missing a lot of functionality, but can be enabled in settings with blindly clicking on things with no description.-Tried to play with a friend. For some reason the game is designed to only display the group leader's location to other group memebers. There is no way to physically find other members of your group without opening the map, which is extremely tedious."
Negative,"The game is ok, but the fact that you get no notifications for being about to be charged for a subscription you no longer use is annoying enough for me to write this. And of course, also not eligible for a refund either ffs."
Negative,Combat isnt good. Classes all feel the same b/c of weapon skills overlay to all.
Negative,I keep getting disconnected . Checked my internet provider and my side is fine . Why am I always getting disconnected ?
Negative,I STILL can't play cross-platform with friends.Are we STILL in the dark ages? LOL
Negative,Its a fantastic solo/ co-op story telling game. Fucking awful MMORPG
Negative,"Pay to play, greedy company... nothing personal we just want your money i guess. I have been playing GTA5  since the game was released on PC and the online just keeps growing at no monthly fee or add on costs."
Negative,fix your fricken game
Negative,Worst customer service known to man
Negative,Not worth the monetary or time investment
Negative,I've been unable to log into my account for YEARS and customer support has yet to give me a plasuable solution to my problem. I paid $50 for this buggy piece of shit!
Negative,if you dont have friends whats the point
Negative,Some times takes for ages to connect and in loading screens. Even with a good PC in some towns its a bit laggy .
Negative,"Played this game when it first came out and the pvp was fun. now, if you don't play a certain way, you will get steam rolled. Not very customizable for pvp. the rest of the game just felt boring to me."
Negative,"Pros+Progression felt good for the first 15 or so levels (trying new abilities and upgrading abilities)+Lock picking is fun+Thats itCons-99% of combat instances are boring, and not challenging-Dungeons are impossible without friends, and dungeon finder doesn't work-Every single quest is boring as hell and feels grindy-There is little progression after level 15 of so-Pvp is bad-Barely anything to lockpick. I think I found 2 chests throughout my 25ish hr character. -Gold has little uses-a few lockpicks take up the same space as heavy armour in your inventory-Character creation is subpar-Tutorial is so boring-Why can your abilities only be upgraded once?-everything is soooo booooorrriiiinggbuying this game is like buying a below average song and listening to it over and over and over again until you want to kill yourself"
Negative,"The Developer only started listening to their fan base as of the last part of 2022 after many years of telling the players of ESO what they wanted ( they lied.. we didnt want those things) the best loot is in the cash shop. Story telling- good, Khajiit-good, voice acting - good. Game play, well once you get some levels under you and some decent gear everything in the open world is pretty easy.If you ask the developer about pvp or use a cities name from their game during questions and answers on a live stream your banned and they change the game so much that your beloved character who did amazing dmg or heals or tank..well they arent very good now.. but its okay.. but thats what we want ( right Zos?)"
Negative,"I gave this game a fair try, I even bought one of the DLCs. In all honesty, it's a game that feel like a disgrace to the elder scroll series. First of the download is a pain to go through, especially if your internet connection isn't good. The game has a loading screen every time to change a location which is fine, but the problem is that is takes ages to load the next area. DLCs are priced higher then the actual game and offer an okay amount of content, but they are still not worth the money. Overall the game has a nice skill tree and character progression, if it wasn't for the grind that it is to level up, kills give little to no xp and missions are just a running sim. Most of the missions are like this ""Go to that place, take that item, kill some guys, story, run to that place, reward"", which makes it very boring and just thinking of having to make a new character and going through all this is a nightmare. Long story short, this game is not worth buying, especially the way they made it, were you have to pay for almost everything."
Negative,Combat is just so boring.
Negative,"Downloaded game only to find out there are known issues that prevent you from launching the game.  After trying suggestions from the community with no luck, I am uninstalling.  I managed to launch the game, but then my login failed even though it worked on the ESO website.  Thanks for the free weekend! Fix your game if you want more people to play!"
Negative,Hi People who play on Steam I d/loaded Tamriel Unlimited because it sounded like a good game to play The D/load took 18 Hours to download but when i tried to access the game I found so many little Gliches that doesnt let you play it. The Key to the game from buying on Steam does not work and T/O wanted me to pay and buy another copy which i have decided not to do.Now if i cannot get my money back from Steam and someone else wants the copy i have you are welcome to it. Should you have more computer skill than i do This game may work for you.
Negative,"If you're expecting the gameplay of Morrowind, Oblivion, or Skyrim you'll be disappointed. It's just a bunch of running around and talking to static NPCs."
Negative,"Endless micro-transactions. Yearly subscription required for additional space for inventory. No cross-play between platforms. Game folder never found when Steam is launched. Bye-bye, money badly spent. Don't buy it. Just don't."
Negative,"The game became incredibly boring over the past few years, here is why.1. Accounting wide achievement- horrible implementation kills character uniqueness, also kills the incentive to get same achievements on multiple toons- aka helping others to get it as well2. Hybridisation- Idk about pvp, but for pve end-game meta, every class uses same gears+ similar bar setups, stacking 4-5 same class for ur parse dps and 2-3 cros for support jailed. It's boring af to dps nowadays compare to years ago3. Aggressive Monetisation- wanna play eso w/o craft bag? good luck, the game has been designed to clutter ur inventory very quickly. 99% of the cool stuff are all in crowns tore, want them? Pay then."
Negative,"Crazily mid-to-low tier combat. Activate an ability to make thing dead. Attacks telegraphed using coded paperwork, three weeks in advance. I guess voiced quests are nice but when the quests feel so...meaningless, and boring...it doesn't really matter.Gives you a tutorial and then says ""Alright, go on"" like it actually prepares you for even one of the myriad confusing subsystems. How does crafting work? God knows. How does armor weight affect you? It might as well not. Why ever use anything but the first ability to unlock? Eh, visual flare???TL;DR Complicated where I wanted simplicity and mind-numbingly simple where I wanted a little more complexity. Just kinda boring to try and play."
Negative,"I played for several hours during the free trial weekend. You play beside other players going through the quests at the same time. This ruins any semblance of a believable environment. You're trying to talk to a quest NPC while other players, one mounted on what looks like a giant bug, and another with a small monkey following him are clustered around trying to talk to the same guy. There's no in-game explanation for this. Why aren't these special quest areas in instances? It does have a couple of elements of what made Elder Scrolls great, but it quickly devolves in a very, very boring and predictable grind. After a few hours of occasionally buggy gameplay I realized I had no desire to play, even if it was free forever."
Negative,Meh I find it boring can't get into it
Negative,"I thought ESO would be great because Bethesda hyped it up to be and so did the fanbase, but it's literally like a replica of Rift. The quests are boring and the graphics, even on max, are not that great. Here's to hoping ES6 won't be a fluke like ESO."
Negative,"This game is a ripoff - Bethesda's try of becoming EA.. Personally, I bought this game for 40 bucks few years ago.. Now the game costs 5.99 *(standalone edition) and 20bucks for all the DLCs..Fun fact, if I want to buy the DLCs for my instance, it's gonna be 20 bucks per DLC and not 20 bucks for the whole shebang..Other than this game being a hog, the update system is garbage.. Steam downloads the game, then the launcher re-downloads the game again.. (Just because the developers are useless and unable to update the steam repositories)..I do have around a 1.6k hours on this game.. Well.. Most of those are updates.. I barely have 500 hours of legit gameplay..If you really want to waste your money on this game, you should buy this from Bethesda's website.. Just because the steam port is just trash.. Also, never try to ""Verify Game Files"" from within Steam, it will rollback all your updates and you're gonna need to redownload them again (Effectively wasting your time)"
Negative,"I have 49 hours on record, but not played anything like that. It records game time when you have stopped playing. I found to stop it doing that, I had to use task manager to close everything associated to it. ... I probably played 25 hours.There is almost a game here, but it doesn't have the quality feel of other Elder Scrolls games. I think my biggest complaint is because of the online nature. Since there are other players in the same place as you, enemies that you kill, just respawn. It means after a fight to get somewhere, you can't stop to look at the view. Or you end up fighting again and again. I really tried to like this game. I tried more than once coming back to it. I think I made it to about level 12. However you need to be level 15 before you can switch weapons. Before that you have to go into inventory. (Like what even is that?)Meanwhile the drive space is 96GB, just for the base game. I guess it's taken drive space for DLCs I have not bought. I hate it when games do that."
Negative,"Buy this game only if you feel like throwing your money into a fireplace. I played this game a few years back for several hours and took a long break from it. Recently, I decided I wanted to pick up playing the game again only to be met with a broken game that wont even let me load into the character selection screen. I've seen lots of other people having this problem as well posted on a number of forums. I've tried all the possible fixes others have posted on said threads but none of them worked just like the several other people who have had this problem and tried them. This is a completely unacceptable problem that should have been fixed years ago but by the looks of it has gone ignored by the developers. Save your money, buy yourself a pizza."
Negative,"Describing it in one word. Meh!!!...In a little more detail;-------Pros-------- Good graphics, vibrant and colourful world.- Quick progression to level 50-------Cons-------- Quests are repetitive, endless fetch requests and honestly quite boring- Everything constantly scales to your level, so no chance to ever be truly powerful- Majority of 'decent' items are locked behind paywalls, even after paying for initial game or DLC's- Largely toxic players in Dungeon Queues, who seem to forget they were once low levelled. - No real way to know if you have a good 'build' until you get called an expletive in a group :D (honestly lol'ed at this one)- Guilds are garbage- Crafting is pointless, since you can instantly find better gear in the world.- No world wide marketplace to sell your overabundance of collected junk.-------If you are desperate to try, wait until it is on sale, sink a few hours in, then quit and go and try something much more enjoyable.-------"
Negative,may be the only game i regret buying..
Negative,"I tried so hard to like this game but I really just can't. It's so bland and boring, but just happens to take place in a world I'm fond of."
Negative,bought this game last year around march and ive been trying to download and play it but i havn't been able to figure out how to set this game up ive been searching forums on reddit and other place to work this issue out and yet after almost a year i still haven't been able to actually play the game despite having every requirement needed to play ive tried to repair abe uninstall and reinstall and a few other things. seriously wtf is up with this?? anyone know.
Negative,"The company behind ESO is the worse. They charged me for membership when I never gave them permission. The game itself is fine, but only if they haven't suspended your account. When I went to support to get the money back they charged me again and suspended my account for no reason. Don't buy it, you will end up with a chance of having your money taken out."
Negative,Great game if you arent on a laptop. In my experience if you run the game on a laptop and run into a problem and contact ESO support they will tell you they dont support mobile graphics cards and will not help you fix your problem nor will they even think about mobile cards in future updates so you are basically screwed.
Negative,"I would recommend this game, but ONLY if you have friends to play with. Otherwise, it doesn't really hold much over any other MMO and it's systems are pretty bland. It's not bad per se, but it doesn't have anything that really stands out on its own. It's combat system would be innovative if action MMOs weren't on the rise on their own, and its levelling system while fresh is unclear and leaves a little to be desired in terms of the abilities themselves. You could definitely pick worse games, and given this game is by and large a ""one time"" purchase, it makes sense to purchase if all you're looking for is a time sync. Compared however to other MMOs like Final Fantasy 14 or World of Warcraft, ESO falls a little flat."
Negative,"If you are planning to play as an endgamer just ignore this. There is no class diversity and all class skills are being nuked, even now when it's 'in a good spot) 80% of your skills are non-class skills. The devs are focing you to play into the styles they want and ignore you, ban you on the forums for a bit of criticism and gaslight you on an social media. If you're a casual sure but if you wanna invest some time and 'git gud' go lick a wall or something, it's better than this.Also because of the updates I've uninstalled and cancelled the sub. Just ignore this."
Negative,The launcher is buggy as hell
Negative,Generic MMO with elder scrolls paintjob
Negative,infinite load screens
Negative,"don't get this game from Steam - the login servers bork every night during prime time and you can't play it, but everyone who gets it direct via the ESO can play no bother.  Save yourself the hassle!"
Negative,SLOW game. Not for those who enjoy solo play. Much of the game play is not winnable unless you are in a group or some folks just happen to come along and help you. Very frustrating playing by yourself as you die continuously fighting bosses. I'm disappointed in the game because I loved Skyrim and it's wildly successful predecessors. I got my character to level 22 in this ridiculously slow and frustrating game and I am confident writing that i will never play this game again.  Don't waste your money.
Negative,"This game is suitable to play only in NATO countries, unfortunately. If you're from SEA, don't even bother playing it. 250 ping is playable, but you will get instant disconnection every few minutes.Edit : Fixed it by using paid vpn. But my point still stands."
Negative,"Combat is absolutely garbage. Somehow it is newer than Skyrim, yet its combat manages to be even worse. By far the largest issue is that the camera has some kind of acceleration or momentum? It continues to move after you stopped moving your mouse, and when turning in the opposite direction, it has to slow down before you can begin to look."
Negative,"The game overall is good... Although I prefer not to play it because of the inventory system, It sucks."
Negative,"here to play pvp from asia? , get slammed by bad connection here to pve grind and do quest from asia? , game working perfectly"
Negative,It doesnt feel like an elder scrolls game
Negative,i want to burn my hard drive
Negative,I walked into this game expecting a LOT and got nothing I expected. Would NOT recommend.
Negative,"I can't even open it when I first download it. No wonder, people are saying that this is cash-grab. Base game, huge list of dlc, cash shop, subscription-based. So many ways to get money but still can't fix a ""start"" button"
Negative,"Game servers are down more often than not, if you're a gamer wanting to spend time and money with friends online then honestly just look for something else... or wait until the bother to do something about it.I appreciate a good steam deal as much as the next individual but even a discounted price is a rip off when the bloody game doesn't work!"
Negative,"This could easily be a great game with a couple minor adjustments, but it's not because...Level scaling results in:Everything being easyZones have no identityNo sense of dangerNo sense of progression/accomplishmentAlso the combat is bad and boring. I can't think of a game that has more boring combat.Rework your whole combat system, get rid of level scaling and you'd have a pretty good game. But you won't do that."
Negative,"The game does not adequately support the game on devices with MACOS. Regardless of your hardware, game optimization, settings, you will encounter problems, freezes, download ping, the developer's unwillingness to optimize the game. No replies or forum attention from support in a dedicated thread.In 44 hours I learned: of which + -26 hours I played as a character, 18 hours  - I see launcher, learned how to forward ports in the router, edit config files, enable and disable add-ons, reinstall the game, recheck game files, enable and disable the game, waiting for loading screens after departure when changing locations, someone logged in my account (its bug when you cant join server after disconnect), two launcher are active now (it means that restarting your game you cant play it, until you terminate all ESO and Steam processes).The best support for MACOS is to release an update to the launcher, which in the new update only began to support the new OS theme. I like this patch)I want to experience fun from playing, not computer optimization for your game."
Negative,"Every time I try to play this I'm absolutely lost in the sauce. There is just no point. Quest crudely marked clunky, finally find where you are going, it's where you just were, it's only an npc, you click and quest over. wow. Lore uninteresting. Finished main main quest in 1 session. Expansion? Lost in the sauce. No results. Side quest and meaningless npc's that just don't hold my attention.Builds? what builds. You slowly get some set skills that barely synergise. Can't just max bow, or sword, gotta wait, no no no.Side quest. Basically wandering around. Rewards kinda suck early on.Find part of a set. Cool. Remaining of the set unobtainable for 30 levels. sweet.Horse real slow. Upgrade 1%. TOMORROW until next upgrade? Not even riding/jumping raises? ffs. Tomorrow horse real slow. Next day horse real slow. Next day horse real slow. At max its not much faster because base horse kinda a joke. Fast travel 300gold. Wait 5 min. 290gold. WTF it's only 1 zone away. Fast travel across the map 1k gold WTFDSAFDSFEIMLSegMan. Ain't no one got time for this game. This game is stuck in gw/wow timeline ""mmo"", meanwhile the world new age is not having to become a basement dweller to play. Everyone relevant has grown up and past this tier game which is also demonstrated by 3 people streaming with 1 viewer.Have to get a mini map UI add-on or else you're checking map every 3 min on a 30 min journey.3/10 would re-sell the game for a slimjim/cheese combo snack."
Negative,Has issues with loading and uninstalling
Negative,"If you loved Skyrim, prepare to be utterly disappointed. This game takes everything about Skyrim and makes it worse. The story has no worthwhile hook and since it's an MMO, you gotta grind to progress. The combat, because it's online, is boring and clunky. No near-miss dodges and no attacking from a distance. Also, none of the quest areas are instanced so other players just roll up and loot everything as well. I only played for a couple hours and man was I let down in every single way. I'm not sure what I expected about an ESO MMO, but it wasn't this."
Negative,"This game has a good concept, It also is multiplayer whitch I love. Me and my friend bought it because we wanted to play elder scrolls game online together, we enjoyed first few hours untill... The ingame store kicked in. You couldn't explore most of the map without spending whole tons of money on DLCs and some ingame currecy crowns or some stuff. I mean if you're like me - Broken - Don't buy this game because you won't get much from it, but if you can afford to spend 30€ on just DLCs then you just might try this game out! I personally don't like it how DLCs are limiting the gameplay, they're just there to milk drops of money out of players."
Negative,"Clunky, poorly designed piece of dog shit game. Quality of life design choices on this game are pretty much non existent. The map icons are horrible, no global settings for your alts, no minimap...but it looks pretty. Playing this game without addons is what I imagine being tortured is like. In a world with more games than you can realistically play, this clunky mess isn't worth my time. It made me realize that.at I took other games for granted so at least I'm thankful for that. Just stay away from this doodooEdit:  I'm angry at myself I wasn't more creative but I'm too annoyed at this game to hate on it properly and put some effort into it.And I want to hate on the elder scrolls fanboys a bit, they won't mind since bethesda has beaten them into submission so much over the years that they don't really know what smoothness in gaming is. And if you complain about some poop design choice on the forums, they'll instantly make excuses and take it personally. I really really hate you fanboys."
Negative,"Not a RPG!  I think you'd have a right to expect that Elder Scrolls Online would be like the Elder Scrolls RPG games?  Well it isn't!  I'm a veteran of Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim and I can tell you this isn't like any of those games.  I actually shocked that Bethesda would use it's franchise for this garbage!  Essentially it is just a dumb 'hack and slash' not a RPG (they should be had up for their description).  The alarm bells start ringing straight away when you notice that there are only 3 basic stats: Magicka; Health; and Stamina (somehow Stamina effects archery and sneaking - go figure?).  Apart from Dexterity there's noticeably absent both Intelligence and Charisma (much like the game itself).  Now OK there's crafting, there's a skill tree etc but this game is just dumb, dumb, dumb!  Take NPC conversations for example.  In both Oblivion and Skyrim you have the options to ask different questions which may effect the final outcome of the conversation or even your future adventure.  Here you just get scripted replies and questions which you have to click through. TBH they might just've made those conversations cut scenes and saved you the chore of clicking!  Even combat is dumb.  Now I don't mind respawning NPCs maybe after I've left the dungeon or area but here you turn a corner then back track on yourself only to find the NPC you've killed seconds ago magically respawned!  This makes clearing out a dungeon impossible!  It is extremely infuriating to enter a cave or dungeon reach your goal then have to come back and fight the same NPCs that only a few moments earlier you killed!  The only similarity to an intelligent RPG (like the Elder Scrolls games Skyrim and Oblivion) is in the races and places.  I feel quite angry that this game pretends to be a RPG and I've wasted my money on what is just a dumb 'hack and slash'!"
Negative,"Ever since the update a few years ago, my family and I can't play this game. Something in the animation/graphics makes us sick to the stomach and give us head aches. No other game causes this issue. We were fine for YEARS playing this game then the update hit and nothing stops the pain. Too bad because we really enjoyed it until the developers decided to do this to the player base. Several guilds of players had to stop for the same reasons."
Negative,"Bland! The story is about as compelling as reading the ingredients on a shampoo bottle. The cash shop is insidious, designed to prey upon any psychological vulnerabilities you may have and then exploit them for financial gain. It's not really an Elder scrolls game, it's basically a WoW clone with a bad combat system and an Elder Scrolls skin on it."
Negative,"its very mid, when you first start playing it slams you with info that makes no sense then proceeds to give u huge stats to make you feel good about how u can do but it legit jsut makes things more confusing ""is that 12 digits or 11"" they dont give you much incentive to keep going and intend for you to start on your own path. its not my game. some other people may like it but its just not for me. i could be biased from playing the original."
Negative,"It's a nice rpg but a little too easy imo.Even hundreds of hours into questlines... difficulty doesn't ""advance""Could do with a difficulty setting option to make enemies do more damage to you for an extra challenge."
Negative,"okay. i'm a little late to the party. i had such huge hopes for this game because man i love the elder scrolls. and i love MMOs. but i have never seen an MMO so unpolished almost ten whole years after its release. even disregarding the DLC, there's so many areas and other content locked behind the most expensive paywalls i've ever encountered. but my god i think this is the closest we're gonna get to TES VI as of now."
Negative,The launcher has a huge ass update so the time it takes to finish installing goes over the play time to be unable to refund...
Negative,"if you plan to play alone, do not buy."
Negative,this game is awful
Negative,"Unless you're gonna pay the sub this game sucks, unless you like inventory management.  Even if you do sub, you work your ass off to get that powerful build finally finished and polished only to have it nerfed."
Negative,not my cup of tea. Super boring compared to other elder scrolls games.
Negative,"Just canceled my ESO + subscription.  Certain content in the game is not playable currently.Oh, and Customer Service is dismal as well, they auto reply with an email, and make you follow up with them.  Dismal."
Negative,This game is great. But after reviews about ESO Plus subscriptions automatically renewing and not being able to stop it. I then decided soon as I paid for it that I was cancelling the subscription. However a year later. 6 months of not playing the game... the cancelled recurring payment is suddenly not cancelled anymore. Leaving me with a stupid bill for something i no longer play due to it becoming boring. Pretty much on Steam I guess. But still pathetic. Especially after making sure I did cancel the subscription since I knew if forget about it.
Negative,"This game has a ton of content to keep you engaged, but no amount of content can make up for how bad the game play is. The combat is so incredibly boring and clunky. Abilities aren't responsive. Animations don't match what is happening. It feels like playing a hack and slash game from the 90s. I was talked into playing this game again by some friends. We ran out of content in New World. This game has really given me much  more appreciation for New World."
Negative,"ESO feels like an Elder Scrolls game. It is fun, expansive and keeps me coming back for more. However, I keep coming back because I keep getting kicked off due to server timeouts, or quiting because of massive lag spikes that make the game unplayable. I want to like this game. I want to play it everyday. I want to buy crowns to support further development. But the issues are far too annoying and make me want to just quit, play something else and come back to see if they have resolved their issues in a few months."
Negative,"I don't know what to say other than it's just not fun.  I loved WoW for the time I played (7 years) I loved SW:ToR, I love FFXIV, but I don't like ESO.  It just doesn't have the same appeal as other MMO's or even the Elder Scrolls games."
Negative,"i used to really love this game, i've been playing since beta and it was an awesome blast as i'm sure you can tell by my hours but this company is super greedy and ruined it for methe constant dlc updates each costing 15-40 dollars every single update really drove me away from playing cause i was getting left behind of all the good gear and fun dungeons and i did the math and as of now all the dlc adds up to arround 450 or so dollars, that's insane for a single game that's half the price of my entire high end pc like dayumso for this reason i cannot recomend this great but very very very expensive game but hey if you like spending hundreds of dollars on one game and you like mmos and elder scrolls than 100% yes get this game it's great"
Negative,"As much as there is to enjoy about this game, FUCK THIS GAME. Spend $80 to get it, look at some of the styles you can unlock and decided to travel to the places where you can unlock them. Oh that dungeon you need to go through to unlock it, pay for it. Look at another style that i like, another dungeon i have to buy. This game will fucking nickel and dime you to do about half the stuff in it. This wouldn't anger me so much if i could earn the stupid crown points by actually playing the game. The gameplay itself isn't bad, better than most MMOs, but the constant need to buy crowns or pay a monthly fee to play half the game kinda ruins it"
Negative,The worst game in the series. Go back to skyrim
Negative,soooo much dialogue. no idea what's going on the whole time im playing because it doesn't engage me at all. have to buy dlcs and eso online to do anything. boring.
Negative,i am NEVER rating this game good until they remove the craftbag PAYWALLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Negative,Zero Support for accounts though Steam.  Will Lock you out of your account and just steal your money.
Negative,"Game could be very worthwile but unfortunately Zenimax/Bethesda seem to never have fixed the disconnects people are suffering from.Personally getting disconnected every 10 - 30 minutes and I've a 100/40 connection.Unfortunately, can't recommend it for this issue."
Negative,"Awful melee combat! Very clumsy, animation badly synchronised, it's not really melee, even simple dagger attack can kill sheep from 3 meters:https://sun9-2.userapi.com/c831208/v831208511/166a7e/Qs7z_0qUZWU.jpg"
Negative,"I'm with others on this. The game is a money sink. First, while it is pretty, and plays well, it plays nothing like the single player ES games...yeah yeah, I know...""online game, different design needed"". Well, even with that, it doesn't really feel like ES in many ways, particularly character development, which rather than allowing you to design your starting character, forces you to take on of a limited set of classes. Second, the money sink. Sure, its TECHNICALLY free to play, but you can't play much without spending cash. There is no ingame way to earn content or upgrades. Inventory space is so very crippled, you actually CAN'T play without buying upgrades (unless you want to be ditching most of your loot, or spending most of you time travelling back to town to sell...both really...and even this leaves you without the resources you need later in the game to manage the increase in difficulty as you progress). Much content, even parts that are foundational to ES play experience, such as Thieves and Assassins require money to unlock. Many other sides of the game become stupidly difficult to manage without spending cash for boosts etc. I would give it a miss unless you either have a reliably deep purse, or are willing to be extremely frustrated. Just for the record, I'm good with subs, with paid content, and with micro transactions...just not all three on top of each other, and the content and micro transaction costs are some of the highest in the industry."
Negative,horrible game to navigate and run. Crashes more often than it works. Don't sink money into this.
Negative,"Used to run on my pc fine, wanted to play it again and it crashes on launch every time. Emailed support and they told me my GPU wasnt supported because its a laptop GPU?"
Negative,"Developers need to rework the entire combat system, the only thing that keeps me away from this game."
Negative,Frequent login issues through steam.Frequent over the top ad drives ingame to force store purchases.
Negative,"I got ""138 hrs on record"" and 95% out of that is fuckin download/update time.dont buy this shit before watching youtube videos and making sure that you like it, else wise u will have to install their launcher, download the game, get a bunch of fuckin hours in it and then u cant refund it anymore. GG"
Negative,"Rewritten 05.01.23You pay for the game, then you pay for a monthly subscription if you want to have access to the full game and don't want your inventory to be permanently full, otherwise, you buy every single dlc.  The best gear is a dlc trial gear and mythics, which require you to have several dlc to get them - sorta pay to win. If it isn't enough, the devs make you see loot box ads everytime you logging in.Bugs - every weekly patch breaks something in the game and it takes months and, sometimes, years to fix what was broken.Balance - update 35, no comments on that. But that was just one example - sweeping changes every three months is a normal state of the game. Be ready to get rid of your now useless gold trial gear, be ready to rebuild your character because your build is a piece of crap now, be ready your skills got nerfed or replaced by new gear (which comes from paid dlc).What remains is really good old dlc zones and stories. The new zones are self-copying (compare Blackwood and High Isle) and the new stories are predictable and boring."
Negative,"Mixed feelings about this one. + The graphics and story mode are awesome, I really enjoy exploring the areas and talking to NPCs to go through a questline. The zone quests are really well built, interesting, and drive you through the game really nicely. It's a game where you don't worry about the numbers so much - the story is more interesting that stats.+ Sometimes I forget where I'm going because I'm admiring the area, the foliage, the architecture... Breathtaking design, really.+ Crafting is also fun.There are some really annoying features though that completely break the flow. - One of them being the most basic: the map. There is no way to tell where the **** you are. If you open the map, you can see yourself within a given zone but have no way to find out which zone you're in. If you open the world map, there are millions of zones and markers and if you press R to locate your char then it takes you back to the zone map, again, with no name of the zone shown. - The other thing that puts me off is that other players are more of a hindrance then help, through no fault of their own. If you are out in the field solving a riddle or collecting clues, people who are ahead of you in that quest can totally ruin the challenge for you. You have to wait for them to go away and resume if you want to enjoy the quest. Being an MMO this is kinda silly - the only way I've interacted with players is via dungeons, where we jump in, rush through the area, loot, and disband... Sometimes I feel it would be easier to play this as single player.Definitely wouldn't consider a sub based on my experience so far (lvl 27 atm)."
Negative,"This game is a perfect example of greed taking precedence over us, the players. Let me sum up.1. They carry out maintenance when most of the US are in bed, this includes the EU servers, of course, so, us Europeans have to suffer, It is not rocket science, they are separate servers, do the US server in the early hours, do the EU server in the early hours. It is not difficult to work out time zones, but they seem to think everyone is on US time, of course they don't, but the arrogance is unbelievable. 2.This week (25/05 to 29/05),and again today 03/06/, there has been maintenance each and every day, as above, this is done whilst the US is asleep, but the EU is awake.3.Constant disconnects, I play a lot of online games, this is the only one that will chuck you out whenever it wants, and you have a wait to get back in.4. Even though, I and many others pay a sub, these greedy people refuse to give us even a day extra on our subs, due to the constant downtime.5. Lag, you want lag? This game has it in abundance, I have decent broadband, a top of the range PC, but this? It beggars belief! It really does. Once again they are cutting corners to get more money out of us, the players, who pay their wages.6. Yes, I have played it a lot over the last few weeks, in the vain hope that one day, they will release we are not all in their timezone, but no, so conceited it is painful.7. DO NOT buy this shambles of a game until they realise we pay their wages with our subs, and show us some respect. After all, a game is only as strong as it's player base, this game has lost it's way in dollar signs and the complete disregard of any players outside of the US. Shame on you!The only good thing about this game is the crafting bag (something of course you cannot buy ) that comes with a sub, other than that, after playing since the start (2012), it is obvious that money matters more than anything else, OK, they need to make money of course, but there has to be a balance, greed in itself is a recipe for disaster.Avoid this shambles, until (if), they find that balance and realise we, the player base, pay their wages with our subs, and of course, realise that not everyone is on US time!If I had to sum up this game in a sentence, it would be:'Greed personified""Avoid this mess, until they sort the servers out, realise that not everyone is on US time, or just get their act together!Avoid, it's a joke of a game, until, well, see above."
Negative,"The only things you can earn in game in terms of cosmetics through gameplay are generic horse mounts and a couple of pets and toys. The vast majority of skins, toys, mounts and other cosmetics come exclusively from time limited loot crates, that have low drop chances on anything except for in game potions and food that are worse than potions and food you can make yourself. In other MMOs like WOW or FFXIV, you have a large variety of cosmetics and collectibles to obtain through gameplay, and a small collection of collectibles that are purchased in the shop (for comparison, WOW has 16 mounts in the game shop and they are not (usually) time limited, ESO has 9-10 in each loot crate season, multiple seasons per year, none of these mounts appear via gameplay, you can't earn lootcrates in game, and this doesn't even touch on mounts that may be sold directly for real money, usually also time limited, while the base game still ). The only mounts you can earn in game are a horse, or one other mount you get in a trial (end game raid). Just one. Out of all the raids. One. This game is monetized to an absurd degree for a game where all DLC must be purchased if you don't sub, and expansions are sold for direct money too. Also, game performance is absolutely atrocious, servers can literally lag to the point where you can't do anything for several seconds, not caused by latency but by the server basically taking several seconds to process what is happening"
Negative,crown crates are not worth the money at all.
Negative,"the most laggy and broken mmo ever, and crazy crazy price for shuch low low product"
Negative,"Uninstalling as I write this.Update 35 is, according to the developers, an attempt to improve accessibility and close the gap between high end players and those who don't know what they're doing (because why should someone who puts effort into learning the game perform better? What an outrageous idea).Go ahead, decrease skill ceiling to appeal to the least invested of your playerbase. That's never gone wrong before."
Negative,"It was hard to like this game for me. I played well over 2,000 hours of FFXIV before jumping into this... oddity of a game. I'm familiar with good subscription models but the only subscription model here is ""Pay to be able to have full access to the things you will need in this game"" and it doesn't feel too great. I tried my hardest to push 100 hours. I tried to really like it, but I can't recommend this in the genre of MMORPGs when greater titles exists."
Negative,"If the game was actually accessible, it might be worth playing. bearing in mind that when it's actually possible to login that you can't get any more Crowns to buy stuff with unless you pay for a subscription, or buy them from other players. Buying them other players is expensive, and i don't want to pay for a subscription cos i think ESO has made more than enough money already, plus there is the problem of the servers being down for HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS and it keeps happening!!"
Negative,"if only i could play the game, that would be great. Servers are always down not to mention all the bugs, that Bethesda never fix. Got TWO server maintenance messages this week already. Would not even recommend ESO PLUS , you will never get to play, 'cause why??? ""Server down due to maintenance."""
Negative,I have been a long time fan of the elder scrolls games and after leaving World of Warcraft. I have found a game I can truly since sink hour's into. However one of the key things that are a major disappointment and will make me leave this game to go back to World of Warcraft is the disgraceful support you get. A scammer provides better game support than the developer of this game. My ticket has been waiting for a response for over 6 days and no response what so ever. I haven't even received the crowns for signing up for ESO Plus and I'm considering going to the local Australian body to lodge a complaint for fake advertising. In short I don't think it worth spending money on a developer that doesn't care for its customers or provide support. It's back to World of Warcraft the gold standard.
Negative,"I love all previous incarnation of this game (I played Skyrim for over 300h and Oblivion about 250h on my xBox) however the online version disappointed me greatly:- it is way TOO EASY to play - and help from other players just makes it easier- many quests are so CROWDED with other players that you can rarely kill some big boss and loot disappears before your eyes- in those overcrowded places I feel like playing Urban Terror or Quake - people are jumping all over place and run toward the goal - SNEAKING is just pointless- it's hard to immerse in the story when your NPC while talking with you is also assassinated by another player, but hey! NPC is still talking- quests are extremely SIMPLE - not only you don't need to look for your objective, because arrows always points you to the exact place or tiny area, but also your decisions have little if any impact on the story- LOADING screens often takes 1-5 minutes - user INTERFACE is just all over the place and it's not intuitive. It seems like developers have no clear structure where to add new things (like, in one menu you have costumes, in other armours but to change appearance of your mount is in another place completely)I like the option of playing with my husband, and I love the world, races, fractions in this game. I wish there would be less players in the same area or option to play locally only with family and friends. But even if that would be available, I'm afraid that the lack of interesting scripts would also make this game repeatable and boring in no time."
Negative,Can't save appearances in character creator.
Negative,"Make me sick, never saw worst camera, character movements. The launcher trigger the steam timer so can't ask for a refund because of my bad internet connection."
Negative,"Bad for SEA, too long download time so you can't refund it. (Steam only downloads installer, downloading fromknstaller counts as playtime) how stupid is that."
Negative,"The game is great, there's lots of content to play, lots of areas to explore. But, in game support is horrifyingly bad. Probably even worse than chinafarm games. God forbid, you run into some technical issue. They will make you wait for half a month for a response, will have trouble locating your account, won't respond to your emails and might even ban you if you start fussing about your issue taking too long to resolve. And might even blame it on you in the end, saying that you were hacking the game, with no evidence whatsoever."
Negative,"Very big CON:-During evening and lots of players this game has loading screens that take 5 minutes and more.-Developer Bethesda knows this ever since 2017 and nothing changed.-Since 2017 so-callled solutions were presented by staf but - again - loading screens are still long.Summary: This is a Bethesda game and ever since Fsllout 76 we players know that money is more important that performance and players fun.Stay away, unless you like loading screens and are willing to pay for it.Also, you can' t respond on ESO forums unless you have an invitation. Well, that says it all. The developer are not only NOT answering the issue of loading screens, it is also  screening the users!"
Negative,"Would have been great if they tell people there is no Asian server in this fucking game. What kind of self-respecting MMO developers not have Asian server? MMO is fucking huge in Asia. Half of WoW players are fucking Chinese, and that's not even counting Koreans and Japanese. Asians are far more likely to buy MTX than any other group,  so it's impossible to lose money on an Asian server. ZOS is literally too incompetent to see a pile of cash dangling in front of them."
Negative,"This is the mmo using the name of the greatest single player series made that is standing in the way of a 6th installment to the series. Nuf said.As far as mmo's go, it is a pretty good game. Realistically though, there is no such thing as free to play. Expect to pay to get  more than a passing glimpse at the game because of storage and a few other issues. It is an mmo so you should know ahead of time say goodbye to your spending money and most of your free time if not all to get much out of it.One of the great points to the single player series is that you level a character based on skills you use and there are (at least before skyrim er oblivion or whatever a lot of skills.) This one has classes with a few skills. The end. It winds up being more of a gear grinder, which is ok if that is what your game is... like say... diablo. As far as character progression on it's own goes this one feels really shallow.It has quite a bit of crafting, but see paragraph 2 about storage. My biggest peave about the crafting is alchemy just is meh. In the single player it is the go to OP skill. If you aren't extremely active don't expect to be in a guild that gets a store bid every week so you can actually sell things and have money. In some cases you can get away with only logging in once a week for a few hours and still sell the minimum required by the guilds that successfully bid locations with stores that actually sell anything. There is no auction house so expect to spend a lot of time searching for that one piece to finish a set every few levels. The game has its good points. The combat is pretty good and there are lots of areas to explore. Some of the boss battles are innovative and fun. They leave you feeling like you accomplished something and sometimes even drop something useful. There is a great variety of enemies. It is story and lore rich. All in all if you know what you're getting into with an mmo it is worth it, but because of paragraph one and its many other  faults I can't give it a positive recommendation."
Negative,"Well, what shut I say?Massiv problems to install this game.Downloading 85GB , than starting dowloadig the last patch, after that, following Patch Error´s etc.I continued 3 times. Still the same problem.Too bad, I wanted to look in the game, but with this, there is no way, to get a new player."
Negative,"Nothing like the actual Elder Scroll series, feels like a totally different game. Its quests are super bland and the same. I wish I could have my money back. Also BETHESDA please consider (if making another online game) don't just make it A massive multiplayer game make it a Co-op experience like borderlands so there's more story involvement."
Negative,"Bethesda does it again: Introducing pay2rent, you can finally rent the game by paying monthly tribute to get access to its dlcs and the craft bag (which is essentially almost impossible to play the game without). Greedy fucks."
Negative,"Don't let the reviews fool you, this game is broken and has been for about two months now. Don't waste your money on these crooks, they don't even care that half their players cant even launch the game."
Negative,The game won't run.
Negative,fix your godamn login issues for steam accounts it is embarissing to have the same issues since launch
Negative,After hours of downloading it continues to update with more hours of downloadingGave up on the free weekend of playing and deleted
Negative,"I have played this game for the past four years on the Eu and Us servers. If you want an open world to escape into then I would recommend it to you. There is something for most people in this game even though it is getting dated. I would like to point out that I still play it but not in the fashion that I did when I fell in love with it years ago. Vested interested in this game makes it hard to give up. There are a lot of bad things about this product. Continued poor performance hampers the PVP side of the game and group events. Continued bugs that have not been fixed for years. Each update brings a bag of troubles like more bugs, more game lag and more down time as they fix it on the fly. Don't expect any customer support or feedback from them. The game has evolved over the years. When I started playing it was a great item. As time evolved it, game items are continually nerfed, events become more common adding to the lag and performance issues. Before it was a challenge to advance levels and game content was truly entertaining. Now levels are too easy to achieve making new players reach too higher levels to quickly. Many become toxic due to the easiness of their being given everything in the game to easy. This is a big problem that is never addressed.There is still something in the game for people but you have navigate it yourself. I will continue to play it until I find a better designed game."
Negative,"I bought this game recently because I needed a filler for an MMORPG. I've played thousands of hours on the following RuneScape, WoW, and New World. I also played every Elder Scrolls game since Morrowind. I love the Elder Scrolls world, but this game just feels empty. You feel floaty during combat. I should have continued to follow my gut and not bought this game."
Negative,"The game has great gameplay, at least the few minutes i was able to actually play, and the story looks good. However, absolutely unplayable with unintuitive, convoluted, clunky and bizarre designs of almost all game functions. Bags, inventory, skills, quests, map, professions, etc.Played 12 hours, 1 is actual play time. Spent 1 hour trying to figure out how to empty my bag that fills after a few quests, for example."
Negative,"I'd really like to recommend this game, but after 8 years of development this could be so much more. For short short term players it's anyway a time sink and way too expensive. For long term players there are too many annyoing changes and no really new or diverse content.- very expensive: base game, chapters, dlc, ingame shop and monthly subscription (without craft bag and extra space it's a inventory management simulator)- new chapters are mostly copy & paste content painted with a different colour and dlc are only new dungeons with item sets which are pointless, because there are already so many similar- the few new features comming with a chapter never get polished after release and just left dead behind- with the latest chapters they introduced always ""must have items"" to sell more copies just to nerf them with the next chapter- devs are very out of touch with the community: constantly nerfing builds which are fun while completely ignoring bugs, server issues and possible (quality of life) improvemnts- PVE suffers from PVP changes and vice versa, so in the end nothing gets truly balanced and just continuously changed- insanely long server maintenances (5h+) and after most updates there are multiple server downs for hotfixes"
Negative,"Really tried to install this game and play it but it didn't work. Too many errors at different stages of simply trying to login, update the launcher or even download the game with a myriad of ""solutions"" out there on our end that didn't solve anything. Too much hassle involved in trying to have fun playing a damn game. I give up."
Negative,"I dont recommend this game! dont waste your time grinding or trying to do anything noteworthy! if you're an achievement hunter then this comment shouldnt deter you from exploring this elderscrolls lore book. but the game as a game where you want to get really into it and slay everyone and hit every leaderboard for all the content? NOPEthere is SO MUCH LAG EVERYWHERE its 99% impossible to actually accomplish any instance, dungeon, trial, pvp match, and ALL veteran content is walled by intense lag. i live in vegas, i have super stable connection, this game actually just sucks and after all these years i thought they'd focus on performance AT ANY POINT, but all they did was add bloated shitty content on top of an already LAG infested server room. good luck dueling, you'll lag spike and die but you cant blame that EEEEVERYTIME so you just stop dueling ok.you go into a vet dungeon but theres so much lag you cant even fucking exist, no way to pull random strangers through any vet duneon anymore, theres too much lag! i used to actually have fun buuilding tanks/healers who could solo vet dungeons then que into random vet dungeons JUST TO HELP! it was fun teaching and playing with strangers! but you cant anymore because the lag is so terrible FOR EVERYONE. i cant beat a vet boss with mechanics when everything lags for 2~5 full seconds and you get back all dead. so i stopped vet dungeons ok.I tried to get into a trials guild, but you need trial gear to get into trials guild... ok, start my own guild, with my own gear sets and ideas... GOOD FUCKING LUCK FINDING 12 HUMAN BEINGS CAPABLE OF THE VET CONTENT IN THIS GAME.after 4 months of training, finding people, training, finding more people, the cycle continues into oblivion where i fucking give up trials now.so i gear up for pvp i guess, get into a battle ground and start having fun until you FINALLY REALLY GET INTO IT! only to lag so hard it pulls the fun out of it, removes my head from thee game and makes me hate the game. ok give up battlegrounds whats next? run into cyrodill to just have fun at this point, so much lag you finally start disconnecting fully from the game, no more lag spikes, full disconnects which make you want to not launch the game again. so i just stop playing the game, OK. if you're literally just on this game to do quests or whatever else fishing, role playing whatever i'm sure its fine for that non competitive, non gaming aspect of the game lol so i say if you Role Play for quests and lore hunting this comment won't help you. this is for people who care about actual video games and performance related to playing that game. after over 4,000 combined hours playing this game between xbox and PC i've never been so sad about something actually becoming a steaming pile of turd shit. :( :( :( :( this must be how World of Warcraft players feel about blizzard... i get it now."
Negative,THE ATTACK FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK IN SOME TIMES
Negative,If u wanna sleep early everyday play this game :D
Negative,"Buy it cheap for the story line, still a good play through. The newer zones have actual some solid plot. If you don't like Bethesda's buggy ass engine avoid this game. If you can tolerate it then give this a shot. Secondly it's worth subscribing for the period you do choose to play.            It is also not worth buying shit in the crown store. Game cost  20$ on sale and some of the cosmetic purchases are upwards of 50$. That being said Bethesda has been reduced to nothing more then a shameless cash grab and over priced cosmetic purchases. It's not pay to win , its pay for it to be convenient to win. With some grind's easily over 6 months and the only viable way for most players is to pay to reduce it. Which is also expensive as the items that reduce those grinds have some pretty hefty prices tags. So a break down You get  1500-1000 gold per single crown .  100,000:100 - 150,000:100So a 20 mil item on an auction house would be 150-200$Making the game ludicrously priced and of course favoring older players.To make it simple you could spend a quarter million real life fucking dollars in the games crown store and not even get close to owning everything that ""money"" could buy in the game. Quite bold for a game using an insanely outdated engine and having a dwindling player base.I'm personally going to stick out the 2 more months of sub I have and then probably never touch this game again. I'd also like to point out that there are MMO's that are over 18 years old that are better then this MMO in its current state(referring to platform stability and known unresolved bugs). A state that will not ever reliably improve, just look at FO76 for all the proof you need."
Negative,Great game managed by a dogsh*t company.
Negative,"too much paid content,"
Negative,"personally i didnt like it. its slow and clunky. and bethesda thinking their little glitches are part of the charm in their games? no , no they're not"
Negative,"its a waste of time, not if u have money just buy their eso plus membership over and over again without it u can't enjoy. Fuck this game"
Negative,Game would never start from launcher. What also makes me mad is in trying to get it to work I logged 1 hour of play time on a game that never got passed the launcher. Glad I only tried for an hour and did not exceed the 2 hour refund limit. Very shifty of Steam to start the game clock before the game ever launches.
Negative,"Very undewhelming.  It got boring faster than how long it took to download and update.The first and foremost problem is it's buy to play, then you have to buy dlc, then get a subscription to unlock content that you still don't get at that point, and then you have ""micro""transactions.The second problem is that you only have 5 skills and an ultimate, and some of the skills are just slightly better autoattacks. And I really do mean slightly, you have to mash the button for a long time before the enemies go down. Combat has little impact, and it's mostly just watching health bars tick down, it's more like a timer than anything, with how limited the mechanics are. The level design is great. Everything is pretty, it oozes mood, although the NPCs are rather dead, even compared to a TESO title. I enjoyed the decor more than in skyrim, though the NPCs being static and just snapping between a few low effort animations takes away from it. The quests in the game all have a story, but as they are, mechanically they end up being fetch quests mostly. It wouldn't be an issue, but it's Bethesda tier writing, so it only keeps you entertained for so long. Sadly the combat doesn't put the excitement back into the game either for me. The full voiceacting is a big plus. Even though it's the same 5 voices as always, it's a lot better than most mute MMOs out there.All in all, I feel like there are a lot of better MMOs out there, even if you pick randomly, you'll find one that's much better in at least one aspect, and it's also a straight downgrade from Skyrim."
Negative,Game performance issues and lag.
Negative,"It is an MMO.  It will be expensive and siphon hours of your day with uninspired, production line content. If you want a fantasy experience, play Skyrim, Dragon Age, or the Witcher instead."
Negative,The game is beautiful but the running and combat animation are so bad this is the only reason i can't play this game
Negative,"Awesome, another complete reinstall in update 25.That's 3x 90GB installs in 2 months.Deleted.Edit: I see the problem now, the Steam version is borked. It downloads about 140GB (90GB old files + 50 GB new files) and needs 250GB of space to uncompress.Totally awesome.Fix your installer... geez."
Negative,"Like all other Bethesda products, this has been a major letdown. All you do is manage items and desperately try to increase your inventory... what a family-friendly fun! Makes you wonder if they will ever manage to produce a fun RPG."
Negative,"TLDR: Games performance is terrible. People that say PC runs better than console are only half correct. Ping/FPS are NOT the same thing. FPS is good on PC with a monster rig in large scale fights. The PING still sucks and skills/combat abilities DO NOT WORK. The platform you play on has ZERO effect on this. You connect to the same servers as everyone else. The PvE is not like other Elder Scrolls games. Choice means nothing and has zero effect. The difficulty is trivial since One Tamriel.Here is a short history to validate my rating/recommendation. I have played this game since release. I have a combined 3,000+ CP (champion points), which is the end game leveling system between 3 platforms (PC NA&EU and Xbox NA). I have always played every class Stamina and Magic for PvP, and have had dedicated Tanks, Healers, and DPS for PvE. I was once a small content creator specializing in non meta PvP builds that could comepete/beat the meta builds. I have completed all content minus certain Hard Modes that I do not want to spare time for progression on due to my personal lust for PvP. If you left this game for any reason do not come back, things are not better and have zero trend that they will get better any time soon. The games servers have gotten so bad that PvP is a ghost town in non active hours or ""prime time"". PvP population caps have been reduced to the point that even when population locked finding fights away from Zergs is nearly impossible. Que system for Battlegrounds and Dungeons has never worked properly. ***BEST PART*** They are now 8-9/12 months into performance improvement plans and the game runs worse than ever. Even PvE players are having lag in dungeons/raids. Their last 4 months of ""improvements"" still have no wordage suggesting a lag decrease either. I used to tell people despite its flaws it is the best MMO on the market and they should give it a try. For over a year now I have not been able to say that. Their complete ignorance to the cries from the player base over the last year has made me disgusted with every member of the team. Balance, MTXs, none of it matters. I can move and evolve with it all. PERFORMANCE however I cant evolve with. If something doesnt work it just doesnt work and they have left me this way for far to long. I do not appreciate being treated this way nor does anyone else that is a long time supporter of this game. After playing this game for so long and falling completely head over heals with the combat I am stuck coming back time and time again. I just cant recommend any one else being brought into this current disaster though."
Negative,"I'm am going to point out some pros and cons of the game and explain shortly what I felt while beeing around 80 hours into the game.  And yes it shows 158 hours but the game time also counts when only the launcher is open in the background.I reached lvl 50 on one of my characters and peeked a little into the endgame content. I have also tried out some other classes but was still low level.Pros:- Story compared to other MMO-rpg is really worth playing. Mainquest are usually interesting and explain the lore of Elder Scrolls well.- Character customisation.- Crafting: Really Interesting system where you can make money really quick and also can do some daily money in reasonable time. It doesnt feel grindy instead it was fun for me.- graphics/design: World and characters look really pretty- Livelyhood of game community: Plenty of active players and up to date guides/content availableCons:- Class identity. I started out with mage and felt it was kind of boring. Switched to templar and felt the same again. Reason for this is that every class basicly has only 3 different skill lines while everyone is able to heal/tank/dps. This leads to that problem that due to the shared skill-lines all classes kinda feel the same. (my templar could basicly heal/dps/tank in normal dungeon runs)- Combat system. Hitting opponents in this game feels like you hit them with wet noodles. There is no feedback and even ultimates have really low impact. Normal skills have no cooldown and you basicly only count the debuff timer until u cast them again while spamming ur dps skills and doing light attacks in between. Doing those light attacks will increase ur dps and cancel the animation of ur skills but it feels like a chore and looks really ugly. Here you can see the engine getting old... While skyrim could be modded to help out here alot, this game will always stay like this.- Crown store: Yes you can get the basegame and Elweyr on steam on sale but the rest of the content (around 80%) are locked behind crownstore where every DLC costs around 20$. So either be sure to get ESO+ membership or take out a few hundred $ out of ur pocket. Simple things like changing character looks is also charged for 10$.- Inventory management: Few hours into the game you will have to either start skipping half of the item drops or getting ESO+ membership for the crafting bag. Crafting ingredient number into the hundred while ur inventory space is capped to 140 (+60 with horse upgrades which takes 60days to get those) and is really expensive to get. The inventory also looks like a bad console port and is really hard to keep up/sorted. Even with ESO+ membership (which i had for 1month) I had to go back to sell every 2nd dungeon run.- Dungeon: I didnt get into veteran dungeons but the normal dungeons where really a let down. In addition to the bad combat system you basicly only fight tons of mobs. There is so little boss-fights and they end in around 20 sec since high levels grind here and destroy game experience for everyone doing runs here. Even without high levels the dungeons were so easy you couldnt die even with 1-2 players missing just that it took longer.- Guilds: You can join up to 5 player guilds which is already the first flaw for me. Most of the guilds are just joined to gain access to the guild trader (since there is no auction house) and require you to sell a certain amount of gold per day. Smaller guild dont have a guild trader at all and you cant sell your stuff which is already piling up in ur too small inventory. This leads to the problem that 500 player guild get the best traders (since the guilds have to bid against each other to get them) and you basicly have no identity in such giant guilds while small guilds are left behind. For me there was a missing guild identity other than a step in auction house.The reason I stopped playing was mostly because of the bad combat system. While exploring the world and the story was really fun, every time I fought it felt really lacking. The other cons I could live with (maybe I even experienced something wrong) but ultimatly the combat system is something that can never be overhauled in the depth it needs to be a good game."
Negative,"Dear,game looks great, crafting is super, fight system is good, lore and voice acting is fenomenal but game doesnt work well, it has baby problems. ZOS is doin a very shit job on game performance. Guys that do balance changes do a lot of cocaine mixed with something. Constant lags, like pvp area is unplayable when a lot players in same area, dungeon finder is bad (when its working), creeps go into walls keeping u in combat so u cant swap gear or skills, bosses overlaping or doesnt do mechaincks at all. I canceled my +membership cause i dont wanna pay anymore for forever uncomplete product."
Negative,"I've been playing for a while and so far it is a decent game with one HUGE annoying problem and it is clearly a problem that they put in the game intentionally.  Your inventory holds a number of items rather then a certain amount of weight like in other Elder Scroll games.  That's no big deal, right?  Lots of RPG's give you inventory slots instead of going by weight.  Except there are an absurd amount of items you need to collect if you want to do any enchanting, make potions or poisons, make weapons or armor, cook food, make jewelry, etc.  Even only focusing on doing just one of these activities my inventory space is jammed full before I'm even halfway done doing a single quest so I have to constantly decide what I want to throw away so I can pick up the next item to see if it is any good.  They know this and have a solution; a magic bag that can store infinite amount of items ingredients.  What's the catch?  You can only acquire it by paying the monthly subscription of $15 a month and the bag goes away if you cancel the subscription.Sure, you get some other stuff with your monthly subscription but lets be real.  If you are getting a subscription it is for the bag.So I'll be honest, I'm going to keep playing the game for now since I bought the game but if I had known that they had engineered things this way before I bought it I never would have purchased the game.."
Negative,Incredible that 6 years old mmo can have this shit servers which kinda ruin anything good game has it going -.-
Negative,Not worth the monthly subscriptions
Negative,"Cancelled M1 Support, unplayable for Macs with ARM64."
Negative,i dont want to buy crowns
Negative,The game seems nice enough but it is predatory as others have mentioned.
Negative,"This game is a grind. If you dont like lore, or dont know the lore this game wont likely be fun. I tried to play enough to get into the game, but sadly its a bunch of fetch quests and hitting cardboard cuttouts of enemies with toy swords. I couldnt even return it because of the extra long loading times, and after closing it I noticed (after like half an hour) it said I was still playing it on steam so i had to close it using task manager. The first person camera made me want to puke because the FOV was too low. It is really annoying when your backpack is full beacause there isnt an easy way of ""destroying"" items."
Negative,"Couldn't even get it to start, after over 100GB of download the game would crash every single time whenever I click the PLAY button and am met with a FATAL ERROR message. I've tried probably all the fixes out there and still couldn't get it to work. My laptop: HP Pavilion 15 (i5 9300H, GTX 1650, 16GB 2666mhz). Certainly not worth my time. Refunded."
Negative,"Don't buy this.This game is like a LaCroix of an elder scrolls game, a hint of a hint of elder scrolls game where the can has an ES theme.Most of the map is locked off unless you buy the expansion or have the subscription.It will keep reminding you of the things you can do if you had the subscription.Which is annoying, I suppose you dont need one like it says in the game summary, but without the subscription its like trying to remove popcorn kernals from between your teeth with only your tongue.But, if you want to see how you can piece up a watered down ES game for dlc or subsciption, check it out.After some more intel gathering: every micro transaction item cost 10x more than it should imo."
Negative,"Servers are shit, game is decent but I can't play it in my region without significant latency. A major disappointment since most other major MMO's have oceanic servers and run fine. Glad I got it on sale and only spent $40 on it."
Negative,"The Least interesting version of an Elder Scrolls game, TESO brings up everything that makes the other games in the franchise awesome and turns it into the most generic MMORPG the north has ever seen. Go alone or with (serious game issues) your friends in a GRAND ADVENTURE, full of dull and boring environments populated by extremely tedious NPCs and a ton of repetitive combat, grinding, over-complicated mechanics and other archaic features!""Playing TESO is like reading a book about the lore of the Elder Scrolls.... after you played the games, you know what's up, but you are not really living it"" (Sum Fuker, 2016) Relive your favorite game styles! like choosing any (pre-determined)class, weapon or equipment you want.... except of course, if you want to play seriously, if that's the case then you have to create your character like this, this and use that and you have to grind every piece of equipment for 30 Hrs each at least... but HEEEEYYY, CREATIVITY AND FREEDOM!Travel all around Tamriel (on foot) and meet the same NPCs with different (poorly) voice acted stories that are as dumb as the first time you played your generic MMORPG (looking at you WoW)""Oh most wondrous warri'r, thee and only thee (along with around a thousands other ""unique"" warriors) art the only desire f'r ye olde kingdom!"" (Average RPG, since Ever)Embark yourself into this grand journey that has everything that everyone wanted... ever....but not the way they wanted it. 6/10"
Negative,"Bland and boring, but it IS the Elder Scrolls.4/10"
Negative,"The game itself seems actually nice, but I have to say that a 3 day lasting login error that prevents people from playing deserves a negative review."
Negative,"Oh now i know why this game was so cheap. I have played it years ago and saw it was cheap on Steam. I entered userID when asked if I had played the game before.. It was invalid. Then I made a new  and did all the numerous things they want me to, and the  continue button is greyed out. Oh AVG apparently think the game is a virus. I allow. Try again, the same, continue button is greyed out. Start again, this time I don't have to do all this, I can pretty fast make a new account and enter my mailaddress. And is told the email address I use every day is invalid. I've spent over half an hour on this bull. Refunded.Actually, while writing this, i think the same things happened years ago when I last tried to make an account, That was why my password consisted of a lot of F words, F this, my patience has grown thinner over the years and there are lots of other games."
Negative,"Probably getting old.Even on ultra, visuals are ok but also nothing to stare at.Combats are basics and repetitive. Playing alone, you enter a dungeon and in less than 5mn it is full of people. Looking at them, it is probably the 14th times they grind the place. Trying to get stealth become useless since they are bullying everything.A lot of talks with NPC. Animations are average. Transition between scenes are really not exciting...It feels open corridors for the few I played.I'll probably give a longer shot but I do not feel excited at all...Coming here after playing Conan, I just want to return in the Exiles lands...There is definitely better than this,"
Negative,"There are always login problems via Steam - players don't get this if you go direct through the elder scrolls website. It's actually a really good game, if you ever get to play it. Unfortunatley, via Steam I only see a login screen then - connection failure. Constant issues which are NEVER addressed by Steam, you have to go via ZOS the game developers and they just say ""we are in conversation with Steam regarding the login issues"". Even on the actual game the lag is real, especially in the Player vs Player area of the game which can be very frustrating. The Story is really good and the look of the game and content is second to none.Buy something else - and not via Steam!!"
Negative,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THROUGH STEAM!!! :(
Negative,Constantly cannot log in to the game. Sad!
Negative,"This game is literally unplayable. I decided to come back after a break and it keeps crashing. My drivers are updated, the game's integrity was verified, the settings were reset and nothing. The game is a solid 0/10."
Negative,"Login from Steam hardly working. Most of the time a connection timeout.Players who bought it from the official Bethesda store are fine.Also, players who bought it at a certain point years ago can log in trough the launcher itself without steam.ALL NEW PLAYERS(like me) ARE ONLY ABLE TO LOG IN TROUGH STEAM.I can not recomment to buy this game on steam at this moment and Bethesda ""is working on it""."
Negative,light attack weaving.
Negative,Maybe I don't understand MMOs.  I found it rather boring.
Negative,"Enjoyed the gameplay at first. Made some friends and found out PvP is basically non-existent. Bought 1 month of ESO membership and got charged for two. Non refundable. Waste of money and time, would not recommend."
Negative,"It's a shame that after so many patches ZOS did nothing to improve Necromancers in PVP.  It's a weakest PVP class for several years. Moreover the coming changes that were announced in the Update 41 will make necro's life in PVP even harder since ZOS decided to cut ""stalking blastbones"" skill - the most usable Necro damage skill. Generally it seems that ZOS team doesn't pay attention to PVP at all cause there were no any improvements or innovations to PVP regimes or maps for years. Classes in PVP are unbalanced. They keep making strong classes even stronger and Necros weaker.I think I'm going to drop this game and find something more PVP balanced and PVP oriented MMORPG."
Negative,I dont like the combat thus I do not play this anymore.I dont see the appealsorry
Negative,this is 2nd time i played this game both times i left for few months to come back to find my account disappeared. So had to start again
Negative,"If I had known that I'd have to pay a subscription fee to enjoy the full game, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place.This is just a milking scheme, where you just pay every month for no real content and you don't get the new DLCs anyway; try convincing anyone that it is a fair deal."
Negative,"so with the latest greatest update 35 the game isn't fun now and player base has noticeably dropped in zones as the new meta is just so tedious. even zone chat isn't about the new features, people are talking about other mmo's to go to as eso devs have killed the game, every update is a player killer latest update 41 makes pvp unplayable lagfest.heres a hint if you have 10 year old bugs since launch of eso, maybe the devs that have been here since launch shouldnt still be here!"
Negative,"Forgot to add a review about the game ages ago. I played for about 10 hours, at the end of my play time I realised that you need MEMBERSHIP TO CRAFT. So, I payed for a game, expecting a basic mechanic such as crafting to be available, but that is not the case. This is when I quit the game. I'm not paying a single penny to this company called Bethesda anymore. What a sour taste to leave in your mouth."
Negative,"Game seemed fun until I ran into the lock-pick mechanic.  I did multiple tasks in a quest chain, only to be thwarted by a simple door lock.  It left me frustrated enough to stop playing the game.  Many other games have challenging mechanics, but they all have meaning.  This was a simple door lock that made me lose interest in the game."
Negative,Stack on load screen for past 30 min... Try'd all fixes i could find online... from restart to uninsall to verify... game wont get of LOAD SCREEN... Cant recommend it with this issue... Will change raing when they fix game
Negative,I recently buy this game with all the Expansions but for some reason i cant use the portals only any advise on how to use them or why it happens ?
Negative,"u need to pay a lot for DLCs,or u have to keep paying for membership.and if you don't buy membership,your report will take no reply"
Negative,"Pros : - Very lore rich for any elder scrolls fan. You get to visit all the different regions in Tamriel in a single game which is great. In terms of visuals also the zones looks great with the art style, - Story quests are fully voiced and some characters are very memorable.- The player housing system is very good!- The combat has good depth with various actives and passives, i can see it expanding very well in the end game.  Any class can use any weapons which was also good to experiment with different weapons and then choose one. - The amount of content - guilds, antiquities, lore hunting, achievements, dungeons, world events , side quests, zones etc is huge ! - Crafting system is very well implemented. - Trading of items with friends/other player is very simple and easy to use. Cons : - While the combat depth was good, the actual combat flow - animations, sound feedback, visual feedback was very lacking and clunky. The poor performance of fps and latency spikes only made things worse.- The game is consolised with only 5 active skills which feels so restricting for a mmo.- While voice acting for story is great, many of the quests i did were just straight up talking to people for 30+ minutes without any combat which got really tedious. - Playing with friends was not a good experience, we were doing same quests in skyrim and some time the progress only happened for one of us. Some quest items were given to only one of us which was very confusing. On top of that we cant share our waypoints with friends also. - I came across very few players roaming around outside of cities, either something is wrong with the sharding system or there is simply no incentive for players to roam around the world after completing quests. Because there was no dynamic events or anything like that. Most of the time i felt like playing a single player game.- The monetisation model is not of good value. There is base game purchase , expansion purchase, dlc chapters purchase. The dlc chapters can be got through ESO+ subscription among other benefits. Apart from that there is also microtransactions !!! - Inventory is pain in the ass for new players, without ESO plus subscription crafting mats don't have separate inventory. So even though game don't need subscription its a painful experience without subscription. - Why does the game start me in the latest DLC chapter ? I was doing skyrim quests for a long time thinking it was main quest, didnt even know there was an actual main quest, faction city etc etc. The story was very random and i couldn't follow many characters because i wasnt aware and did not play main quest. IMO there should be a prologue in the faction city then players should be informed about main quest and dlc quest paths. ( This is a one-time issue, but still makes the new player experience bad).Overall while the game has lot of good things going on but even more bad things too. Now I know the same argument for MMOs - ""ENDGAME IS BETTER"". But for me personally if its this much of a boring trip to get to the end game then its not worth. The biggest problem for me was It just felt like a single player elder scrolls game with coop , not much a social MMO experience. World felt empty and lifeless.If you have same preferences as me then definitely not worth buying.If you want the mmo structure and a mostly solo play game this might be the ""mmo"" for you."
Negative,I contacted ESO Customer support several times already but still no resolution. I'm a returning player and after a year of not playing I encountered this bug where it's showing I have 10 mails but when you open the mailbox it's empty. Now I can't receive items from players stating that my mailbox is full. I can't even buy from guild shops bec I won't receive the item bec of the said bug. this is really game breaking now all I do w/ the game is login just to check if it's already been fixed. this is really frustrating for me.
Negative,"This game is complete dog shit, the way point system sucks and ive yet to experience any ""MMO"" aspects. Its a shit ""MMO"" with an elders scrolls tag slapped on it, do not buy."
Negative,"Couldn't log in. Got stuck on the requesting login screen. Only way to fix was to run steam as an administrator which just logged me in as my brother. 65$ thrown away on *literally* nothing... great...*EDIT*So a few days after posting this review, the problem fixed itself somehow. I'm not sure why it wasn't working, but it did. So I did end up playing it. Overall, I'd say I actually quite like it. It's fun and I like that good portions of the game are single player friendly. My fun is probably diminished by my nerves, so I have a hard time communicating with other players. Nevertheless, it's fun. Assuming it works for you, then maybe you'll have fun. It plays like an odd mixture of Skyrim and normal MMORPGs, so yeah..."
Negative,"If you like shopping at in-game stores, then this is the game for you. If you enjoy adventures, then wait for ES VI.EDIT: I'd also like to point out that the loot-crate mechanics are ABSOLUTELY designed to take advantage of children who think that mr. friendly neighborhood khajiit drug-dealer is cool. All of the cool kids are buying these loot crates and look how much fun they're having! I can't believe that Bethesda can put their name on this atrocious product. It's disgusting how deeply their greed has permeated through this game. Almost everything has been monitized. I will never buy another game from Bethesda, EVER."
Negative,"It could be a good game, but I was never able to log in and actually play it to find out.  I click play and I get errors and it crashes.  I just want to play the game, not spend hours trouble shooting it.  Refunding because if I can't get past 'Play' I don't have much faith in them."
Negative,I can not express the amount of depression this has cause me. I have played 100 hours and I still want to die. My experience has not been limited to only the base game but the enitre game *(including dlc). I have spent 300 dollars on dlc alone and my experience at all. 4/11Would not recomendGave me LupisAcually that may have been the 17 dollar hooker I got last night Amen my christian Klan.
Negative,Can't even play! Error 334 lost lobby connection every time I try to login in to play
Negative,"If you are looking for an MMO with solid endgame, this isn't it. The cost of subscribing or buying DLC for this game just isn't worth the mediocre experience."
Negative,The game is ridiculously expensive and I have given up my membership!Membership fees in Argentina have directly increased 17 times!
Negative,turning into a money grab as with many of the triple A titles out there.Game play is fast and energetic.it's a public game and like all public games you have to watch what you say. they will suspend you. Fair warning before you dump alot of time into it. i really tried but alas no dice this games dead. Except for the diehards...moving on
Negative,"Won't let me use the Bethesda account I already had set up for PS4, so I created a brand new account just for PC, got kicked out of the character creator, and now there's a server error when I try logging back into my account. So from the 0.4 hrs I got to spend in the main menu, my takeaway is that this is complete garbage. Wait for ES6."
Negative,"Played this game for a while and it was fine, I actually had a lot of fun. Then, I decide to re-install it, I can no longer even get into the game since the launcher grays out the 'play' button when I press it and nothing happens."
Negative,"Played this game for years, sick of coming back and everything being revamped, skills, cp, combat, nothing stays the same. Don't waste your time building a character that will be wiped clean continuously.EDITED: Try Elden Ring, literally very similiar atmosphere, has all the online multiplayer you're looking for, and its a REAL challenge, its like Elder Scrolls, if it grew up, and bonus; i dont have to be afraid of my character being completely wiped clean after putting time into it. Literally, it became my new Elder Scrolls and its way better! :)"
Negative,"ESO had its fair share of problems over the years some they fix some they dont.The straw that broke the old camels backSad to see what they done to  this game over 3300 hours  to get to level 812 and now its changed to 3600.Seen lots of info about the new content they want us to buy , but nothing about this . Oh well I ended my Sub not that it means anything to them .I feel that old Skyrim spark died today for me"
Negative,"ive played 2200 hours into this game, they have removed the option to gift crowns so now those who pay get the best looking items in the game without buying crowns you will have the most basic cosmetics out there its not pay to win but its not fair that no matter how many hours you invest into the game without giving real money toward the crown store you will look very basic throughout your gameplay"
Negative,Pay 2 Win Garbage
Negative,"20 million different ways to spend money before you even created your first character , this game is a pathetic excuse of a lottery system"
Negative,"I used to love this game,  played for 2400 hours through Steam then because of connection issues,   started running the game .exe direct outside of Steam, so probably another 4000 hours on top of that.The latest Necrom expansion is uninspiring  just rehashed old content, full of bugs with the same old tired story lines.The ESO Plus membership is overpriced but the game is a chore to play without it due to lack of bottomless crafting bag and XP boost. Update in response to Developer Bethesda_Kraken's reply below, as they have comments disabled.Thank you for taking the time to respond to my review.I already have an active support ticket for current Necrom issues and the support team responses have  been less then helpful."
Negative,"With how overpriced everything in the crown store is compared to any other game, not to mention all the bonuses you get for paying a monthly fee(including crowns), the fact that these scum developers also want you to pay that monthly fee for QoL updates such as a materials bag, I definitely do not recommend this heaping pile of garbage of a game by super money hungry devs for a mediocre as hell MMO.This is not even to mention the horrible spaghetti code this game runs off of. Bugs are going to happen constantly, such as being kicked from dungeons frequently the moment you get joined into a party. Not worth the price, and DEFINITELY not worth the laughable prices in the store.. ($50 for a mount LOL)Do yourself a favor and skip this garbage."
Negative,I'm just deleting my comment the game is working fine now ty.
Negative,"Boring quests, lame abilities, and lifeless atmosphere. This game is fucking painful"
Negative,"Literally the worst MMO I have played. I wrote a wall of text describing everything I felt that could deter yourself from this game, but the list was so long I couldn't bring myself to let you read it. So, Ill cut it short:-Predatory asf Store-Buy the game, but need to spend at least $345 for all the DLCs (Story and dungeon content) OR forced to pay sub--------Storyline is not linear and you have to research how to enjoy the game as it was meant to be-Max your mount takes 6 months (Speed/Stamina/Inv Space all 60days each)-Literally get stuck everywhere for no reason.-Buggy asf with some skills like Warewolf or Vamp-Good luck enjoying the story for dungeons. Veteran players skip all the content and you are forced to que up again if you miss something for the quests or dailiy Pledges)-No game that needs addons is good. Literally needs 50+ addons to make the game better/easier/QoL-Crafting will take you an eternity for 1 piece of armor (At max you can research 1 trait to 3 pieces at a time.) To research all 9 traits, it takes at least 3066 hours in research time (if you are diligent and don’t forget to research when timers are up). That is 127 days to max out 1 piece of armor. -The player market is convoluted and requires teleporting all around the world to find the cheapest item. Again, another add-on you are forced to snag AND you have to use a webpage (that is never updated in real time) to use. -Vet players are clicky asf and guild force you to sell stuff because the guild gets a portion of your profits. (Granted some guilds are chill, but are far and few in between to find them)-Lvling system is dumb and the playstyle of a character gets boring once you max out to 50.-PvP... ugh, if you are into pvp, just walk back now. I dont even want to get into this section.-Fashion is locked behind a paywall or tons of grinding. Even dye is locked behind achievements and the ones in the store ($1 each) are a 1 time use!-Combat is pretty bad and Tanks have NO AOE TAUNT LOL HAHAHAHA! I will say some skills are real pretty though, but get old really fast. Honestly, I tried my hardest to give this game an honest try, but couldnt for the life of me enjoy it. Its such a shitty game and only those people that have spent thousands on it will defend it because lets be real, you want to justify the reason you spent so much on it. I literally had 0 fun playing, but did meet 2 or 4 cool people, but overall, its not worth it. Also.. $150 for a house is ridiculous!"
Negative,dont buy this it is a waist since you have to pay the full price then over priced memberships that are very short
Negative,100 GB for game like this ! No tnx!
Negative,mega trash lol
Negative,"I bought and refunded this game years ago, I might fully buy it later, but so far I have no use for buying it."
Negative,"Tried to get this game working for over 3 hours - sadly didn't. If I knew about Steam's policy of a 2-hour cutoff for a refund, I would have stopped trying earlier. Costly lesson learnt."
Negative,This review will not be deleted until the Crown Gift is back. How do you expect players to trade gold with crowns now ESO?
Negative,too bad no asia server
Negative,"I somehow played this on PS4, didnt like it. Got it on Xbox when Morrowind expac dropped, didn't like it. Then for some reason tried to give it another shot with a different friend on PC, didn't like it. Combat is very meh. The world is honestly TOO large, as a completionist trying to do all the non repeatable quests is a miserable experiance. I did every non repeatable quests in 2 WoW expacs before I quit, Runescape, FFXIV, New World and Guild Wars 2 (not really quests but I completed the whole map several times) but there are probably thousands of quests in ESO so trying to do them all is a fools errand. But map clutter drives me insane so I did it anyways. (tried to anyways). Dungeons are fine, World content is kinda trash and I didnt even try the PvP."
Negative,"I've been playing this game for more than 2 years now, and I loved every second of it. But ever since the latest update came out, my ping on the NA server has shot to 600-999+, making it completely unplayable. It takes me 10 seconds to register any action I do.I created a new character on the EU server to check the ping and its fine on that. But the problem is that you can't transfer your progress from NA to EU, so I'll need to play the complete game from scratch if I switch servers.After creating 5 different characters with different builds for every type of in-game activity on the NA server, I don't think I have the patience to do it all over again.If there's no fix soon, then it will be the end of my ESO journey."
Negative,this game suck ass ngl
Negative,"this game good, but i hate this game. because i purchase ESO first release and don't have free The Morrowind Chapter, free The Morrowind Chapter only for new buyer! FVCK"
Negative,not as good as skyrim
Negative,"So not only is almost every skin behind a paywall, but they are now stealing fan art an selling it in their crown store. Until this is rectified, I will not give ZOS another dollar of my money."
Negative,"There is too much server lag and the game is filled with toxic people. There are many sets in the game that do not require skill to use, so good luck ! The crown store is way overpriced as well."
Negative,"A myriad of content to quest for hundreds of hours. A few hours to level new character 1-50, a few days to get proper gear from pvp or pve. Weeks/months worth of time farming champion point upgrades.. Meta skill rotation can depend on season, making setups more or less viable based on ZOS whim. Season's rotate every few months. A haven for people who just want to get into game, pick whatever task, level it, sell the spoils via guild trade, farm enough gold for a house, decorations, pets, gear.. Top end raid content fluctuates with update season. Item sets, class, and weapon abilities frequently forgo extensive revisions; making veterans rebuild characters, gear, and rotation sets from ground up. Perfect for casual player looking for some light pve/pvp, skilling, questing, farming a few items on side. Takes awhile to accumulate necessary champion points, collect proper gear, build a skill rotation to be any good. Sometimes to play for few weeks till ZOS kills your loadout, then you start from zero."
Negative,Best requesting login simulator 2018IGN timed-out/11
Negative,"Greediest game I played, everything about you sinking as much time as you can sloging through rng mechanics never to get what you want,"
Negative,"Lame unbalanced game, worst way to waste your money"
Negative,Wanna get kicked from server constantly in the middle of dungeons and trials? Play ESO.
Negative,"My actual playtime is far, far less than indicated as just having the launcher open counts up playtime. I really like Elder Scrolls lore. I find the world fascinating and exciting, and this game explores a period of it that was largely barren in the lore before its release. For me, it was worth playing once every year or two when the DLCs go on sale just to experience the story. This game is not, however, a good game, although I suspect it is good for an MMO. I'm not really into the MMO genre as a whole; I briefly tried WoW and found it unenjoyable. I played GW2 and enjoyed it well enough, definitely the best of the MMOs I've played. I haven't tried FFXIV due to the high price of entry and my lack of any interest in the setting. But when evaluated as games, not as MMOs, I don't think any of these games can be evaluated as any better than average at best.I fullheartedly believe that this game would have been far better as a single player, or multiplayer co-op self hosted game. It does not benefit from being online, but it does suffer from it due to the incredibly high operation costs that come with online games with massive servers. This leads to the developer needing to implement obnoxious gameplay limitations (yes, the crafting bag) that lock a good gameplay experience behind a ridiculous paywall. ($18/mo CAD is insane for ESO Plus.) This results in intentionally compromised game design that punishes players for not paying a subscription that absolutely does not justify its own cost. Aggressive lootbox mechanics and cosmetic shops in a game you not only have to buy, but also pay a subscription for, are insane and unacceptable to me. I also have to criticise where the story has gone - that is to say, nowhere. The entire alliance war has been completely forgotten, and important characters totally ignored or underutilised. For some reason, the writers seem to prefer to introduce a bunch of new characters that show up essentially episodically rather than actually having character arcs or narratives. The entire premise of the game has really fallen by the wayside. In my view, the point of an MMO is getting to experience an evolving world over time, but ESO instead has content islands that are totally disconnected from each other. This is a flaw of most MMOs, but that doesn't excuse ESO; it just makes most MMOs also guilty. Destiny actually managed to do this really well up until recently, so it's not impossible.This game is not worth playing unless you are playing it for the story alone. It would be best with a friend or three with regular play sessions, but I know that's completely unrealistic for many people. I don't recommend it, and its failed potential makes it doubly frustrating."
Negative,"They made everything annoying to deal with if you dont pay them extra money. The game might be fun at end game but the leveling is an extremely tedious and dull experience. You kill everything in 1 second no matter what you do or use.The game wants you to waste your money, so they force you to waste your time if you don't. The only reason to play it would be for the story and the quests, but they're not exactly something to write home about so far."
Negative,"DO not buy ANy Bethesda games. YOU can ""ban"" my reviews but all it does is make me hate Bethesda even more. You just lost a 25 year customer. Go ahead and pretend that removing people reviews does something other then make you look like jack asses."
Negative,Keep getting kicked off servers.
Negative,developers like to ban people
Negative,Too many DLCs to pay and in game transaccion after you expend a lot for a full game
Negative,"I have had this game for over a year. I have upgraded pc's twice in that time (3 pcs) and I have never been able to get past the connection login screen. No reviews, no Bethesda Support, No Zenimax Support has helped. Waste of Money"
Negative,"Really want to get into this game but just like loads of the other comments, do not buy through steam!!! Constant connection problems and devs have next to no communication with it's players. Negative review until they fix this trash problem which honestly I can't see happening anytime soon, if ever."
Negative,i love this game i will continue to play this game but if u want this game you NEED to buy it through there websight the servers are not working on steam it its makeing me crazy game 10/10 steam 400 steaming piles of shit/400 steaming piles of shit
Negative,"I want Bethesda to know I just gave up on The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited.  First of all there is no Elder Scrolls to it.  It has no cohesive story line.  There is nothing about it that makes you feel special in the world of Tamriel unlike the other Elder Scroll games.Second of all, there is too much repetition without end.  I have played for 1052 hours and I haven't advanced in any of the skills like blacksmithing, alchemy, etc. passed the third level.I see the game as a way to make Bethesda a lot more money continuiously with no real goal or resolution ever offfered.  Houses without storage - all paid for separately - furniture you can never make because you can't skill up enough  in every skill to make them.  It is all too stupid and with little gradification."
Negative,"I could like the game but the queue system and the lack of improvements make it a terrible experience.Every time you want to join a battleground it will prompt you like 100 times in 2 minutes if you are ready to join and you have to be there to press F every damn time.After a while if you are really lucky you will get invited to a battleground that misses a few people. And the game is unable to fill those positions so the BG will never start.You wait like 5 minitues for a miracle then leave the BG, get a 20 minute deserter and throw your pc out of the window.And it has been like this since I got the game which was like 2 years ago.Dungeon works the same, but it only needs 4 ppl so its a bit better.Developers obviously not care about the player experince so I do not recommend the game."
Negative,"Game was great at its start back in 2014 but then it went trash on the membership restrictions so player needed to pay to get the full game (inventory restrictions, craft, ...) . Interfaces went completely wrong too with plenty of menu screens that look horrible. So sad to see that such game turn to be bad after all..."
Negative,I killed the wolf and looted the corpse - wild wolf's corpse contained an axe.. Ok
Negative,"It's fun until you realize that all your level ups and progression don't actually make you stronger, they just keep you on par with the enemies since all the leveling is relative."
Negative,Not for me i guess kinda boring and confusing. And yes i finished skyrim
Negative,"2/10got hooked by the trailer(s) - oh what a scam!1) if you want deep character development, customization or unique gameplay (e.g. provided by specialized skills for every class) AVOID at all cost: the game doesnt have it; all classes feel the same (a fact which gets even more absurd if you take into consideration that there arent even that many classes)2) the game is almost unplayable without addons which are developed and provided by the community, just to cancel out major flaws the game itself has. Those arent getting worked on or getting implemented by the game devs which is quite a shame - in fact they cancel out / deny a lot of addon-features and destroy the motivation of engaged communitymembers!(fun fact: a lot of those addons are just basics in modern MMO's like a functional auction house or efficent and comfortable quick-travel or just a useable HUD. this freak*** game doesnt even have a (optional) HUD! devs say ""we want to keep our game clean"" )3) graphics are ok tho4) ""so why are you still playing you dumb f***?"" - very very good question. im just a poor pot-committed doggo with to much hope for a creative change of the game even if there is no reason :( (should have played final fantasy...they have real creative and diversified content over there)edit: there are so many flaws in this game, so i will go to continuously update this rant listing the major ones which come to my attention. stay tuned- no way to inspect other players (which is quite absurd: this game is so much about cosmetic items and optic individualisation and having no way to look at other players is just ridiculous)- tab targeting is not working in pve (but works well in pvp as a wallhack :) )-expensive : this game doesnt stop after you payed your entry fee(=bought the base game) ; ""optional"" premium subscription is not optional if you intent to use the crafting system because without the ""neverful bag"" provided by 10,50-13€/month crafting is just a pain in t** ***(if not just impossible because you spent 99% of your time with inventory tetris trying to store all materials) ; furthermore lots of dlc-areas and content are behind a paywall ; funny and absurdly enough you even have to pay for those if you have the premium subscriptionbecause it only makes all dlc free EXCEPT the latest, so if you want to enjoy the current content you have to pay. every. time.(=several times a year)"
Negative,"DO NOT BUY this, this is NOT Elder Scrolls, this is a reskinned WoW with a little Elder Scrolls thrown in, all designed from the ground up to be a money grab and pay to win. In no way shape or form does this feel or even fit as an Elder Scrolls game. Its a pay to win MMO masquerading as an Elder Scrolls Game. Not even worth the money if on sale"
Negative,Another boring MMORPG.
Negative,"So sad that I decided to uninstall this,but somehow I can't play without a VPN, and that resulted in unfavorable ping numbers. I saw that this problem occurs not only for me but also a handful of others, and no solution in sight. Zenimax isn't doing enough IMO, or maybe a handful of player just aren't worth it for them. It's a good game, but sadly I can't play it nor can I recommend it based on my experience."
Negative,"Couldnt get the game to work at all. Reviews are showing that the reason it was cheap on steam is the lack of support.What a HUGE letdown as I was finally getting around to experiencing this game. Unfortunately companies seem to be paying 3rd party companys to develop their games and better yet, to support them. So there is no true Bethesda experience here except the characters and lore.After a full day of troubleshooting, all I have to say is Bethesda can keep their garbage. Dont even accept this as a gift."
Negative,This is a game that has been out for five years. Installing it takes about 120 GB of disk space. And trying to play it is a buggy mess where you suddenly can't interact with the environment and get thrown out at random!? Just... Crikey.
Negative,Game is great. If your only interest is PvE content. Open world is nearly unplayable. Constant crashing! PvP in open world is supposed to be end game where you spend you hundreds of hrs. in my opinion. Doing dungeons is great but it gets old and sometimes youll crash in a dungeon too.  I look forward to this game often but then it straight up doesnt work and i turn my PC off cuz theres nothing else like it out there. What a bummer! FIX OPEN WORLD PVP PLEASE! Its the best thing about the game.
Negative,how many time do you want to pay for a game?
Negative,This game is absolutely massive (100GB disk space) for what?? It's ugly and has shit performance. Immediately hated the play experience and will not be playing again.
Negative,"I want to give this a thumbs up, but the purchasing options need to be explained better. Crowns are an in-game currency that can only be received by purchasing crowns or ESO+ Sub on steam. One crown is worth 1-10 cents USD when not on sale. Gold Road offers Necrom, High Isle, Blackwood, Greymoor, Elsweyr, Summerset, and Morrowind. And scribing ability.The following DLCs are not shown on steam. Deadlands - 2,000Ascending Tide - 1,500Dark Brotherhood - 2,000Dark Heart of Skyrim - 2,000Dragon Bones - 1,500Dragonhold - 2,000Firesong - 2,000Flames of Ambition - 1,500Gates of Oblivion - 3,500Guilds and Glory - 4,000Harrowstorm - 1,500Horns of reach - 1,500Lost Depths - 1,500Markarth - 2,000Murkmire - 2,000Orsinium - 3,000Scale Breaker - 1,500Scions of Ithelia - 1,500Scribes of Fate - 1,500Season of Dragon - 2,500Shadows of the Hist - 1,500Stonethorn - 1,500The Clockwork City - 2,000Thieves Guild - 2,000Waking Flame 1,500Wolfhunter - 1,500Wrathstone - 1,500Year Three Mega Pack - 3,500Year Two Mega Pack - 3,500Total DLC Quest and Map Availability - 61,500 crownsThe only other Items worth looking at are:Any Race Any Alliance - 2,00014 different Merchants Types That Player Can Summon - 5,000 Each3 different pets that upgrade inventory by 5 account wide - 1,200 Each.

Negative,it has wasps
Negative,Leaving a negative review until ZOS give me a way to migrate my xbox account to PC.I don't even own an xbox guys come on.
Negative,"I like almost every aspect of the game!The two aspects that I don’t like, however, are two very important things. It’s way too easy and the combat makes me want to never want to fight anything.As I’m writing this review, my companion Bastion (some random helper I picked up from a regular quest) is soloing entire packs of respawning mobs whilst also healing us both. I’m like level 21. It never feels like I’m getting a stronger and it’s not even difficult to quest with no gear on. The combat is also quite shit. Attacks hit when they shouldn’t and don’t hit when they should, targeting is a pain in the ass on controllers, every single ability in the game looks lame, and all the classes are really boring. A class system like Albion Online would make so much more sense in this game.There’s also no in-game player item market. Or at least I haven’t seen one yet 🤷"
Negative,"This company will scam you out of money. She can ban your TECO account without giving any reason without an objective explanation. With the same success as they accuse me of some kind of “violation” without specifying the reason. I can say that their employees are molesting young children. And they need to be planted. The support does not explain anything and does not even try to understand the situation and help me with this. For example, I didn’t log into the game for 2 weeks. And I don’t really understand why the database arrived, other than the unsubscribe “We regret to inform you that your account has been identified as being associated with activities and accounts that violate our terms of service, specifically the selling of in-game items for real-world currency""Where with whom and when - nothing is clear..."
Negative,"this game is a lie, it claims to be buy once and play forever yet its filled with payed dlc and premium content. it is a sales trap"
Negative,needs full steamdeck support asap!
Negative,"Pay to play, annoying dialogue UI, mediocre graphics... Overall disappointment."
Negative,oh my god this game is so lame.graphics are piss poor. story is so boring. it is so generic.this game was given to me as i gift and i would like to give the money back to my friend as it such a disappointment
Negative,"FIX YOUR SHOP SYSTEM Scammin ass game, got deluxe necrom pack now gotta do stupid bs to get necromancer character"
Negative,"I just cannot get passed the ""why so many quests"" part.I have ignored this game since it came out and only now in 2024 i went for it after all, knowing that i might not enjoy the 80k quests that it will bombard u with.the last 4 days i been trying to accept no new quest and finish the 25 i had on the list, btw, 25 is max quests u can have active at any time. and i have to admit i keep failing it. either i am not paying enough attention or every quest is giving me a sequel quest and they just wont let go. this alone is reason enough to quit and not look back and yet i keep coming back to it. but instead of playing, i quit it minutes after. so there may be something about the game i like, i guess but i cant figure out what it is. although most quests are short, like kill few guys or go pick this up or pick 3 mushrooms, it almost always ends up in doing more than that, and if it won't, the time it takes u to go there is a waste enough. not to mention, when u are there, u will get a sequel quest or find more enroute. so the circle is never broken.if u hate doing quests all day do NOT buy this or play it even if it is free.no way in hell i can recommend this game despite the love for the genre."
Negative,"OK, so I bought the game a fair while ago and really enjoyed it, and even used my ingame gold to trade for world expansion access with other players.  It was quite fun, and while it had a MASSIVE cash shop, thankfully nothing that was actually vital for gameplay was locked in there.I haven't played in years, but there's one thing I MUST point out: the game now uses Epic Online Services, and as it's online only there is now no way to play the game without it.  This means that those of us who are (rightly so, given Tim Sweeney and his buddies at Tencent and their complete lack of ethics) paranoid about EOS having WAY too much access to files on our PCs and potentially being malware are basically stuck with a lemon of a game.HIGHLY recommend not buying the game at all if you care about privacy.  I pray for the day that someone who's a diehard fan of ESO just says ""screw it"" and ignores Bethesda's rules about modding assets from one of their games into another and just ports everything into either Skyrim, or for added ""screw you"" flavour, to OpenMW.  Also hope Skyrim Together gets more stable and compatible with mods, so that Bethesda's cash shop ridden multiplayer games are rendered pointless, or failing that someone just backports Skyrim and Oblivion into OpenMW in their entirety and then plays the game using the TES3MP fork for multiplayer gameplay."
Negative,"Fun with friends, but that is not much of a recommendation. Only serious Elder Scrolls fans will find lasting enjoyment from this MMO, seeing as how this game essentially weaponizes fan-service. I don't think Elder Scrolls lore buffs will find much enjoyment here, and someone who enjoys an Elder Scrolls game casually might have a good time here and there, but this is largely for people who breathe Elder Scrolls. Outside of that, there's nothing here that will make you a fan if you're not one already. The combat is pretty basic, even by MMO standards. On top of that, the story is pretty uninspired. Quests are certainly a fun distraction like every Elder Scrolls game, but also like every Elder Scrolls game, you'll eventually grow sick of side quests and try to find things on your own. The map is expansive, just begging for adventurers to uncover all its secrets, which is great. However, at that point you're playing a single player game, just with an MMO backdrop. Sure, the community is kind, I personally believe the Elder Scrolls fandom as a whole is pretty inviting and keeps things pretty lighthearted, but during my time in the game I didn't understand why I would want to party up and play with others, at least as far as the main and side quests are concerned.Everyone in your party can complete the same quest, but not at the same time, it's pretty distracting. Additionally, the story is paper thin to start and there's not much there to grab your interest and hold onto it. Immersion is quite hard when you're inundated with advertisements for in-game currency, and quality of life improvements such as unlimited inventory space are a real-life purchase, not an unlock. The Elder Scrolls Online is, in essence, a decently fun multiplayer Elder Scrolls game that's sandwiched between questionable MMO quest design and scummy MMO monetization practices. I love TES games, personally I hold Morrowind in high regard as one of the best games ever made, but I can't quite recommend this game unless you're willing to put up with a bunch of nonsense getting between you and your fun. It's definitely a fun experience for fans if they're willing to put up with some of the genre's misgivings, however I feel cynical towards this game as a whole.It feels like a pretty standard MMO that's wearing the carved-off flesh of a beloved open world RPG franchise that, at this point, is practically dead. Keep in mind: Skyrim released 13 years ago, and we're not even close to the release of Elder Scrolls VI. What this game has done, in function, is satisfy the fanbase's hunger for a new Elder Scrolls game. It does this by dancing, a not-too-original routine, and kicking the dead body behind the curtain in hopes that we don't realize this dancer is not all that great at what they're doing, and we'd much rather have that stand-up comedian come back on stage. After all, it's what we came for."
Negative,"I do NOT recommend ESO or ESO+. Old crap servers that kick you out of game for no reason, countless times i couldn't log on for hours at a time, they only release new content to hide the fact they can't fix existing problems with the game. Many players have quit for these reasons, i'm not far behind being i cancelled my ESO+."
Negative,do not buy this game it will consume 10 hours of your life every day... good game though
Negative,"This year I finally decided to try MMOs, as I like the TES lore I decided to give it a try. Just Terrible.This is a cash shop with a game attached to it, a game full of artificial limitations to make you buy ""solutions"" in the cash shop, want best cosmetic, cash shop, etc.On top of the terrible design to push you to the cash shop, and dont even try to play without a subscription (on top of the game cost), good luck with that inventory and the boatload of stuff inflating the loot pool.I went on to try FFXIV, zero regrets, having a blast without all this BS."
Negative,"Have tried this game a few times since release. Can't ever really give it a thumbs up at any stage -It has never really felt optimized. -Its UI , while usable in a single player Oblivion style world, is horrible to navigate here with 3 times as many screens but the same antiquated UI navigation-Limited freedom / world impact by your character-Bombarded by different ways to spend real money and play I miss you, Morrowind. I hope we one day return to those days. This just isnt Elder Scrolls ."
Negative,"Alright, I'm going to say it  even if you have a good connection because the lag is unbearable. The gameplay, content, PvE, dungeons, voiced story and massive open-world battles, everything is awesome except the lag. Sadly, I have to do this because I've been a huge fan of the series since I was a child and wanted to buy this so I can explore more of this world and the story. I tried playing with a few mainstream VPN providers but it is not a good solution since now and then you get disconnected. So once again"
Negative,"Overall, a really cool game, but as someone who loves PVP, the disparities are overwhelming. I am giving it one final try, but I quit after 3 weeks and do not expect that I will be able to continue. You can be fully geared, but die immediately (in a jump animation, in half a second or a second) in PVP encounters. You are completely powerless against certain players who carry effectively complete invulnerability. These players will stack countless effects that other players will claim only give them so much damage mitigation, but they are effectively invulnerable. Pokemon is more balanced than a lot of the PVP on this game. PVE is totally fine, and actually reasonably challenging. A lot of gaslighting from existing players, who make claims that you have any control over the disparities. You don't. You will not be able to compete against whatever it is that these players are running, and if you have any sort of decency as a human being, you probably wouldn't think to run the builds they do. The math simply does not add up for a lot of it, though I wish it did."
Negative,"Downloaded and wasted 3 days trying to get it to install, I have in fact played ZERO hours, not the thirty something it says I've played, on the 3rd attempt after running all night, I wake up to a message saying ""not enough disk space"" on a 2tb drive with over 800gb's of free space available, every time I try to play, it tells me that something's corrupt and it needs to repair. The repair process will jump to 100% multiple time as it said it would then get's stuck at 18% on the 4th or 5th one. Now I just wanna know how to get my money back on this PoS game...Just to throw it out there...I'm running a RYZEN 5 5600X and 32gb DDR4, with a Nvidia GeForce 1080ti and over 12tb's of storage and Windows 10 Pro."
Negative,"With 3.6 hrs of game time, I can tell you. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME."
Negative,Not even worthy to shine Morrowind's Boots of Blinding Speed!
Negative,Mediocre game at best.
Negative,The game is not playable from Asia. And it is not actually mac compatible. dont play this game. absolute trash they cant even fix the combat bug. the people behind this game/programmers are incompetent really
Negative,DO NOT SUBSCRIBE!!! IT DOES NOT GIVE YOU THE NEWEST DLC ZONE!!!
Negative,"Didn't even play for 2 minutes. I just forgot to close the launcher and Steam decided to count that as gameplay. I had this game for ages but only decided to install it last night.Out of curiosity, I spent half an hour exploring the in-game store through a browser, but every purchase page ends in a 404 error. As someone who loves wasting inordinate amounts of cash on meaningless video game assets, I am thoroughly disappointed. Bethesda doesn't seem to want my money."
Negative,"This is an extremely mediocre game which only holds because of The Elder Scrolls lore, though ZeniMax Online Studios is doing its best to desecrate this aspect as well.It could be fun for the first hundred or so hours, while you explore and build character, but after that the game becomes boringly repetitive, all quests repeat one another with completely unchanging and shallow narrative patterns, and the character development system is frankly poor if not pathetic. First impressions ofthis vividly drawn world can be exciting, but very quickly you understand that it actually lacks any kind of originality or inspiration. The legacy of The Elder Scrolls series is used ineptly and stupidly, as if developers were eager to get on the train of extorting money from the fans as soon as possible, forgetting that they should have made a good game.Of course, it was not without annoying and conspicuous inserts of the modern cultural agenda. A lot of companies ruin their games and reputation with this, but it takes a special skill to, instead of a superficial formal implementation of the agenda, shove it down the throats of the players.Also, here should be mentioned absolutely disgusting technical support. Arrogant and useless, it exists in the game not to help you, but to ruin your experience.In general, although the first impressions of the world can be entertaining, very soon it becomes a waste of money and time.  I spent many years with WoW, but now it is dead, and I was looking for a new MMORPG for myself. I came to TESO hoping to spend many wonderful years there, but I don''t want to play it again after 5 months. I am disappointed that The Elder Scrolls world I adore so much is ruined by such a pathetic game. Absolutely not recommended."
Negative,This game is the Kanye West of games. Do not recommend.
Negative,very boring walking simulator. massively monetised
Negative,"First of all, I only use steam to download the client and patch it. I have logged 2,000+ hours in ESO.The Elder Scrolls Online is a terrific MMO for someone who wants a good ol' fashioned, casual, drop-in-and-out elder scrolls questing experience. If you're in it for the questing, go ahead.Just be warned that cosmetics and convenience microtransactions is quite extensive. There are many in-game options for cosmetics that you can chase, but the process can be quite a grind. I will not be touching on the microtransactions since you can find out more about that elsewhere.Now, below is a review for anyone who is in it for something other than questing. I will be discussing more nuanced issues that are deeply rooted into the game's design philosophy, which revolves around ""making a game that has something for everyone"".To understand the problems in the endgame gameplay loop, you have to understand the core design philosophy of ESO. Every content and feature in ESO are designed and implemented to accomodate one (or maybe two) of 3 specific player archetypes. (Quester/explorer, raider, PvPer) The overall experience of attempting to source rewards from content that is designed for an archetype that you do not resonate with can often lead to negative experiences. (And when enough of these negative experiences pile up, players inadvertantly leave.)If you have any intent on enjoying the game's end game content, you will at one point or another face a massive wall that you have to slowly crawl over. This is because the devs decided that if you are in it for the endgame, you're gonna take it. The grind can feel terrible because the designers have incorporated the tried-and-proven playtime padding strategies such as RNG, timegating, and grouping into the endgame grind. What astonishes me is that they more likely than not did this because they are operating with the assumption that endgame chasers ""enjoy"" the grind. And by the way, this grind isn't limited to just power chasing. Even things like character customization and housing requires immense amount of grind and/or trading.Just as an example, one of the many ""mythic"" items in ESO, called the ""Markyn Ring of Majesty"" is often utilized in PvP. However, a piece (of 5) required to make this item is not only an RNG based loot, but also timegated. You have a chance to acquire it by completing either of 2 specific daily quests. You can only complete 1 of each /day, /character. The current wisdom is that one can reasonably expect it to drop on or before 20~30th attempt. However, RNG being RNG, this obviously can be much longer. I personally acquired on my 60th-ish attempt or so. There are horror stories of folks who acquired it after over 100, or even 200 attempts.This Markyn ring of Majesty also serves as just but one of many situations where someone who likes doing one particular thing is almost-forcibly dragged into something that is designed for someone with completely different desires and expectations. This deliberate, targeted, systemic segregation of content-per-archetype often makes ESO feel like a self-contradictory game. You can ""play the way you want"", but you gotta do some other random crap (that you might dread) somewhere along the way in order to keep doing what you want to do. This practice of divying up content also has many gameplay ramifications. Notably, each type of content in the game have massive gap in set difficulty, level/encounter design, and intended player behavior that corresponds with the aforementioned player archetypes each content is designed for. To give a practical example: to a quester/explorer, the dungeons and raids are difficult. Impossibly difficult. The soft and/or hard DPS checks required to reasonably, or reliably clear higher-end content is 5x, 10x more than the type of DPS your average quester would do. Achieving the required damage involves making many unexplained, counterintuitive build decisions. (e.g., the current meta revolves around equipping dual wield daggers and a greatsword, while often dumping all your attribute points into mana, and rotating a mix of stamina and mana consuming DoTs and class abilities.) The designers have not made any attempt into streamlining the build-making experience. (part of this is because different archetypes of players and their corresponding content have different build needs.) The game makes very little (if not completely 0) effort into explaining how things are calculated, scaled, interact with one another, or overall just freaking work. Though there are build guides out there to help players settle into higher-end group PvE content, there aren't that many guides that helps a new raider structure their own progression pathway into acquiring power (mainly by acquiring gear sets). The ""meta"" damage builds are very delicate, and changing even one thing may result in considerable damage loss. So much so that community discourse often gets derailed into arguments like ""toxic elitist raiders demanding everyone stick with the meta"" vs ""toxic casuals unwilling to learn and adapt demanding to be carried without understanding how and why meta exists in the first place"".And that, leads us to the final topic of discussion. The tailored approach in designing various content and encounters has yet another consequence: the different player archetypes become intrenched in their playstyle and sub-communities. Each subsection of the player community is effectively their own microcosms, or echo chambers. This naturally breeds toxicity and resentment towards other archetypes who all share and love this game in their own way. The studio, up until this year, was lazer focused on continuously delivering questing and exploration,  which further deepens this toxicity and resentment. (eg., ""the PvP criers are making PvE more difficult to balance, bringing the endgame raiding scene down."";  ""the vocal minority toxic elitist raiders are getting away with gatekeeping content from the actual majority of the playerbase by forcing the devs to overtune the difficulty despite what the community really wants""; ""ZOS pandering to raiders and questers have left PvP in the dust, when in fact at initial launch PvP was the true endgame content"")All in all, ESO is a massive game with a myriad of issues in the endgame space. The community is separated, so the feedback is separated. The designers, quite early on, decided that the best approach is to just compartmentalize content and respective player feedback, and eventually narrowly focusing vast majority of their resources towards content for the respective majority player population. (This sentiment used to be a somewhat of a myth/tinfoil conspiracy, but not any more. All the pieces comes together when you read both Rich Lambert's interview regarding ESO's design philosophy and Matt Firor's 2022 retrospective letter.) Its only upside at this point is that it has so many one-time questing and exploration stuff to do, that there is enough content to keep you going for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours, even if you don't get into the sort of endgame that requires power chasing and group coordination.The end of year letter from Matt firor, the studio director, has made some pretty bold , albeit vague statements about shaking up the content deployment strategy to the game. The new direction moving forward would be focusing on expanding and improving repeatable content (which he refers to as ""systems""), and intend on starting out by releasing QoL changes and new ""system"" starting with the fall quarterly update for next year. More details are expected come next January. However, overall player sentiment and expectations are fairly low given to the poor track record from the recent 2 or 3 years.To this end, I cannot recommend the Elder Scrolls Online and all available purchasable content.I hope this review helped in making your purchasing decision. Thank you."
Negative,"They charged me 20 dollars for the game, and then tried to make a core race of the franchise and add on. Either charge me for your game, or beat me over the head with micro transactions. Not both"
Negative,good but too many character....
Negative,"I was very dissapointed when i found out that this games main story cant be played Co-op, which is the whole reason i even bought the game."
Negative,"good game bad devs no pvp support.  still ass.  updating my review, it got worse.  still ass."
Negative,"This game doesn't load, dont bother spending countless hours on this piece of shit #fuckthedevs"
Negative,to much pay to win
Negative,"Runs like a blind three-legged dog at 1080p, yet I can smash out a bit of Witcher 3 at 1440p everything maxed out. Also, 10 MINUTE LOADING SCREEN TO GET TO CHARACTER SELECT ON AN SSD.I'm gonna go play Morrowind at this rate, it's probably less fucking buggy.EDIT: I had to disable all audio devices I wasnt using. including all my steelseries sonar virtual devices. And not use steam web browser while gaming. Works great now."
Negative,"I'm probably biased from having played GW2, but this game somehow feels so old. The way the characters move, the way quests work, the way combat is more clunky than you expect. The way the inventory and menus work... It all just feels like a bad xbox port from 2008.The world is empty. The characters are bland and forgettable. The movement system is archaic. The quests are meaningless. And my god, having to click every single thing you kill and then press another button just to loot all... Come on. We've moved on.There are so many better options. Don't waste your time with this.In case anyone looks at this and thinks '1 hour? He doesn't know what he's talking about'... I played this game in the open beta, bought it at launch, and played it for quite a while before realizing what a waste of time it was and drifting off to the next game. The hour is just a memory refresher, bringing back all the bad memories."
Negative,"This is the third time I played this game during a free weekend and each time I got bored after an hour or two. My playtime listed is incorrect - I've only playe 5-10 hours total. There are some things I like about this game compared to other MMOs I've tried which I'll list below.The main thing I like about this game compared to other MMOs is the freedom you have with building your character. I've only tried 2 classes, but both had a combination of magic/abilities to choose from along with melee, 2 handed, shield, blocking, dodge roll, and ranged combat (staff or bow). There's also different armor types that add various abilities. While this is still freedom than single player Elder Scrolls games, it is an improvement over MMOs.I should add that if Steam had a neutral option, I would probably choose that instead of negative, BUT MY VOICE MUST BE HEARD! Also, while I'm a big fan of action RPGs, I don't really play MMOs and am not a huge fan of Elder Scrolls games (although I do like the freedom those games allow and am still excited for TES 6 to be released)."
Negative,"Tl;dr I strongly recommend against this game (don't buy it). ESO has a lot going for it - in particualr a massive world, countless things to do, and what's more allows you to explore the Elder Scrolls world in the most comprehensive way ever imagined to-date, and that's a huge plus. One of ESO's biggest claims (and what I see in reviews) is that its a higher-fidelity world than competitors like World of Warcraft (graphics are better), and superficially this is true. Its a shame the game is clunky, filled with countless bugs, and overall is so poorly optimized and designed. Its the design of this game in particular that just completely takes you out of the experience. Fundamentally the game just doesn't play well as a cohesive experience, and has you constantly breaking your immersion to complete quest objectives in large & empty open spaces highly lacking in moment-to-moment action or engagement."
Negative,"Game does not load, have been stuck on loading screen for more than an hour. Every 10 minuted or so an error pops up that I need to log in again due to inactivity. This is apparently an issue that has been around since launch and they still haven't bothered to fix it."
Negative,"It makes for a good solo elder scrolls story.... BUT.... its pay to play meaning half the quests, lands, and some of the skill trees are behind a pay wall. I guess you can buy the crowns for gold ( from other players that pay for them)if you enjoy the grind and don't want to pay cash for the unlocks.... honestly i thought when i bought this i was buying the game  + content up to blackwood.... but really but was only about 1 in 4 of the content/land packs. If i want the rest i would have to buy like 150$ worth of crowns to unlock the rest making a 7+ year old game I bought on sale cost $170 JUST FOR THE quests/lands so I would consider this one of the worst cash-grab games i have ever played.  On a side note....... my modded skyrim's replaced assets look SOOOOOOOO much better. The 3rd party reskins/texture on the walls/ground/characters look far more professional than what was made for this game...... kinda pathetic.......SMP physics enabled gear had more effort put into it too.... ohh AND the character creator in ESO is junk compared to the face altrerations you can do with a 3rd party ones for skyrim...... but the ESO story is decent so i guess for 20$ on sale.,  if you liked any elder scrolls you should still probably buy it."
Negative,nunca jugue un juego tan poronga
Negative,Pay to win.Lack of local servers.Lack of subtitles/dubbing.
Negative,"System requirements say 85 GB available space, I have 108 GB available and it won't let me finish installation."
Negative,made for 40 year old men
Negative,"Maybe the story is good, wouldn't know I got filtered by the shit gameplay"
Negative,its boring FAST
Negative,"I got the game and loaded it It took 9 hrs and it was finish I enter the game did all my pregame setup when I got to avatar set up I did everything and lock all my changes  the game would not let me OK it and I could not get into the game I try to correct it  through the game that did not work , I uninstall the game and reloaded it that did not work. I went to elders scrolls online and they could not help me  I say don't buy it"
Negative,Pros:- The elder scroll IP is good.- Open world MMORPG- Take a look.Cons:- Degrees of freedom is quite low- Some classes require class purchase- Many skills are abandoned like they are not useful for PVE and PVP- Not really rewarding us. Quite grinding but not fun.- Not really feel like action RPG (I don't know why..)- Not friendly to solo player- Only few people play this game.
Negative,Spent 28.1 hours and i got bored and perma quitted when i completed 1 region. Elder scrolls is best played as a single player. This MMO innovative stuff is just not suitable for the series. Graphics seem low even when played at Ultra settings. Gotta wait for Elder Scrolls VI after Skyrim. Imo this game should be bought only when it's on sale for 0.99 USD (Complete edition)
Negative,"If you're going to be expecting the same kind of magic you felt while playing Skyrim, you're going to be massively disappointed. The game feels and looks worse than Skyrim, the quests are bland and boring, and the skill system doesn't feel exciting in the slightest compared to the versatile system Skyrim had. I had heard a lot of praise about this game, and was excited to jump in, and was honestly shocked how painfully average the entire experience was."
Negative,"there is boring dungeon, many"
Negative,"Что за контора пидорасов, даже лаунчер нормальный сделать не в состоянии!"
Negative,no where near as good as skyrim
Negative,Do not buy this game through Steam. Whatever account you log into your first time starting the game is permanently stuck to your Steam account. I let a friend log into their account on my computer and now I can't play my own game on my own account because it has no option to switch. Unbelievable.
Negative,"Day 1: Download the game. Excited to try the game tomorrow.Day 2: Big update to download. Didn't feel like playing anymore after waiting.Day 3: Patches to the update. Didn't feel like playing anymore after waiting.Day 4: ""Down for Maintenance"" How long? Dunno. It's just down. Apparently I've played 3 hours. I guess updates and patches count as hours played. lol."
Negative,"A fantastic continuation of the Elder Scrolls universe, perfect for players who enjoyed the glory of Skyrim. Game isn't worth playing unless you pay for a subscription, and the glitches/bugs make it virtually unplayable at times. Save yourself some aggravation and stick to Skyrim unless you want to be constantly loading or fighting with the shoddy login features"
Negative,"Alright, I'm just going to put it very simply. This game is the definition of mediocrity. The story is bland, the mechanics are okay, and the gameplay is meh. An MMO RPG from the elder scrolls lore could've been phenomenal but it just doesn't feel right. For one, a lot of the most fun mechanics from the main series like sneaking and skills have been either dumbed down or removed. Sneaking, something that was fun and simple in Skyrim, has basically been made useless as you can kill half of an enemy camp without any of the other enemies noticing. You aren't even required to think about what you do, most of the time if you just walk into a place and start press your 1 2 and 3 keys, you'll come out fine. It would've been really cool if you were forced to think before acting and make some form of plan but there's no situation that I've found where I've had to do that.Something else is that they changed how a lot of the crafting works. I'll use enchanting as an example. Instead of using soul crystals and learning enchantments from disenchanted gear, you find runestones. I understand they have to pad out crafting processes to make it more grindy, it's an RPG after all, but they could've tried to make it more faithful to the ES games. Soul gems now serve as basically 1ups for the player, allowing them to revive after death.Another thing is that overall, the story and characters feel extremely hollow. A lot of the characters just feel like throw always and their isn't any personality to any of them. I remember hold guards from Skyrim more than main characters from these stories. That's not to say that there aren't cool moments. For instance, in Elyswere you got to see Parthronax when he wasn't a good dragon and in the newest expansion, Greymore, you get to see Solitude but other than some moments here and there, it's just boring. You don't feel connected to the world or its characters.But by FAR the worst out of all is that this game is ALWAYS selling you something. They have over $200 worth of DLC that should be included by default. Like, you have to buy the dark brotherhood questline separate from the Greymore expansion and same with the thieves guild quest line. They are constantly pushing for you to buy crowns. To purchase Proudspire manor in Solitude fully furnished it's going to cost you 63 real like dollars. You can buy the unfurnished house for the fair price of 1000000 gold (for some perspective my main character I spend 75-90 hours on had at most 5000 gold.) I'm not spending hundreds of dollars on a game when I can play something like Skyrim or World of Warcraft and get a better experience.Overall, the game has a lot of cool ideas but nothing is ever finished and the stuff that gets finished is overshadowed by tons of purchase windows and grinding. A good example is the guild system. Joining a guild allows for a special set of talents you can unlock. That's really cool and interesting and is something I'd like to see more of but I'm not playing this game for hundreds of hours to do it. I think the most disappointing things is how amazing this game could've been had it been more faithful to the main series of games (doesn't have to be Skyrim, MMO edition but something with standard Elder Scolls Style.) My final verdict is 6/10, unless some major revamps are done(which I doubt there will be as they are undeniably making tons of money of this) this will remain as just a ""meh"" game."
Negative,"Playing Skyrim with your friends might seem like a good idea, but then you realize there's other players in the world to ruin your immersion and questing experience. This should have just been a coop rpg or have most of the content be instanced. Also the numbers scaling is really strange."
Negative,"One aspect frustrates me to the point of done , bag space . I gave in and paid for ESO plus for my other account on Xbox , I am not about to pay for another ESO plus account for PC no matter how much better the Graphics are . Ran around trying to find stupid level 3 water for a writ of sip of stamina ,an hour wasted looting having to empty bags to make room for more important loot. Stupid entrapment to get you to sign up for a bottomless bag for 14.99 a month.I also know that even with bottomless bag for materials , you need to empty bag going through solo dungeons having to weigh what to get rid of . Tonight i just had to log out because of frustration of bag space and a simple writ that for some reason is impossible to find stupid level 3 natural water."
Negative,"jesus christ...purchased the game, took 8 hours to download, game doesnt even load. Wow...."
Negative,its by far the worst elder scrolls game because it has virtually no good npcs and has basicaly no story.
Negative,game is cheeks
Negative,i have a logitec gaming controller that wont even work on this game now im getting error message like  servor timed out yes i tried playing it on controller now its not even starting
Negative,I regret playing this game
Negative,Wants to install massive DLC on to my PC that i can't even access. Unless i feel like paying for skyrim for the 5th time
Negative,"Terrible customer support. Instead of giving my account back once it was hacked, mind you my steam was hacked as well, they decided to perma ban it after I spent a few hundred dollars on the game. Instead of just giving me back my account after I proved my identity via Drivers license, purchases made on the account, and even where my Steam had been hacked they decided to ban it due to the hacker claiming to be me as well. Yet... I had actual proof of identity. My account was from the closed beta.. Its very disappointing to see a good game fall so hard due to terrible customer support and money hungry publishers."
Negative,"If you played, if your a fans of everything elder scrolls V, You simply love the absence of Classes,... the open world, .....the darkness in the cold ambient dungeon world,.... the completly open to customization freeplay and open workshop, +++ no cashgrabbing bS ???Well do not try this masterpiece from the museum of Craplandia!!!!!!All that was awsome and pre-listed here is reversed into this fake ES, not from the same corp or DEVS i have to say,.The expectations were high and all the hardcore Nords were getting their shit together to start the real open world ESO!!! and then this happened....The coldness, is now lavish colorfull linear kitten BS with pet flying all around, they added colorfull flying pets, colorfull textures and more !!! from the gothic coldness of this well know franchise, is now complete fluff for 15 years old mother fed cashwhales !!! Come get your pick!!!! Now we have  classes (like every medieval rpgs) flying pets lagging every corners!(like every bad manga) and really linear narrow maps (like every 1990 s game)!!!!!! Did i say they have really fluffy pets flying around ? elder scrolls???Oh yes the cashgrabs is crazzzyyy i mean dong get me started, you will have to pay for ..increasingly and possibly everything eventually in game , wellcome to the era of :corporate gaming!!!!!Come get your fill in this parody of ""the elder scrolls online"" where you will need a lot of drugs not to quit the franchise all togheter!"
Negative,"This game is set up to drain you of your money! Steam lists the Elsweyr and Greymoor content as DLCs, and on their ESO Plus Membership page they tell you that paying for the subscription means you get access to ALL DLCs. Guess what? Elsweyr and Greymoor are NOT considered DLCs. So now you gotta pay again. Unless you dig through their website to find out this difference, there is no clear distinction. And if you bought 30 days membership, you only get 29 days before they charge you again!*Edit based on dev reply: I'd figured out the difference after I'd already spent the money, if it wasn't clear from the downvote I gave. Instead of making people dig through your website, how about you state that on Steam?"
Negative,"I do not recommend the game in its current state. PvP is unplayable due to performance and server issues. Furthermore, there are several bugs that have not been fixed these couple of years, and the support team doesn't care.For example, my main is bugged in an invisible, corrupted group, which makes it impossible to group up or queue for battlegrounds/dungeons. There is no fix to this, except to wait for the next maintenance, which could take some time. My main has to wait 10 days before being able to play in groups again.There are multiple people that had or have this bug that has been going on since 2015, and the devs simply don't care.I highly suggest another MMO that actually works and is playable."
Negative,"If you are not interested in the marketing side of the game, please skip to the second paragraph:   If you are going to purchase this game. Please please know. It is a full price game to essentially get dropped into a free to play marketing strategy. It is pay to win, but distorted through heavy emphasis on cosmetics, plain and simple. And they cleverly hide these predatory tactics until after you purchase the title. This game is a fucking joke when it comes to honest and fair marketing.Gameplay: This game is fun, I cant lie. Although I cannot stand the disgusting business practices used by the developers bosses. It is very deeply rooted in the lore, and also has lots of engaging, meaningful combat. Perfect for both the enthusiast and the dungeon slayer type of player. I must say that the open world is just as fun as the PVP combat. and the dungeons, even with a good team are challenging, yet rewarding.Overall: This game is not worth a purchase.."
Negative,"We need Chinese,please!"
Negative,The community is pretty bad - hostile towards new players.
Negative,It's not for Asia. full of lag and buffering all around.
Negative,One of the worst looking and feeling MMOs i have ever witnessed.Gameplay feels clunky honestly this game should have been released in the 1990s over all 2/10
Negative,"AVOID! Not worth your time and money.They will screw you over once you've invested time and money. ZOS are greedy bastards and will recycle content and will call ""new"". Game used to be really good. Money is all they care about now. Unsubscribed."
Negative,"by far one of the biggest grind fests ive ever encountered (and i was a beta tester for console and PC). Many Massive sections of the game are hidden behind pay walls, Now normally for a ""free-to-play"" title This is a Normal and perfectly fine thing to do. Howeverr this is a PAID AAA title. Meaning not only are they charging you for the game but they are charging you to play it too."
Negative,"Your game doesn't even want to log in and if it does you can barely play before you get kicked out againEdit: So after I have logged a ticket with Bethesda for more than 2 weeks they still have not come back to me, oh no they took the link away where you can follow the progress on your ticket. This game developer sucks, I will not be buying any other games from them ever again, they are pathetic and even after the update the issue still hasn't been fix and I can't even request a refund from Steam anymore so I have wasted money on a useless game from a useless developer"
Negative,every year this game just keeps getting more and more broken
Negative,Meh. It's alright. The only thing it has going for it is the fact that it's elder scrolls. Without that it just feels like a very loose MMO.
Negative,dont buy this game
Negative,WAY too addictive. Prepare to say goodbye to your family and friends for a few months if you start this game.
Negative,the further you progress in this game. the more problems arises.
Negative,"install the game, wait for 8hrs for 75gb file, then it update and download in laucher for 6 more hrs, and then when i enter game, only thing i can play is login screen, the game is constantly crash or time out error, sever always disconnect,...shame on you bethesdauninstall the gameupdate: stuck at request login button, try everything to fix it, nope, i am out, this time, for good"
Negative,"Best lags of the year 10/10.Don't waste your time, because with ping 999+ you became old faster then your projectile achieve enemy.Developers just don't want to do anything with it.Game deleted after 2500 hours of playing.UPD: After 7k hours it is still shita game, but at least BGs working."
Negative,"im at 800 hours while posting this review, 800 hours in 2 months, average over 12 hour per day for two continuos months, you can see that how much love i put in this game (but most time spend before reaching max level, max level PVP is horrible, details below), and i still decided to give it a bad review. I also tried one month ESO plus, but strongly suggest you pay your ESO subscription somewhere else, example, buy a game a month, no need to support such lame game, especially those negative part surely can be fixed but developer doing nothing, details below:PVE:as a World of Warcraft player for nearly 2 decade, and have quit because boycott blizzard, this ESO is good in story for single player preferred player.  but the bag slot provided is terrible. even with ESO PLUS subscription (with unlimited craft bag), u still need to often go back to town to deconstruct equipment, and sell junk. i know it will get better after u unlocked whole 200 slot, but as a beginner till u get rich with million gold to unlock all slot, and also the need of 60 days to unlock the stable slot, u will suffer a lot within the first few months, dont forget upgrade horse speed need 60 days, bag need 60 days, if u upgrade bag only, u will explore the game with stupid slow horse for over 2 months. so in order to start playing practically normal, u need at least 60 days for slot, 30-60 days for speed, thats stupid.PVP:You may also enjoy PVP before level 50, because gear gap between player is not huge, but after level 50 u can forget about battleground, u can get killed within 3 seconds, enemy player can cast 5 skill on you within 2 seconds, some says its some source paid program, some said its their animation cancelling bugs, and i expect some would reply and tell me its because im noob. anyhow i've been playing PVP in WOW for more than a decade, never get angry after losing battle, but very angry for ESO battleground.  the battleground design is 4v4v4 which is different to WOW pvp 10vs10 or 20vs20, that make u need to pray that everytime u queue for random battleground, u need to pray ur teammate assigned to you is good player, else, no matter what u do, wont make differences, if you get what i mean, because in 10vs10 game, 2-3 noob player u may still win with 7 good player, but in a 4 player only team, u even need to pray the gear differences between team not huge, its all about praying game, not PVP game. player who runaway from battleground only suffer penalty not able to join for few minutes, this is stupid rules as compared to WOW pvp which is 30 minutes at least. which make ESO more terrible with player leaving game before trying to turn the tide. not to mention their random dungeon and random battleground system is broken, if u start battleground with only 2 players instead of 4, very very high chances you will play the whole game without any new player joining, ended up 2v4v4."
Negative,"What used to be a fun and peculiar rendition of the Elder Scrolls series (in MULTIPLAYER OMG), it starts off being strangely familiar to the genre, but quickly losing it's familiarity for a very different type of skill / combat / item / progression system.Social interactions can be pesky as they overlap in frustrating ways, with instance splits ruining a lot of interaction opportunities, and people griefing for fun or out of frustration. Then there are the quests... which have become so bloated and overlapped, that it's nearly impossible to follow any proper sequence anymore, which ultimately gives the feeling of confusion, uncertainty, and nobody can really tell you for certain where you missed out and where you should have started.Guilds have degraded to petty politics and butchering their members' wallets to greedily hunt ""guild traders"" (merchants that allow players outside your guild to buy your stuff - otherwise, you can only sell to other guild members). Want to get roped into backstabbing and real-life harassment? Join a fairly big guild.Solo PvE? There's still PvP and no avoiding it. You WILL need other players to assist with certain things... the game force you to. 4-player or 12-player content... which is practically impossible unless you have pre-farmed gear, for that content... or pre-crafted... and you don't have the liberty of definite returns, as the RNG (drop system) is falling apart with trash drops; expect 2 weeks to 2 months to grind the correct set, in the correct traits... or risk ""not being good enough"" for certain content.Lore later goes downhill fast from rich and compelling, to cheap roadside soap operas and fanfic gutter fodder. Elswyr's ""dragon theme"" was AWFUL. There's no getting away from it... you want khajiits? HAVE ANNOYING DRAGONS FOREVER AS WELL!Zenimax Online Services (ZOS) tend to neglect the obvious in their continued pursuit of profits, and squeeze the servers for everything they're worth (while people disconnect, lag, and are unable to play) - but some of the staff still try, and really deserve kudos for their efforts and commitment... but the game has been dying for a long time, and has just gotten too bloated to be good anymore.Amidst a huge nerf to DPS where ""the best gear is suddenly mediocre"", many players (myself included) bailed on a good few years of gameplay (Sorry Steam, I unlinked the game because you kept ""Verifying Files"" and making me reinstall the whole time) and either joined up in World of Warcraft or EVE Online (or other game/s).If you wanted an Elder Scroll title, this used to be it... but not anymore. Don't get fooled into paying exorbitant amounts of money for what has become an unplayable and lacklustre experience... (you might have missed it, but it's too broken now to get any reasonable good out of it).Final Verdict: NOT RECOMMENDED"
Negative,The new patch and recent requirement increase makes this game unplayable. When I bought the game it had drastically different requirements. The past year has seen a steady decline in performance.Here is the original requirements...Processor: Dual Core 2.0GHz or equivalent processorMemory: 2GB System RAMHard Disk Space: 60GB free HDD spaceVideo Card: DirectX 9.0 compliant video card with 512MB of RAM (NVIDIA® GeForce® 8800 / ATI Radeon™ 2600 or better)Sound: DirectX compatible sound card.Source: https://www.neoseeker.com/the-elder-scrolls-online/
Negative,Way too P2W. Play WoW instead.
Negative,"Greedy practices, unreasonable prices, servers not working. Horrible customer support, can't even manage their own game."
Negative,wasting ur time
Negative,"character customization is next to 0. Whatever you do, you still look like a bag of potatoes with arms and legs. And after you finish the character creation, you go outside only to see a colorless world that makes you wanna scratch your eyes with a screwdriver. The game looks like Skyrim's retarded cousin. I would only recommend this game to Metin fans"
Negative,"All good things in life must come to an end.. Not saying ESO was perfect but it was damn good! Mind the WAS. This game has become a corporate washing machine that does not and never will care for the players. As a veteran player with over 1660 hours I am deeply disappointed in how little the developers could care. For years we wanted better performance and bug fixes, we got new emotes and other cosmetics.. We wanted balanced patches and personality but we got game breaking skills and nerfs. This game is shit, and no one should play it anymore!!! Shame on you ZOS"
Negative,"So i sunk alot of time into this MMO. why dont i recommend it? Simple enough the ""END GAME"" is more of the same first you have to Grind up 50 levels doing dungeons, PVP, and questing,ETC. Then you have to Grind 160 ""Champion Points"" or CP doing dungeons, PVP, and questing thus the game made me lose all interest at this point. oh dont grind PvP for CP or you will have a bad time do to the horrible balanced end game battlegrounds, unless your geared to the teeth. so i did make it to CP 160 and my friend who i was playing with told me to grind this DLC dungeon for a set of gear and i quit. i was so sick of dungeons getting from 1-50 and then to 160 CP. also before you say oh maybe you dont like MMOs i have 8-9 years of WoW behind me"
Negative,"This game sucks. I bought it ages ago because it advertised as non-subscription and it wasn't riddled with microtrans but they've decided not to respect that. Now that I need 100+ more bucks/subscription to play it properly I regret spending the first 80, it's just not that good of a game.To the Elder Scrolls Team: Your response is disingenuous. Inventory space is so limited without add-ons classes can't be built properly, guilds can't be participated in. There is no viable end-game and swathes of content is denied. If you had advertised this to me as a 80$ plus 10/month subscription, I wouldn't be upset. Because I wouldn't have bought the game. Thanks for taking the time to respond here."
Negative,"Don't buy from Steam. The game takes 5 hours to download and then you're forced to download it all over again along with the patches in another launcher, and steam clocks every second you have the launcher open as ""time played"" so you can't even get a refund if you go over 2 hours. Then, after all that the game doesn't open ""fatal error 11"" and the application closes. Huge waste of f***ing time and money, steam should be ashamed.The game itself is okay, I got a refund from steam and bought it directly from Bethesda. If you want this game do that, don't buy it here."
Negative,"i m so dissaponted in this game...bad optimizations, crashes after crashes in pvp, the servers are working like my 82 years old grandfather, u have no chance to play in the weekends, u get ping over 200 (i have 1gb internet connection). is unacceptable, when battle starts u either crash or u get 10 fps ( i have 1080 ti and ryzen 7, 16gb ram DDR4). if u crash good luck getting back in, is practicaly impossible. And the worst thing of them all is that Bethesda and Zenimax dont give a damn about people complaining and they are doing abosulutley nothing about those issues."
Negative,"It's a shame the game is not in spanish. I have no time to look for specific words in the dictionary, it becomes a boring game. Other than that, I guess is a good game."
Negative,It Crashes. I am trying to get my money back now.
Negative,"Got suspended for no reason, literally."
Negative,"Used to be good, now its the definition of cancer!!! BUGs BUGs AND MORE BUGs and do not forget the (not) B A L A N C E D  trash PVP"
Negative,Please create a server for Asian players
Negative,Didn't live up to what i was hopping it would be.
Negative,"I have spent more than 5 hours combined on re-trying failed character load everytime i tried to login, in my 30 hours of playing this game."
Negative,"Does not work on wifi, only ethernet. Only game that does this. Zenimax support is nonexistant. Do not buy, because if they can't fix an issue this big then they probably not fix any other issues that come up. The game also hides 80gb of data to be downloaded in the launcher, so you can 't refund it even if you can't play a minute of it due to spending over 2 hours downloading it with the launcher up."
Negative,"Too much greed from the devs. Extreme monetization. If you like cosmetics, stay away. Also, Zo$ is infamous for extremely predatory bussiness practices and extreme censorship in the official forums. The devs and their families insult PvP players and, in general, feedback is ignored. Can´t endorse such a behaviour.On another topic, they usually have a weekly 8 hour long  (in the best of cases, for it usually gets longer) maintenance during european prime time. That means that if you don't live in the US, you can expect to waste one weekly day of your subscription, lose one day of daily rewards, lose one day of events, etc. Another scam.On another note, the game is available for old gen consoles, which means that old Xbox and Ps4 are dragging down the development of the game a lot. Forget about having good animations or physics, or about having proper housing and multiple classes. Old consoles prevent this game from competing with any modern MMO.Finally, regarding ZOS istelf: they are the saddest, most pathetic collection of bigot fascists I've seen. Their censorship is extreme. The official forums of the game are a cesspool of bootlickers and yes-men, and any slight critic (reasonable, polite and well-thought critic) is shut down with immediate bans. I had never seen any other forums so fast to perma-ban. In my case, just for stating that loot-boxes will never dissapear because they make ZOS too much money. A simple truth, got a perma-ban. Even in-game their censorship continues. Don't give you character a slightly playful or mature name, you'll get a suspension and will be forced to change the name. And never dare to speak ill of ZOS in the game chat. Just saying that an event was bad organized and that I disliked ZOS because of it got me a 73 hour ban, and the menace of getting perma-banned from the game. Disgusting behaviour from this devs. Shameful and idiotic.But don't worry, cheaters, exploiters and the longest trains of bot farmers will never get banned, because Zo$ only cares exactly about one thing: making money. The state of the game can be trash, and they will never do anything to change that. Bots everywhere.  I have devoted too much time to this game to quit now but, if I were to buy this game and knew about all this, I would NEVER, ever, give a single cent to these trash of people. Buyer beware."
Negative,"A whole city is burning up in flames, and people are being killed by these bad people. So i decided to take one pieice of food off a table and bounty hunters start chasing me in the city with a bounty on my head...Thug life 10/10after playing this more, it really sucks"
Negative,"Game won't run. It was working perfectly till some days ago. Big update (is there any small one in this game?, and now... nothing. Can't go beyond the ""PLAY"" button in launcher."
Negative,This could have been better. All I have to say really.
Negative,This is just silly.  Elder Scrolls does not work as an MMO game.  Don't waste your money.
Negative,Cough *beyond skyrim* Cough
Negative,Spawned into an area with literally hundreds of players frantically running around doing very unmythic uninteresting stuff. 20 mins later bored and deinstalled. Watching 25 other players try to complete the same task as you at the same time is just gross.Also clearly has structures designed to encourage you to pay money or face the grind.Shame as it is visually pretty.
Negative,"I don't care who is making problems here, Steam or Zenimax. Both launcher and client are garbage compared to Path of Exile and Ubisoft implementations. Just google ""eso steam issue"" and don't buy this game from Steam.Outside of that the game is fine. A lot of quests to do, if you'll buy basic game and even a lot more if you'll pay a lot of extra cash for all those dlc's and chapters. Some pay for quality of life features (horse training speed) and lootboxes with in-game stuff are kinda annoying, but nothing game breaking."
Negative,"I have played the elder scrolls v skyrim only and I loved that game. I'm not like a hardcore addict to the elder scrolls games, but this game is just amazing, a few hours in and I'm already hooked and want to spend the whole day dedicated to playing it. You wont be dissapointed2020 edit: i was on some good type of elicit drug to recommend this steaming pile of dog shitadd an oceanic server region you absolute baboons2023: help im losing my mind"
Negative,I bought this game a couple months ago. This 60 or so hours I have is not gameplay what so ever. In chronological order this is how my experience has been.- Bought game.- Took a couple days to install (60 Gbs) due to awful internet.- After waiting ages it was installed but then I had to patch it which took another day or so.- When it was finally installed and ready to go it crashed everytime I attempted to launch it and       this isn't due to a low end pc.- I gave up and left it for a couple months.- I came back and had to do another massive patch wich was most likely a bunch of     unnecessary files.- After a couple days it was done so I launched the game successfully.- Created an account.- Attempted to logon wich a message announcing that my account did not exist.- Checked website account indeed exists.And there you have it that has been my experience not sure if I'll get it working anytime soon but that chances are that the game will be a let down anyway don't know why I bother to be completely honest.
Negative,"Skyrim does everything better.  Unless you want broken laggy chaotic PvP or a shallow PvE grind that requires a grind to reach.For exploring/lore MMORPGs this one is probably top tier, but I don't play MMORPGS for exploring and lore, I play Skyrim for that. Case closed."
Negative,"Let's get this ""First Impression"" underway.Yes, I only played for an hour or so. And I can honestly tell you, the game still has some bugs, and if you're looking for some immersion.. Don't. It's still bland as a stale piece of bread.But don't let that be the main point here, the game does boom on some aspects, like combat, crafting, and the like. But the problem is, it doesn't have the same ""Spice"" as the single player games. But what can we say? It's an MMO elder scrolls game after all.I could stomach the blandness of the immersion, the little to no thrill in a fight. But there are some bugs as usual, like when I got off my horse, (I had a bounty on me) I was stopped by a guard, but it didn't continue on with the arrest action, my character just went on doing a hands up motion endlessly, while I keep hearing. ""Halt! Damn you!"" until it reached the point of me pressing Alt+F4. But of course that didn't stop me. I played on, and tested it out for my buddies.So far I gave them an A-okay!But then as I try to back it up just in case. It redownloads the whole game! ""Great! I'll waste probably 3 days now! WOOPEE!""10/10 Will let Steam do the deciding. Luckily for those of you who want to play, the devs do answer sometimes. And I can't really recommend you to play the game since it didn't really meet my expectations, I just had to stomach everything. And yeah, I know the review isn't much. But hell..... I ain't going to waste 3 days again...(In short) You want to play this game? Don't hit that PLAY button on the ESO launcher. Exit it make a backup, and be ready.If you don't want to play this game, then I'm wondering why you're still reading this. When you could be looking for something else.Now I'm off to give my buddies an F for FFS!"
Negative,The North Korea of games.
Negative,I purchased the game through steam and cant link OR create an account. 1000% DO NOT RECOMMEND! I wasted $20 on a game I cant even play!
Negative,spend more time trying to login then i have play
Negative,"Start game, load scene, load again, then load scene. Open door will make the game loading, go back through the door, will make the game load again! If you like loading, this is the game for you."
Negative,gameplay feels like ice skating on a rocky road while getting carpal tunnel syndrome because the combat is just pressing 12121212121212121212
Negative,came from ps4 and played it since it came out moved to pc and i cant move my guy that i spent years on building to pc so gotta start all over again
Negative,Installation error. GFYs and gimme back my money!
Negative,I was playing this game pretty regularly and having a lot of fun doing it.  But this most recent patch stopped group queueing into BGs.  PvP has always been my thing and now I can't do it w/ the people i talked into trying the game out with me.  Needless to say we all quit for now.  Why would a MMORPG want people to play solo?  This has to be one of the worst decisions ever made in an online game.
Negative,"If you want play an mmo experience there's nothing new here and nothing awesome. If you want a TES game... The story is OKAY, just okay. Oh how I wanted TESVI... now I just don't want it to come out. It will be bad for sure.Disappointment."
Negative,"Everything in this game is cosmetic. Excited to equip that new axe you just found? Cool! Just be ready for it make zero difference in your damage output. How about that new armor? Doesn't really matter what its stats are, so long as it looks cool. It makes no difference in your resistance. If you want to impress your friends with cool new animations that make no difference in the combat, then go ahead and level up your skills!I understand the reason for level scaling. I understand that a lot of people like it. Personally, I just feel that it usually ruins RPGs. When I level up 10 times and mud crab takes just as long to kill as it did before, I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels and going nowhere. It's a pretty game. It definitely does of a good job of bringing in the elder scrolls feel in every aspect aside from the character progression. Overall, it's not a terrible game. I just feel like the leveling system is a waste of time. There's really no reason to include it. They may as well just remove that facet, start everyone at max level and turn it into more of a massively multiplayer open world action/adventure/platformer style of game set in the elder scrolls universe because that's basically what it is."
Negative,Wanted to start playing this game again but unable to install it anymore..  Always a corrupted download.  i tried 3 times. did a fresh install same issue.  70 gigs 3 times is a lot.  So I gave up.  Playing SWTOR instead.
Negative,this game is suck! badass world im play game 40 min and unistall
Negative,Not my cup of tea.
Negative,It's really just not very fun. Mainly the usual grind with quests that aren't very memorable and are lacking in depth.
Negative,Half of my time on record is waiting for shit to download
Negative,"I have thousands of hours on ESO on Playstation. ESO is boring and not worth it and I doubt it will ever be worth it again. The only thing fun is the dungeons but everything else sucks so unless you wanna grind ESO dungeons forever, don't bother playing ESO."
Negative,"A grossly uninspiring game. I got bored of it almost immediatly and the rest of the time i spent playing it were nothing but painfull. The quests are devoid of any meaning or interest. They added preaty much nothing in the lore and the world building. It felt like playing the most generic MMO story from an anime. But i  have to give credit where its due! The gameplay and the leveling mechanics were quite enjoyble , the combat felt very much like a good hybrid between the skyrim and the classic mmo combat. The game was quite fun when playing with friends and the it gave a lot of chances to socialize with others players. The comunity is not that toxic and if you are lucky you can find some helpful people online.All in all, i do not recommend this game since there are  better MMORPGs on the market."
Negative,its a good thing i tryd the 3 free days before paying money for this game. my computer specs far out do what is required to paly this game. yet after downloading 60 gb then setting through an update then having it scan an repair any broken files every time i hit play its starts up the game and infinite laoding screen with music playing. sit there for hrs and hrs and it will not load. already tryd repairing like i said and i hear some ppl say change the settings to lower all the specs at the start fixes it. problem is steam auto signs you in so you can so your screwd. from what i understand this is a problem that has been going on for a long time the devs dont care and ppl who have actualy bought this game an ran into the problem are screwed by bad develoment with now support.
Negative,"The Elder Scrolls Online is fun sometimes but there are some things holding it back.-Exploration: It's pretty fun going around and finding some cool places that are off the beaten path. Unfortunately, some places that you find are cool but are untimately just there for show you don't get anything out of it except a casual stroll. Huge wasted oppertunity.-Combat: The combat is very, very boring it feels like ElderScrolls but in reality it doesn't. For instance: You opponent is charging a devistating attack then just block it and it automatically stuns them allowing you to do a strong attack and knock them on their ass. Same if they're charging a devistating spell just bash them and do the same thing afterward. Extremely boring and not very innovative.-Loot: This was by far the biggest issue for me since I started playing. Say for instance you've been fighting this boss 1v1 and after 5 or so minutes you finally win and you get your reward. NOPE! Because, someone can easily just come right in and loot your kill without a second thought and without minimal effort. Everquest 2 has a loot system where if you kill something there is a 10 minute window before anyone else can loot your kill.. seriously Zenimax?Skills & Progression: You develop your skills just like you would in Skyrim. Use a Greatsword or any weapon you'll naturally become better with them especially your skills trees for each different class. Quest NPCs And NPCs In General: Alright, so this is another point that I have an issue with that bogs down the experience of ESO for me. In Skyrim when you got a quest to say kill some Skeevers or something like that the NPCs get straight to the point. Skeevers are at point X after you're done come back to me at point Y. Here in ESO that is not the case literally just to get the info you need to go though 2-3 dialogue windows. Literally we don't give a shit about your life's story we want to go kill shit and level up(I'll get to that)! Literally, the amount of exposition you have to go though is HORRIBLE and you'll be rushing though all of their pointless exposition in no time.Experience and Leveling Up: Alright so you finally got though the starting area and you're ready to go kick some ass and level up right? Ehh.. no.. not really if your planning to go though the long haul that's if you fork over a nice sum of cash(cool right?). Okay, so lets get the bullshit out of the way. If you're not a subscriber you're going to be handicapped not severely but it makes the experience that much less to be desired. If you're not a member you get -10% XP(basically you'll get 90% of every mob you kill instead of 100% of it), you won't have a matierals bag which means all your crafting supplies will be in your bag taking space(instad of being in your matierals bag which is a seperate bad that takes no space) which means less loot for you, and many other things that just slow you down. Honestly, EQ2 had these restrictions before but afterward they look them off because they saw people were still leaving because they have to come back to town every 10-15 mins just to sell their shit off it's honestly just a hinderince. I'm okay with not playing the expansions(EQ2 made their last expansion free 1-2 years after release)I'd rather much enjoy the main experience to it's fullest before I actually make a decision if I want to invest in ESO and any of their expansions."
Negative,"Tried this game as part of a free weekend, and very quickly got bored.  The combat is very MMO-like (slow, uses hotkeys for special abillities, face hordes of trash-tier enemies who just sit there and use thier one canned attack over and over) and the gameplay itself seems to have taken the worst of open MMOs and instanced multiplayer and combined the two.So when you are in a town or a dungeon, you can barely move for the sea of other players, however when adventuring the game seems to forget its a MMO so each party memeber must indivually kill each monster to get credit, individually unlock the doors etc.  Worst of all, when I went into a boss fight, I went by myself (and then had to wait for the group to finish thier own personal boss fight)Simply put, this game is a poor MMO, poor single-player experence and also fails as a immersive experence too."
Negative,Why bother releasing this game on ASIA if the server is only US and EU.I'm a hard core ES fan but damn this game is disappointing.
Negative,"You will meet a fredrik, and that is the last thing you want to meet"
Negative,"for a game that costs $20, it sure has some awfully prevalent microtransactions...and that $60 dlc kinda scares mealso the servers are complete poot and i get booted to the login screen often"
Negative,"Another generic MMO, but with a ridiculous macrotransaction shop(see what I did there?).  It costs a ton of gold to do anything, like expand the laughably small bagspace you start with.  Pair that with the massive amount of materials you need for crafting(which isn't great), and it's just frustrating to do much of anything in this game."
Negative,Just buy this game. I am very disappointed that the game keep saying connection time out and need to close. If you in Asia better don't buy this game. I am like having a 20% to log into the game and 80% of the game will log out itself.
Negative,"The Install and Launch experience first time is horrible. The game is first a very large download. Then you have to verify the install, download patches for a game you just downloaded at a super slow speed, Then you have to sign up on a website not even in the app, wait several minutes for a confirmation email, activate the email, sign into the account... then you get to play... By this point you are already at 30 minutes of ""play time"" The process seems designed to pad things out...because I know I'm still going to have to deal with a long first time log in process, plus character creation. By the time I've actually played anything I'll be at 60-90 minutes of ""play time"" (This is all because the Launcher being open counts as play time... and of course the launcher doesn't automatically close with the launching of the game or the quitting of the game) This all seems like a trap to prevent refunds. This does not bode well for the game as a whole.EDIT - the Developer responding... but of course everything they said has 0 to do with my comments. Nothing didn't load right... this was all normal stuff... it just takes more of the refund period to actually get in the first time. More than that... I just spent 20 hours playing it. I ran into an issue during a quest which required me to abandon the quest and redo several steps (including a open world dungeon area) all because this 8 year old game still has odd bugs... and there is no difference between abandoning this quest and the whole chain. I encountered this AGAIN in the same session with a different quest because no visible marker to a ""race"" I was supposed to do appeared. (Or at least not that I could see as it later found to be around the corner in a location that isn't obvious to even look at to no that something changed. I abandoned this quest hoping it would fix the issue. I had was in disguise and the disguise vanished. The quest mobs then despawned, The quest was removed from my journal and none of the previous quest givers were spawned either. I could find no way to get the disguise back which I had prior to entering this area. Given this was a primary part of the Zones Quest chain I thought I was going to have to restart the entire chain ( about 20 different parts at this point) I went back to the very beginning... but no quest giver. I went back to the tutorial zone... no quest giver. I started going forward in the chain... no quest giver... I finally found one of the NPCs sitting about 2 stages (about 10 quest links back) but the next quest giver wasn't in their location. I found the quest giver eventually about 5 quest links back but he was in a state of having already given me the quest which of course I didn't have) I had absolutely no idea what was going on. 5 hours of research and nothing.... finally as a last ditch effort I went back to the island I was on. When I arrived (in a different way to how I got there the first time) the disguise reappeared and the quest giver from 3 links previous had a quest marker on their head. Nothing in the game indicated this is what was needed. Nothing suggested the disguise I had in the previous zone that carried over to this zone would just reapply if I left the zone and came back. This is just bad design. The quest I had issue with originally was still annoying requiring me to follow markers that are too far apart and shift to place behind objects (obscuring them) and at strange angles (like around corners where there are multiple paths...) the first one is literally down a beach with no obvious trail through a ruined wall, where from the location talking to the quest giver is heavily obscured to a point that you wouldn't even notice it unless you were actively searching for it..... and this is a timed quest.  This is a quit moment for most people. I very nearly did. Hours of work wiped out with no clear way of fixing it due to bad quest design and bad troubleshooting design....I mean.. I suppose it does give you the full Bethesda experience though with a Zenimax twist. Beyond infuriating with time wasting bugs ( that aren't super common, which almost makes it worse)  Then the Developer also pushes super scummy tactics to try to force you to one of the most expensive monthly subs I've seen that is also for a game you have to pay for. They go out of their way to fill your inventory with items you can't bank so that you need to expand it. While giving you dozens of different crafting resource items that particularly early on you have no idea what you do and don't need. All to push you to buy the sub to get unlimited crafting space. Otherwise you are filling your bank, bag and chest with stuff and spend 1/4-1/2 of your time just resource managing. This is from a game that as I say makes you buy the game. Then buy expansions. As well as buy extra DLCs or pay a sub that if you stop paying you lose access to the DLCs of course. Oh and of course the first major city is filled with quest givers for DLCs you don't have without any way to know this as the look just like normal quest givers. Basically a nice way to waste your time and try to make you sink enough time to buy the DLCs so it doesn't feel wasted. (it is a seriously scummy tactic...)To buy the full game will cost well over $400CAD (w/o sub). And they still want you to get a nearly $20CAD a month Sub for quality of life improvements. Honestly do not buy this game at full price. Spend as little as humanly possible. Or play a more honest game. Other games my be P2W but most are honest about it. This game legit uses psychological and annoyance tactics to try to lock you into long term purchases or large upfront costs... so honestly spend as little as possible. As for the game it self. Meh. The combat is crosshair targeting... but the crosshairs are so off kilter in 3rd person you will  miss targets your eyes say your character is pointed directly at, but your crosshairs are way off. This is adjustable but; it makes the combat feel mushy. Beyond that it is fine. Not amazing but fine. The Story line is super meh. I stopped playing the Beta and never came back to it because the main story is focused around the stupid Oblivion stuff from IV which I never cared for. The game is from the sky beam era of story telling. In part to use basically a copy of Rifts in game events. They are overly regular and they are... fine. The day night cycle is very good. The graphics are fine. The questing I will say is very good. Minus the bad and frankly lazy design decisions. I have not really had a single kill x number of creature y quests. (I did eventually get 1 quest like this)  This is very much a nice change. Combat is always for either farming mats or to get to a destination. (Or to kill a boss). That is the best thing I can say about it though. It is also the reason I have kept playing because the quest design is so refreshing. Just in a meh game. Most of my game as been about inventory management because I am constantly full on inventory space (by design) my bank is always full and so is a chest in a player ""housing"" area. The other positive... is Female characters get to wear clothing. It's not like Terra or BDO where I spent large amounts of time searching out trousers that covered both legs fully. From the start you are fully clothed and the guys that want to ogle their female toons can search for outfits to do that. Basically the best that can be said about the game is... if you get it for a deal and you are very cautious about how much you spend... it is worth giving a go. However at full price... and cost of Expansions. DLCs and Subs... it is 100% not worth the money. Honestly SWTOR is much more value for it's sub... and it's use of cash shop unlocks."
Negative,"Great to Epic RPG, below-average to average MMO.Feels like a single player game with the option to engage with others under poor latency conditions.If you're into Lore, Questing, Leveling and Housing you have to try this game, it's really good that way - It works that way.Overall though I'd not recommend you playing this game."
Negative,"It's very boring and rather disappointing. I've played all the Elder Scrolls games from Morrowind (the best!) on. I still have not really finished Morrowind after years, there's still locations that I haven't seen before. So what's wrong with it?- OP. Other people. Ocasionally it's quite fun when a whole lot of peole get stuck into killing a mob of monsters. - OP. Other people. Then someone else kills the monster I have been hacking away at and got down to 1 % life. They whip in, one hit, get the goodies. Great. I have to kill it agai - after waiting for a spawn...-OP. Other ?people? Or children? So, immersion? What immersion? Hundreds of (I hope!) 12 year olds acting like 12 year olds turns the game into a kid's playground.  Ruins any involvement fo me, so I avoid the towns and go round edges at funny hours looking for peace and quiet.It's not all bad. I play it from time to time, but compared with a real Elder Scrolls game, it's disappointing. If you don't care about that I suppose it's OK."
Negative,"I like running around in Tamriel as much as anyone else, but that doesn't happen much any more. :-( There have been so many problems with Steam accounts tied to ESO, that I just can't recommend the Steam version. If you want to play the game, please buy it directly from their website.It's actually a fun MMO, and it has a vast amount of things to do. I like to run solo a lot, but grouping is easy and actually fun! But the fact that when I try to play and often there's a problem with the Steam version...that's just not good.Oh, also, the total number of hours in game is quite skewed. A lot of times I log out of the game and walk away to go to bed, and accidentally leave the launcher running, which inflates the number of hours played. I haven't actually put in that many hours."
Negative,1/10 would play more
Negative,this game gave me a fucking migraine
Negative,I simply cannot login in to this game to play.... What a waste of money...
Negative,"I stopped playing for three years and just recently came back to it. It's amazing how practically nothing has changed to improve the game mechanics. PVP is a lagfest joke.  If you don't like Pay-to-Win games, you won't like this one."
Negative,"Where to start? The skills system is convoluted and every class is essentially the same - you are limited by a 5 ability hotbar and a weapon swap system. The result is combat where you mash buttons, there is no depth. The voice acting is... Not the worst but also not the best. The game has menus inside menus inside more menus: it's UI hell. Many quests are simply ""talk to 12 people all over town"", (not an exaggeration) which results in a waste of 50 minutes of your time. The quest journal itself is an absolute mess - it doesn't even begin to track the steps you have completed, meaning half the time unless you listen to dialogue for 70% of your session you don't know what the hell is going on. And even then the quests seem to have been written by 10-year-old roleplayers, they stretch the dialogue to unreasonable lengths and are intentionally vague to get more mileage than is warranted. A quest line in TES3,4, or 5 for instance would last a few hours. In this a similar quest line will drag on for 7 or 8 across multiple zones if necessary. Doling out bits of info as you play errand boy.Microtransactions are abundant, and even though the game says you can play for free after you purchase all the content it's functionally a lie. Bank space, bag space, and gold are *severely* limited unless you spend in-game currency or by a subscription. On top of that the actual crafting systems while expansive are totally convoluted: you are expected to master *all* of them, and have the inventory to do so. As a result the game isn't worth buying on the basis that there won't be a monthly fee."
Negative,"This game has a really cool and refreshing combat system. The block mechanic means you dont just cast a spell that will block for you and your team and automatically blocks incoming abilities, instead you have to click your mouse button and predict or react to mobs abilities or auto attack animations. Honestly, the game did a lot correctly in the sense that there was a trinity, there were leaderboards, cool visuals etc.Now, Why do I not reccomend this? So to begin with I didn't play much of the game but that was the issue - I was bored. The start of the game was interesting because I had a new combat system to play with and a tonne of things to get my head around. But then once I hit around level 9-10 I just kept seeing the same thing over and over again. The stairways to dungeons were the same, the bridges used the same design, the mobs were the same and there was an awkward leap between questing levels meaning I was either breezing through mobs or getting my butt handed to me meaning I had to grind on mobs that don't give much exp. I just found myself bored by level 10 and that really isn't a good sign. It was feeling grindy already and that is meant to happen around level cap and due to the flexibility of each character, there is no real incentive to create new characters like in other mmo's. To be fair, I didn't play through on different characters but I predict that they would feel very repetitive. Every class/race can acess all the weapons - which is OK. BUT. There are no different skills - THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME as if you were to play it on a nightblade or a sorcerer or a Dragon knight.. This is really disappointing to see. I have played about 1000 hours of gw2 and what I loved about that game is there was a lot of variety. If you picked up a greatsword on a Mesmer it would have different skills and in this case a completely different range than if I was to use a greatsword on a warrior. This is an awesome feature as it kept the game fresh. I was so disappointed that ESO didn't include this. I understand what they were going for but they really ruined that for me. In summary, feel free to try out the game, the beginning is awesome for sure but if you have had MMO experience then I really don't see how you would hit lvl 50 or VR16 and maybe even make some alts, because its just a lot of the same content which is a massive shame. There is some awesome nostalgia from Skyrim - not as much as we would hope but it is there. Hope this helps you make a decision. I realise I stated pros and cons but maybe it will make up your mind. If it were me, I wouldn't listen to some review on steam and I would want to try it for myself but this is just me giving my piece of mind."
Negative,the servers needs real work game lags bad in PVP and randomly everywhere else. Game cash randomly expressly after Sumer set release. don't know what Zos is doing but am thinking of finding another game to play because I am not getting what I paid for with all the lag
Negative,"Welcome to Elder Bowels Online!Here you can enjoy the next biggest shithole of an MMO!It's like playing WoW except you pay to hold more items once you fill up your crap sack after ten minutes. (By the way, this is a subscription. You must buy it monthly to keep it.)Big numbers = funPrepare for inflation, get those millions of damage hits that hardly grind on anything at your level.Join the brotherhood, become apart of the thieves guild, all these fun things all for their own separate prices because they're DLC.Why would Sithis accept you if you can't even given him 3.50$ mission?Own a house and decorate it with everything you can (just make sure you're a premium member of course, otherwise you get limits!)Mounts, tattoos, colors, decorations, armors, so much stuff, and it only costs your wallet to have! Why wait? Buy now while they are still on a few cent lower discount!Dare change your mind and want a refund? Good luck idiot, you waited two hours just downloading the fucking game, no refund for you."
Negative,"I found the game impressive in it's own ways when I started playing. The first thing you'll notice is that you can't just pick up everything you run into. It's a new problem that's finding its way into games, but staggering progress to limit what you can do in a day is very much at play in this installment of the Elder Scrolls. Once I got halfway through the possible progress of what you can level, I found myself queuing up for dungeons and running them ad nauseum every day. Not because I had to (which you will if you want item sets), but because it was the only part of the game where I had any real contact with people. Single players are everywhere, but there's no real reason for anyone to take the time to interact.It's a good game if you have nothing to do, but not if you want something to do."
Negative,"Totally waste of money, if your expecting something epic like skryim, well its not gonna happen.Quests are boring and repetitive, gameplay is bad, all the best content is in DLC format. Its a nope for me.3/10"
Negative,Can't get past the loading screen in the launcher :c
Negative,"Just got to play this game for free but couldn't go further the dreadful  ""name already in use""  and the imperial race locked behind a paywall..Might appear as dumb reasons to some to instantly quit a game but for me these are a deal-breaker..Oh well  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  at least I saved time to spend in other games"
Negative,"Combat sucks. Feels like I'm swinging dead fish at the enemy.Combat text is off by default for some reason?Got to level 7 and killed maybe 5 things. The rest of the time was spent running around talking to npcs for ""quests.""Players, when rarely seen, are laggy. Opening doors felt delayed as well.All in all, should be free to play if anything. It's hardly good enough for that..."
Negative,"I've been a fan of the elder scrolls games for many years. Getting to explore each province, and to see what kinds of people and monsters dwelled within them has always been an absolute joy, especially when it comes to learning it lore. However ESO is nothing like those games. If i had to use one word to describe it, it would be ""artificial"". For starters the game neither plays or feels like an elder scrolls game. Sure its an mmo that's to be expected, however tamriel feels just alien. Npcs dont move around, only main quest npcs have a story, any other character is just there to sell or make the city feel alive. Unfortunetly the game fails to accomplish this as well. The world feels dead, when i walked the deserts of hammerfell, I didnt feel like i was in hammerfell. I felt as if I was in a place pretending to be that very province. I also found myself for the first time, uninterested in the lore or the characters. It all just felt the same and mundane, nothing made me care about the world I was in. To top it all off, th massive number of players running around just felt distracting and at times overwhelming. Now many could argue that an mmo world is suppose to have players all over the place- thats the point. My only response to such an arguement is this: if thats the case, then maybe a franchise like the elder scrolls was never meant to be multiplayer."
Negative,"Heya traveller!God... ESO is a game, that's where we all agree!But, let me begin with the pros:PROS:-You actually get to explore Tamriel! (A large part of it, if you want more, then pay!)-The graphics are good for the time it came out-You don't really have to pay for anything in the crown-shop, it's pretty much all cosmeticCONS:-The combat is absolute ass: Like, seriously, it doesn't have that nice feeling of, for example, Skyrim. Everything simply bounces off and does significantly less damage than in, again, Skyrim. (Even with completely unarmored or really lightly armored enemies)-The story is pretty lame: I never really had any type of interest in the story here or in any of the side-quests. It all felt so boring.-The dialogues are uninteresting: Have you ever felt like your life is boring? Then do not fret, for the dialogues of ESO have arrived! I almost fell asleep by how much and how untinteresting the dialogues were in this game.-The quests are trash: It's pretty much mostly the same for every quest. Here, I'll list the three types of quests I fell over in my playtime here on Steam!; Walk from A to B; Go there, raid that dungeon and come back to me; Head to that location, kill XY/ kill XY amount of enemies there and return to me.-Bethesda/Todd Howard have their stinky little corporate fingers in it: Let's be honest, we all hate Bethesda/Todd Howard. Now, that's not against the devs, but more against the marketing part of Bethesda. Of course, Bethesda is not on a level such as EA or Acitivision, but they're still near that!Alright, traveller, I hope you got at least a bit reason to buy/not to buy this game. If you do and enjoy it, then Congrats! You have a vastly different taste than me! But if not... just buy Skyrim, Oblivion or Morrowind. All three of them are far better."
Negative,"Avoid at all cost to buy it from steam, causes more problems than needed.Steam litteraly do nothing for this game. You'd be better off just buying it straight from the ESO site.Don't do the same mistake I did.Not to mention that any attempt to verify/backup the game through steam will result in all game files being deleted because steam believes them to be corrupt (when they 100% are not) and require you to download the entire game again.So do avoid it on Steam."
Negative,"I was quite disappointed. I had been eyeballing this game for years and my girlfriend really wanted to try it out as well so we got it together to play with one another. I've played free-to-play games better than this. I can't believe this costs money and that it was over 100GBs of space to install for what you're getting. Witcher 3 is half the size and one million times better.The combat is atrocious at best and this is what truly killed it for me. The hit detection is non-existent. I could back up some 10-15 feet from my enemy and they still hit me with fists or a short one handed weapon. Basically melee combat is a joke, Oblivion was better and that's what, 13 years old now?The ranged combat isn't any better either. I really wanted to be an archer but when you draw an arrow it auto fires. In other words you can't draw an arrow and wait for your aim to be right and then release when you choose to, you instead just click and hold and your character slowly fires arrow after arrow on its own...and I mean SLOWLY.Dungeon crawling is boring as all can be. We move from one area to the next, near impossible to sneak as all enemies somehow auto-hear you and turn around. We kill them, we move to next area, oops need to retreat a bit and heal or something, nope previous enemies respawn after a time limit of a few mins so that other players can get kills too. The respawning wouldn't be so bad if the combat wasn't so awful. Gets to be such a lame grind after first few mins, I can't believe people find this fun. Oh well, to each his/her own.Glad I only spent $10 for this joke. Should be free-to-play with how poorly built this game is and I still wouldn't play it even then."
Negative,it suck ball
Negative,"The game is mediocre but the Steam version is a piece of trash. You must have to link your ESO account to the Steam account or else you can't play, at all."
Negative,"Fun up until level 10, it has waaaayyy too much grind in it, and way too much running. not like skyrim, has more of a cheap mmo game feel to it."
Negative,"Make no mistake, my playtime is 100% from the update launcher."
Negative,"Updating my review. I have over 19k hours of play time, so clearly I enjoyed ESO for quite a while and I had ESO plus for most of it. I have not played since October 10. High Isle was underwhelming, Tales of Tribute felt like a vanity project we had forced upon us. The Crown store is out of control. Update 35 was unhelpful and unnecessary, it's exhausting to have to rebuild characters , and it felt like the developers are not listening to the players. I would like to come back, but I just don't see it right now."
Negative,"Honestly, I can't recommend it. The DLCs aren't packaged all together. I stupidly thought that if I bought the highest Collection Edition, I would get everything. NOPE. Want to join the Thieves Guild? That's 2000 crowns and the only packs they sell are 1500 & 3000. That's ok... there'll only be special boxes scattered throughout the map that only Thieves Guild members can pick up. Want to join the Dark Brotherhood (arguably the coolest faction)? That's another 2000 crowns that isn't part of any DLC pack. Plus the low inventory space that you can rent... not buy extra space for. Yeahhh, f*ck your Free to play paid game tactics."
Negative,"I played this game because it was recommended for the good ""pvp"" experience. For an MMO, I suppose it is, but not really. For reference, I very much enjoyed Warhammer Online while it lasted. I was an officer in a very competitive guild in Planetside II, and levelled seven or eight builds to cap in SWTOR (largely by PVP). My ideal MMO would be Mechwarrior online, but with open world PVP as in ESO or planetside. (That game would be amazing.) I pretty much loathe PVE levelling in any game. (SWTOR aside - it has very good stories for the Sith characters.) So I DL'd this on special and thought, what the heck?What I am looking for in PVP?- Design choices that matter more than gear or hours ground into levelling- Able to contribute to my team/side/faction/unit from the beginning- Tactical play, where positioning reactions, and awareness matterIn short, I've been playing for months, and levelling by PVP is so slow that none of these factors come into play as a newb. The game penalizes you for being new by keeping your movement speed low (in non-combat situations) as you slowly buy speed for your horse. Over sixty days. For most of that time, you will lag behind any group you might be a part of, and thus vulnerable to being ganked by stealthers. Super annoying. Design choices might matter in the end game, but I don;t really care at this point. Your build can either spam heals or spam spells/arrows. . . it all feels ""same-y"" after a week or so. There are low-level servers, but they don;t have much pop in low levels, so it is even slower to gain xp :/ In the regular servers, there will be a lot of builds that are simply *invulnerable* to other builds, and can wade into opposing zergs and emerged pretty much unscathed. I have no idea what those people did to get such builds, but it certainly involved a very long grind. It's broken and annoying. PVP tactics consist of zerging from one keep to another, break down the wall, kill the inhabitants, rinse, repeat. You will gain and lose keeps, and that's rewarded, but in the long run, there's little variety in which you actually do. It's true that the open-field fights *can* be really, really fun, but those are exceptional compared to sieges. To be fair, the PVE is probably really, really fun if you are into that sort of thing. The stories are waaay better than WOW, not nearly as good as SWTOR. But there is one central quest line for EVERY alt that you level, and so it gets super boring super quickly. I don't need to watch the Prophet explain ancient history for 30 minutes over and over again for each alt, thanks :/ I wish I could rate this as a ""meh"" instead of a thumbs-down. PVP wise, it's good filler until something else comes along. PVE is probably great for a lot of people, but not my cuppa."
Negative,Bought the imperial edition and was pretty excited to give the game a try.  Unfortunately the poorly designed patcher is having problems with version errors and what not.  After 2 hours of repairing the install with the patcher and following ESO help topics about deleting files and whatnot I gave up.Thank god for Steams new refund policy which allowed me to get my money back.  Big thumbs up to Steam for that change that protects us from poor game design issues like this.
Negative,"The game itself is very good, but the lag time from log in screen to character screen is 30 sec. That is crazy!! The developer and Tech don't let you know about downtime on their launcher and how long the game will be down. Last time it was down for  two days. If they do a patch , you can log in but you can't get to character screen and if you go to the Tech support, they give you a cookie cutter response and say it is fixed. The next time they patch, which is alot, guess what same problem!!! I have canceled and deltete this game!!!"
Negative,"Not bad story when over powered people arnt 1-2 shotting people all around you, monetization feels awful with how the upgrades work and are priced (1500 for one outfit slot on one character just eww) and the CE upgrade screws the value of the in game equals so you dont get all items you would if you would get them with crowns instances are nothing specialdidnt do much pvp"
Negative,Would rather watch paint dry
Negative,"In the 6.9 hours logged on this game, i have not even been able to play it. This is terrible. The code provided to me did not work, and it downloaded through steam, and AGAIN through the site. i do not reccomend this game"
Negative,"Class customization is nice for the variance it offers- you can really take any skills in any class, which could be considered a negative but I like it. Hotbar just a little small, could use maybe two-four more ability slots. Character creator isn't the worst, but ultimately produces boring characters, every time. Voice acting still sounds like they read the lines in alphabetical order for any quest that isn't a primary one. You have to pay for anything fun or decorative but the game can be enjoyed without spending any money, it just gets a little frustrating. PvP and Dungeons are enjoyable. Cult classic if you're willing to sit through/look past the microtransactions. Solid 5/10."
Negative,"You'll notice I've put a lot of time into this game. That would logically make you think I like it, that I'd recommend it. Well, here's the thing: I did. But we're currently through an event that ""encourages"" us to enter the PvP areas in order to get our daily ticket for exclusive, time-sensitive items. Now this game is roughly 99% PvE, if not greater. If you aren't specifically kitted out for PvP, you'll die nearly instantly. If you're a healer, you'll die nearly instantly. So as a result, this just means literally thousands of players are trying to complete one of two daily quests-- and being relentlessly, mercilessly farmed in a large PvP area over and over again by players that can turn invisible and one-shot most PvE players. It turns a 5-10 minute activity into over an hour at times. And not a fun hour. An hour of frustrating respawning in an extraordinarily poorly designed, user unfriendly PvP zone. So yeah, the game has amazing story content and immersion. Except for when they force you to be punished for two weeks straight or miss out on exclusive items. Whoever greenlit this is a real sadist."
Negative,This is kind of a mess. The whole thing just feels sloppy and pointless. It feels like there is no reason to progress. and the world feels fragmented in every possible way. Meh.
Negative,"this game is not like skyrim, it isn't really fun, and i had friends to play it with, we all made a character to try this MMO and man, it didn't live up to skyrim. very disappointed with this game, it is slow and nothing special. i wanted to like this game and i think that is why i was so let down by it. dont buy this game."
Negative,"At last Zenimax made a a patch that crossed the red line, the scaling of gear and merging of all factions has completely murdered the enjoyment you get out of questing in your own pace. Now you see people fighting over gathering materials and people waiting for monsters to respawn everywhere while they curse at eachother, this sounds much like what you experienced in world of warcraft and there is a reason why i no longer play that game and now this.The only regret i have is that i wasted my precious time with this game and gave Zenimax the benefit of the doubt."
Negative,"this game looks good at first however the more you level up you understand that its just a money grab, late game is very very boring and the pvp is laggy as fuck, also there is no arena, very average MMO and abysmal RPG."
Negative,Unplayable without a subscription if you even consider getting into crafting. A cash shop disguised as a video game. A game that is as wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle. A game that just keeps becoming more degenerate as time goes on. I will not be returning.
Negative,"TL:DR; another bland MMO with no life, no soul, and it doesn't borrow much (if anything) from what makes the Elder Scrolls games so great.The community has been complaining about the combat for 4+ years. It's well known this game has the worst combat of all the MMORPGs. Have they done anything to address it? Nope. It's such a shame really, the world is nice, the game is pretty, the sound outstanding. Why is the combat so dull? The gameplay is very bland and repetitive.  You feel like one of the many instead of the central part of the story. It's a typical MMORPG with some gimmicks to the combat. But unfortunately, it's just a mess. Having to pick a set class in an Elder Scrolls game is just wrong on so many levels. The skill system is very uninviting, and the actual combat doesn't require much strategy at all. Just hit a few buttons, maybe dodge or block or interrupt a few enemy skills. Nothing new, and it certainly doesn't feel like an Elder Scrolls game. The character building makes 0 sense. You'll feel like you want to take your class a certain way but your forced to go another that really doesn't seem to fit the class. Just odd choices all around.If you absolutely HAD to make an MMO ES game, why not make it JUST like ES? Instead it's just like the 100s of other MMORPGs out there, with some tacked on ES lore. It's a lazy cash in on a great IP that has been sullied by this games existance instead.The only good part of this game is the lore and the world - very true to TES. Gameplay, leveling/character building, itemization, spell casting, crafting, all are not true to TES.I'm just so desperate for more Elder Scrolls I took the plunge. Another life lesson learned. Maybe you can at least learn from my mistake. Back to Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim I go."
Negative,don't do it
Negative,WORST COMBAT EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Negative,i did dolmens for 2 days then contemplated suicide for a year.
Negative,"Im sure its a great game, if you can actually get it to work, have now downloaded the game from steam 42GB's, 3 times and the update on the launcher 27GB's, 3 times. Tryed multiple things to repair it with no luck"
Negative,"Just super boring to be honest, plus graphics look like crap. A watered down TES game."
Negative,"I let a friend access my Steam library through family library sharing so they could try this game. But for some reason, it tied the game to their account and I learned there is no way to undo it since I am no longer in contact with that friend. So even though I own the game, I can't even play it. Cool, thanks."
Negative,"Just... stay away from it.I would really like to praise its good parts. And yes, the game had (and still has) some potential. But it's just a total destroyed mess. They even proceeded to butcher their own game over the years. If you try to start anew, you will not simply be overwhelmed by all the stuff they put in: They completely destroyed the world, lore and story. Even the gameplay doesn't make any sense anymore. It's simply just a waste of time.If you like the elder scrolls series:Don't touch it. You WILL definitely be disappointed.If you like good story:They tried but failed. It's basically the same poorly staged stuff as in SW:TOR.If you find some of the features intruiging:Don't fall for it. They did not deliver to bring ""anything"" meaningful to life. It's just generic MMO stuff.If you like compelling and interesting combat:Forget it. They managed to completely destoy the elder scrolls real time combat system and made it a tab-target mess with funny colors flashing all over the screen.If you like a beautiful, interesting and living world:It looks just better on screenshots. The world is completely dead and static. The visuals are very eerie (e.g. lighting, shadows, materials) and feel artificial and boring. Even the character animations are somehow weak. Additionally, the megaservers keep the world almost completely empty. It feels like a very old and dead theme park (it is).If you like a demanding difficulty level:Don't touch it. You simply ""can't"" die. You can run around and pull as many enemies as you want: Even mages ""don't"" die. You can even do 5-player dungeons as a 2-player group and ""tank"" as a mage. I guess there are some more challenging instances. But the game overall is made for brain damaged zombies."
Negative,"I cant get into this game , everytime i try to launch it through steam it stays on loading screen for as long as i can bare to sit and stare at it........ every now and never it works but i have maybe played 1 or 2 hours out of the 20+ i have spend whatching the loading screen . i have un-installed , and re-installed still nothing , you released a patch and still nothing after i sit and download it thinking you have fixed the problem....... At this point no i wont be recomending this game to anyone as it dosent work .......... but from the 2 hours i have played it seemed like a bad ass game."
Negative,"This is a good game if it works. Which it doesnt. At writing of this review my last days experience are login queues, 10 or more minutes loading screens to just transition, broken group finder, broken guild vendors, basically everything is broken which requires server-loading. And these problems arent new they are present since months. I would suggest you wait some months and check bug-/general forum if the situation gets better. No point in paying for something you cant use, but thats up to you."
Negative,Bought the game and now I have to buy dlc? Okay.
Negative,"bought the game to only log in, wait out the loading screen, then disconnect without even making my first character. nice, 10/10 gameplay"
Negative,The game just annoys you into paying a monthly fee. Want to gather crafting resources? Well its gonna clog up your inventory unless you pay 15$ a month for space.
Negative,"I got the game and nothing would work. I kept getting errors and nothing was wrong, I would recomend getting this off the ESO webpage"
Negative,"If I could get the game to work, it would be awesome. However, I would find myself uninstalling and re-installing the game every few weeks. Now it just doesn't work at all. I've exhausted all forms of help and patches, would be a great game if it would actually work. If anybody has any advice about what I could to get game working again, I'm all ears."
Negative,Bought the game 06-14-2017. Had 4 nights where the servers were down and countless other times where the lag made the game unplayable. I am uninstalling and requesting refunds for my wife and I. The game was fun when you can play it.
Negative,"I tried SO hard to like this game...I really did, but I'll bite my arms off if I get another ""investigate 3 sites"" quest. Seriously. Also, never got into a dungeon. Dungeon finder just never got me into a group, even after half hour waits...it's so sad. The game is beautiful, even if the armor all looks generic. And the combat...oh, god, the combat...so bland and unimaginative. Same rotation for EVERY enemy. Also just forget about any sense of progression since everything scales with you. I feel so bad after wasting time on this. I LOVED Skirym and Oblivion, and this game MIGHT fool you for a bit into thinking the sense of adventure will be comparable, but NAH..."
Negative,"Amazing game!  Triple A title!Here's the pro's-Trailer looked cool-Earned a trading card for 7 mins of windows 7 launcher permission screen-Only needed 5 minutes of windows 7 launcher permission screen to gain enough in game minutes to write review of game-I have more time for myselfCONS-Doesn't run with launcher-Game client not updated via 64bit exe, game shuts down. -Doesn't update client-Doesn't play period-Roughly 4 hours to download to have HDD space consumed. -High blood pressure-Abominal amounts of swearing involved.-Actually worse then starforge-Wasted money, like starforge"
Negative,"The endless lore and lands of Tamriel are robbed of their magic in The Elder Scrolls Online. ESO is unfortunately built like an MMO, and not an immersive roleplaying game like the numbered Elder Scrolls are. The provinces and lands feel segmented and detached from the world at large, making exploration unrewarding like your wandering around a theme park, not a living, breathing world. While ESO allows you to return to iconic locations like Morrowind or Skyrim, they are pale imitations of the true snapshot in time we can experience of those lands in their respective games. Not everything is bad; there's a lot on offer here if you like the MMO experience, but this feels like WOW wearing an Elder Scrolls skin and not a true Elder Scrolls experience. I bought this game in hopes of exploring the corners of Nirn; the main games haven't offered yet, but I feel ESO has sucked the magic out of the locations in-game books promised to be wild and astounding.   I cannot, in good faith, recommend this soulless husk of a fantasy realm. Go jump on the Nexus and just look for some mods to spice up your other Elder Scrolls games for another replay of Skyrim or Oblivion; your money is better spent on newer games."
Negative,"10 hours in, level 12, and no challenge whatsoever. It's like it came with cheats installed. No difficulty in combat, every quest leads you by the hand so there is no thought involved; no mental stimulation. Shame, because the lore and quests and storytelling had great potential. It could have been very immersive and rewarding if they didn't treat you like a 5 year old that would cry if you had the slightest difficulty. Uninstalled."
Negative,"I bought the game on steam today and then on Elder Scrolls Online first thing I tried was the option of LOG IN USING YOUR STEAM ACCOUNT option but it said: Steam version not present. Steam version of The Elder Scrolls Online is required to log in with Steam account details.I do have the game on steam though so wtf!!?? I tried running the exe's as admin and one worked and made a new account but could not login it would say my UN or PW was wrong and to launch via Steam if I had the steam version, when I launch the steam version it says connection to server timed out try again later.had to reinstall 3 times and still didn't work"
Negative,"You pay so much and receive so little in content for the price. You would think you were in a free to play game that was pay to win . Graphics are nice but the game isn't as fun and immersive as the other elder scrolls games. There are free to play games that give you more content for FREE than the base game here. This company is nothing but greedy just check the Crown store in game if your so unlucky to have paid for this and you will see what I am talking about. I have been playing video games for 30 years and I know a thing or two, and I cant remember a more expensive game than this. Just avoid this game and replay Skyrim or one of the older titles. Save yourself the frustration and save more of your money by getting something else."
Negative,You will spend far more time downloading gigantic 30 gb patches than actually playing.
Negative,ZOS does everything they can to stop players from playing solo in pvp. even if it means they have to put in an entire class to kill movement.
Negative,Accidentally hit guard in starting areaInsta killed by op guard NPC'sRespawn still with notorietyConfronted by guardThree options:pay bounty (not enough money)use some talent I dont have to intimidate themfighthave to fightdieskip to line 2 and repeat2/10 nice tutorial
Negative,"This game has great potential, gameplay and lore as all of the other elder scrolls games. But this game is simply unplayable, the first real enemies after tutorial are unbeatable, even 1v1. I highly do not recommend this game, but i recommend other great rpgs like neverwinter nights 2, oblivion, everquest 2, etc"
Negative,"After having played Bethesda's games for years and enjoyed it I thought that the torch would be handed to a worthy and capable company to carry on the legacy of Bethesda. HOWEVER I am extremely sad to say that this company is NOT worthy of the legacy and perverting the game as in Elder Scrolls Online is to belittle all of the previous company's work and effort.There is Nothing about this game that links it to its predecessors unless you count the ""world story"" which is quite nice and has many of the elements of the older games, but it is far from enough to make up for the fact that this game is a parody of Elder Scrolls.In the old games you would often find yourself so immersed in the game that you could literally jump in your seat from something unexpected happening in the game but it just doesn't happen here at all because it simply lacks the immersion factor of the older games.Factors that detract the most and make the game really bad:The characters, creatures and NPCs all have a BOX of graphics protection which means that your character occupies all the space inside the box although the box is bigger than the character, which makes movement clumsy and bulky. No more sneaking around and finding the best possible way into somewhere because there is NO other way in now, only one path exists and climbing is not even part of the game.Skill system and combat has been reduced to pretty much what you can expect from ANY other MMO, so it is extremely simplified and easy to use but offers NO real options or customization. It really doesn't matter much how you try to fight because in this game it is either very easy to complete something or very nearly impossible to without help.Crafting system and economy in general leaves the game again wanting because of simplification and ease of usage takes precedence over functionality and customization.Last but not least this new company is out to make money and it is not being shy about it either so if you are a poor person like me this game will only leave you cursing at rich spoiled people who just buy all they need ingame and don't have to work for it like I do, which of course leads to huge game imbalance between the have's and the have not's.Please Zenimax, give this game back to the original company and give them a try at making this a game I would like to play..."
Negative,"I wanted to enjoy this game.... but meh.The combat is bland, the skills are mediocre, the graphics in combat are subpar, and on and on. Combat is just 'meh'I would pick a neutral rating as for 10$ (on sale) there is a Ton to do and well worth that price just for kicks. But at full price, it really should bring something better to the table with combat - it is not worth full price but completely worth 10$. (since combat is the complete main focus)"
Negative,"I guess it would be fine if you just wanted to play an mmo in the elderscrolls universe but as a represenation of the elderscrolls franchise is pitiful. not to mention there are significantly better mmos you could be playing. I'm sticking to skyrim, oblivion and morrowind till the elderscrolls 6 comes out"
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FROM STEAM.Use the official ESO website, trying to download and use the Steam interface into the ESO servers DOES NOT work. I've been trying for 3 days to get into the game without any sucess. Steam will NOT issue a refund.The game itself is awesome, I've played on the PS4 for 2 years and wanted to get the PC experience with the Homestead update. Unfortunatly, trying to use Steam doesn't work for me. I'll get the game from ESO website or go back to PS4 at this point."
Negative,Fun until you realise half the game is locked and you have to pay extra money for the cool stuff.
Negative,ZM are greedy scumbags. This game is a mess.
Negative,"i want to play this game and i want to love it as i am a HUGE elder scrolls fan, but it is so badly optimized its unplayable. smh"
Negative,"While waiting dungeon queue for grinding levels I have plenty of time to write a review. As a fan of PVP and trading I can say that this game frustrates me. Battlegrounds till level 50 was awesome but after hitting 50 you get matched with maxed out players and you basicaly die in few hits (and I am undying warden. I just can guess how it is for leather or light armor wearers). You cant upgrade gear to even get close to compete with them till you are 160 cp so you can forget PVP for fun and PVP for grind 160cp is nightmare since you cant be useful for your team at deathmatch (90% of BG I get). Why I dont do quests for leveling? Because you need to quest for 4 hours to get same amount of xp as you get for 1 win at bg or 1 complete dungeon. I admit that quests are interresting if you like stories. But it's not the thing for me, I get quickly bored doing ""go there do that"" thing.Trading in this game is pain in the crane. Auctions are like from old school 2005'ish game. Ok the idea of having only guild auctions is interresting, but interface is terrible. You can't quickscan, search without addons is unusable, even with addons it's so slow and time consuming. If you want to post items for normal price you need first scan all auctions. You can scan 1 page every few seconds - imagine you have 4 trade guilds with ~100 pages of stuff. Do math and you will see how time consuming this is (ofcourse IF addon doesnt crash because ""Too many search in rapid succession."" Wth?).I wrote this while being in q for random dungeon. Already passed 20+min, and it's most busy time in EU."
Negative,Bricked my friend's PC. Would spend $20 plus subscription again.
Negative,"I like the game so far but what I don't like is that they force me to buy the morrowind dlc with the game. my friend bought the game and didn't have to buy the morrowind. and to add insult, if you buy the ESO with morrowind you will not get the collector's edition just the morrowind basic dlc and if you want the collectors edition you have to buy it seperately on it's original price. correct me if im wrong but I guess they should trim down the price if you already have the morrowind basic. since you already fade for some part that already in basic edition and you really just want to get the remaining part in the collector's edition."
Negative,"ESO became my main MMO in 2018 (don't play it through Steam, but have thousands of hours on it). Now though, I would not recommend it to anyone. It was always a rocky game, but performance seems to consistently get worse instead of better. ZOS and the devs are a joke, as well. They constantly ignore player feedback and make questionable changes/updates to the game. There's even censoring of players who don't support the direction the game has gone on the official forums. Most recently they even closed a forum where someone was asking if they should play ESO or WoW because apparently talking about other games and comparing them to ESO is not acceptable (like what are they scared of, really). The only people I know who still have nothing but good things to say about ESO are die-hard TES fans who don't even play other MMOs or online games. Seriously, just play something else.... anything else."
Negative,"I really liked the game at first, but poorly optimized graphics, and bad stuttering even on 80fps is not acceptable, and made me want to close the game. otherwise this game is very good, very wide game, but the problem is too little players, and i feel like i'm running around in my own alone world, trying to quest! the trade system sucks, item prices are unbalanced, and unknown, too easy to gather items, nobody buys them almost. also, this guild crap is unnecessary, why not bring worldwide trade in, trading just in guilds is crap. nobody cares about trading that way. quests are too much slow reading boring crap, like pokemon on nitendo, even worse stories!! the stories, are all about some ghost/spirit crap, then some weird magical bullshitt, nobody cares about. it's like stories for specially interested Sci-fi fans. easy crap is explained, over and over, with advanced english. the game itself is buggy, boring, and empty....i don't even feel like i'm earning anything here. but at first it was really fun, and promising, untill i explored everything almost..."
Negative,This is the most trash game you'll ever play it's SUPER pay to win and very laggy to the point where u can barely do anything and stare at ur enemy.  This game was fun bout 3-4 years ago but now it's complete doodoowater do not waste ur time with a game that bans people just for tbagging even when they tbagged 1st. ZOS only care about money and they do not give a single shit about their customers.
Negative,"Stay away from this game. The number of times it is off line for maintenance is annoying. The other down side is to be able to progress in this game you have to keep spending more money in the store. I must of spent about £400 so fare and I do not intend to spend any more on a game.  Collecting enough coin to extend your carry slots takes for ever more because for instance you get charged for travelling, changing outfits etc. The concept behind the game is fantastic but the company seems to want you to keep spending more and more of your money.  Never been a fan of a game where you have to be connected to the internet in order to play a game."
Negative,How tf u gon make ur game look like mongolian butt herpes and charge a grillion dollars for shitty dlcs
Negative,"Played since beta, there are times it works great, times it doesn't work at all, and times it wants to work but barely does. Weekly patches that are not needed are hit or miss if it works or not."
Negative,what the f*ck is this sh*t
Negative,"rise in price, stupid zos"
Negative,"Its FUN. When you have friends. I dont, so its not fun"
Negative,when you download 100 GB  for this game in steam you want to play and launch the game.... ooow what you see?? 70 GB update in launcher!!! after  download 100 GB in steam :)))
Negative,got past the tutorial then got my first quest in the open world to go into an instance...it crashed then couldnt log in my character...had to make another character then log them out to get my original character back in game...tried to zone in and it crashed again and now i cant log into either character....first quest game broken...100% garbage.
Negative,I loved this game to my soul but its just not the same for me anymore. catch myself playing it here and there but I cant honestly explain it. more push to buy buy buy and not ingame unlocks.upsetting to see more and more games be more greedy than community focused more.
Negative,it is Dec 30 2015  and so far i regret my purchass.  I was in the beta and as far as I can tell   game play has not changed  much if at all.     I still have had little luck in finding provision recipies  and had to resourt to exhstortion level prices on the player venders  as in  2500 gold for a bottom tier recipie.   I do not recomend this glob of code they call a game.  I would even go as far as to caution you even if it was free  as a waste of quality game time.
Negative,"Everytime I go back to Elder Scrolls Online, im reminded of why I shouldnt play Elder Scrolls Online."
Negative,skyrim is better and the prafacy 10/10 whould steal yor information agian
Negative,The game is crap because of a lot of random players running around which I cannot switch off. It destroys immersion and story altogether. Atmosphere like in supermarket or a train station
Negative,"The game per se is not that bad, however if you're looking for a PvP game, this one is no so friendly anymore. ZOS seems to care less about the huge reports about lead screens, crashes and terrible lags when there are many people around in PvP areas. They keep improving the game with DLCs but they seem to refuse to believe their server does not support the numbers anymore."
Negative,oh please you are all full of it. even firefall right now is a better game than this. Not firefall in the good old days. No that one is a master piece next to this garbage. This is just a glorified single player game. You can't do main quests with your friends. Also main quest are stupid short and easy. Not to mention that the enemy is ridiculously easy to kill. This is a game for little kids or for players with very low skill level in games in general. Garbage. Sad thig I couldnt get my money back cause it took for ever to download it. So the two hours limit was gone. F U bethesdathis expression sums up what I was thinking while playing this game https://media.giphy.com/media/Qe5oD5aXjEbKw/giphy.gif
Negative,"This is my first thumbs down review on Steam1- Not only was it a boring game, but also I experienced unplayble Ping. Addinally, the missions were repetitive. 2- The Map is so large that I cannot remember some places unlike The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.3- The Combat and Mage mechanic was not my cup of tea.4- Despite the fact that Rockstar Games consideres having microtransaction, but It's possible to obtain in-game items by grinding for several hours. In this game, even furniture items must be payed with real money(Pets, mounts, Armour, Weapons, abilities, races etc).5- Downloadable Contents are more expensive than the base game.(Jesues christ £48...)6- The game size is 100GB, filling 10% of my precious storage.I played this Game for 7.1 hours, and I didn't enjoy at all. Maybe I was wrong about EA(Sad Sims 4 and Sims 3 999+ DLC noises)In the end, Video Games that used to be Singleplayer, should not become a Multiplayer game; In fact, It's the biggest mistke they made from left to right)I don't reccomend this game at all unless you're a blood thirsty of Bethseda."
Negative,"I love this game, as you can tell by the number of hours recorded on Steam, not to mention the hours that haven't been recorded. It's probably one of the most fully fleshed-out worlds in any MMO. I've played most of the big ones, and they can't come close to what ESO can do. So why am I not recommending this game? Because the launcher is horribly broken and has been so for months. I'd always hoped that ZOS would listen to the players who keep having an issue with getting the game to even download in the first place, let alone patch itself whenever necessary. They keep taking people's money and not fixing this at all. What's worse is that they blame everyone else but themselves for this issue, saying that it's a problem with the ISPs and not them. Which is hilarious because I never had a problem with game patching or downloading until I started playing ESO. To be fair, there are ways to get around this issue manually, but I'm not paying $15 to have to do this every single time they patch something. You may or may not have this issue, but a lot of people are and will continue to do so until ZOS finally decides that it's something they want to fix. Until then, don't bother."
Negative,kinda boring tbh. wow is more fun.
Negative,Loading times are insane.
Negative,"A really fun, money thirsty MMO. Almost impossible to have a good amount of fun without paying a subscription (and with that subscription, you don't get the latest DLC until a year after it's out and the hype is done). You can permanently buy the dlc, but for a higher price.It's a bethesda game alright, fun in some aspects, terrible in others.EDIT:Since a dev responded; I love the game and have so much fun with it, but it feels like I'm buying the game over and over. You pay for the game. To have fun, you pay for a subscription. To get the latest content you pay another $40-$60. Even if you're a member, you don't get greymoor, or blackwood."
Negative,"Despite not being a free-to-play game, major portions of content are locked behind subscriptions and purchases. The combat is fairly boring, consisting of just spamming your most powerful skill over and over, and the tiny carry weight prevents you from just mindlessly looting everything and then selling it. Quite a few things aren't even worth the trouble to loot, as they're worth no gold. This is a massive game (around 98G), but the content is fairly low quality.If you're looking for an online version of skyrim to play with friends, this is not it.If you're looking for a good MMO to grind away on, there are ones with more interesting mechanics out there."
Negative,"Just about the only reason why you would want to play this is if you are already planning on playing with others. The way the game runs you through the first little bit like a tutorial is shoddy at best, it ""encourages"" micro-transactions in order to look cool and basically forces your class into one of the main 3 stereotypes- warrior, archer, or mage. If you're looking for an in-depth MMO, this is NOT it. Unlike the trailers, you are ALWAYS in 3rd person, the graphics are MUCH worse, and the enemies are much more of a pushover. The devs also made next to no effort to allow anyone with different builds to stand out (again, only 3 main classes) so you have next to no feeling of accomplishment from this one. All around, a POS."
Negative,"Elder Scrolls Online: A Fun Game on a Crumbling FoundationElder Scrolls Online is running on a 24-year-old engine, and it shows. While the action-based combat and voiced quests are enjoyable, they don’t make up for the game’s severely outdated look and feel. Despite being the 7th largest MMO/ARPG by population, the game feels ancient in comparison to newer titles. Character models, in typical Bethesda fashion, are just plain ugly. No one’s asking for a ""waifu upgrade,"" but some basic physics or visual improvements would have been a step in the right direction.For a game that’s been around for a decade, it's embarrassing that World of Warcraft, an even older game, outshines ESO in both beauty and functionality. If WoW didn’t rely on its outdated tab-targeting system, it would likely steal ESO’s players outright. Zenimax Online Studios (ZOS) clearly isn’t interested in investing in a much-needed engine upgrade, despite the wealth of monetization strategies they use beyond the subscription model. With all that cash flowing in, you’d think they could reinvest some of it into improving the game.Instead, ZOS seems more focused on their next ""big MMO"" while ESO slowly withers away. I’ve logged almost 1900 hours in the game, so I’ve had fun, but it’s clear to me that the game has become a cash cow for ZOS and Bethesda. They have no intention of putting in the effort to make this game truly shine. I fully expect ESO to be sold off to a ""graveyard"" MMO company like Broadsword once the player base shrinks to the point that it’s no longer profitable.It’s a shame to see a game with such a legendary IP being left to slowly die, but that’s where we’re headed."
Negative,"This game is probably the most boring I have ever played - the combat is okay though i would imagine most would deem it to be subpar, any glimmer of immersion is immediately ruined by random players running around, the quests are, unlike what the community seems to want you to believe, the most boring I have ever experienced in any game ever and also the only thing you will be doing for a very, very long time; they consist of mostly boring npc dialogue you are better of spamming through and then maybe you get to fight like 3 guys at the end that all die in a microsecond and even if you stood there for a minute wouldn't be able to kill you (this is a trend that continues throughout almost all of the game, absolutely no difficulty full baby mode) woo amazing this game needs more actual combat less talking, running around and triggering a loading screen every 2 fucking seconds. Gathering and leveling up doesn't feel good even if it tries to make you by making your character fucking clap which just comes off as incredibly out of place and cringeworthy and the monetization of this game despite being a pay to play game disgusts me, selling numerous content dlcs which are the last thing that belong in an MMO and a paid subscription, which, from what I heard becomes basically required at some point while also locking off key quality of life features they strategically withhold from you to make you have to pay for them. Give this game a pass for your own good."
Negative,"Absolutely the biggest waste of data I've ever seen. All the time played is on the login screen, maybe make the first login boss a little easier, idk? Fought the username boss no problem, the password boss was harder, was time gated and had spam filter spell. Next battle was the link account boss for some reason the"" connection to server timed out"" spell has no cool down so they are basically impossible to beat. Save your data download that will let you get past the login screen."
Negative,first hour in im ganna say cool but once u play this and expect a skyrim consept ..skyrim is 3x better then the online i bet its fun with alot of freinds but the first hour was just hunting for somthing to get me into this game im sorry to say this was not what i was looking for..
Negative,Has 1k hrs of play maybe 2 or 3k then it gets boring
Negative,i bought the game it sucks that u got to pay but the game doesnt look good ass it seen so isnt worth buying if i had read the comments before buying i wouldnt trust me as soon as my subscription expires im canceling
Negative,No risk vs reward.
Negative,ESO has the absolute worst development team in MMOs. Do yourself a favor and get hooked on literally any other game.
Negative,Im very disappointed by the fact that there aren't any lore friendly mounts at ANY of the stables. I EXPECT there to be region specific mounts at each stables. I stopped playing for that reason. Any Real fan of the elder scrolls should also expect this and be mad. This is disrespectful to the fan base.
Negative,"Life is too short and this is a cookie cutter MMO where everything is boring and you press E to skip all dialogue, move to a thing and press mouse 1 until said thing is dead. Can't bear with it. It literally breaks canon in the series, introduces a bunch of species and items that make 0 sense.The tutorial Dark Elf copy paste lady told me: 'Nice, we make a great team!' YOU WILL NEVER SEE A DARK ELF SAY THESE WORDS TO ANYONE, ESPECIALLY AN ASSASSIN.0/10 You get captured by slavers but someone rescues you but you can move freely after all and now you do fetch quests and pay for it."
Negative,"I'm gonna delete the whole novel I almost wrote and just say this;Do I enjoy it? Yes.Do I enjoy waiting almost a week or two to finish researching  ONE. WHOLE. TRAIT.  out of the however many I have in the personal bank, with my only ways of making gold being Antiquity farming, yelling out in zone chats, or just selling a whole fancy kidney I found in a dungeon in order to try and buy instant researching scrolls from the guild merchants because this game lacks a proper auction house system? No. No I do not.Do I enjoy running around like a kwama without it's head because there's no proper quest tracking for completed or yet-to-be completed quests? Meh. I enjoy the exploration so it's a double edge sword there.Do I recommend it? Not unless you have money to throw at ESO+ but there's a lot of content base game without ESO+, or even just the base DLCs. Yes, I said base DLCs. Because for some reason they have Story DLC to  continue the Story DLC. Again, I'm playing without the subscription atm but I wouldn't recommend picking up this game unless you got the 13-15 bucks a month to pay for ESO+ or just money to throw at buying crowns.Don't ask about PVP. I haven't touched, nor do I trust, PVP in any MMO."
Negative,"Bought the game on sale while ago. The basic feel is a bit clunky but otherwise okay.The real bummer is that when you get into the game all kinds of small things start to inconvenience you to push the premium currency.Want to level crafting? Run around randomly ten hours to find stuff or... buy crafting materials with premium currency?Found the crafting materials? Too bad your bag is so small it's a bitch to carry all the different kinds of crafting items----> Buy a bigger bag with premium currency/plus membership.If you enjoy paying extra to avoid all the small annoying stuff, this game is for you.Tamriel is here and it's...inconvenient?"
Negative,At first I was thrilled by the blending of Elder Scrolls rpg with the MMO experience and many of the game mechanics but since then I have had constant display issues and bug because of this game. I have tried extensive searches for solutions but none worked and as a Steam user I am bared from their support forums so I can't even submit a ticket. At this point the game is unplayable and I feel cheated out of my money.
Negative,Can't recommend this since the mouse input is so janky and laggy that I wasn't able to play for more than a few minutes without having to refund it.
Negative,"Game logs and drops out. Gamepad does not work.... stay away, and it has little to do with real ESO"
Negative,"For a B2P game it's not half bad. Pros:* Exploration is pretty fun* Delves are awesome!* Tons of stuff to do, ""rifts"", world bosses/dragons etc.* Literally any class can heal.* While no housing system can top SWG....this one is really good allbeit instanced.Cons:* You need ESO plus or your gameplay loop will be an inventory management nightmare.* Character customization is lackluster at best.* Hero Engine - no explanation needed.* Floaty combat* You have to limit your choices on spells/abilities because the devs thought you'll only need 5 up on screen and 10 total, huh?* Bait n switch on necromancers. They advertised a necro with pets who can also summon a dragon. Instead we got a dps with very short timer pets that barely do damage and no dragon.It CAN be fun but this is definitely a ""wait for a deep sale"" game especially concerning expacs."
Negative,"I think I made my mistake to buy this ESO and few expansions after it was on sale in March.I enjoyed through the storylines in each of them and researched the complex skills and gears, but i felt sad that it is heavier paywalls in the game even with expansions. I was thinking about buy the crowns after i had fun in ESO until i discovered something/someone... Ppl disrespected my disability (not serious). I was getting kick out of the guilds even I doing log in daily, requested in emergency rl, and asked for help (I am newbie with 50+ champions),  I get some not enough example what ESO does. I find some ESO wiki database is ok-ok to alright rate and not clearer information than other game's... no /wiki...  The game is already losing me.Hey, ESO Gamers, Keep your EGO and annoyed behaviors to yourself, If you want to help newbies, help them with simple logic and clear example, losers. Let them having a fun and enjoy. Be patience. They might will be supporting you, guilds, ESO+ and or anything in the game. Geez...I never felt a sad to this game until now. Time to uninstall ESO."
Negative,"This is so disappointing for me to not be able to recomend as most of my hour are on xbox witch is why i only have 142 hours on steam. I love Elder Scrolls games and Lore and this was my dream game, why would take the best looking gear out and put it in the cash shop with mounts. look at world of Warcraft. even if its a low drop rate the best gear and mounts can be earned in dungeons and raids. thats why most people are willing to grind a dungeon hundreds of times and then go in town and show off what you earn. you claim that you care about players and care about this amazing world you built. put weapons and mounts in a drop pool that simple thing would bring most of the population back including me. as of right now it breaks my heart but I cant recomend this game to new players"
Negative,Pay to bagspace.
Negative,"Very poor combat, clunky, graphics are meh, questing is way too easy.Highly monetized.Potentially good match for casual players who dont want to put any effort.Very bad match for competitive players who like mmorpgs."
Negative,"The core mechanic - combat - is a total mess. It revolves around literally spamming one ability 80% of the time. The guides even call these abilities ""spammables"", so there is no doubt this design is intended. And the intention is wrong. Combat is extremely dull. It is not methodical, it is not tactical, it is brain dead and carpal tunel damaging.- avoid"
Negative,"It is not the game itself it is zenimax and bethesda that is the problem.  After you buy the game they hold it hostage until you wade through a bunch of agreements and agree to a bunch of crap.  Suddenly after a few days of playing the game the play button stopped responding.  No error message.  No email indicating any kind of account issue.  Nothing.  The game just doesn't work.  Spent some time googling the problem and tried several things but nothing worked.  The game would not function.  Uninstalled.  Reinstalled over a gig several times.Account access does not link properly to steam.  And the kicker is all of the time you are installing re-installing updating and fiddling with the LAUNCHER ESO and Steam think you are IN THE GAME.  You are NOT!  But more than two hours in the game and you don't get a refund.  Just downloading the game and updating and running it (around 100GB of network traffic) tells me I played an additional 6 hours.  What a joke!Submit a ticket button takes you to a generic support page.  Lousy support.  Lousy account handling.  Refund requested.  Denied.  Still trying to make this game work on another reinstall (this time on windows).  NO Luck.  The lack of a helpful error message helping you to diagnose problems is inexcusable.I actually found the game enjoyable while I could play it.  Now it is just an exercise in frustration.  If I knew then what I know now I would have said ""no thank you""."
Negative,"I dont recommend this game bcs of its very lame combat gameplay, one of the most important thing in any MMO. Combat feels awful one of the worst you can get ton of skills but you get 5 skill slots and 1 ultimate slot + swap to secondary weapon and same 5 skills 1 ultimate.You would think that with many skills you can come up with great build that would suit you but no there is always meta build for stamina and magicka builds that would be superior to whatever you would come up because certain skills are BIS for optimal and best DPS, heal etc.. There are 5 classes in game, again you would think that other classes would be different with whole new gameplay style and skill setup but no you get almost the same excpect the passives 90% is same with every classNow about gameplay there is no Cooldown's in this game so you can spam abilities until you run out of Stamina or Magicka it kinda seems fun but its executed very badly to make combat challenging Zenimax Reduced Duration on BUFFs and DEBUFFs and let me tell you every class have buffs, debuffs, self heals etc.. so Buffs about 15-40sec and Debuffs 8-15sec and there is animation cancel in this game when you use skill you can press block to cancel it's animation.so combat goes like this mostly for PVE - light attack-->Buff-->Animation Cancel-->Heavy Attack-->Debuff-->Animation Cancel-->Debuff-->Animation Cancel-->Few filler spells and then guess what? Buffs and Debuffs go off and you need to do what? yes reapply them and you get in this dumb rotation buff,debuff,debuff few hits and same again.its so boring that i cant play this game anymore to better understand what im trying to say search build guides on Youtube and see their rotation for different classes and you will understandNow Pros: Rly Good Graphics, Colors, Zones, etc..Fully Voiced Npcs and Quests you will really enjoy questing in this game wich is rare in MMOs when you just rush to max lvl to enjoy End Game Contentoverall its not a bad game if you want to have Single-Player experience as for the MMO i would not suggest it Gameplay Mechanics just give me cancer it feels like every class you play is ---- Warlock from WOW in Mortal Kombat X"
Negative,yall smokin crack not making it cross plat you bums
Negative,Community is very special...
Negative,"Installationprocess misses some files which the launcher needs to work and start the game.Developers expect you to go through tedious file changing and tinkering with system- and routersettings. followed them for a while until the documentation extended to a second page and they basically started repeating the same useless steps. still no real progress. launcher loading and than giving up because it is missing files and it is not capable of downloading them. Repair doesnt work because it cant find some manifests.So the game doesnt start via steam at all (launcher gives up with error 210).Forums and Help usually contains no solutions although there is countless Errorthreads.Nach der Installation fehlen Dateien ohne welche das Spiel nicht starten und aktualisieren kann. Lösungsweg der Entwickler läuft ins Leere und dreht sich im Kreis. Die vorgeschlagenen Eingriffe in System und Routereinstellungen führten zu keiner Verbesserung.Launcher startet nicht mittels Steam. Original Launcher startet, aber Logindaten kennt nur Steam."
Negative,"Edit: Just re-downloaded. After spending 3 days trying to get the game to actually boot I was amazed to see that there's a new DLC - ESO: The Infinite Loading Screen. Don't bother with this boring, broken waste of hard drive space. Just play Skyrim.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you think that this is going to be Skyrim online, with all the immersion, depth and charm which that would suggest, then you are going to be very disappointed. If you have specifically always wanted a WoW-style grind set in the world of Elder Scrolls then you’ve probably already bought this game. For everyone else, just stick with Skyrim/Oblivion/Morrowind.  After a short piece of superficial exposition you are thrown in and essentially told to ‘get on with it’. This sounded kind of cool to me too, in theory, but in reality I spent all my time asking ‘Why am I doing this?’, ‘Why should I care about this?’ - a classic symptom of lacking story, a sad thought when talking about a series known for it’s amazing immersion and storytelling. As wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle."
Negative,game wont even start when hitting play
Negative,FTP or GTFO
Negative,"This game is one of the best mmo's I've ever played.Base game is great, but if you want to get to end game, u gotta get all the dlc's, expansions or just eso+.This game can be played for one time payment but it feels like it is made as a pay to play game because your inventory is always full and your bank as well...oh and every patch it gets, it gets worse. so if you want to play it do it now cause this game will end up being a 2D game if these patches keep going on :)"
Negative,"CRAFT BAG... For those of you that's played this game you know what I'm going to say. But for those who haven't let me explain. This game plays heavily on your ability to store and manage items. From your whopping 60 starter inventory to the Bank that's also only 60 items. Now they give you the option to buy more storage in three ways.  1.) Crowns (premium currency). And its not cheap. One 60 item storage box will cost you 2000 crowns and WON'T tie into the crafting system. Totally worth it (sarcasm).  2.) Buy with in game gold. That wouldn't be so bad if gold wasn't so hard to come by along with the fact they charge you an ever increasing price per 10 slots, starting price is around 2500 gold.  3.) At level 10 you get a horse. That horses inventory ties into your own and can be upgraded to another 60 slots. BUT.. Its a one item slot at a time upgrade with a 20+hr cool down. That means only one slot a day for sixty days if you only focus on that skill and not the other two offered.  That brings me to said craft bag. Its a wonderful and very helpful feature that should have been incorporated into the base game with no strings attached. BUT.. Its locked behind a pay wall and not just any pay wall, a subscription pay wall. I've tried the ESO plus trial and even with the craft bag i struggled with inventory management. And I get the game mechanics of inventory management but this was without a doubt a decision made only to influence sales for the plus subscription. And for that reason alone I can not recommend this game.  The ESO plus subscription comes with its own benefits and in many cases worth the price, I won't pay it, but I'm an old school gamer and don't get behind the whole live services model. With the revenue from sales of the game, DLC, in game premium currency and a monthly subscription service one would think a craft bag would be the least of their worries. It sure has worried me quite a bit, but I speculate that's what was intended..**UPDATED**After spending 100+hrs on this game I will say its worth buying on sale.**UPDATED***I changed my mind. Totally not worth it as of 2023."
Negative,"My attempt at trying out the free event:Set up new account""Email address is already in use""Try to reset account information""Could not find account matching those details""Round and round I went for over two hours trying to get this figured out. Zenimax Online is terrible, worse than the Epic Games Store for account security. Don't waste your time with this game."
Negative,For a game that has been out this long and still has the login issues that it does I find it annoying . I was looking foreward to playing but all the time was on the game login and tyring to get repaired .
Negative,Could be a great game but the developers are greedy and most of the features are locked by a monthly membership fee.  What a sad place we've come to.
Negative,"Its telling me your server is timed out, try again later but still doesnt let me log in"
Negative,Only have EU and NA server.Stay clear if you're in Asia.But if you have the tenacity and patience to play with 300+ ping.Go ahead.
Negative,"It is a very good game to play when u can play it, but i am sick to death of the crashes and not being able to connect to the megaserver. This is not a free game, u will need to spend a lot of money to play it. I mean having to pay a monthly fee to get the inventory bag is absurd"
Negative,"Severe lack of ERPers, I am completely appalled at the time of this review. False advertising from the company, making these posts with pictures of Argonians in provocative poses. I had high hopes following the top tier content in The Lusty Argonian Maid, but they have been thoroughly quashed. I am just looking for a game to nuzzle wuzzle some scaley wailies and suck some toesey woesies. Truly disgraceful addition to the series, not worth the money."
Negative,"Gameplay:⭐⭐⭐☆☆Fun overall, but some mechanics feel dated.Story/Questing:⭐⭐⭐⭐☆Excellent storytelling and lore, but some quests can feel repetitive.Graphics/Art Style:⭐⭐⭐⭐☆Visually appealing, though showing signs of age.Sound/Music:⭐⭐⭐☆☆Good sound, but the music can feel underwhelming.PvE Experience:⭐⭐⭐⭐☆Enjoyable, but difficult for new players to learn.PvP Experience:⭐⭐⭐☆☆Neglected by devs, with a harsh learning curve and a gatekeeping community.Crafting/Professions:⭐⭐⭐⭐☆Deep system, though it can get grindy.Community:⭐⭐☆☆☆Unwelcoming to newcomers, with little patience for learning.Overall Rating:⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3.5 stars)At the time of writing, I have 1,351 hours in the game, so I feel confident in my assessment.Summary:I enjoy The Elder Scrolls Online for its expansive world and build diversity, which preserves the Elder Scrolls feel. However, the game is showing its age, and both PvP and PvE suffer from issues. New players won’t find others to learn with and are instead farmed by veterans in PvP. The PvE experience is similar, as players are often abandoned in veteran dungeons if they aren't already experts. While I'll continue playing until another MMO grabs my attention, I wouldn’t recommend it to new players."
Negative,"Will not let me login, not going to waste time trying to figure out why, if the developer can't get the login working right, I can just imagine all the other things wrong with this game."
Negative,"i really and i mean REALLY love the game (you can see i have close to 700hours from the date of purchase) but the incident that i had yesterday was enough to give me a good heads up for what is going on here. i was playing battlegrounds and i had 3 people jumping on me at the same time who i killed solo.The last one i killed of course i teabagged him . and i get a whisper from that nutjob that he is going to permaban me cause of teabagging and that he feels sexually harashed and all kind of fuckin insane things to which i was laughing , told him to grow up and he kept spamming me shit till i told him to fuck off already and FINALLY found how to put him on ignore list.After my gaming session out of curiosity i googled if you can actually get banned in ESO for teabagging and guess what! this is actually a thing! imagine investing so much time in a video game just to get banned because you spammed the crouch button over the dead toon of a middle aged man who instead of trying to actually get good in the game, he tries to weaponize the woke disease that every single gaming company caught against you. i am SO happy that this thing happened quite early in my eso journey - needless to say i insta-uninstalled the game.This is what online gaming has become.i dont want to be a part of those kind of companies-communities even if they paid me millions! And of course i dont want to give a single penny to those kind of people plus i wish people with more than one braincell started doing the same"
Negative,This game isn't it.
Negative,"Fun for a couple of months, then it's repeating same stuff over and over. Champion system adds nothing to game-play, just a few % here and there but not worth the grind."
Negative,A disappointment at every turn.
Negative,loot boxes and half the game is behind a paywall
Negative,So many F**king errors....210...102....playing this game requires daily fixes. Don't even bother playing on Steam...adds another layer of bullsh**
Negative,"I actually fell asleep while playing this game because it was so boring...not even playing with a friend could keep me coming back for more. Disregard the 100 hours, most of that was spent AFK or asleep at the keyboard."
Negative,"Login system is not great, graphics are okay, game is fun, but still A LOT LOT LOT of bugs, and im only 3-4 hours in.  Game crashes quite often, lots of frame drops, not able to interact with objects sometimes, start fighting an enemy and they lag behind you and hit you 3 times....THAT BEING SAID, I still kinda like it, I think ill play more but man if they could fix these bugs it would be pretty cool."
Negative,"I keep trying to give this game a chance over and over but Its difficult to like. The combat just feels repetitive and bad, a lot of it feels unplayable solo, especially bosses. You almost have to run a build and it feels like if you aren't doing things right you do little to no damage. Targeting system is irritating, and so is the bounty system with guards. The quest tracking is also irritating as well and the map is cumbersome and frustrating to use. Most of this game feels inaccessible without a group to  play with and without someone teaching you. It just seems like a huge chore tbh."
Negative,"Where do I start for someone who, according to Steam, has played nine hours?  For starters, that's inaccurate.  I purchased the game yesterday.  Spent quite a few hours doing downloads and installation.  All for naught thus far.  After I created an ESO Account, and logged in ...I could not advance the game past the initial combat tutorial because the game has invariably frozen during the blocking tutorial.  Moreover, after spending several hours attempting to troubleshoot, I have received no assistance from ESO Support.   Frustrated to say the least."
Negative,"I feel if it was single player id enjoy it a lot more. I was talking to teh queen about a serious matter during the quest and other players were throwing paint all over her and giggling and running about, it ruined the immersion tbh."
Negative,Playing this is like stappling your d*** together
Negative,I didn't have to pay to be a thief! Hell yeah best mmorpg I played EVER
Negative,"Do not sell your soul to Todd!! I kept acting like it was ok but do not sell yourself out to Todd Howards wallet, know your worth and avoid this game *Loud banging at the door* play something anything just get out of here *gun shots clip through my walls*"
Negative,"Where to start. For some reason I thought this would be different from any other Bethesda game, but alas. I have such a love/hate relationship with them. Builder of incredible worlds, but simultaneously the glitchiest experience available to you in the early 21st century. Can we go back to the days where video were released when they were actually completed? I hate this release it early and fix the game over the first 4 years that it's out for the public.I've been fighting all the glitches in this game same as all the other bethesda games I sadly put myself through, but recently they did an update and even more is broken than it was before now. I do not recommend giving these idiots any more money."
Negative,"Once, it was a great game, but we can see through pass 6 years, there nothing much creative to all the upgrades, and it is going to feel boring if you really had got to cp160. The game is big enough, and what player needs was something different from the quest. The leadership of ESO and the team work on it is really just finishing their ""job"", which is do something easy and just earn their own money. Maybe it should be the time to change some new blood and listen to more advice from the professionals.I'm not a enlish man, hope that's not a problem for reading.I used to love this game, and I'm still loving this game. But, not those fake creators whom had wast 6 years of time on this game to made it not improving."
Negative,"BS: ""No game subscription required."" You have to pay a lot of money for the base game and the DLC, but you won't get full content, even if you get all DLC from the shop. So that's close to false advertising, and not true if you want to enjoy the whole game, i.e. crafting. Even if you spend over 100 bucks to get most of the DLC, you still need to subscribe to get the craft bag. So even if a game subscription is not required to start the game, it is still a game where a subscription is strongly recommended, if you want to be able to compete - without farming it 24/7. Implementing a pay to win model in a not free to play game is just an impudence imho.Beside the cash grab mentality (publisher & player, sadly) the game isn't that bad. The majority of quests, music and voices are good for an online game - the graphic didn't age well though. That wouldn't be a problem with some other games, but ESO needs a decent PC setup and a lot of disc space to begin with, so I feel that the used ressources are kind of wasted here. The support isn't their strong suit, too. Plus you got a lot of toxic people, just throwing insults or trying to scam you. Fell free to pay 10 bucks for the base game, when it's on sale to try it out. But I wouldn't invest more, unless you want to subscribe - that's what they want you to do anyway."
Negative,"For those, who enjoy playing classic MMOPRG - get this game, you will, probably, enjoy it.For those, who want a game like Skyrim or original Morrowind - no, just no. It may be just me, I agree, but I did not enjoyed this game after playing almost for an hour. I had a short experience with MMORPG like Perfect World or Lineage and I left them after playing for 2 hours.Probably, it is just me. Go and see it for yourself. I didn't enjoy it"
Negative,"I've had the game for several days now.  It doesn't run and support is completely unresponsive.  Might be a good game if it worked.  If you have problems with it though, it looks like you are on your own.  Cannot reccommend."
Negative,"I played for awhile. This game is not really fun. Its not hard. And i just find it really boring sadly. I tried to give it another shot and reinstalled it to play my necromancer. Just decided to log off and unistall again. I wish i could actually enjoy this game but i cannot.And theres not really anything that makes the game super shiny and interesting. The armor outfits are just boring. The mounts are lame. PvP is hyper unbalanced with 1 dude taking on like 15 people for awhile due to insane damage and self healing. While world of warcraft has awesome transmogs, badass mounts etc. This game is just uninspiring and nothing that makes you go WOW!War within is coming out in a couple of days. Just play that or a different mmo then wasting your time on this one.There is one thing i do admit is the zones in this game look absolutely amazing."
Negative,"Without the subscription the game just slowly becomes unplayable. As you're just managing inventory trying to make space to loot anything and after 10-20 min of killing and looting bags are full so back to town, can't break down items because bag is full, go to bank maybe deposit one material item then bank is full... can no longer loot... why play the game."
Negative,"I see a LOT of positive reviews for this game, but it kinda looks like you have to sink hundreds of hours into it before people start to feel that way. In the hour I played here is why I refunded it.The writing and dialogue immediately felt significantly worse in this game over the single player games it is based off.  The other Elder Scrolls and Fallout games weren't award winning by any means, but whereas this game, I immediately wished that everyone that was speaking would stop, and found myself skipping dialogue more and more often.Combat is missing one key thing that I didn't think about being so important until I saw the complete lack of it: physical impact.Enemies react to almost nothing you do, save for successful ability interrupts. Nothing about the combat feels good and that is why the trailers only show 1 second of it before they cut away.Finally the micro transactions. Its a live-service game, so some is expected, but the selling point at the top right of this store page in the description says ""No game subscription required"" but if I have to pay for 99% of any content they release, its no different.Glad other people enjoy it, at least. Maybe if I put in another 50 hours i'd enjoy it, but I don't feel its worth the commitment. I shouldn't have to ""wait"" for a game to get good"
Negative,"After more than 5000 hrs, i gave up. So many Russian in EU server, so many of them they don't even use the game to play but to communicate about Ukrane war. I ask so many times ESO to ban them, took screeshots etc....nothing.Well, with so many bugs in the game and russian do probaganta and battle system failling patch after patch and ESO killing somme class ( like my dragonknghit) with stupid ''adjustements'' of race and dps overall + allowing peoples to ask for money to do dungeons and trials....that's it.Sad i don't communicate with many friends i had in the game but anyway they also gave up so....... ESO lost my game, wife's game and 4 members of my family...... i guess they don't care, money and russian probaganta is more important to them....... :-(Have fun stay safe"
Negative,Games with microtransactions should be free. Or should be playable without microtransactions. Overmonetized piece of ****.
Negative,"If you want to enjoy friends and family, or if you want to feel the touch of a woman... then dont play this game."
Negative,"money hungry game, crown crates are a scam, builds change every update, stam builds are trash, nightblades get nerfed every patch paid classes are the best classes, real game issues never get fixed"
Negative,"I bought this game a long time ago and it wasnt fun. I thought maybe id give it another try. Its still equally just as bland and boring. Nonreactive characters, watered down combat, no sense of scope or scale, extremely unfun."
Negative,"I would recommend anyone reading this and everyone one they know to never touch this game. I waited a good 8 years to see how much this game improved over the controversial launch back in the day. Guess 8 years wasn't enough time to fix a good amount of the bugs that have been around since launch. PC NA and EU servers being unstable/broken for the past month since update 33 especially during events and the weekly maintenance (sometimes that has made the game ever more buggy/broken) makes me wonder how the developers at ZOS still have their jobs or at least haven't tried to fix the spaghetti code they are working with. It seems that adding content without much thought for compatibility or stability of the rest of the game happens a whole lot too even when the players in the Public Test Servers warn them about the issues that could arise during an update. I heard it best in a dungeon recently - ""The only priority of ZOS is making sure that the crown store is still fully functional. Everything else doesn't matter as long as the micro-transaction money is still coming in.""The experience of the community has been a mixed bag. Some players are pretty fun to be around while others I'm surprised still have access to their accounts. I personally find it annoying that doing a dungeon quest is almost impossible at times. Even when you tell your group you are doing the quest sometimes they will still run off and kill everything in the dungeon before you're done talking to the second or third NPC and when they kill a boss you need to defeat for a quest and it doesn't register you have to redo the dungeon again for the quest to complete. I personally don't play PVP in MMOs so I've stuck entirely to the PVE experience. While combat is fun and i like a good amount of the mechanics regarding builds, the lack of level scaling has never given me a sense of challenge when fighting enemies and being able to solo a good amount of world bosses makes them just feel like cheap hp sponges with very little variation in their move-sets. Pretty sure the first time i died was to a dungeon boss with an attack that did full health damage to me and nothing else beforehand was even close to doing that much to me. Any other times I've died was either due to fall damage, a one shot from a dungeon boss every so often, or logging in to my character already dead from the mobs that spawned around my character while I loaded in. (might be wrong about mobs in this instance.)The story is entertaining at points but I felt like most of what I've done has had no real effect on the world itself. Sure some mobs may not attack me anymore in a certain area but they are still there and attacking other players. Quest structure is pretty basic too usually going by the rule of threes in terms of doing the same quest objective multiple times or finding/freeing a group of people. Besides some of the end of zone quests and the Mages Guild quests nothing else has really stood out to me or given me the same feel of facing someone at the end of a main story or guild quest line in the mainline series especially when all the main villains in this game I've fought have similar combat mechanics and are lower tier in ""difficulty"" than a world boss.Now to the part i despise the most about this game. The crown store/ESO+. Locking a seemingly infinite inventory space (The crafting bag) behind a paywall doesn't sit well with me and is probably the main or only reason why so many people purchase the subscription. How a game like this still has lootboxes after the big trend of lootboxes backfired on so many companies a good years back astounds me. The crown crates have been changed so that seals of endeavors can now buy them instead of just crowns but you earn the endeavors at a pathetically slow rate so that players are still tempted to purchase the crates outright with crowns. ESO lootboxes/crown crates don't just have cosmetic items either. There are potions and poisons, riding lessons, experience boosting scrolls, and research timer bypasses (which i found out today that the timer for research can go up to over 20 days of real time.) Worse part is that so many of the crown crates will be filled with trash items so trying to get a decent cosmetic item is a complete gamble.I also saw in the crown store just how much of the world of Tamriel, the dungeons, and even guilds that have been staples of the franchise have been set aside as additional DLC for crowns or requiring an ESO+ subscription. Buying a chapter like Elsweyr gives you only the northern part of Elsweyr and the other parts are additional DLC for that year that must be paid for since they are not included in the chapter expansion. Sure you can trade gold for crowns in this game but at the rate they are being traded for be ready to spend over 5 mil worth of gold just so you can access all the zone/dungeon/guild DLC.It hurts to see ESO in this state after 8 years because I think that there was an incredible amount of potential for an Elder Scrolls MMO and at times I can see glimpses of this potential but its bogged down by so many unnecessary things and by an incompetent set of developers and an even worse publisher that I don't think it will ever come close to reaching it."
Negative,this is not anything like oblivion or skyrim it feels like a Google play rpg its not what i expected the game mechanics are not like the games for example i cant aim the bow or hit the specific body part that i want everything is different nothing feels like the old games i was sold a lame copy in name only and im still waiting for a refund its been a week i expect to have to request a refund every week until they get tired of me
Negative,As a player of the Elder Scrolls for many years I have to say I cannot comprehend all of the positive comments. This game Sucks. Most of the other negative reviews have said it all. I NEVER played 23 hours. I quit in disgust after maybe two hours.
Negative,"Was fun at first, had that skyrim adventure feel. But small things get annoying like enemies constantly debuffing slow on you, and knocking you off your house, cant relax anywhere without a mob locking on to you. Even worse in dungeons when enemies respawn stupidly fast, i understand this is due to MMO and we have to share the dungeons, but that didnt make it any less annnoying. You will see every single player just run through the dungeon to the end, get the thing, then sprint all the way back with enemies chasing them, i guarantee you will see this, and its just so unrealistic and stupid. It gets so grindy, youll end up doing the same thing, then youll get even more annoyed that you cant ""exit"" the dungeon unless you have no enemies ""locked on"" to you. I mean why is all of this so GAMEY? Whoever designed this has no idea how immersion works. After playing this i now understand why it didnt get very popular like it should have.--RESPONSE TO DEV--Greetings,Thanks for taking the time to give your completely automated, cold response, which isn't even directed to me personally. We're sorry to hear that your department cannot afford to give actual real personalised responses to reviews. I guess that's something that only developers who actually care about their customer base do.We encourage you to detail any feedback regarding this negative review directly to the original poster in a more professional manner. This helps your customer base feel appreciated and listened to, which in turn gives you more customers, and more sales, which i think is the type of experience your department is looking for.Thanks again for your automated response and we hope you will give writing a actual real response to this review another try.Warm regards,The Jin Maq TeamSee what i did there?  :D"
Negative,I stopped playing when mobs from the first zone were able to kill my Vet character and I wasn't able to mine low level crafting mats with my Vet character anymore. Have they changed this?
Negative,idk played like all of my  game time when the game came out...Didnt even get out of the opening part of the game and legit left and uninstalled
Negative,Not fun at all.
Negative,Having played skyrim...this game feels clunky and broken to me...wasted around 80 GB to download this baad game...The most annoying was its movement and fight animations and the enemies just respawns every few minutes ...never got around to enjoy it...
Negative,Vateshran Arena like many other areas and dungeons in the game forces you somehow to buy dlc's or membership for mythic items spreaded around the world and broken sets .Very clever strategy by zenimax who provides pay to win gameplay behind the curtain of new content every year and promotion design.Now you can have a mythic item ring and play just without weapon swap entirely solo veteran dungeons in Hard mode .Well done ...
Negative,"22/04/2017DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!GAME LAUNCHER SUCKS....2 nd time for encounting 210 error in this week, it couldn't be fix. Last time, I spent 5hrs to fix it, but this stupid game caused Error with your C drive and steamapps file, all the game couldn't be deleted / installed.  I don't want to spend another 5 hrs to fix this fucking problem, FK this game developer, and I will quit this game for good.DON'T FALL IN THIS TRAP!!!!!!!19/04/2017I had played this game for 40 hrs in 3 days, and I hate this developer not the game. Plz, don't rush to press the ""NOT HELPFUL"" button before u have completely read my reveiw, especially for those keyboard fighters. What 's happening during my gaming experience?After the 10 hrs gameplay, I encountered the first bug. MY ATTRIBUTE POINTS LOST during the lv-up by game crushing, I couldn't get those 2 points back, even I tried to reset the attribute points. At this moment, the only thing I could do was just searching on the Internet and the official webpage for the solution, but I GOT NOTHING. Finally, I had to DELETE THE CHARACTER, and 10hrs of my life was wasted!!!!!FINE, LET'S PLAY ANOTHER CHARACTER...CRUSHING,FARMING,RUNNING...40hrs gameplay later, OMG, there was another bug. However, u can't call this as a bug, it's a FUCKING programme error -Error 210 - the PATCHMANIFESTERROR_DOWNLOADFAIL. Alright, I searched the solutions on the official support webpage, it provided 4 methods:1. Run the Game as an Administrator ---> NOT WORKING2. Download the Patch Manifest File ---> NOT WORKING3. Repair the Game Client ---> It didn't allow me to do so4. Delete the Program Data---> NOT ALLOW because of damaged file After that, I had to try my way - un/reinstall the game. FUCK YOUR LITTLE TWAT, the game couldn't finish the install at all and sucked at 95% or something. SO I CHECKED THE GAME FILE IN C- drive, the damaged files couldn't be deleted or opened, nothing I COULD do at all. Ofc, i sent an e-mail to official support, they haven't replied my mail yet, and it seem they never try to read about it.WTF with this developer, I don't think this game is player-friendly, just another UNITED AIRLINE  or Ubisoft, leaving u dead after u paidAlso, WTF steam. I couldn't play this game, and u r not allowing me to refund because of >2hr playing hr !? WTF with the refund policy!!!!"
Negative,"just didn't find it fun.a lot of running around to get 3/4 of the way thru quests that seemed to be bugged, so i couldn't complete them.awful in-game trading system.  back to the sad old days of EQ1 - trading thru online whispers.  auction house facilities limited to guilds of over 50 players, so if you like solo play or play with a small group of people, you are basically cut out of the trade system. i also suspect this game is whaling boat - one of those games that is mostly directed at people willing to spend heaps of real life money to get in-game advantages."
Negative,I honestly expected at least Skyrim graphics but it's pretty much Morrowind. The graphics are equivalent to systems as old as the PS2. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING is monetized. I'd have more fun at the dentist and he'd charge me less.
Negative,"i could tell you how Fun this game is, and it is. but it wont matter and heres why.1. i wanted to return to the game today so i needed to re install the game, fast forward some hours, Launched the launcher  it will act ""frozen"" is my best description as i can not interact with it but every thing else is fine, it will close itself  after 2-3 minutes of doing nothing , 2. Read on steam discussions, its not a rare problem and its well known by players, tried some long convoluted ways hoping it would work. Nope3. Thought id try support. went to create ticket , it asks you to Run the Game Consultant, which comes in the install , so ran it, it spits out a report that will make no sense to an average joe, when creating a technical ticket this is required, went to upload the file from THEIR GAME CONSULTANT APP. And it says "" please use a file under 10 MB."" 4. My response as you can not finish ticket it with out the report. """" So your game doesent work and it costs $$, ill contact support, Cant procide with getting official Support because YOUR report isent small enough, This is Great Sell me 10 more copies because this is a scam. 5. if your looking into this game, ill suggest highly you dont buy it, plus expansions, have a over priced cash shop  in your face, plus a Subscription model. Go play GW2, FFXIV, BDO, or even hell go play WoW or EQ1 OR II all those games work for what they cost and have better support teams."
Negative,"Down loaded in 2014-didnt play much. Then spotted all the work and up dates-now cant loggin because off, login issues, zero customer surport"
Negative,MEGA DOG WOOF WOOF
Negative,it doesn't feel like elder scrolls at all
Negative,this is so bad this is sad luckily I managed to refund
Negative,why would you make this
Negative,Imagine a gimped out WoW with downsyndrome and microtransaction hell.  That is Elder Scrolls Online.  The only thing that's Unlimited is the amount of microtransactions you'll have to pay for to make this game feel anything like a playable game.  Otherwise you'll feel almost like you're behind a paywall.
Negative,Do not get this game. customer service is non existant... my email is already in use somehow so since i cant login i cant open a help ticket. unreal. sickening really. im not the only one that has issues with the customer service. just awful. do yourself a favor and avoid this trash. i paid and paid. what a waste.
Negative,"Notice that the majority of the people recommending the game have less than 100 hours played of the game. Yes, there are some with more who recommend it, but let me explain a few things that don't become apparent unless you've played for a while.1. There is no freedom of choice, it's an illusion. Yes, you can have whatever combination of things you want, but in the end the meta builds are so much better that there's really only a handful of viable things you can do. Due to this, you'll see a lot of the same builds from the higher levels. 2. PVE is insanely easy. Probably the easiest dungeons you can do in an mmo. Tank, DPS, and healer might as well just be suggestions when you queue up. Honestly, because of scaling you can run just about anything and not even know your class. Open world pvp is rarely hard unless you have a bad build in which case the game actually becomes challenging but not for the right reasons3. Scaling. Sounds like a good idea on paper, but it sort of removes the main reason a lot of people play MMOs. Your gear scales, your enemies scale, rewards scale. I remember beating Molag Bal as a low level in the sewers and getting 5 gold as a reward along with a random armor paint. Fun. 4. Scaling in PVP. Take what I said about scaling in a PVE environment and apply it to PVP. It doesn't really work. Yes, technically a low level can fight a higher level, but because you need to get levels to get skills, all the higher levels have more skills and better item bonuses than the lower level players. This honestly makes no sense. You're scaled... but you're really not equal. Due to this, after (I believe it's 50) you either have to deal with deathballs for any chance of PVP or enjoy getting pounced on level 1000+ who have optimal builds and weapons.5. It's actually a lot more expensive than sub based MMOs like FFXIV and WoW. If you want all the content you either need to buy it seperately or pay a sub and also buy the latest expansion. This means it's already as expensive as a normal MMO... but there's more! Your horse is slow as hell unless you spend 2 months training it every day to get it to max level in ONE OF THE THREE CATEGORIES.  It'll take you almost half a year to fully level up a mount on ONE character because you can only increase the stats by 1 every 20 hours or so. Alt characters don't have horse stats transfer despite the mounts being transferred. If you want housing you're also screwed because all of the nice stuff is paid. Some are insanely expensive $100+. Final Verdict: If you want to play, it's not a bad game but it's not a good MMO. I'd recommend buying a month of sub to try it out but would advise sinking any real amount of time or effort into the game."
Negative,"A truly beautiful world, a gorgeous map, a fantastic lore and much more.Despite all that, things like level scaling and playing like it is an offline game, plus a lack of elder scrolls game ""feeling"" make that beautiful diamond of a game a piece of souless crap like no other.  Funny thing is the developers are continuing to take a shit by turn on this game by milking the franchise with overpriced expansions and chapters without giving any actual content.Wasted my money on this game, there were so few times that I actually enjoyed it, and I had given a lot of chances for reasons I mentioned above."
Negative,gud but clumsy
Negative,trouble linking the accounts
Negative,way 2 many mages bro
Negative,"cant log in, 10/10edit : cant log in again, 11/10"
Negative,"Dull and lifeless, it's just another MMO. The world feels incredibly dull, quests feel pointless, cities feel dead. NPCs walking around is not all that it takes to make a world feel ""alive"". They need to have a purpose, a daily life, all that. It just doesn't have the charm that Elder Scrolls is known for."
Negative,"Do not buy STEAM VERSION! Get it ANYwhere else. ""You do not qualify for this product."" you will not be able to buy crowns in game if you have steam unless the DOUBLE 3rd party workaround encoding WORKS.....a greyed out ""you do not qualify for this product"" will make you have salty tears of frustration."
Negative,this games sux. i played it a bit when it released on ps4 and it had a set story line and starting location. now it's got a shitty meaningless tutorial starting thing and you have to choose the location you want to start in which will then influence which story you play. and not only that but purchased and redeemed items and characters dont transfer between platforms and when an item is claimed on a character and not your account you have to play that character on that platform to have that item and if you lose access to that character or switch platforms all is lost. this game and games like it are garbage. this game is also way too big with a download size of 120GB and then it has to be installed manually with their launcher. this review is extremely late but i wrote it anyway.
Negative,"I, personally, am not impressed and feel I spent WAY too much money on this. I have played 16 hours and don't think I'm going to play it ever again.My favorite con:How the idea of emersion, which TES games have been great with, is crap in this. Enemies spawn right in front of you...... and just don't mind, so long as you don't move.  Only MMO I played prior to this is Dragon Saga/Dragonica (I played over 200 hours of Dragonica) My favorite pro: How the game wold is just SO FRIGGIN HUGE and already familiar."
Negative,"Well the 287.3 hours you see is what I have since buying it on Steam. I did not play in the alpha sub model, but as soon as it went pay to own, I have been with the game since. I cannot honestly recommend this game. It's not like The Elder Scrolls, it feels more like the kiddie lite edition. I have grinded like crazy to get the best equipment in the game, and it meant nothing. I stopped playing and came back a few months later, ALL of my inventory was gone on person and in bank. ZeniMax does absolutely nothing in these cases. They tell you that it's gone. The 5 mil in gold was nothing compared to the items I traded...The game play itself is sub par, with the actual mechanics being less than WoW was even in the early days. The graphics are not being updated like other MMOs are. ZeniMax knows that they don't really need to make major engine, or rendering improvements, so the game still performs subpar on even the best hardware. Just wait until Skyrim XV comes out. At least the games Bethesda ""remasters"" were quality storylines to start with."
Negative,game is getting forgotten. you can tell by the exclusive content that's coming out now and then all sparkly shiny stuff witch one of the things why it die. the biggest reason why i don't like it atm is that i have RTX 3070 laptop witch is brand new and all. Graphics looks hideous the game cant customise itself for best appearance. and I get in touch with the support and what happens nothing i get like 5 different ways how to improove PERFORMANCE witch i keep telling that i have no such problem xD its like getting automated robot answers because they dont read whats wrong with your issue here they predict and aswer xD (answer is overstatement) anyway even if they release new content it sucks i know i bought it its pretty much same everywhere you go. same as every other content they release time to leave this pay to have a craft bag  nonsence and let bethesda go bankrupt for what they do with fans.... disgusting
Negative,Constant random disconnect issues.
Negative,"Didnt like it, mechanics are weird."
Negative,"Play for 2 hours , didn't even get started, just exploring and searching what I could do. Got Ban for no reason."
Negative,runs like absolute dog shit on mac m1
Negative,"Some hours to download...ok,some hours to repair a pair of times...ok and when ready to launch error 12 or something like that...."
Negative,i live in south africa.soo i normaly play on eu server wich there is but i cant get past the character loading screen it keeps on telling me error but my internet is not the problem .i played a week ago and now i cant even log in to choose my character and if i do it just loads for a while and then tells me error again
Negative,"It's pretty and can take out anger on mud crabs. That's about all the pros to it. Combat is super clunky, quests are boring/confusing. No impact on your hits whatsoever, feels like your made of paper. Don't waste your time."
Negative,"Can you please make the craft bag free or at least one-time purchase, I really want to recommend this game, but I can't right now, I bought all the major DLCs and the base game, but I have no inventory space because of the materials, and you still want me to subscribe."
Negative,"I'm a fan of the Elder Scrolls universe. I tried to like this game, I really did. Sadly, it's just a walking simulator with MMO elements such as microtransactions and lags."
Negative,Meh and heavily monetized.
Negative,"Doesn't work on MacBook Pro with Intel chip, while description in store clearly states the opposite"
Negative,Hard to log very Buggy
Negative,Paid to win
Negative,well it was reasonably fun when i first installed it... but the first update I tried to do broke the launcher. I've tried it a couple of times and it still fails to update.in summary it wasn't good enough to make me angry that it broke.
Negative,"Doesn't work. It works sometimes, sometimes it doesn't. Most of the time it wont, just google 'eso steam login error' and you'll see ESO and Steam won't fix login issues since 2016. So if you buy it thru steam, be prepared to be able to login only when steam and eso feel like working on login fixes for the issues that arrive every week.Steam won't care and won't refund my game because it logged 11 hours of playtime, even though I didn't play that much, the launcher/downloader itself takes a long time and it counts as play time.So in sum, I only recommend this to people I dislike, and even then, I have to REALLY hate them a lotEDIT: On top of that, during the little time I was able to play, I have seen that this game is just some WoW with different graphics. So if you like games in which you run errands for NPCs, get this, otherwise don't bother"
Negative,"Somehow the console version of this game is superior, I will explain. MMOs are one of the single most social game genres available. The worlds full of other people existing, engaging, and playing with each other is so important to the mmo experience. The Console version of this game adds to it via proximity based voice chat allowing all players to kind of communicate in town and such making meeting other adventurers very organic and immersive, further emphasizing the social aspect of mmos. For whatever reason the bozos at zenimax thought why even bother implementing that into the pc version when there are so many voice chat platforms available on pc. Well that would be fine and all other than the fact that none of those platforms are the slightest involved in booting the game and starting your adventure in eso. If you are a multiplatform kinda person blow off the pc version because you can just get the better experience there."
Negative,"Bom jogo, bastante potencial, mas é mercenário e caro demais, você mal começa a jogar e o mesmo já está sendo inconveniente pra te forçar a pagar mais, inventário extremamente limitado, e isso que eu nem tava farmando, enxia só pegando loot dos inimigos e uma ou outra plantinha ao longo do caminho, tem como aumentar com gold mas é extremamente caro, e demorado, pra um jogador novo, 180k de gold pra upar o inventário no máximo, 800k pro banco, e mais 15k pra montaria, só que o da montaria demora 4 fucking meses, já que vai até o nível 60 e só dá pra upar 1 por dia, e é bem melhor upar a velocidade primeiro.Comprar os conteúdos extras também é extremamente caro aqui no Brasil, alguns preços nem fazem sentido, uma DLC que adiciona um mapa novo com vários conteúdos pra fazer custa 1.500 Crowns (70 reais), e ao mesmo tempo um slot extra pra ter outra build na armory também custa 1.500, wtf???? Se for comprar as DLC's e expansões fora de promoções e eventos, é no mínimo uns 750 reais (500 da assinatura de 1 ano da Plus, mais os 250 reais pra comprar a Collection), se for comprar usando crown pela loja do jogo é ainda mais caro, dá mais de 1.500 reais pelas minhas contas.Eu sei que dá pra trocar gold por crown, mas eu to falando da experiencia que um jogador novo vai ter, ninguém que começou a jogar o jogo a 1 mês vai estar fazendo 1 milhão de gold por semana igual um veterano, me arrisco a dizer que nem com 1 ano de jogo dá pra fazer isso.Servidor horrível pra jogar aqui no Brasil, eu tenho uma internet de 250m, não é top mas é boa, e o ping fica em 200 constante, e isso só explorando as cidades iniciais, não quero nem imaginar o PvP em larga escala, ou os mapas com bastante players.Pra comparação, no Guild Wars 2 que também só tem um servidor NA e usa o mesmo sistema de mega server, meu ping fica em 140-160, só no PvP em larga escala que sobe pra 180-200 em alguns momentos, mas mesmo assim é super jogável. A ArenaNet não deve ter 10% dos funcionários e recursos que a Zenimax/Bethesda tem, mesmo assim o servidor deles é bem melhor, não faz sentido uma empresa que lucra bilhões por ano só com esse jogo ter um servidor tão podre desse jeito. Enfim, não recomendo como um ""MMO principal"", a não ser que você seja rico ou tenha muito dinheiro sobrando kkk. Se quiser jogar o jogo base pra ver, vale a pena até, só esqueça crafting, pvp, etc, trate como um jogo single player onde você faz umas quests e explora uns mapas, quando o conteúdo acabar (jogo base + Morrowind), ai você decide se quer continuar investindo ou não."
Negative,"While this game was, at first fairly entertaining, studio desperation and the creeping ""pay to win"" updates aswell as in game gambling with lootboxes took a firm grasp, the game lost all of what made it special. This game had the means to take the MMORPG throne, but focus on profit and lack of meaningful content updates and the push of lootboxes left it as a bad memory."
Negative,go get skyrim. this sucks.
Negative,Junk! not even playable with very high ping
Negative,"What the hell is wrong with the service? I could not launch the game last time and neither could my friend because there was a rediculous problem with registering a new account. We returned the game and got a refund. But the good reviews kept coming and it's not like there is much of a choice of reasonable mmorpg's at the moment. We tried again. I bought the game, installed the rediculous 100 Gb and what do I get? A launcher that freezes up with 210 ""PATCHMANIFESTERROR_DOWNLOADFAIL"". First thing I do is I google it and guess what? There are dozens of articles about solving it. You know what? How about solving this at development level? Twice I bought this game and I could not even launch it!"
Negative,"Very disappointed with this game.I am a new player and really hoped I would like ESO. I used to be a big WoW player back in the day and was hoping ESO would bring back those old MMORPG memories. But it really did not.Quests are super mundane, even much more than WoW 10 years ago. It's really just ""go there and click this NPC/item""... nothing else. Seriously. On top of it it's shockingly easy so that there is zero challenge. You just run through, click through the boring quests and level up. Not once during the first 15 levels was I even close to being killed. Even in dungeons you just run through - no need for a tank or a healer... your group just plows through and exits the instance.I really don't get the appeal of this game. Sorry."
Negative,just another mmo this game is boring and repetitive nothing like the other elder scrolls
Negative,"walking and talking simulatormusic is alrightnowhere near as good as ES skyrim or obliviondon't even buy on sale, not worth it"
Negative,thanks for the crate I guess
Negative,bu oyunun işi bitmiş. para verip alıyosunuz ve girmek için sıra bekliyosunuz.dlc dlc çıkara çıkara zaten mundar etmişlerdi daha kötü olmuşuzak durun
Negative,Continual changes to slow player progress.This game is simply no fun.
Negative,"Terrible servers, terrible monetization."
Negative,how the actual hell do people enjoy this?
Negative,tragic bugged spending more time dealing with gear then actually playng game i hoped to get somthing better
Negative,"Its like they made a Elder scrolls game, but ignored everything that made elder scrolls fun to play. Then threw in the MMO grinding."
Negative,"Running around being annoyed by a cluttered inventory, learned there was a crafting bag but only available if you pay a monthly subscription in this already paid game"
Negative,"It could have been a pretty decent game. It's not. It's an MMO. Also, the Crown store and all related to it is disgusting."
Negative,"I tried, I really tried to like this game but it just doesn't feel like an Elder Scrolls game and without that it is just another tedious mass produced MMORPG."
Negative,Base game has a way of making you feel like a second-class citizen. It doesn't even give you a quest when you start. There's no story to immerse into. Zero Elder Scrolls vibe happening. First quest I received was a side quest from a priest when aimlessly walking up the road.Also very confused why it required 122 gb to install when there's very little to do in this game. Once you get passed the paywall it's overwhelming how much stuff is suddenly available. I feel like they could have evened this out a little. At least a little.
Negative,"Although steam says I have logged 69 hours I've logged about 2. The majority of that is waiting for the game to update and the part is me attempting to fix the damn ""Requesting Character Load."" If you buy this there is not guarantee it will work. This game doesn't work at all on my own computer because there is some stupid thing that prevents me from logging in. This has worked once for me and if you want to take your chances with it you can but now I can't get a refund because I've been trying to fix it. This is a great game but hardly ever logs in."
Negative,"I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone. On the surface, the game seems great. Who wouldn't want more Elder Scrolls? Open world across all Tamriel? It should be any Elder Scrolls fans dream. But it isn't Once you get past the initial allure of ""endless Elder Scrolls"" the cracks begin to show and they never seem to end. Rewards from things like Tribute and whatnot are not a sure thing. The game is very buggy in unpredictable ways, and the support staff of the company constantly seems to be playing catch-up in this regard. Patches are wildly hit or miss, with very little consideration for the actual player base being factored in. The community of players is also frequently at each other's throats because of all of these negatives. There are also tons of micro-transactions, not related to leveling, but for cosmetics and whatnot and housing where the odds from things like Crown Crates are horrendous and just meant to prey on gullible or stupid people who are going to dump money into them. Seriously, just wait for TES 6Edit: I came back to this game for a bit this year with the announcement of the new class and the expansion involving part of Morrowind. There was positive buzz around the game for the first time in what felt like years. My play time in the past 2 weeks has been essentially logging on, collecting my daily log-in, and checking a few things and logging off. If that. The cash shop stuff is getting more expansion and more pushy, the new model for expansions means what would've been multiple DLCs of content in past years is 1 DLC with extremely mediocre QOL changes that should in no way shape or form be considered suitable substitute for actual DLC content (the PTS is out for this stuff, it's pretty bleak). If you insist on playing a game where the devs clearly only care about money, just go play Diablo 4. At least that game does the cash shop right. Most of the cosmetics are trash and there's nothing remotely close to as egregiously bad of a practice as ESO+ essentially being required because of the Crafting Bag. The ESO devs really are not even trying anymore. Funny enough, if you look at every ""developer response"" to negative reviews here it is just a copy and pasted bland response from ""The Elder Scrolls Online Team"" so you know they are not listening to anybody. It's been a decade and they are out of ideas."
Negative,"The annoyance of ""spend money to play the game"" is beyond measure. It is frustrating to spend good money on a game and then be pushed to spend more money to access features that should just be a part of the game..."
Negative,I should like this game but I don't
Negative,As of now it seems that they just need to start fixing everything that has to do with login because i see that they have had tons of issues in the past with it and they still have tons of issues
Negative,Вот бы в 2017-м русский язык не поддерживать.
Negative,This is the most boring shit I've ever played in my entire life
Negative,"New players get more purchasing a game right now than veterans playing a game for few years. Game has a great way of appreciation, the only thing they worry is how to get more money out of you. I would'nt bother with this one if you are not ready to spend constant cash all the time. It's NOT a one time purchase, they want your cash alot and they remind it in every step."
Negative,"every update makes the game worse, it is now just an overpriced skinners box. $500 doesnt even get you half the gems you need to buy the apex reward from crown crates, horses take 180 days to upgrade PER CHARACTER, inventory space is a joke but you can pay 140$ a year to remove the limit of crafting items. other than that its 10$ per 10 inventory slots. most new ""content"" is just skins and armor that is not added to the game but instead added to the casino that as i mentioned before $500 doesnt even get you halfway to getting the cool gear. now onto gameplay. for some reason modern games just love to make the time to kill enemies (TTK) take a long time. im lvl 1000 and have bulit my characters the ""meta"" build but my attacks are still weak, on the flipside if i create a new character and use junk gear im suddenly strong. but the moment i hit lvl 50 the character becomes weak as hell again. all in the name of inflating playtime as well as cutting the work load. ZOS gets to claim they are ""working"" and added difficulty to combat when all they did is change #s to make the enemies take longer to kill.i have 900 hours on steam over 600 on xbox and probally 400 on the pc launcher version before the game came to steam. in all my gameplay i still havent even gotten enough crafting materials to make a full set of the yellow top teir gear. i do my daily writs every time i log in and still need to craft 4 peices of yellow gear.ingame houses cost more than a new AAA game. the good houses cost $140 no that wasnt a typo ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS for a stupid ingame house.ZOS is worse than ubisoft or ea they just arent as popular so they dont get the negative recognition they deservegreat game, entirely different play style from other elder scrolls but its still great characters and stories and amazing places to explore and dungeons and raids not just fetch nonsense.the grind is pretty crazy id like things to be less intimidating to collect ie 30 mins for enough jute to do my writ, btw im lvl 27 or so and not cp and only needed 16 juteprices are jacked up, i bought them all but its a deterrent for my brother and friend that i play with and bought copies for. so now i either need to buy them the dlcs and such or they will still be deterred. it would be nice it the costs were lower though so more people could get those. also crown crates... im not getting into how much i spent trying to get the starchaser senche, please add an option to buy all loot box items and remove duplicates. most games lootboxes have duplicate protection so you get all the items first before duplicates can be acquired or they prevent duplicated entirely. also games usually provide an option for 60-120$ to buy the entire collection. that would still encourage more purchases, provide people a way to buy all at once increasing the allure of buying them and increase the number of people who can or would be willing to engage with the crown crates because in their current state they are not worth italso please make it so that horse stats transfer between characters, i paid to upgrade my horse and then i start a new character and all my collectables and upgrades carry over except the horse stats and waiting 180 days for each character is bonkers"
Negative,"End game requires hundreds of hours of preparation, and working in large groups. You'll spend more searching for people(that are good) instead of actually playing.Do both"
Negative,"I picked up this game again after a long time and frankly put, the game would be fun if it wasn't for predatory inventory management systems hidden behind subscription packages that are nearly impossible to unsubscribe from. Make the crafting bag free or an individual micro-transaction for .99 or something. Game is unplayable otherwise."
Negative,"Under the Sid Meier definition that ""a game is a series of interesting decisions,"" you'll find that there's little interesting decisions to be made in Elder Scrolls Online.  By and large, there's three builds: health (tank) stamina (physical DPS) and magicka (magic DPS) and everything else is just flavor.  Most builds just involve animation interrupting your way through an optimal hotbar rotation while dodging the red, and this quickly becomes muscle memory, like some kind of dance.  Consequently, the gameplay in ESO is a very chill experience largely enjoyed by MMO players who don't want to have to think too much.That's fine, because by and large Elder Scrolls is more of a theme park experience.  All of the content is really nifty, and there's much to enjoy as you drift from attraction to attraction being guided by the digital animatronics.  The whole thing is elaborate back-canon lore they've contrived for a 1st Era Elder Scrolls prequel taking place a thousand years before Skyrim, but this makes for reasonably entertaining MMO content.  Hey, there's nothing wrong with wanting to visit a theme park, just look at being nickle and dimed with arbitrary inventory caps and DLC access as a form of concessions.If you're fine with it being a theme park you dance through, then the main thing that's wrong with Elder Scrolls Online is that the technical bloat is getting a tad unwieldy.  In fact, my last 12 hours of recorded play time were just spent just trying to download the game.  The client is nearly up to 100 gigabytes, and if something goes wrong their instructions say[help.elderscrollsonline.com] you have to run a repair which turns out to be another 52 gigabytes to download.  The launcher alone is single-handedly depleting my broadband cap, but you'll find no shortage of reviews indicating that the game that exists past the launcher is pretty bloated too.Personally, I would not recommend this game to just anyone.  If you want to play a better-looking MMORPG with deeper decisions, go play Final Fantasy XIV.  If you want to play the best MMORPG from the last generation, go play Guild Wars 2.  If you want to play what everyone else is playing, you're already playing WoW.  If you want to play a good game, wean yourself from MMORPGs entirely, as they're generally less games and more high grade Skinner's boxes with social trappings that will sap you of your time.  But, if you want to visit a MMO you can largely sleepwalk through while visiting a massive Elder Scrolls theme park, then you're in the right place."
Negative,ITS JUST NO FUN
Negative,At least it isn't New World.
Negative,"A hollow shell of the single player games. Almost no immersion and feels like a generic MMO wearing an Elder Scrolls skin. Egregiously overpriced macro-transactions. If you love the Elder Scrolls games like Oblivion and Skyrim, but want to play them co-op, this does not satisfy that craving even in the slightest, unless you already love playing MMORPGs.I can see this being appealing to folks who like Elder Scrolls and love MMORPGs, but if you love Elder Scrolls and hate MMORPGs, this game really has no redeeming values, outside of the general fun of playing games with friends. But that usually boils down to your friends being fun to play games with, and not the game being good on it's own. Not to mention that the MMO-optimized assets like models and textures feel cheap and flat compared to Skyrim."
Negative,"Lacks the character found in other Elder Scrolls games, instead replaced with mundane fetch quests. If you went into ESO thinking it would be like Morrowind, Oblivion or Skyrim, you will be gravely disapointed.The varied gameplay all suffers from the same problem, the combat in entirely created with latency in mind. For example in Skyrim you would have about half of a second to block and would most likely be unable to block in time if you were mid-swing, ESO on the other hand gives you about 5 seconds and a flashing indicator above a foe's head whenever you have to block or get out of the way.While it has the lore of the Elder Scrolls franchise to build itself upon, the experience feels unrefined and overall bland."
Negative,"I played this game for about an hour. I found the game not engaging, Just going through the startup was boring.i felt the graphics were poor. I do not recommend this software to anyone.Refund my money."
Negative,"Game kinda boring to be honest, but that is my opinion. The base games story is really boring to play however the story for Elsweyr is decent enough. I would highly suggest getting friends to play with you, if you plan to play this game. Also there are no good severs for South Africa."
Negative,"I redownloaded this game after years of not playing it, wanting to try it out again. I spent hours downloading it, just to not be able to play due to a launcher issue. I spent subsequent hours trying to fix the stupid launcher, but to no avail. I even uninstalled and tried downloading it again. No luck. I wasted hours of my life and couldn't even get this to open. Don't bother wasting your life with this piece of crap."
Negative,This game is awesome but the steam connectivity issue is really bad. I can't play at all tonight because of this BS. I want my money back because I can't play. No solution on the internet so far and this is really frustrating. What do you mean??
Negative,"terrible combat horribly boring writing a bland generic forgettable world and all of this is only there to shove micro-transactions in your face it would genuinely be a challenge to find a game worse than eso, on top of it having some of the worst combat in any game in history it also sets up its respawning encounters so that you have to pass by it on your way to the quest objective meaning you have to fight through the absolute garbage combat encounters multiple times for the same encounter it is beyond boring even without all the bugs this game is utter garbage"
Negative,"Cannot get past the loading screen. Repaired 4 times, NO SUPPORT. $40.00 GONE!!!  DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!DEMANDING MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!"
Negative,Waste of time.
Negative,laser beam goes brr
Negative,Pay 200 gold to get yourself unstuck. Where is this money going...?
Negative,"I asked for a refund and got nothing, thanks for the help."
Negative,It takes me NT$299 and 4 hours to download this game.Then I found out I cannot even login.UNACCEPTABLE
Negative,"Normally I would highly recommend it, but the recent ""performance"" patches and overall gameplay decisions (specifically regarding PvP) make me change my recommendation.IF you want to play alone, for the storylines, sure. Go ahead. It's an excellent game.IF you want to do anything else, specially PvP with friends, then no. Stay away."
Negative,"The game used to be really fun back when I played years ago. Now the game is just EASY mode with the whole game scaling to your level. I do not find ANYTHING outside of dungeons to be challenging at all. Even world bosses can be solo. But the worst part is, they added LGTBQ BS agenda to the game. Now conversations confuse tf out of me with incorrect grammar and English. For example (It wont be 100% accurate but it goes like) ""I'll meet you at Toothmaul Gully, I can't wait for you to meet them"" Who is them? One fucking person, I thought it was her crew. Who is her? It's a they, I was told they fawn over new people like me..... Can we just keep the English normal? I really don't care of you are gay, at all. My issue is the language and gender.... Stop it.... Since I bought the fucking game and DLC I will finish it BUT I will not be buying new DLC nor support this game any longer after Gold Road is finished."
Negative,"I started playing ESO Day 1 it released for XBOX, I moved to PC over 3 years ago, and played on the downloaded launcher from the website, until swapping to Steam. It WAS a great game. Unfortunately ZOS (Zenimax) does not care about its players. If you've played more than a few years, you're being screwed over. PvP players are screwed over the most, endgame PvE players after that, and then everyone else essentially. ESO at one time had the opportunity to be the most popular MMO, but failed to capitalize on that. So games like FF14 chose to not make the same mistakes ESO and other games have. A good way to compare is with LOTRO, its devs did the exact same thing and its all but killed their game. I and many other left ESO after playing for years, because we just can't play a game that screws us over that badly. There is no whisper of balance in the game, and every new class added only makes it worse. The company also takes things from more successful games, and markets it as their original idea. I understand many companies do this, but I don't like it at all. Arcanist was one such example, especially since there is already a spellcaster-esque class, Sorcerer. If ZOS had looked once at the player feedback they would have seen so many other things their community WANTED to pay them to bring into the game. I truly wish that ZOS would turn this sinking ship around and make the game better for both PvP and PvE. Screwing over your players is not the answer ZOS. I and so many others would come back to the game we loved if they did."
Negative,"Don't expect this game to be a ""Skyrim Online"" It's not.I don't enjoy this game as much as I enjoyed Skyrim.But I haven't played with my friends yet, so I might change my opinion later.The stuff I've been enjoying the most are the Character Creation and the one dungeon I've tried.Even tho I feel the game was overpriced I still think I got a lot of files for that money since it took like 60gb +"
Negative,"As far as MMORPG's go, this one takes the cake. The story lines are well defined, and not nearly as repetitive as their competitors. However, as far as Elder Scrolls games go, this is one of the worst. The ridiculously over priced DLC makes up for the fact that you aren't required to pay monthly subscriptions (though you can if you don't want to buy all the DLC's separately pay for their premium service which automatically includes all of 'em). Another disappointment to me was the lack of availability to regions of Tamriel like Skyrim, though that may come with future DLC. I'm torn as whether to recommend this game or not, because if you're looking solely for an MMO, totally pay the monthly fee and get ESO. If you're looking for a good Elder Scrolls game, give this one a pass. Because I was looking for the latter, I'm gonna thumbs it down."
Negative,"A decent MMORPG, with many possibilities and good updates/promotions. BUT. A big problem is that the Zenimax Studios does not treat its primary supporters well. I'm talking about the people who bought the TESO game as soon as they could, for a high price almost at the launch date. Those people, have to buy the DLCs, even though they've bought the original game years ago, while the newcomers get the DLCs(currently Morrowind and Summerset soon) for free. Not saying that it is a bad idea to give out the old DLCs to the newcomers as a promotion, but treat people equally, please. If you decide to include any DLCs for free in the base game copy, upgrade the whole base game so that the old supporters don't feel scammed. Would rate 8/10, but since the servers uptime had been fairly unstable and this whole DLC situation, i'd say 6/10"
Negative,Go there and kill the guy with alot of hp and get 27 items and run out of space and sell it and do it again simulator
Negative,Felt like a TES game but with none of your actions actually mattering. Combat isn't that interesting. Monthly membership is almost required just for inventory space.
Negative,"Painfully average! Not a Elder scroll game rather its a reskin of other generic MMO games. The game is a grind fest with some rewards but it doesnt keep you engaged. The level of immersion is really shallow with random spawns and premiun users having monarchy. This game is streamlined to a point where everyone gets everything but somehow that feels uncharacteristic. The game discourages multiplayer gameplay and more on singleplayer aspects. Even after all these years the game is still unappealing and plain boring! Is it enjoyable, I guess if you enjoy grinding and beating your head to a wall."
Negative,"every single addition to the game, paid DLCpotato servers - drops a lot and when it's up high pingfull of bugs (quests, skills, party, dungeons, achievements,...)imbalanced builds and changes to the core mechanics very oftencompared to other MMO: not goodcompared to offline elder scrolls: not good"
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM This is the only game onm steam i have had any issues with. The game comes with 30 day free sub, but to activate it i have to pay for a normal sub, WHAT  A FUCKING JOKE. On top of that i keep getting an error messgae while the game is trying to update "" Webget request failed"", i have followed the information and ideas on how to resolve this issue and nothing works., submitted a tciket though the games website and yet to hear back.A COMPLET AND TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY"
Negative,"TLDR:The game is quite fun. Large world, lots of quests, lots of stories.   However, it is getting a thumbs down because of clunky handling through steam (don't get it through steam!), frequent crashes and server problems, not something I would expect for a mature MMO. The Review: Updated 7/30/2017Guilds: The game allows a player to be in up to 5 guilds. I have hoined only one guild, and it functions as expected, complete with guild chat, guld bank, and guild store.  The only thing missing is a guild house, which apparently is not a thing.  No big loss there, as guild leaders home can act as a guild house, and guild housing always seemed pointless.Player Count:  Lots of people seem to be playing in all zones.Story Telling:  Story telling is pretty good, lots of voice acting, but it could use a larger cast of actors.Solo Friendly:  Most quests are solo friendly, but faster with a group.  You get credit for mob kills/quest completion as long as you help.  Not sure what the limits are, there a few times when I arrived right at the end, got off a couple of shots and got no credit, but most of the time I get credit for a kill, even if it was a token effort.PVP friendly:  This game has open world PVP in Cyrodill, and imperial city (and one other zone), as well as arenas.  Imperial city was pretty much empty when I went there.  Cyrodill, however was always busy.  There are several versions of Cyrodill available depending upon your level, so you can jump in at level 10.  You will die a lot, but then you will die a lot anyway... For me, the open world realm v realm (three realms) is quite entertaining, and a highlight of the game.  I'm not a fan of arena's so can't comment on it.Level Friendly:  Game auto adjusts player and/or monster so you can have a fun experience in any zone at any level.  It does the same thing in PVP and dungeons.Leveling System:  You have standard levels 1-50, after 50 you accumulate champion points which buy buffs and powers that affect all the characters in your account.  The champion system goes quite high, but gear stops leveling at 160.  For me, champion points up to 100 went ridiculously fast and didn't seem to slow down until I hit about 105.  The consequence of this is that getting 'good' gear has been pretty much a waste of time as it is outleveled so fast.  After 100 leveling is brisk, but not ridiculously so.  My advice is to save any XP scrolls you get (from game purchase) until you notice your champion point gains slowing down.Crafting:  Crafting system is pretty complex.  Luckily there are mods (yes mods are legal) that can help keep things organized.  Don't expect to be on par with veteran players anytime soon, no matter how much effort you put into crafting, armor and weapons have 9 traits, each trait takes longer than the one before it, and making some top-end gear requires knowing all 9 traits.  It can take the better part of a (real life) year to research all traits.  In retrospect, I wish I had not purchsed through Steam.  Steam has to be running just to launch the game, and if you want to subscribe you have to do so through Steam (and they don't seem to handle that very well).  Instead of dealing with one company and one online system you have to deal with two.  Frankly Steam just gets in the way and makes things more cumbersome than necessary."
Negative,"Just payed $40 for new expansion and $15 to get a month of game time. Unfortunately, I have this game on steam. Every time I launch game, it crashes before I see the characters. I have troubleshooted every method I could find going back to 2016, and everything I could find on the forums posted by the mod ZOS_BillE. Nothing worked! I want to play the game, and I wish it worked. I wish I didn't have to come up on another 8 hours of troubleshooting before quitting this game again."
Negative,What a disappointment.
Negative,Great game let down by stability issues / logging on issues / maintenance windows and updates taking ages to download
Negative,"1 - Free week starts - ""Yay! Time to try before buy!""2 - Its a 80gbs download - ""Well, that's a bit demanding but fine""3 - Spends 3 days downloading - ""Here goes half the free period...""4 - Download ends - ""By Talos I can finally give it a tr-""5 - Opens a launcher and starts another 30gb download - ""FINE! I'll be patient...""6 - Finishes download, CRITICAL ERROR - ""FFS""7 - Starts another 30gbs dowload - ""Are you serio-""8 - Starts YET ANOTHER 60gbs download"" - ""Gives up and CALMLY uninstalls""IF YOU ARE GOING TO LET THE LAUNCHER UPDATE A TOTAL BIGGER THAN THE ENTIRE ACTUAL GAME, WHY PUT 80GBS ON TOP OF IT?JUST LET STEAM DOWNLOAD THE LAUNCHER, THEN LET THE LAUNCHER DOWNLOAD THE GAME FFS.Yes, all the playtime was spent ""patching"" the game in the launcher before I gave up at the second 26%."
Negative,"I've never played a more boring MMORPG.  I've seriously tried to like this game but the quests....OH the quests.... literally 95% of all the quests ive gotten so far (9 hoours in) have all been 'go talk to this person, then this person, then this person, then theres a dungeon but before and after u need to talk to these people 5 times!' like FUCK.  I've been waiting for it to end BUT IT NEVER DOES!!!With the combat you can only have 5 abilities set at any given time...so thats not fun...honestly nothing about his game is very fun.  It's just brainless tedious quests over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over."
Negative,"The Elder Scrolls Online, for me, fell short of expectations. The buggy servers and rushed feel of the game left me with the impression of a Disney straight-to-video movie – it may resonate with some, but for me, it didn't quite hit the mark.While there's certainly a lot to do in the game, I found myself lacking the motivation to engage with much of it. The few hours I spent playing didn't feel worth the cost or the hefty download size. It's disappointing, considering the potential of the Elder Scrolls series and the high expectations that come with it.Comparisons to Fallout 76 are inevitable, and while The Elder Scrolls Online may have fared slightly better, it still feels like a rushed cash grab. Bethesda Studios would do well to find a developer committed to delivering a truly immersive MMO experience worthy of the Elder Scrolls name.If you can snag The Elder Scrolls Online for less than $5, you might find some enjoyment in it. However, it falls far short of its potential due to lackluster support and execution. Here's hoping for a brighter future for the series in the MMO RPG genre."
Negative,"Not an Elder Scrolls game to me, sorry. And the recurring membership fees/crowns and expansions are expensive"
Negative,This is perhaps the most frustrating game I have ever installed and its sign in multiplayer thing wont let me log in again. I love the elder scrolls games but this one just makes me want to break something.
Negative,"Had to stop playing after I realized the only part of the game I liked was the crafting. You can find materials in the world or by breaking down certain types of items like weapons and armor. There are several different avenues (cloth amor, blacksmith, alchemy, woodworking, enchantment and provisioning [cooking]), and the leveling system in ESO is quicker to reward you for progress than Skyrim. Some cities will also ""certify"" you, meaning you can take the tutorial in any/all the crafting types and then take daily missions to fill quotas, and you get rewarded with xp and bonus materials so it doesn't feel as much like grinding. There are also special research options for weapons and armore to add gems that give special properties. I hope TES6 takes a page from this system.That said, the rest of the game is just... boring. Like, really fucking boring. It's open-world, but the quests all play out the same way: talk to this dude, go find/kill this thing, meet up with some other guy, kill/find the last thing, get reward. The rewards are usually only good to break down into components for crafting because even early on you can make gear better than what you can loot. Maybe that changes in the end-game stages, but I don't see myself ever playing that long.You can't choose to be good or evil, there are no real branching paths that the quests take, dialog is pretty much limited to 'yes', 'no', and 'what is this?' options, and you can see the plot twists coming a mile away. It feel more like I've been given a laundry list of chores than going out adventuring.I'll summarize one of the last quests I did: ""Go get me these reagents from my dead ancestors so we can summon an ancient daedra to smite these invaders. I'd already tried and they said no, but I'm sure they were just being dicks."" ... ""Hahaha! Look how well my plan worked! Suck it ancestors, I'm amazing!"" ... ""Oh no! The daedra is too powerful to banish! Why didn't my ancestors warn me??""I don't play pvp so I can't comment on it, but there isn't much about this game that makes it stand out from any other MMO on the market, so I'd be surprised if the pvp was any different. I want to be clear though: I't not a bad game. The pve game mechanincs are solid, graphics are good, has the standard microtransaction fare that pretty much all MMOs have these days. But the whole time I was playing I kind of just wanted to do something else.TL;DR: It's got all the trappings of a solid MMO, but it's boring as fuck because every mission is the same. Great crafting system though."
Negative,"Don't buy if you want to try it, just watch gameplay and reviews. It's not worth the money or time as you won't be refunded..This game has an update client that counts off steam updating time as playtime, goodbye 2 hour playtime limit for refunds. The initial update is at least 60gb, so.. It hurts to see that the new Microsoft Flight Simulator update process doesn't count towards playtime, but this games updater does when it's the same exact scenario..Damn you, Todd Howard, stealing my money.."
Negative,"yikes so the game is straight up pay to win online. which really makes it unfair for other players. the game has a subscription which gives almost all the dlc which is unacceptable. if you are paying 15 dollars a month for ""almost all"" then you can tell why this game has the bad reviews. i have played this game for a long time and have seen both worlds. you are severely handicapped without getting eso plus therefor i can't support or at all recommend this game to anyone."
Negative,This game is nothing like skyrim other than the music
Negative,this game fuckin sucks
Negative,Still no ragdoll physics in game using Havok in 2018 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Negative,Bethesda is a clown company and their games are the jokes
Negative,Keeps crashing won't let me in.
Negative,I love MMORPGs however i hate being left out.the time it takes for me to get to endgame is a extremely long plus i dont play ESO alone this would eliminate the opportunity for me to play other games.Im not talking about lvl 50 i mean beyond that champion points.I would like a way for me to get to endgame quick i understand theres alot of content however i tend to play less when i feel im making no progress and take brakes of up to weeks or even months.Basically there should be a better way to catch up.The game itself is well worth it however the time consumption is way to much.
Negative,"This game if painfully average. Carrying the Elder Scrolls name is all that I feel may be holding the game up, it is certainly the only reason I bothered to buy the game. GOOD = Strong, fun and engaging leveling system coupled with a fairly nice combat system were the only strong points to this game. The PVP was pretty good, but as I am not one to enjoy PVP all that much this was of no real use to me.BAD = The looting, weak economic system and purchase to enjoy type in game store ruined it. Has some fairly Average Graphics, to some times very weak Graphics... especially for an Elder Scrolls game. Also the Questing/PVE with friends system is utterly broken and absurd. There is no real questing together, it is mostly you and your friend or friends questing single player, but just happening to be able to see each other in game. Often there I found my self dreading other players helping or even just joining in a battle at the last moment. Another note on questing, it became very monotonous, and much like busy work. Also weak traveling options aside from the outrageously expensive mounts made questing a chore. Battles, in game story quest, boss fights and the like were very often anti-climatic. Like I mentioned loot was appallingly weak, spending lots of time on a quest to end up killing a boss and be reward 2-3 gold was very frustrating and made me regret doing stuff. Battles for towns consisting of fairly weak enemy numbers and friendly NPCs that would stand around doing nothing... Compared to what the trailers and previews for the game would make it seem like were almost a spit in the face from the developers. It seemed like they spent more time making the advertising for the game almost more enjoyable than the game play and story line its self. For now it is not a subscription based game which is good because that was one of the only things that made me willing to buy. This game is nowhere near 60 or even 80 dollars, especially when your going to find yourself after having played it feeling like you need to spend more on the in game store just to enjoy it. Also at that price for such an average game is not worth it. Do your self a favor and if you absolutely must get this game like I did being a big Elder Scrolls fan, wait till its on sale. Other wise I suggest finding another MMORPG, there are some very good ones that are also non-subscription based games you should look into."
Negative,"Game's great but it uninstalls itself everytime you log out of it now since late last year and you have to reinstall a 60gb game every time you want to play, Zenimax couldn't care less though, they've made their account systems pointless because everytime you log in it accuses you of using a new IP and demands a code, then says the code's incorrect thus preventing you from acctually raising the issue. I sunk at least £100 into ESO and I'm now basically rendered unable to play the game. I'll never buy a game ascociated to these companies again."
Negative,"The mouse sensitivity is absolutely horrible. It also changes when you sprint, which is beyond stupid. The game feels absolutely horrible to play as a PC player, and I can't refund it either because I played it for more than 2 hours. Those two hours were spent downloading a massive amount of data on top of the 90+ gigabytes that steam has you download. I've played many MMORPGs and I have to say, ESO has the worst feeling controls out of all of them."
Negative,"Despite my deepest desire to find an mmo I could actually enjoy, after playing ESO I decided that even the greatest, no subscription required MMO  is still an MMO.  And even if I dont pay for a subscription, I still dont want to spend my time playing an MMO in 2019. If you like MMOs you might like it."
Negative,Not a big fan.Edit: It still sucks...
Negative,"never got the play, game has the world's worst login system i've ever seen."
Negative,"FIX YOUR PRICE, ITS GOT 12 TIMES AS EXPENSIVE IN A WEEK 👎👎👎👎"
Negative,This game is sad now
Negative,"constant bugs, fix one 5 more come. takes for ever for any fixes with no compensation. im actually waiting on a fix for invisiable npc that I cant turn in quest"
Negative,"Everyone insisted this game was different. It's not. It's just another MMO, which I guess is fine, if MMOs are your thing, but I bought this expecting something better."
Negative,"The game is so easy that it's hardly playable...i did a 4 man dungeon with only one person, it can probably be done solo. While questing, you can just stand in one spot and kill 5 mobs with left click, the game gives me no motivation to use skills, which have no cd btw...I understand that there may be harder dungeon modes later on, but investing 100+ hours or so before getting there doesn't seem worth it...a shame that such a world has absolutely no thrill."
Negative,"completely NOT what I was hoping it would be.Maybe what I'm looking for D&D in a game with other people.I don't know if such a game exists, but I'm going to find it.I guess I hoped ESO would be Skyrim (immersive solo RP) but as an MMO, which it is definitely not.Sorry."
Negative,"Beware Mac users. Steam claims the minimum requirements for Mac is OS X 10.9 but it won't run for me on Mac OS X 10.12.6. The launcher works, but the actual game doesn't. When I try to open the application directly it says I need OS X 10.13 or later. Plus it took a million years to install something I can't even use."
Negative,"Cool theme and idea but it doesn't really go beyond that for me. Back between the beta and release, I loved it but at the time, my ISP was blocking it in the UK for some bizarre reason. The issue has been solved for years but I only just got around to giving it a go and I was just bored from the get go.I just feel like things move too slowly and things feel too basic. The small inventory is bugging me already (why are there so few merchants to help manage that?) and instead of feeling like an Elder Scrolls game, it feels more like I'm just standing there hitting skills. The whole thing feels a bit wooden and lifeless.Maybe FFXIV has spoiled me but so far, it hasn't convinced me to stick at it. FFXIV had me wanting more from the start, this had me wondering when it was going to start as soon as I got to play. I think I'll just wait for the multiplayer/co-op Skyrim mod that's going into open beta once the closed beta ends for this kind of game. ESO isn't awful, it just isn't particularly great... or interesting.You could be drinking tea while you make more tea instead."
Negative,lost out money.paid threw steam to get some dlc packs on sale.no coins were in  my eso account.talked to both and no one wants to help.very upest.
Negative,"never got the chance to play it, i tried fixing it and nothing worked, that's $20 down the drain"
Negative,"""Wasn't I just in this cave? Oh wait, they're all the same""-10/10"
Negative,"cringe, scum game full of paywallsedit: the developers are lying to me in their response, the fucken audacity, shove it up your ass"
Negative,"It took me 5 hours to finish the tutorial after countless server issues and silent crashes, if that's not statement enough to Bethesdas complete incompetence I don't know what is. I can't even refund it now because my playtime is over the 2 hour limit. If spaguetti coding ever became an olimpic sport Bethesda would take the gold.I'll update this review if anything changes but god fucking dammit we are not off to a good start."
Negative,Just reinstalled the game to have some distraction. I thought it would help me recover from anhedonia since I coping with chronic depression. Then I realized ESO blocked my IP address due to the United States sanctions so I need to play with a VPN...In Iran we don't have a high quality internet connection and as far as I know ESO still struggles with high ping problems and performance issues. loading times even didn't let me visit my in game house for the last time in my life.I'm so sorry that I can't recommend this game to anyone anymore.
Negative,"I gonna give this game a thumb down as there is no option for something inbetweenI played during the free weekend of this game, and after the first 7 hours I just wanted to quit, However I'm aware that with an MMO 7 hour is not enough to judge the game. So I mange to get some more hours in during the weekend and the  more I played, the more I started to liked it, BUT i would not pay the full price for this game and absolutly not subcribe a monthly fee.Have in mind that I only played solo, and at least in the begining of the game you don't really need a group.What I like with the game is + The quest. They put a lot in to it and it's not your usual ""go there, kill xx of this mob and then return to the quest NPC"".  + It is an open world. You can run around and just explore both quest and other thing tells you a lot of the Lore in Elderscrolls world. + Crafting is nice. Find the material, refine it, craft the item, put more items in and get a better result. (crafting is one of my favourite things in games) and I feel they did a good job here as well.The problem is that is wants to be like Skyrim and an MMO at the same time, and the mechanic in Skyrim does not fit well with an MMO in my opinion.- The fighting mechanics does not fit well with an MMO. During the time I played I used the same 3 skills over and over again in combat. I used range spells so I did not need any of the block mechanics and had a ""pet"" to tank me. - They also made the game for console which dumbed down the UI a lot. The the quickbar is limited to 6 skillslots plus a quickslot for one type of potion and one elite skill. This is sad for me as a PC player and one of the reasons I only use the same 3 skills in combat.- Everything is to easy. They scale most of the enemies to the same lvl or a few lvls higher. So the combats aren't much of a challenge if there isn't a lot of mobs.- There's a bunch of small bugs I have not seen anything gamebreaking but there is a lot of them.Majestical HorkPointed out that it is the controller compatability, that makes the UI and combat mechanic so bad and I agree 100% on that. Mabye my bad English did not make that clear.As you can notice most of the things that I like you can easly get from a Single player game and the downside is the mutliplayer mechanics. As a game I like it, but as an MMO I don't. I'd suggest maybe getting this game on a sale when you dont have anything else to do."
Negative,"Do a search on this game and you'll find ALL kinds of issues and ""fixes"" that don't work. ""unplug ethernet cable so you can do this and that then plug it back in"" whaaatT?THen once you get that to work the launcher will freeze. Reinstall and same issues but then it crashes. Fix that and then an error. I have no issues with my computer or any other games, just this damn launcher and I am not alone. Do a search on Elder Scroll launcher freeze or crash issues. . Steam is garbage. They have ZERO customer support and their tech support is non existent. No refund on games you played 2 or more hours. Ok. but I didnt ""play"" the game. The game won't launch and now I cant get a refund? seriously? You can't tell from your side that I never played the game? That the launcher freezes and I am literally not connected, nor ever, to a game server??"
Negative,"I guess this game will be good if you can actually login to the server. For 2 days i have been banging my head in the laptop but still not able to login to play. I somehow was able to login into EU server for 5 minutes, after getting booted out of the server again. I guess i should have donated my money to some needy people rather that wasting it on this game. I was really looking forward to this game, but so so disappointed. I am also a developer, and i understand there may be some server issue but for 6 months. That's just poor management. Thanks Steam so much for opening my eyes to buying game from you guys. Adios!"
Negative,"It just doesn't have the same feel as Skyrim, cool MMO, but not Cool Elder Scrolls game imo:"
Negative,"Feels like a metro station during rush hour! The biggest problem of this MMO is that there is just no atmosphere - you are constantly surrounded by other players. The enemies are laughable, no challenge at all. Especially if there is one enemy and maybe 5 players killing it the moment it spawns. In case your ""quest"" is to kill 10 enemies of a certain type you literally have to wait to get your shot. Maybe they should introduce a ticket system where you draw a number at the entrance of a dungeon (no instances in this game...) to get 30 sec time with an enemy.The quests are way too easy as well. Just in the beginner island there is a supposed massive ritual going an to destroy a complete island and it is guarded by 3 enemies on the same level you are? There is no strategy, no buffing, just mindless clicking on my strongest spell and I killed all of them without getting any damage."
Negative,"this is also not working ,do you guys see a patteren?"
Negative,Crashed consisently. Won't even let me play.
Negative,fuck the devs
Negative,"I could write a dozen pages about this game, but it is not worth the effort anymore.99% of the time, its generic MMO gameplay with some heartless Elder Scrolls flavor on top. There are too few moments where its actually good, but they have been few. I play dumb clicker games and ESO feels more like one of those than an RPG much of the time, endless grinding for no real progress.If you are mainly an MMO fan, you might enjoy ESO, though I cannot say it does anything unique MMO-wise. If its on sale for $5-10, its not too bad with low expectations.The MMO aspect of the game does not add much than to bring attach generic MMO gameplay elements like stereotypical MMO dungeon raids and the completely ignorable PvP.The game is plagued with issues. Constant login problems over the last couple months (still unresolved as far as I can see). Event bugs (crates that give you nothing, or no crates at all, which is about as good as the worthless trash they give when they work). Their inconsistent polices on chapters verses DLC's and which ESO+ or base game bought at a certain time gets. Lack of support (never gotten a response on any ticket). Level scaling (eg. a mudcrab will be as time consuming to kill at L1 as it will be at L150). Etc.On the upside, a lot of the bugs from beta were fixed, like being able to remain in the same phase as other members in your current party for longer than a couple minutes. I was playing in beta and was completely disappointed for countless reasons, so when I came back to it a couple years later, my expectations were about as low as possible, but ESO managed to surpass those. Its not the joke level bad it used to be, but it is nowhere near worth the few hundred dollars I spent on it so far.I was ESO+ during the periods I play, but I don't think I will care enough about the game to sub again any time soon. Checking if I can get a refund for the last month since I was completely unable to play at any time I tried for a billing cycle and a half, but my expectations are very low (its not worth the time to file a chargeback on $15).Recently started playing original release Skyrim again (no Special Edition, no DLCs, no HD textures, etc) and was surprised at how much better the environments looked in Skyrim 2011 than ESO. I originally didn't get that in to Skyrim due to how overly simplified it was from previous TES games, but after ESO, its been much more engaging.Update: Steam support issued me a refund exemption for ESO+ for this month which logins were still broken."
Negative,"Oh, prepare yourself for this review.This review will not even be about the game because I didn't even get to that point. I paid for the game, downloaded it (if you do not have a fast internet speed, this might take some time), after downloading the game I downloaded the updates through the launcher, and then tried to launch the game. The first error I got was about missing the d3dx9_43.dll. Ok, so I googled several options to be able and fix that error, did some tinkering, and then tried again. Another error, different this time, appeared saying the launcher needed to be closed in order to work. I tried that and it proceeded to not work again.At this point I was a bit frusturated. I get that not ever game download was to be smooth, but this was a very poor first impression on the game, not to mention the lack of help available online for the first error about the missing d3dx9_43.dll. At this point, it was a matter of uninstalling and installing the game several time thus wasting an abundance of time with no effect. Eventually, the launcher would open but it would just be stuck at the loading screen with no sign of advancing. So, recap, without even entering the game I had encountered three errors with the set up of the game on my computer.In the end, I uninstalled it and put in a request fora refund from Steam which they promptly gave me. If you're going to get this game, be prepared as you could be victim to this frusturating process. What a pity."
Negative,"Character creation system sucks, please bethesda change your fucking art director already, you create good worlds but your art sucks"
Negative,"Constant launch issues, not sure if its the game, or steam, though steam seems to have no issues running other games. Also the DLC is MASSIVELY overpriced. Id probably enjoy the game more if it didnt have issues every other time I start it. Do not recommend, just play Skyrim."
Negative,"Good luck to those trying to install this piece of garbage. Typical bethesda game, unoptimized broken mess. Download 90gb on steam only to re-download 60gb through eso launcher and then constantly trying to apply the 60gb patch and fails at the end. The launcher can't locate files that are downloaded and in its launcher folder, have to manually move files. Do yourself a favour and stay away from this. It was a mess when it came out in 2015 or whatever it was and its still a mess now. Multiple people on steam and eso forums with same problems."
Negative,"I am a long time Elder Scrolls fan starting with Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind on the original Xbox. I was an original ESO player on PS3 until I got divorced and no longer had access. Now I got a Macbook Pro for work and it could play the game, but the M1 is not supported. This is a big loss as it is a very capable computer that a lot of people are using."
Negative,"Have been away for a long time, just downloaded and tried again. Still runs slow as hell on a pretty powerful system and gigabit connection. Not worth the frustration waiting for load times."
Negative,it has been 10 years and i still have big regrets spending money on this
Negative,This game is terrible. You can't even play it.The game is plagued with unresponsive login servers that zenimax seems to ignore no matter how many times they get told it's happening.I want my money back.
Negative,cant... even... log into... the game... and.... cant play it... D:
Negative,"Got this game waiting for a TES 5 experience online and bottomline is: nothing that made Skyrim fun can be found in this game. I get that this isn't ""Skyrim Online"" but why shouldn't Bethesda take what made Skyrim so fun and put it in this game? No dual spell casting, boring and bland combat, technical and AI problems (more on that later) and no sense of progression at all.Gotta say though, this game is BEAUTIFUL. While I'm not a big fan of medieval fantasy worlds, it's undeniable that this game has great graphics and it's a delight to admire everything that comprises the universe of TES. There are so many maps and areas you can visit, though I never left the starter dark elf island (whatever its name was) and I even felt a little bad for not visiting places I only heard of while playing Oblivion and Skyrim. If you're a fan of the lore (not my case), I'm sure you'll have a great time if you don't consider how boring the actual game is.I created a dark elf mage to support my friend and it's weird how I never felt I was playing a ranged character, since the spell distance is so short. You can't even pick enemies from afar and take them down one by one instead of being ganged because they'll reset their positions shortly after leaving their initial position, regenerating all of their health and being invulnerable while doing so. So what's the point of being a mage in the first place?The skillset is a mess, so many skills to invest on, while you get only one or two points per level up. The skills aren't even synergic, so unless you like to watch youtube videos on how to create the perfect character instead of actually playing the game, you'll probably waste points in useless skills that doesn't even feel different one from another anyway. I stopped playing by the time I got to level 10 or 13 and despite being fairly experienced in games like this, I still felt like a squishy weakling (despite dying only once, since your health regens after combat like you're immortal or some shit, idk).Since it's an online game, you'll encounter other players during your travels but the dungeons aren't instanced. That sucks so much, since you can't even measure how strong your character is because other high level players will keep jumping into your fights or will kill the enemies before you can even get close. Even when you're alone, the UI is so bad you can't tell at all how much damage you're dealing because the health bar goes towards its center, there are no damage number indicators and the skill descriptions uses megalomaniac numbers like ""bla bla bla deals 817 frost damage, 518 shock damage, 751 flame damage and 4961 damage over 17 seconds"". Gonna need a damn calculator to understand how much damage I'm dealing, for fucks sake.Anyway, I wanted to like this game since TES and FO are unlike any other games in my opinion. Taking that experience online was like, ""that's it, this is gonna be the perfect MMO ever"". But no, it's not even close, I got a bland, generic and essentially boring MMO instead."
Negative,"It's a really nice MMORPG game. You're able to choose the time you want to spend, but still you won't sit back with crap gear. Just because you don't got 4 hours to spend a monday afternoon. Most players online is very kind, help is never far away if you would need it!However, players who want to destroy your gaming. Just need to press the report button. *BAM* Now you're in deep shit! If you by any means offend this person. Even tho he/she might started off by being rude or offensive, they suspend you. You can try to defend yourself. Good luck the support team is basically shit! I will now show you a nice answer i got from getting reported by a kid playing the game, and didn't really had the backbone to stand for what he said. He pressed Report, *BAM* Suspended without any warning. 72 hours without any possibility to play at all.I told Support team that we were actually Role-Playing and i found him rude thats why i said that i might kill him. This MMORPG (RPG=Role playing game) Doesn't allow RP. Because that is very offensive. The fact that the scumbag tried to rip me off for 500 gold. Not really the point since i never reported him. Im going to paste the mail support sent me.""Regardless of how other players may have been behaving, this type of chat cannot be tolerated. The suspension will remain in place for the full 72 hours, and this decision is final. Regards,Elder Scrolls Support""So play the game. But be aware that a simple touch of that report button. And you might end up loosing your account. Since as support said herself. ""Regardless of how other players may have been behaving, this type of chat cannot be tolerated."" Be carefull out there!"
Negative,"I've tried getting back into this game four times already. I always end up getting bored in the first few hours. It's a real shame because I love this franchise. The thing is, I've played too much Skyrim and Oblivion. I'm used to more engaging combat than this game has to offer, even though other Elder Scrolls don't have the best combat system out there. This game is like a dumbed down version of the single player iterances. If you are playing for the lore, I do recommend this game because it has plenty to offer. Otherwise, look somewhere else for your Elder Scrolls experience."
Negative,"The only good thing about this game is the length. Everything else is extremely bad.  Bad mission design . It's either go there and kill everything or collect notes. Then it goes on with respwan times. Most of the time you can't even search a room without having to kill the same enemies 2 or 3 times. they spawn right where you are. The game does not know how to clear a location.The customer support is extremely poor. If you have a problem, you are screwed. I had forgotten my login data. Then they wanted to know what day I bought it in 2016. I was also supposed to call up the security question, which was not possible without login and the related email. Which has not existed for a long time. I explained all this and still I couldn't get access to my old account where I had invested many hundreds of euros. I had to buy the game again and lost everything. The support request took 1 week. after that every 3 to 4 days for a copied answer. They wouldn't even tell me the security question. The store prices are outrageously expensive for a 10 year old game. Companions are poorly written, the missions are boring and the scoring system is drawn out. So I don't want to grind for months to get a shred of story.  Which is also boring and just collecting notes. The stupidest was the last companion mission. Collecting information as usual. Then it sends me to the thieves' hideout, which gives me minus points with the companion. How stupid can you make a mission This game does not deserve the name Elders Scoll and that's exactly why the negative rating.It's a shame for a great game series and only there to make money"
Negative,"Took literally days to download, but started off alright. Once passed the usual obligatory character screen, you are in the big open world and that's when the usability problems start. The game immediately throws quest after quest at you. It feels as though you can't take five steps in the game world without some NPC throwing a quest at you. You can ignore them, but a pointer that looks far to much like your current quest pointer, keeps pointing you at the nearest quest giver. If you like collecting unfinished quests, then this is probably the game for you, but, if like me, you like to concentrate on one quest at a time, or prefer to have just a few active at any time, it's a nightmare.I also think some of the old quests (for newbies) are broken, as when you arrive at the point stated in the mission, the character is rambling on about a completely different quest. It appears as the game has aged, they have simply used the same quest points (and NPC's) for different quests without actually removing the old ones, or at least, ensuring the old quests don't interfere with the new.It's an absolute horrible mess.After just a couple of hours I have given up on the game as it's just a chaotic mess. Which is annoying, given how long it took to download. The game would have been far better suited to having a separate world for new starts so they can get started and find their feet, rather than throwing them in with the main populace.Also, a lot of content is hidden behind a paywall, which I don't mind, if the content is value for money. However, it isn't. If I had a lot of money to burn, then I might consider it worth while, but I don't and I don't think I am going to get any enjoyment from the game either as it's just too messy.Uninstalled it shall be..."
Negative,"Game punishes you for taking a break. Where new players have promotions which allow them to access most old content without additional charge, older players returning are forced to buy things piecemeal."
Negative,I'v played this game for a year or to. When my trial was out I should have still been able to play it. But it wont let me log back onto the game. I wouldn't suggest giving this game to anyone.
Negative,fucking garbageeeeeeeeeeeee gaaaaaaaaame
Negative,"Spent 1 hour trouble shooting the game to actually get it running and past a black screen on launch. Get into the game and it says it can't connect to my Steam account, troubleshoot that for half an hour. Get annoyed, uninstall and download Final Fantasy XIV. It shouldn't be this hard to play a game that you own."
Negative,Cannot even get past the launcher. If you are thinking of buying this game from Steam..Be advised do not. I repeat DO NOT BUY IT FROM HERE...Launcher will start think about updating then completely freeze and 10-15 seconds later will crash...Meanwhile trying to put in a support ticket through ESO or other support channels is met with...It is your ISP's issue not ours or maybe you downloaded it wrong or did you try uninstalling it and installing it again? After explaining it to them several times many different ways the help ceases to exist and you are indeed treated like a 3rd class citizen... No help...No updates..No future for most of the people who attempt to play this through steam. I have 16.1 hours on record all of which have been spent trying to get this blasted thing to function correctly and it has not and more than likely will not. I end this rant with a DO NOT BUY IT HERE.
Negative,"It looks good but that's about all it has going for it. Nothing about ESO makes me feel like its a game or world worth investing hudreds of hours into and $ in whatever is in the cash shop. The concept for the combat is good, the implementaion of it is not on top of a 250 ping in AUS forget it, its still ""playable"" but is something that will become more frustrating over time like I feel many elements of the game would. Not worth it, glad I got to check it out for free."
Negative,"Played this game for over a year now and recently took advantage of the sale on steam to transfer my account onto the steam platform.I would have originally recommended this game however I have just received a 72 hour ban in game for apparently 'botting'.I was a part of a farm group doing a popular grind spot called Dolmen farming in Alik'r Desert, during this time I was auto attacking with my 360 controller and talking to my girlfriend on the phone. I go to loot a chest and bam, I am kicked to menu with an error 307.I looked this up online and it just said something about servers, so I check online and NA server just went down. No worries I thought and log back in. I play for another 5 minutes and bam booted again with 307 error, except this time when I try to log back in I get a message saying you have been suspended, contact support.Believing this was some sort of error since I was clearly present, due to looting and moving around this was clearly obvious I wasn't botting but I also was not moving between points due to being on the phone so I could have been incorrectly lumped with the 30 or so actual bots present there.I go to contact support... except their guide states to login in then press 'appeal suspension' button... when you login the button vanishes.. great, If you don't login and press the button your sent to a page that is trying to get you to reset your account information instead.After spending half an hour trying to find out how to even contact support I finally find a random hyperlink through Google search which takes me to a ticket page which I send a ticket and ask them what was going on and to check logs and see I was clearly moving and collecting loot etc.The response I get was that apparently a gm tried to message me in game, which was a complete lie. I am 100% sure this didn't happen at all.Then when I asked again for them to see I was making clearly none programmable movements due to the fact Dolmen farming is a timed event based on how fast the other two Dolmens are completed and it would be impossible to loot if this was a bot, they dismissed the information.Better yet when I tried to get them to check chat logs since there was no chat from GM at all, the request was dismissed saying that apparently sometime in the previous 24 hours a GM had approached my charecter, changed something and I hadnt responded immediately so this is why I was banned. The only time this happened was the fact I was one shot killed completely out of the blue whilst farming to which I rezzed myself and continued.They state I could have been afk at any point in the 24 hours prior to this around the location of Dolmen farming. I mean come on, apparently if you choose to do any type of farming, your not allowed to even get up for a drink, toilet break or anything for fear of getting banned. What a joke.I have never botted in any game and never been banned in anything ever before. If Zenimax had a legit reason to ban me I would be completely fine but stating first a complete lie over chat and then using something in a 24 hour window to state I was at some point afk is just a joke.I have farmed hundreds of hours in MMORPG's over the span of 16 years and never had this crap happen. Canning this game because of it and I cannot recommend it due to this."
Negative,"whole week during event servers crushed and drop ppl from servers, entire week of lie no comments no excuses trash servers . no game through all over these days. fuk in trash incompetent and greedy grp of ppl called zo$ MF greedy and incompetence"
Negative,"Today I lost 100,000 gold after I placed it in the bank. It was the money I collected from selling stuff in a guild. Of course I checked if I accidentally placed on the guild bank, but that is not the case. I requested assistance but only found the indifference of the lazy support team. Im quitting forever after this. Be careful when placing money on bank, it may suddely disappear just like my desire to continue spending real money on this game."
Negative,the moderator staff is really dumb banning steam players who have to use verified files just at childish whims of pvp players
Negative,New player experience has no challenge; wish I got hooked.
Negative,"just risimg subscribtion price 17x. Great scam, gonna finish all content that i own and drop."
Negative,"Don't bother playing if you are not remotely near their ""mega"" server, unplayable"
Negative,just bad elder scrolls
Negative,FIX THE GODDAMN TUTORIAL BUG! it's utterly annoying that in the tutorial phase you get to punch her and nothing happens
Negative,"I wanted to like this game but its literally just like any other mmo out, shit and not original, the fact its a ""spin-off"" on the ESO series is barely a selling point, and the people this appeals to is the standard greasy nerd who enjoys mmos.Not original, Not challenging, Not fun, Not recommended."
Negative,"Ive played this game alone for over 240 hours, enjoyed it untill i found a friend to play it with and now the game wont even open, has happend before but now i cant get it to work again. i have tried EVERYTHING online for fixes, spent countless hours and stress trying to fix this problem like a software engineer but this game is broken, ive given up as its not worth the headache no more and tech support are completely useless.  all that time wasted.  this game is nearly 8 years old and they cant even make it run for some people. USELESS AND AVOID, GO PLAY WOW INSTEAD!!"
Negative,"Maybe I am a bit old fashioned, yet this game does not have a hero progression arc (as in storytelling). You start as a powerful character (no difficulty in defeating bad-ass mobs from the start), armour looks as good as high level players, you have a lot of items in the inventory… it feels just too much, and after a couple of hours you just skip dialogues in the quest and run towards quest marks.I did not feel like I wanted to beat the game, or other players, felt almost a single player game, but lacked depth of such."
Negative,I do not recommend buying this over the steam.Steam version is buggy and it is probably impossible to get to the game. There is hundreds of topics around the internet regarding Steam version Launcher issues and none was resolved. Some people claim they have the game for year and never got pass logging screen. So buying it here is probably russian roulette. I refunden and bought the game directly from ESO store and now it works.
Negative,"I hate this game, I never plan on playing it...Okay, i'll play it for a couple of hours."
Negative,Game wont launch from Steam anymore for some players...Download/Buy at your own risk
Negative,"Unfortunately, I had to return game, it wasn't playable for me because of the bugs."
Negative,ESO is NOT a BUY-ONCE with Microtransactions or Subscription with added content type game.It DOES have Microtransactions & it DOES have a Subscription with more content.HOWEVER - LITERALLY 30mins into this F'CKING game after you basically finish the tutorial section your inventory will be full. You will have NO INVENTORY SPACE to pick up ANY LOOT and being a complete noob will have to constantly weigh what to throw out and what to keep. THIS IS SO F'CkING MADDENING. You've paid $20-60 dollars for this content but Bethesda wants to 'Fallout 76 your wallet' a little more in order for you to have any space in your inventory to LOOT much of anything in game. PATHETIC.**(For comparison Guild Wars 2 has a basic inventory capacity for every crafting item in-game with one time micro-transactions that offer more capacity for crafting materials or regular inventory if it's not enough for you)
Negative,"Purchased game through steam to try to find something to play during this ""gaming rut""This game is not it. It is old and outdated even though they are pushing a new class/content. I purchased a month subscription (to use the ""crowns"" that comes with to unlock a class - imperial upgrade) - not all the items of the package were mailed to me in game. I am 10+ emails in with devs who have no interest in fixing this and just refer me to steam; even though it is a package within the game. Purchased this game to play with a friend; cancelled the subscription after 3 days of headache. 36 hours played; Launcher sitting open counts. I've played around 15 hours and spent 3 hours making emails to devs to try to have them send me what i've paid for.Do not recommend to anyone -"
Negative,Non-Binary Companion LMAO
Negative,"Unless you plan on spending money on monthly subscription or pour hundreds of dollars into DLC, i wouldn't recommend it. It's a shame though, because the game is absolutely stunning and the combat system and spell visuals are really good."
Negative,"Graphics are meh even on ultra quality. The way NPCs act and talk during quest feels dull and stereotypical of other MMO games, and they seem to have no personality, and the game was very confusing with what to do just killed my immersion and my enjoyment of this game. I remember playing a trail of this game years ago where you started in oblivion having to escape it to be teloported to a random place and the graphics where amazing but now owning this mess this is not the trail i played years ago its like a piss poor downgrade of everything."
Negative,Graphics are shit and gameplay is boring.
Negative,"Marketed as a MMORPG.  Since the server lag is so bad, the game is more like a JRPG."
Negative,"Pros:1. Got the game on sale for $5 on steam2. Great Voice acting & fun combatCons:- Graphics are outdated- Very confusing for a new player as to where to start and what to do. Be prepared to read alot and watch guides- They want you to get ESO+, If you do not your inventory space is the biggest frustration ever. These is so much content    that is locked BEHIND this monthly optional sub but if you want to play this game and stick with it, its not really optional-Everything is the cash shop so this takes Micro transaction to a whole other universe. Mounts, in game housing is out of control.Bottom line the developers had made the main point of this game where if you want it to be enjoyable, you need to spend lost of money, ESO+, cash shop and all expansions. Go for Final Fantasy online or New World."
Negative,3 hours to donload the game.  3 hours to download updates.   I don't even know how long for the game to actually start up the first time.   I do know that it locked my computer up and I had to reboot.  I finally was able to set up my character and found the process to be somewhat minimilistic information wise.   I start playing and find the same minimilistic information approach to be present in teaching you how the game works.  Not even an hour into actual game play and i found myself trapped by a bug that has existed for 2+ years.   Really?  And the fix is that I need to enter into a tool that only exists on the PC version of the game which means me on my mac is hosed.  I found that games ability to interact with my non-apple mouse to be frustrating and not acceptable.   This experience has been a very real waste of my time.
Negative,"The whole game system is made to takes as much money as possible from the players. You can only have some basic things, such as a horse, every other mount must be purchased.Game is ok but publishers greed is too big!"
Negative,This game stinks
Negative,"Wake up in a jailcell, immediately get asked to stop a daedric invasion, fight a practice dummy and get told you're totally ready to take on these daedra, fight some enemies while the girl asking for help heals you the entire time so you literally cannot lose, need to find a crystal, find it and absorb it instead of picking it up because you're special.I miss when in morrowind you start the game and all the strangers call you slurs."
Negative,"It was alright, but buggy.  PVP is a mess because people can initiate a battle against you whilst you're in a cutscene and then attack you after a timer goes if you don't respond.  As a new player I had some random guy pick a fight, a timer went off (a whole 5 seconds) and then he killed me.  I was trying to watch/read an npc interaction.  Stupid knobs who made the game should at least let people know that you are BUSY!  It was confusing and then I was dead and running around a ghost.  WTF.  I hate pvp systems in all mmo's and rarely ever play it, this game seems to be the kind that just throws it at you."
Negative,"Honestly, when I got this game for 10$, I thought ""what the heck, right? Why not?""That was my first mistake.I have not been able to get this game to work at ALL. That 14 hours you see I have? All debugging. All of it. I've spent 14 hours of my life trying to get this piece of absolute garbage game to work, and I haven't had a single bit of luck, no matter what I do. I anticipated the customer service being below par, because it's Bethesda. You don't expect good things from Bethesda, or any of the companies they work with. That's just a general rule of gaming. What I didn't expect was the level of incompetence the customer support provided. The emails I recieved were riddled with incorrect grammar, the fixes were completely off-topic and useless, not to mention the kind of ""support"" I recieved was your textbook 'have you tried verifying your game cache?' or 'try running in compatibility mode!'Oh, and also, guess what Zenimax? Having your support team send out copy-paste emails makes the person they're helping feel like they aren't worth your time! To anyone reading this: Do not buy this waste of harddrive space, unless you are sure you can afford to replace every single piece of your computer one at a time to see what's causing the issue. Also, don't ask for help from the ESO staff--they probably know as much about fixing their game as you do right now."
Negative,Not friendly to new players.
Negative,I just spent 15 dollars because I wanted a wolf as a mount.
Negative,"Tried this game because it was on special and you could play it free for a few days. It took longer to download, install and update than what i played.I suppose i was looking for something like Skyrim or Oblivion. But of course not. It's an MMO. And thus comes with all the failings and trappings of those games. I have personally never enjoyed them for the most part. I wasn't far in. Pushing into my first dungeon. Taking it slow, using the skills. Feeling my way through the latency. Then some dude runs through, smashing everything in sight. He did not explore the cave at all. He did not enjoy the how the area was put together and made. I will assume that this is not his first play through. Which is great for him but by God, what was the point of me being there?No, these games are clearly made for other people. If you dislike MMOs, I would recommend you stay away from this. Even though it's set in the Elder Scrolls universe."
Negative,Space eater virus
Negative,Not a whole lot of fun. No real sense of direction. Runescape is a better experience and it's free.
Negative,"I found it to be boring. MMOs are hard, you got to hook people with interesting game play right away."
Negative,"I waited for over 2 days for it too download and install all the updates , tryed to play twice and got to a point where the ai was one shotting me or using spells to lock me in place and drain my health . If  you think being killed and having to respawn over and over again is fun , than this is a great game . If you like games that make you want to throw stuff , than this is a great game . if like me you value your own sanity , and don't want to play games that make you angry , than this game is anything but a great game ."
Negative,Most terrible is the lore and the game twisting your balls your pay for ESO+ especially if you're a crafter because otherwise you need to go out of your way and gain a stockholm syndrome to enjoy it and be outpaced by paypigs
Negative,With summerset coming out I tried to get back into this game but.It really just isnt very fun. The entire game is just go here grab/do/kill this. No fun twists or mechanics. No non-combat related activities that are enjoyable. PvP loses it's charm when you realize what it is.If you're someone who makes a lot of characters this game might not be for you because it's fun the first time. The rest of the time its a chore that you do just to level up.
Negative,game becomes unplayable after patches on regular bases thats why i quit playing it. fogot about this tried to play it after a year away then got reminded why i quit the last time.
Negative,i have no idea how they made this game so bad
Negative,Such a grinde game. It gets really repetitive after a while and boring.
Negative,******* me hard in the bottom of the well for buying this beast. So goood i cant even get past the login screen. I love you dad   6/17/18
Negative,"There may or may not be a good game here. I can't tell, because the UI is so infuriating I uninstall it within 2 hour of installing it."
Negative,Good combat system for paraplegics and trained rats alike
Negative,"Elder Scrolls died in mid-Skryim, and remains dead. Without a subscription, there is effectively no crafting in this game. Crafting is a key part of Elder Scrolls for me. And I'm not paying a subscription for a video game.There is no positive strong enough to overcome all that."
Negative,Because I already had the game I don't get Morrowind with the base game meaning I have to fork over more money to play Morrowind. This game forces you to buy their ESO+ sceme by removing the large crafting bag and old DLCs from the base game and making it not worth it to buy anything seperatly so when your ESO+ expires you lose access to the DLC areas. Classic Bethesda.
Negative,Wtf. I have been religiously logging in every night after work to claim the daily login prizes and still some how I’m missing days. Luckily this month has nothing that great but it’s the second month this has happened. What a scam!
Negative,"Downloads are horribly massive for updates, for someone with slow internet this is such a nightmare to the point I can't give a positive review, haven't been able to play in over a week since the expansion hit with how poorly compressed it is."
Negative,Nothing to do when you make it to end game and most of the things you can do is locked behind pay wall
Negative,DO NOT BUY FROM HERE. bought it and every time it goes to launch zossteamstarter.exe error if u want it go buy it right from the eso website much easier
Negative,"The five hours I have ""played"" have been trying to get the fucking thing to run."
Negative,"If someone buys it for you, then the game is decent. However, for the price they're currently asking, it's definitely not worth it. There are bugs that can end entire lines of content and the grind on some content is very repetitive. That being said, its combat is simple and allows you to choose a wide variety of play styles (many of which are viable for most content since your character is scaled to the content as you level, not the other way around). Watch several videos of gameplay BEFORE considering buying this."
Negative,"Great game, however if you live in the oceanic there are no servers so expect 240+ ping... Which means pve is fine but pvp is pretty impossible unless you play a ranged spec. So a downvote from me only due to not being able to melee people in pvp due to having no oceanic servers."
Negative,"This game could be good, but for me it was plagued with customer support issues. I suppose if you have no isses requiring customer support then you will have fun, but once you need to contact these people expect a lot of frustration. Passwords are lost, reset, hacked or whatever. Your account becomes suddenly unusable. Customer support directs you to pages of inaccessible FAQs to answer your questions. It is a nightmare.The game itself is fun but ultimately becomes a lot of the same ol' same ol' over and over again. Grinding, grinding, grinding. The story isn't interesting, characters are boring, etc. I had no problem clicking on ""uninstall"" after the last round of bad customer service."
Negative,"At first I was impressed by the graphics, huge world, and story lines.  But then I realised, they keep repeating the same story: 1) listen to a tale about some villain of no consequence 2) go somewhere and hit three switches 3) kill said villain and forget 4) listen to a tale about the next villain.   The quests are mundane, unengaging, repetitive.  I ended up skipping the mostly pointless speeches like most players, because the ingame pointers will tell you what to do, and the speeches gave me nothing of any real consequence.  The game is pretty, though most of the scenery is wallpaper, you don't really interact much.  There is no reason to team up with anyone.  It could be a solo desktop game.  People say the game is about crafting stuff, but that you need a subscription just to get the bag to hold the materials you find.  Really?   Make real stuff in real life!Play the base game if you have the money and want to blow a bit of time occasionally looking at nice scenery and running around clicking on stuff that the game tells you to click."
Negative,"TLDR:Ain't Great and ain't horrible, its merely ""alright"".Has a lot of content but like on many many many cases, it throws a lots of bones and very scarcely some meat to keep you hooked.Yearly chapters every year gets worse and worse on value and quallity, the best parts of this game is behind the PAID DLC's and there is enough of it to break your bank account.ESO+ would be acceptable if it was cosmetics and some ""scrolls"" but ends being yearly ""content rent of €120+"" yearly and what is worse is the unlimmited material bag/cache BEING A PAID FEATURE, making who buys chapters and such stuck with a inventory that 20-30+ down the line is always full and you waste  A LOT OF TIME DISMANTELING, SELLING..... this is no exageration, it will be 1/3 of your gameplay time UNLESS YOU THROW THEM HARD EARNED MONEY MONTLY.........IF you just play very very very casualy and forget any notion of catch up to high level players, than it will be OK if you just buy main/chapter-main at the point of when you pick the game (as older chapters will be bundled).IF you want to invest serious time and get deeply involved within this game, than be ready to keep tossing money, monthly sub and crates, and all the dlc BS, because for making them insane ammounts of money IT JUST WORKS!This is a NO, but with a big IF, being that IF for a ""yes"" ONLY if you buy at discount and just playing now and than and not as a typical mmo-time sinking/obcession........ No forced sub, but not so hided constant reminder to get a sub to play........  *wink wink*"
Negative,"pay for convenience, pay for inventory, pay for anything that would remotely make this awful game with it's insanely underwhelming sense of progress (no difficulty)  and reward (unless you pay the greedy devs of course) , it's baffling horrendous gameplay and combat just a little bit enjoyable. This game is absolutely terrible and if you want to have a little bit of fun prepare to bust your wallet for qol improvements that you should get AFTER YOU BOUGHT THE GAME. disheartening to see such greedy practices employed with no shame whatsoever, fucking awful."
Negative,Devs are the most incompetent people in existence.
Negative,The pve combat is extremely boring and repetitive.  Not worth the $10 I got it for.
Negative,"If you are a person who likes to buy a game and own it rather than paying monthly subscription fees like World Of Warcraft, be aware that you will be severely handicapped in this game. I played about 1 hour, then uninstalled and asked for a refund once I realized how far behind I'll be if I do not pay a monthly fee. Elder Scrolls is a fantastic franchise and if I ever feel like committing myself to a monthly subscription, I might consider reinstalling.When I first took a look at this game, I assumed the difference between the Gold Edition and the ESO+ subscription was that the ESO+ subscription gave access to the DLC and some bonus crowns, while the Gold Edition gives all the DLC for a much higher upfront cost, but that otherwise they were the same. I was wrong. There are numerous other benefits of an ESO+ subscription which makes the higher upfront cost for the Gold Edition seem like a dirty trick, since any person who enjoys the game will feel compelled to get a subscription anyway. Giving the company money monthly gets you a special crafting materials storage, faster progression of skills and traits, and daily login rewards. All of this is fine, except that the full game has a very high upfront cost in addition to expecting a monthly fee. Is it worth it? Perhaps. But not for me right now. I wanted access to it all by paying the higher cost for the Gold Edition, and to have the freedom to play a bit here and there without being handicapped and without a subscription going to waste in my downtime."
Negative,WHERE THE HELL IS MY ACCESS COOOOOOODE???!!!
Negative,"Game is horrible if you are looking for pvp. Screen freezes, kicks, and lag expect better from such an old game. Don't buy the game find something else."
Negative,"DONT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAMSteams servers go down constantly and wont let you log in, which especially frustrating as I paid for this product. I love the game and its community, would absolutely recommend playing it, but if you buy from Steam you will be frustrated. I have played many mmos and have never seen servers go down as much, and it isnt due to Zenimax. Its all on Steam and its laughable that they MIGHT give you an in game $5 crate if the game goes down for a day or 2. Giving a positive review as the game is amazing but definitely dont buy here.Edit: Devs are terrible and have no idea how to balance. Literally nerf classes for no reason. Play for the story but if you care about end game PvP and hardcore PvE i would choose another game."
Negative,"A deeply flawed theme park RPG packed with predatory cash-grab mechanics, not even remotely worth it for a solo player. A long-time Elder Scrolls fan with a few friends may find some enjoyment in the cooperative aspects, though frequent instanced single-player only quests blunt the experience.Nevertheless, this is the only really viable WoW alternative right now. It's receiving regular content updates, the quests are voice acted -- though otherwise rote -- and the world is rich with lore for people already invested in the universe. Frankly, this game could not exist if the competitive landscape was not already so barren, but it does what it does well enough to make for an enjoyable adventure with a friend or two.Call this an extremely qualified recommendation for diehard fans only, and ONLY if you are interested in paying for ESO Plus, the monthly service that alleviates the ridiculous strictures placed on ""free"" accounts."
Negative,"servers are so shit, it barely works"
Negative,trash game. not worth the data used to download.
Negative,It wasn't for me but I respect it for what it is. Tutorial just felt a little tedious and the combat felt a little off to me. I'm not a huge fan of the character create in this game either.  Maybe you'll like it more than me idk.
Negative,Piece of shit game wont even install after it opens the game launcher... keeps sayning corrupt server or whatever and apparently its been a problem ever since the game came out years ago so gg
Negative,"800 hours on ps4, tanks are no longer a class in this game it's boring to see everyone as dps."
Negative,Elder scrolls in name only.
Negative,"SHIT DEVS THATS FUCKING BRAINDEAD 5k HOURS IN THIS SHIT GAME AND THEY DESTROY ANY SKILLFULL PLAY FUCK THIS GAME!!! 7,4k hours game still sucks"
Negative,"Fun MMO. Too bad you can no longer log on with Steam (North America server) shortly after Dragon Bones release. Their support doesn't really allow direct contact, so they believe their own BS that it is fixed, despite numerous forum posts to the contrary. I'll try again for the next few days, but then I'm gone. Too many other games I can spend my money on or play for free."
Negative,"Frankly, it's just a bland game that happens to have Elder Scrolls in the name. The story is . . . well, not great actually, but apparently better than other MMOs. But it doesn't matter, because there is little in compelling gameplay. The entire game is scaled to you and so easy there is no incentive to . . . well . . . do anything, really. It's the ultimate realization of what WOW started: it's so streamlined and easy-to-get-into that the game pretty much plays itself.Not for me."
Negative,"It has tried to stick to Elder Scrolls playstyle incorporating with the mmo to give the feeling of both worlds but lacks something from both genres in the process. The game itself is not bad but what makes it bad is the price model. You have to buy a game and then play it as a F2P with restrictions even after buying, otherwise you have to get subscription and then again buy the latest expansion. In present day of mmo where even Wow gives full access to the game with subscription except latest expansion, FFXIV is extending f2p to 60 levels, GW2 gives full access with one time purchase and SWTOR gives all expansions with a sub, I don't know how they can attract new players with their method. It looks like they're only banking on Elder Scrolls nerds to remain loyal to the game and cash grab as long as it lasts. So its only worth it for the Elder Scrolls fans but if you're trying to get into a new mmo then there are better options out there."
Negative,"The overworld is graphically stunning and the quests are amazing, but they've made the mobs so easy that you can faceroll everything to 50. Level scaling interferes with sense of progression. Playing a class optimally requires animation-cancelling rotations that look weird and I doubt ZOS ever intended this. Build variety is there and it's great but bringing anything off-meta into grouped content will get you kicked."
Negative,"I cant smith, its a bad version of a game play loop, and I don't feel like you can talk with the community. I didn't like this game and they shouldn't have made it and just focused on the next actual Elder Scrolls game. 3/10 Don't Recommend."
Negative,"If you're looking for more Elder Scrolls gameplay just go try a different playstyle in Skyrim or Oblivion, the gameplay feels clunky, slow and unfinished, in fact it feels nothing like an Elder Scrolls game besides the setting and character races. The quests are boring in comparison to other ES games (a lot of errand running and talking to people, rather than real objectives). Combat feels like an afterthought and is often unnecessary. Honestly, I would rather play the train wreck that is Fallout 76 than this."
Negative,This game will not launch. Do not buy it.
Negative,"Pay to win snatchel for materials, and bullshit quest limit."
Negative,"the devs for this game are the ""08"" Det Lions"
Negative,"Combat is freaking garbage. Ruins the game for me. Otherwise, not bad."
Negative,Takes way too much storage for how much content there is
Negative,"I missed the boat for when the game was fun I think. 1: Level scaling really made me feel like i was never getting any stronger1a: That also made it feel like the combat was super boring and repetitive2: ""Questing is why you should play the game but the rewards are useless shit"" ?????3:  It is arguably the most monitized game ive ever played4: ""Dont come into this game expecting it to be like skyrim"" ?????5: Its better with friends but theyll spend most of the time showing shit theyve bought to feel validated 5a: Thank you to that friend the bought the game for me"
Negative,"Decided to try it out, during this free week thing - shit is so broken i cant even login. And the EULA is longer than an old man's nutsack. Thanks for allowing me to sign away my organs i suppose? Absolute doge shit. I havent even paid to try this and i somehow want my money back. In fact, i demand you give -me- 20 dollars, for having wasted my download speed & time. Eat shit/10, wouldnt try again."
Negative,"have played this game from release on console, then moved to PC and still love playing, but my negative review is based on the casino that is crates, I'm ashamed to say how much have spent on them over the years and never been lucky enough to get anything great. It really should be illegal and ZOS  should be ashamed of them selves"
Negative,"just a couple moments why this online game looks cheap for me: 1. when u trying to hit things with your sword, arms etc u r finding that u r not really able to do so. I mean there is no sound, no sparks, nu dust from hitting things. Your weapon just coming through the textures. Plus the graphics looks lil bit better than oblivion, and still oblivion (of course looks more charming to me than that).I've had enough of that during first hour of gameplay."
Negative,"What a boooring, stupid game!!! 🤮  🤮  🤮"
Negative,Run back and forth simulator
Negative,with over 2200 hours this game has become so much more worse. Its more of a mobile game now. With so much micro-transactions. The Dlc is horrible and rushed and the main story sucks.
Negative,Just feels like a generic shitty mmo in the elder scrolls world to be honest
Negative,"Everything scales to your level, itemization is boring and unrewarding, basically all activity's comes down to collecting vanity items most of which comes from cash shop. Yeah super fun game."
Negative,"I cant in good conscience recommend any game so woefully uncompressed. Nobody has enough room for that, bruh."
Negative,"Honestly, I thought I'd like this game, got it to play with a friend. But I am extremely bored with it. It's not that active, and really boring."
Negative,"Would not say play this, the pve is dull after a few weeks, and the pvp is just a bunch of people cheesing the system with ball groups, the devs will ban you if you say anything in zonechat pvp that calls them out for allowing the garbage and making it worst, the devs also play pvp and cheat to win, so no this game is hot garbage would not advise playing, so much potential waisted on some trashcan nazi devs"
Negative,"looking for an elder scrolls game? dont buy this, gameplaywise its just a MMO and none of the lore even matters because its like it was made by someone who is going off of the story from a different series entirely. as an MMO its not that bad, but as an elder scrolls game, i would just buy morrowind or skyrim."
Negative,"So the elder scorlls online is one of the better mmo's, but there are still some things off about it. firstly you have the difficulty of the game. the game is way too easy for an mmo, once you got some gear you can venture to basically anywhere. As an example i had a level 25 tank that could tank dragons quite easily. WHich actually ruins the game if you're searching for a game that is at least a tad challenging. You can stand still and make lots of mistakes and it doesnt matter, since the foes dont deal any damage.The farming aspect is also sumn that's annoying. To become a master crafter it'll take a LONG time. waiting and waiting untill the hours of waiting are done per piece of equipment to research. it's rather annoying. Yes it can be faster, but youll have to spend money on it. so it's either a long time before you become a master crafter or your wallet will be empty. not only the crafting is annoying, also the farming of specific items with specific traits, etc. before you can finally get that piece hours will be gone, which is annoying af, again there's a solution called spending money to get clockwork city to be able to change that. there's also a lot of amazing stuff inside of the game. The storylines and areas are actually really good, it's just unfortunate that its 2 easy to complete the questlines. you'll face a so called boss and it cant deal amage. like wtf bethesda. lastly the crown shop is just really shitty. you can basically purchase anything that'd normally take a long time, the master crafter or pjijic order are 2 of them. which just ruins the game again. the prices are also really high which doesnt make any sense. a new area costs roughly 20/30 dollars. Buy all the areas and you'r wallet will be empty again. overall its a good game for people that like to play casually and follow storylines, but it's not worth it for the people that like a challenge, since the game doesnt have that (yes even the dungeons get easy at some point)"
Negative,the screen shots look better then the actual game.
Negative,like the elder scrolls 6 but not
Negative,that you think this game is look like Skyrim that you are wrong
Negative,Pathetic and boring. Soulless cashgrab with the same boring combat and chores like any other MMO.
Negative,This game is worse than my parents divorce
Negative,"Changes the Hit box, and adds MMO feel. But it loses some elements that made the original OPGs great."
Negative,"i spent two days downloading this only for it to not work. tried to run it on the same opening loading screen for 6 hours only for steam to flip me the bird and say i couldnt return it after that much 'playtime'. steam and the publisher both point fingers at each other anytime there's an issue. you buy this game, you're on your own if there's a problem."
Negative,"This game and its developers are terrible. I bought this weeks back and the game has never worked. It says, ""An error occured, please try again later."" Well here I am weeks later and it has still yet to get past the loading screen. Meanwhile, ESO support has given told me to check the forums despite the fact the forums say to contact support for their error. Then they troubleshoot the wrong error code. Then they tell me to open hundreds of ports to the internet in my firewall (not an option) Then they tell me to disable add-ons, which you can't with ESO Gold because it is all bundled. Then they tell me to run the game with administrator rights which didn't work either.  Did I mention that every time I write back saying their suggestions didn't work I get another email saying that they are sorry for my continued trouble and that I need to reply back if I am still have trouble.Bottom line, I want my money back. This company is just terrible."
Negative,"Compared to other MMOs its pretty good. But as a fan of Elder Scrolls content, it's pitiful and disappointing. I got this for like 5$ during a sale, and that's about how much it's worth. It is also over 100GB to download, and then when you finally get in game you have to install additional content of over 20GB and that's without DLCs. It throws way too much in your face at the beginning and it doesn't explain what a lot of it means or what its even used for. The gameplay is pretty bland, and uneventful. The skills and classes aren't very well done either. The game tries to keep you playing with all these rewards that you didn't even earn. I don't even want to go into the economy. I will admit the game is visually appealing. Usually in MMO's they cut back on graphical details because of the scale of content, but this one is pretty good. But like a lot of other games, the art department far surpasses all other aspects of the game. I guess the visuals are all you need to draw people in. MMOs are really hard to pull off well, and this one didn't meet the standards in my opinion. They should have spent the time and resources on future elder scroll games rather than an MMO. I don't recommend it."
Negative,"Alright, I haven't posted my review yet on Steam, but I did on their website after they banned me on the word of the clan I joined accidentally put an Aetherial Dust in that clan instead of my Guild and when I retrieved it from my the clan storage, having had permission, having been there for a good while, they caused a fuss, grabbed my IP from your in-game chats, threatened me with a blackout to my geological location, I make a joke because I lived in Big Bear, ""We get them all the time, it's whatever, only this time it'll have a traceable signature for proof"", but the proof was never needed because nobody bothered to care. I got banned after three years for putting my own material in a bank by accident because it was new to my Routine, then promptly withdrawing it to put it in my own and I get fucked by a company that bought a Competitor video game company and effed off that game too. I'm sorry, but Bethesda has some explaining to do, so do a lot of people, so do I even, God Knows I'm Not Squeaky Feckin' Clean, but that's for God, not man, I may kill again (I've got roughly 33.3mil confirmed kills and at least a quarter of those have been talked to and nearly all of those, chill closure, but you don't screw the future out of seeing Potential skyrocket or plummet on its' own and like Oculus, trying to claim the Metaverse's ""Meta"" Title, EM buying an entire Social Media and firing the Legacy Execs and likely half of the staff because they didn't follow some quota, who knows, the point is you're upsetting the Balance and if this is not reprimanded soon (Focus On The Legacies You Stole before allowing anything else to cloud your Soul's pathways), All Could Be Lost....   You Need To Fix What You Broke or you'll lose us, your players, to someone you least expected and I know who it is. You'll never succeed once this game launches, I can guarantee it and it's only a month away.... Please listen to me now that I have a reason to slightly care about your P2W Game, The Arcanist looks fine, but the description was pretty fun, so I'll try it, knowing your Abilities System and Combat Versatility Basics....   Seriously, I hope you consider my words, don't eff us all into Oblivion just because you lost after being warned it would happen if you didn't do this, this, and this to prevent it! You're literally being given A Salvational Kindness and you're spitting in it's direction, wake up friends!     Our Future Is Nigh, So Either Love What You're Making 100-feckin'-% or you'll be done. Either Get Behind An Open-Source Supported CEO or get left behind, it's that simple.

What Is An Investment But A Promise Between Friends? You Scratch My Back, I find a way to never have to ask again! X'D   I used to look up to you Elder Scrolls Saga Sage, Morrowind taught me to survive Oblivion and Oblivion taught me not to hate ending my fun with the Daedra while I transition to Skyrim and Skyrim made me fascinated enough to play ESO, and especially being given that adventure again in VR!? I nearly creamed! Fukeigen!! If you make ESO in VR, New Accounts, New Inventories, you'll be onto something and you'll make a little bit more, but only make it $42 flat For All DLCs and a Battlepass to get us started, this price is asking a lot, but you have enough wallet collision to offer us some leeway, so give, please. Discount from 42, not higher, maybe lower, but don't let Greed control your Fairness or it won't do nearly as well as you'd hope....       And if EM has a problem with this review, he can tell me instead of buying off whoever literally 'just' because he can.... Celebs make accounts on things all the time, just don't be obvious and you'll be fine, mostly. It's the internet, it's got who knows what or who behind which screen...."
Negative,"It would be a nice game. A MMORPG with story and voiced quests is very rare but a nice novelty. The combat system is similar to Guild Wars 2. Not great but not terrible.But this is a Bethesda game and everyone, who ever played a Bethesda game knows: ""Bethesda is Bethetic"".- Minimizing the game may crash it- Sometimes the game freezes the whole PC- Sometimes I have framerate drops under 1 fps for 30 seconds- The group finder doesn't work properly - Sometimes it takes half a second to activate skills (with <70 ping)- Sometimes it takes several button presses to activate skills- Sometimes the skill is activated but doesn't do anything- Animations break often- ectAll of these issues are known and old, but didnt got fixed in over 5 yearsBut hey the Ingame Store works, and sells stuff for ridiculous high prices, which would be fine if the game was working. But it doesn't. And it never will. Because its Bethesda. And Bethesda is Bethetic"
Negative,"As much as i love this game. i dont recommend, they arent as greedy but still greedy due to the fact they are pushing the morrowind DLC so hard (which i cant afford nor willing to spend 40$ for a freaking island, idc what new gear/class they added with it) that they are limiting players who dont own the DLC  on the holiday events...as of writing this tonight was the last night for the halloween event and was the only night i was able to play it.. but when i went to go do the quest which appeared on my quest list already it kept telling me i needed morrowind...Thats pretty messed, up u Wont let ALL PLAYERS ENJOY THE HOLIDAY EVENT WITHOUT THROWING MONEY AT U??!!?? Thats has to be the ugliest thing iv ever seen.. NO MMO EVER has made u PAY FOR SOMTHING to Enjoy a Holiday event (at least in my exp, and iv played TONS of mmos)...Great game! (if ur rich!)"
Negative,It has the worst UI I have saw in my life! You have to use 100 addons in order to have a normal UI
Negative,"I'm sure this game would be great, if I could actually play it. The download takes so long it doesn't even work."
Negative,"I love skyrim, been playing it since day one. I still play it, thanks to all the modders who continuely expand the world  with wonderful mods. I'm not big on mmos . This game was recommended by a colleague at work, who also  being an  elder scrolls fan, said it was great even in single player mode, which was the only reason I got it.Alas, I played for approx 2hrs.  so I'm stuck with a game I don't even play. I play all pc games with windows pc controllers (I came from consoles  abt 10 years back, never to return ) no plug and play  controller support unlike it's predecessor,  which  has been around since 2011.  That was the beginning, the quest lines for single player ( the only reason I purchased the game )  weren't as epic or had the sense of grandeur I'd expect in an Elder Scrolls game. So disappointment would be the operative word I'd chose to describe my  lofty and probably uneducated expectations.I should've researched thoroughly, like I normally do before I purchased. I definitely know better. I feel like such a noob to get caught out there like that. I heard  Elder Scrolls, colleague skyrim fan recommendation and  attempted to execute a reverse dive; 3 1/2 somersaults, in a empty pool. I blame no one, but myself. I have friends who enjoy the whole mmo experience, and really enjoy this game from that stand point. I'd sell  them the game, if they didn't have it already,so there's that. I'm waiting for skyrim special edition to drop, listen to the feedback and maybe give it another playthrough. Hey it's free, nothing to lose there. So like if anyone doesn't know by now that this game is mainly about online play, not really created for the epic quest driven storyline, single player in mind, this review is for you.Lesson learned."
Negative,"Terrible.Played 5 hours with a friend trying to give it a chance but its just fetch quest after fetch quest after fetch quest. Run here for this person and do this thing now back to them to do the same thing somewhere else. Higher level players camp resource spawns and the variation in armor design is pitiful. I saw all of the postivie reviews and thought the game turned around after it's initial release.It didn't. 0/10 Can't refund this dumpster fire of a game. Thanks, valve."
Negative,Poorly designed and full of bugs. NO ANY support from developers!
Negative,"Unfortunately, I can not recommend this game on Steam with clear conscience. Log in issues and other network bugs WILL ruin your experience.Doubly painful once you are fully invested and spent countless hours in it. Their network/infrastructure/programming or whatever is resposible for lost weekends and ruined people's time is disgusting. And these issues have been going on for what now, 6 months? A year? Remember: this is not the same team that made other Bethesda games. And do not buy this game on Steam, because you will have log in issues/delays/treated like a second class citizen."
Negative,This game would be good except there's no sense of progression and enemies scale with you. This was a terrible idea for an mmo and makes the game grindy and boring. Which is a shame because a lot of care and love went into the presentation and quests.
Negative,"Mate you cant be serious, yeah bruv first of all why is it cheaper to buy the base game with the morrowind chapter than to buy the morrowind chapter on its own. Like bruv you're literally cucking me"
Negative,"I really really wanted to love this game but I just ended up dissapointed. The quest's feel increadibly shallow, I dont care about any of the characters, and the combat system just feels kinda lacking.  Im pretty bummed."
Negative,This is stupid game i can't log into my account..
Negative,"The game is unplayable for me, after 3 minutes of playing my wifi completely disconnects, which means that I can't even create a character. The worst part is I can't return the game."
Negative,Getting worse from Update to Update...
Negative,"It's too dated for me, I played a lot back in 2014 on xbox and nothing has changed. If they updated the mechanics maybe I'd play again. It's not even crossplay and even though you can attach your xbox account to the ESO website it doesn't do anything, your characters nor crowns transfer from one platform to the next, waste of money."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  apparently you cannot play this game on a laptop after the middle of january.  they made some change that screwed up mobile gpu's with the game, and rather than fix that, they just said they don't ""meet system requirements.""  the forums are filled with unanswered people desperately trying to play the game after putting countless hours into their characters.  the best responses i've seen from anyone are forum regulars (not devs or anyone who can actually help) just saying the issue is being looked into.  i just spent 30 bucks and was really excited to play ESO, but it crashes at startup (just like it has been for everyone else).  this is a laptop but it costs about 5k and less than 2yrs old.  this is just a big symbol of how the game was run from the beginning.  the fact that they had the greatest concept (what could be better than an elder scrolls game online?) and still launched such a failure of a game should be enough to tell us not to buy it.  i tried anyway and regret it more than any game i've ever purchased.  the people who put this shit together don't deserve a penny.  if you're like me, ESO could have been the greatest thing to ever launch.  what a waste  EDIT:  they really give you the run-around when trying to complain and let others know what a bunch of thieves the company is.  you can log in no problem to buy the game, dlc's, or microtransactions.  but try to get on the forums or do anything else with your account, and pages are either ""down"" or your username ""does not exist.""  keep in mind i've already used this account in every way imaginable.  it straight up just does not let you use your account in ways that they don't want.  dirtiest thing i've ever seen from the gaming world"
Negative,"why would i have to pay for download but then have to pay to play, its 60$ for download, i mean this made me so drunk with anger that i punched a hole in my wall. i mean i know it cant be changed now but seriously how much money do u guys need...."
Negative,"Where to begin...First bought this game when it came out circa 2014 – ran very occasionally before crashing on the hour every hour. Game play was just dull, group play would have party members vanishing or phasing out of existence. Go into town or city with more than 20 people in it and the servers would slow to a crawl then implode. Demanded a refund after 2 days of this.Now in 2017 – was persuaded by friends to give it another go. “Come back” they said “it’s much better now”.Have now downloaded and installed the game 3 full times. Refuses to run properly when launched from Steam (it just repeats an install cycle and nothing happens).Managed to get the game to finally load to the login screen to be told that my client version (on a freshly installed and fully patched) game is – out of date. Steam file verification process is useless, no way to perform a repair install as with just about any other game I’ve played other than to download the full game each time after the Steam “verification” process.5+ hours of website browsing to try and find a solution – lots of forum hints and tips tired nothing works, files tweaked, drivers updated, setting changed etc. Still won’t run properly, still can’t log in even on the rare occasion I manage to get to the game login screen.This was a buggy piece of trash when it came out and it’s a buggy piece of trash now. Save your money for a better quality game that doesn’t require hours of forum trawling to try and get it to work."
Negative,Started playing the game. Got real into it with some friends. Find out I can't do Battlegrounds with a group. Instantly lost interest.
Negative,The Titanic was more balanced than this game
Negative,How many times are you going to take both the EU and NA servers down at the same time not letting anyone play?Tell us.
Negative,"This game is only worth playing if you have premium subscription (11€/month) otherwise DO NOT BUY IT. I myself bought the full collection package (80€) and it's still missing half the DLC's needed to play endgame content, and the premium subscription (only while active) gives you access to an infinite material bag, which is A MUST HAVE unless you want to have extreme inventory capacity problems since about level 8 till forever. If I had known all this, I would NEVER EVER have bought it. Let my ignorance be a lesson to any potential future buyers."
Negative,"Seemingly I can't find a way to cancel the monthly charge. I have to go the steam client (I think, it's never stated anywhere that I can find) Just going to the games Web site it doesn't recignize my username or password. So I'm just calling the bank to today to make sure they dont' accept anymore charges from this company. The game is pretty mediocre. Play the free version if you're bored."
Negative,"****It's good, but it's not quite Carling!****I really REALLY want to rate this review with a 'thumbs up' but I am finding it hard, I am a huge elder scroll fan!I can't lose myself in this game and that's what I am finding really hard! I can't explain, there is just something missing, it's like bread without butter...I will give it a break for now and try again in a few days, hopefully it will change my review on this game, we will see..."
Negative,"My experiance with this game, while only showing maybe 5 minutes of game play, was a roughly 3 day ordeal of trying to figure out what went wrong. I downloaded this game because it looked like all the issues I had heard that the game play and mechanical issues were fixed so I wanted to give it a shot. Now, before I continue, I want to stess that, fromwhat I understand, only the STEAM version causes the issues i'm about to address, not the version from their website. Also, there's supposed to be a way to link the accounts but I couldnt find any support from their end on that so I don't know how that works.After spending what seemed to be a little over 24 hours downloading the game, I was greeted by a quick load up screen followed by its immediate crash. I had seen that there were some fixes that worked for people, like running as admin or deleting the Visual C++ 2010x64/x84 programs, which didnt work. I then figured out that this version apparently doesn't come with a launcher folder/application. A friend of mine was gratious enough to send me a copy of his launch folder. After recieveing that, I was treated to another 24 hrs of loading via patches. After that had been completed, approxamitly 4 hours before my posting of this review, the actual game, which I had to go into the files to find because the Steam provided short cut continued to give the same crashing load bar result, told me to launch it from the main steam client.Now at this point I have asked for a refund, and maybe sometime in the next few weeks I'll considder purchasing this game from the official website and changing my review here, so I want to make it known that I don't know about the gameplay and that there are great small content creators on YouTube who go in depth on the game and its workings.TL;DR : Steam version is way to much work, so consider buying it from the official site."
Negative,My game is showing that i have been playing for 20 hours .. which is a lie .. i haven't ever successfully lauched the game due to updates and repairs and validation ... but it has taken 20 hours so far .. with a 1Gbps internet connection :(
Negative,"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T BUY THIS GAME FROM STEAM!!! BUY FROM BETHESDA WEBSITE, LOGIN SERVERS ARE FUCKED UP THROUGH STEAM"
Negative,Pay MICK GORDON what you owe him and apologize you bunch of SCAMPS
Negative,"Over priced, appalling controls, dull quests, avg graphics and horrible movement."
Negative,"If your looking for Elder Scrolls IV/V-esqe gameplay and questing you'll be sorely dissapointed. Graphics are dated, animations are poorly done, and the quests lack engagement and feeling. While soloing is often extolled as an option, it gets old fast. If you have no interest in PvP and/or an aversion to paywalls, don't buy this game."
Negative,"After trying the latest beta and two previous betas. I am still unimpressed with ESO. The graphics are lackluster, the crafting is a waste of time. The one positive is the world is big enough to explore without loosing interest in a week.Thanks for the beta but no thanks."
Negative,i tried the game after beta testing it and thought i would be able to get it on sale for 67% off afterwards and its still regulau price. Big disapointment. I won't buy this game for full price. It's better but not at full price.
Negative,"I'm so disapointed with this game. I thought this would be amazing because of its very successful predecessors. But no, it's not. If you want to play an MMO with good story but horrible combat, then buy this. From when you start the game to however far I made it (not very far). The combat will be the exact same. Basically just swing your sword or axe until either the enemy dies, or you die. It's just so d**n boring to fight anything. Because it's the same thing over and over. Want some good loot? Best pray to the almighty RNGesus and hope that you don't get crap. I've been forced to use a level 6 dagger when I was level 12, because everything that I'd get my level, blew. Want to know the difference between an Iron Sword that's level 12 and an Iron Sword that's level 40? 200 damage. That may sound like alot, but in the beginning you get around 10k health. Yea. PVP? HA, I've watched level 20's absolutely demolish level 200's. Yea that's a cool aspect but I feel like that shouldn't be possible. I'll just stick to the original Morrowind and Skyrim."
Negative,"Played a ton. Problem is that the game is incredibly static. Each zone happens in isolation, after the 15th time 'saving the day' yet people developing amnesia in every other zone get old.Combat is floaty. there is almost no real substance to attacking things. It is so bad that what was once a bug of spamming light attack to clip into ability cooldowns is now expected. Tons of ability and damage bloat. The devs are so bad they have given up on producing challenging content and instead use the crutch of 'but you are only here for story, right?'."
Negative,"They told us you can play ESO solo...They didn't tell us combat is the dumb MMO zap zap style. When there is no need to aim and you have endless arrows, then ESO bow it just a weak stupid magic staff. If you find MMO style combat fun, go for it.But if you seek bow/sniper experience - ESO will just disappoint you."
Negative,"All of the hours that have been recorded as gameplay haven't actually been spent playing the game. I can't get a refund because the download time of about 2 hours was recorded as play time and steam policy says I can't get a refund because of that. So far I've only seen the launcher and heard some slightly cinematic music. Still haven't played the actual game as all the recorded time has been spent downloading, re-downloading and verifying files. ESO support is trash and they had the nerve to suggest I uninstall steam to try to get the game to work as if they can't really offer me a solution. Waste of my thirty bucks if I can't actually play the game or even get decent and timely customer service."
Negative,"Played this game since beta, but has gotten to the point that I have basically quit the game. Bugs that have been in the game still aren't fixed and every new patch they introduce more bugs some that are game breaking. They have a test server that they ask for feedback before each patch but they seem to ignore player feedback to the point that alot of people have stopped reporting bugs since they know they won't be fixed.The PVP is suppose to be a major part of the game but has basically been ignored for most the game history. Every patch  the performance in pvp gets worse to the point it is almost unplayable. The snares in pvp you are suppose to be able to break free up but lots of time between lag and abilities being broken you are stuck even with full stamina.They tend to focus more on the crown store then fixing bugs or improving the game. Before you had to actually complete quests and zones to get skills  but now you just buy them for real money instead of earning them. The game does have good graphics if you are actually able to  play through the lag and crashes.Right now I cannot recommend this game, the game has promise but only if they would actually fix the game instead of letting the bugs getting worse each patch."
Negative,"This used to be a great game with beautiful graphics and a great story.  I started playing just after launch, back when it was still subscription based, and it was worth every penny.  I've left and come back a few times to check out expansions and really enjoyed it.  The last time re-installed and tried to play I noticed that leveling was completely nerfed!  The game has become WAY TOO EASY.  The thrill of exploration is gone, replaced with boring mindless rolling over mobs with no effort at all.  After just an hour or two, I logged off and haven't been back. It's such a shame, this WAS one of my favorite MMO's."
Negative,Can't get past the error code on the login page to even play... what a waste of my money.
Negative,too many dlcs
Negative,Money money money money :) hot garbage :)
Negative,just dont get it. wait for elder scrolls 6
Negative,"Shallow story and very grindy gameplay. MMO through and through. Be prepared to fork over lots of cash, unless you want the stripped down bare minimum experience.Cash shop is getting increasingly aggressive and expensive, for a premium game such as this.Have to buy expansions/chapters too on top of subscribtion."
Negative,"Pay to play + premium (almost unplayable without) + Lot of DLC's (lock content / some buffs / companion etc) . Game is focused on PVE solo dungeons (for story and DLC) and lot of old school quests for potato brains . Crafting is ridiculous and almost miss , enchanting system is decent and most stupid is dungeon drop system ... RECOMMEND ONLY FOR ROLE PLAYERS ."
Negative,"Game was good, but the devs decided to not care anymore, ignoring all player feedback and introducing huge changes to combat that NOBODY asked for.If you value your time don't even bother.If you like grinding new gear for days every month, only for it to be useless the next then this is for you.Also, game is literally close to unplayable without the subscription, No, It's not optional. Having the subscription is mandatory, if you want to get into crafting or anything really, you're locked out of so much content. You'll be playing ES inventory management simulator for hours without it."
Negative,"This will look weird posting a negative review with 694h in the game but hear me out. The game is actually pretty cool - otherwise I wouldn't have played this long - but the problem is bethesda. Every update they break something and this time it was for me. I'm completely unable to play the game now since the deadlands update - just crashes to desktop after 5 sec. Went to their tech support and opened a ticket just to be rolled around by a bunch of ""Brians"" and ""Jasons"" that would not even listen to my report just offering solutions like ""have your tried updating windows etc.."". I'm a programmer so I'm not exactly a tech illiterate grandma and this just pisses me off. Eventually my ticket was escalated to a ""more specialized team"" and it was just the same crap but this time just lying and saying that my setup was below minimum specs which it isn't (since i can go to their website and read the specs there). But the implication was that i was on my own and it was all my fault and not the update even though literally the day before i was playing the game just fine.I understand that things can break in updates but the behavior of their customer service that is just focused in brushing you off and ignoring the glaring problem instead of just acknowledging the issue and working on fixing it - hell it could be next update I would have waited - is unacceptable .Anyway so you know that if you decide to sink your time and money into this game they could at any moment just decide to break the game for you and you'll get zero help! I'm now just going to uninstall this game and keep posting this everywhere i can bethesda because I'm pissed and this is not over."
Negative,Most unintresting mmorpg I have played is ages
Negative,Tried to like it many times. Very boring combat.
Negative,"I have played this game long enough and finished most of the endgame content so i think i have pretty good idea what the hell am i typing about here so before buying this game or any expension of this game read this first. This is gonna be an extremely honest review and i will not show mercy to this game even tho i played it a lot.First of ""Content"" and ""is it p2w ?""  Let me be really clear ESO world is huge BUT it is fucking empty. There are some fun zones with ""ok"" story but most of the zones you just pay for exclusive sets and trials and dungeons etc. Strong sets come with chapters and dungeon DLC's and that is the truth. That doesn't mean you cannot have a spot in endgame groups or guilds without paying but you won't be flexible and you won't have a lot of options in raids or dungeons. With ESO plus monthly subscribtion you get to play every DLC and chapter except the earliest released chapter but i think the biggest impact ESO plus has on your game is Craft Bag. Crafting materials are really important in this game, all of them has some kind of use and it is always good to have large stacks of them. Craft bag gives you endless bagspace for your crafting materials so it is really important to have for faster progression. But that's it. These are only stuff it is actually worth paying for and effects your gameplay.Second part ""gameplay""  OK, so you played the game for a while. You made it to 160cp you gathered your gear and now you are here for real big dick action. Guess what, this game doesn't work like other mmo's where you have cooldowns on your skills and you normal attack in between skills or whatever. There is no cooldown in this game. Only ultimate abilities have cooldowns everything else you can spam the shit out of and even tho it sounds ridiculus it works. Combat in this game have a little bit of a learning curve, i can give you best gear in the game but if you have no idea about your class or rotation you simply will be useless and i think that's ok. BUT the problem is and the main reason why my rating for this game is ""DON'T BUY THIS FUCKING GAME"" is performance and how devs doesn't give a FUCK about it. Everything i said about combat ? forget it because game won't even work %90 of the time. That really cool spammable skill of yours ? Won't fire because server cannot handle 12 people trying to kill a FUCKING RAID BOSS !!!! If you don't get random disconnects in raids dude you are fucking lucky. And what about PvP ? PvP is fucking UNPLAYABLE. The lag in PvP is nothing you have seen in your life, it is out of this world. Like devs who built this game are either braindead people who has ZERO knowledge about game development or they are just scamming people at this point because i fucking SWEAR this FUCKING GAME DOES NOT FUCNTION AT ALL. No i won't say nice things about ESO anymore like i did before because this is going out of fucking hand. The more i support the dev team more they are scamming people releaseing new DLC's and chapters into a game that DOES NOT WORK.THERE. Don't fucking buy this shit, don't support the devs because they don't deserve any of it."
Negative,Wouldn't recommend it.
Negative,"Cool concept, terrible execution!"
Negative,"It gets boring really fast, just play the elder scrolls games (Not ESO) that have more character in the game than this cash grab game."
Negative,"Great game, very well done and polished.But I stopped playing because there's no real feeling of progression - as you level you don't really feel like you get stronger, and it all feels like treading waters quickly.There's no like super weapon or super set, so no matter if you play with a lvl 10 or a lvl 1000 in a dungeon does not feel that much different. Maybe good for some, but not for me. Even at high levels you can't kill start-zone mobs with a oneshot."
Negative,"terrible game performance , could be nice game to get into , server laggs are just too much , and its getting worse with every patch . for new scalebreaker dots meta , no idea which pvp player ever wanted this , its horrible balance right now ,  canceling my ESO plus. fix your game"
Negative,"Do not buy this game from steam. Just don't do it.The only issues it has are the inability for steam users to login constantly, if you really want to play this then buy it directly because the likelihood of the steam connection issue being fixed any time soon is precisely 0 given that it's been going on for weeks now."
Negative,"i cant even play the game, when i try to login the launcher crashes and i cant find a fix to it"
Negative,Game doesn't even launch anymore for me but it doesn't matter when you pay for a game and then have to pay for even minimal inventory space and they won't refund.
Negative,I enjoyed the game for however long i could then i got a game breaking bug and i can no longer play it. I geuss i'm involuntarily ejected from the game
Negative,"Combat feels like a mobile game, but a mobile game's combat is more engaging than ESO's. Such a boring game."
Negative,"modded skyrim crashes less, but hey 4 years after the fact the developer commented on this post get some clout."
Negative,"!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!We are currently experiencing our third unplanned service outage in the last 10 days. The developer seems to have no way of fixing this issue, with no communication on the cause, or compensation for those affected.Apart from issues with the steam version, The game is pretty good, although held back by aggressive monetization (you have to buy a sub to fully experience the game). Make sure you get your money's worth by not buying the steam version so you can enjoy the benefits of your purchases 100% of the time!"
Negative,"Tl;dr It doesn't work with steam.Wot I liked- Vvardenfell. My favourite place in all world. Seeing cantons, ashlands, the great houses (didn't get past Seyda Neen though). That was a pleasure trip down the memory lane.Wot I disliked- Steam Version sucks. ""U cannot log in one account, you have to use another account to log in"", Jeez...- Works like crap, you have to do 10-15 clicks to launch the game;- Why do I have to look at their breaindead laucher every time I start the game? They wanna cram some more ads down my throat? - The chicanery with accounts. There's an ESo account, a forum account, the steam account, bethesda.net account I don't want to sound spoiled but registering approximately one million times with different passwords and e-mails ain't fun. I cannot log in to one of my ESO accounts to tell them about the problem with their game.I might give it a shot outside steam to jump through a couple hoops less every time i want to play the game."
Negative,"Steam and ESO have some serious issues when it comes to account integration. I tried to connect my existing account, but ended up being forced to create a new one, after many repeated ""Cannot connect to server messages"" - attempts made over several days."
Negative,"I don't recomend this game for afew reasons. One being it loads A LOT and for no reason."" walking in a town"" LOADING, ""Fighting stuff"", Loading. It also has a very dull one walkway overworld that is just very plain and boring."
Negative,"PvE part: - many maps with nice designs (including quite a few areas with a whouah factor but oddly you may experience them only once during specific quests...)/a lot to explore/large lore (but too large to go in depth) so a lot to do ptotentially although maybe too much and could be confusing or overwhelming for some,, - quests becoming repetitive with limited and/or not so engaging stories (oddly some side quests from older maps are longer/more demanding than the main questlines of recent zone maps),- nice background music in general with an ok sound ambiance,- combat system not great with cosmetic moves and the odd need to try to master the light attack weaving and heavy attack animation cancelling techniques (which are officially recommended not to say needed) to bypass the built-in limitations and be effective (and there are free MMO games with much more fluid and smoother experience of combat skills rotations...) - farming/grinding even for cosmetic things is not mandatory but you will be implicitely driven slowly and surely towards doing it like most/everyone else,- guilds and more globally in-game community are generally helpful and well-mannered (less in pvp as one would expect but thats likely similar in other MMO), your experience, good or bad, in dungeons (team of 4) and trials (teams of 12) will strongly depend on the collaboration among players and at veteran or even hard mode level team communication through external system such as Discord is paramount  (pity there is nothing in-game that could fulfill that function beyind the limited group or zone chat typing) and with the caveat that deluge of visual effects and the need to follow very specific mechanics are limiting severely the enjoyement of these end game level features,- following up on this: it is a pity that too many new or existing players feel driven to follow a few builds strongly advertised on the web so that they can feel they would stand better through the game despite the large and impressive diversity of equipment sets and combination possible, and, looking back at the update over the recent moths/years, it seems that  on the development side they are a bit overwhelmed too by the management of their own system (despite each time, mentionning that they ""satisfied themselves"" with the latest changes in each update....)- trading system seems to operate in a stable manner but to get the most of it you will have to rely on info on the webso external to the game (e.g. Tamriel trade centre) or add-ons,- noticeable effort to try to bring in some new features regularly/every year but some systematic downside appearing after e.g. antiquities system and overpowered items that most try to farm at each update just for these to get nerfed at the subsequent updates; companions (=recently introduced character near you which are a bit more effective than the cosmetic and graphics-power-consumming non-combat pets...) which are still now a pain to level up; a recent card game (the only pvp option without lag ?! ) which oddly appears to be a dwarf version of TES: Legends a free card game without development/improvement in several years...,- difficult to avoid the ESO+ subscription if you want to experience most/all aspects such as crafting and DLCs maps & dungeons. PvP part: Described by the players themselves on a daily basis as ""unplayable"" (that would be the polite version of what you can read in zone chat...) due to lag, desync, bugs, etc and all getting worse and worse (no or negligible fix attempted so far, without improvment) + quite some exploiting going on (and the changes at each update seems to keep the exploiters and their macros on their toes...)UPDATE December 2022:According to https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/63363, it seems that they start putting themselves a little into questions.... Will it be effective and sufficient remains to be seen but it is nonetheless necessary as the Elder Scrolls series is resting on ESO survival while an eventual TES VI remains so elusive....."
Negative,I can't complete the a 4th level quest.  No information online and no details in the game.  so confusing.
Negative,its quite boring
Negative,this game fricking sucks
Negative,be prepared for endless meaningless crashes with no fix
Negative,"did not like combat like at all.no challenge to level up, just rushing through.made me reinstall skyrim for the xth time."
Negative,ive spent four hours on the launcher trying to get it to play the game i paided for
Negative,"I love Skyrim, and have played through several times. I thought this would be easy to love, but it just isn't good. Really poorly executed. Plenty of better MMOs out there, and if you want to play Skyrim, just play Skyrim again."
Negative,"I feel like I wasted my money on this title, truly disappointing how the scaling works in this game and there is no sense of progression, regardless how much you play. I have played SWTOR before and I really liked it, and I wanted to like this one too, I really did. I spent hours trying to learn mechanics and exploring just to finally realize its not for me and oh frick I played more than 2 hours, can't really refund now. If you like difficulty in combat like me this game isnt for you. I bought this game because one of my friends requested and then he played less than me and refunded lmao. Play swtor, free and better."
Negative,"I'm pissed about this crappy game! I have been trying for hours to log into my account to cancel my ESO Plus membership because it's been charging me each month WITHOUT APPROVAL since I started. This would be easy to solve except I have been locked out of the account that regulates the charges. When I change my password, it still doesn't work. I was only going to pause the ESO but now I want this frickin' game off my damn computer permanently!As for the game, whatever it's an MMO..."
Negative,"I didn't receive this product for free, I played it during the free weekend event.My previous experience with this game comes from the open beta, so I felt interested in seeing how the game had changed since I last touched it. In addition I wanted to get some more Elder Scrolls experience since I've temporarily put Skyrim on hold while waiting for SKSE64.That said, my conclusion from playing the beta was that The Elder Scrolls Online was an uninspiring bland MMO.Has that really changed? No. That's all you really need to know, but I'll try to elaborate regardless. CombatMagic lacks impact and feels unexciting. There's nothing visually interesting whatsoever about the magic you cast, same can be said about the sound effects. I played as an Altmer sorcerer and couldn't take it any more once I got to level 5. It was dreadfully boring, achingly so.If you like being magic users in MMOs, I recommend looking at other games like FFXIV or WoW instead.So I switched it up to a Bosmer nightblade (rogue/assassin).To the game's credit I had more fun as a nightblade than sorcerer, but that doesn't really say much.Melee combat feels more exciting than magic, where your attacks have better visual & sound effects such as the attack Assassin's Blade.Unfortunaly combat as a whole suffers from one common problem.Inflated numbers & lack of impact.Your first piece of armor piece? 1450 something armor. Your first weapon? 1000 something damage.These numbers start so high that every number I see becomes completely meaningless to me. 1200 damage? Whatever, I know it's not actually much. Dagger with 1200 damage & 1200 poison damage? Whatever. I can understand a game where you end up with ridiculous numbers as you get to end game content, but right away? Nuh-uh.Overall experience tells me what cloth-wearing magic users rarely get interesting looking gear, most of the time you just get some pyjamas and call it a day. So my expectations for magic users gear was low, but good lord nothing could prepare me for leather-users.Every armour piece I obtained as nightblade was just an awful brown coloured Frankenstein of a leather armor, the most interesting part of the armours was the stitches. I got my hopes up when I obtain some chest armor that had Queen something in it, but it was just another brown Frankenstein leather chest armor.Really makes me understand why ESO have costumes in the first place, which can be purchased for real mon- I mean the in-game premium currency Crowns. I got 500 Crowns for free from hitting level 10 or something I guess, which is enough to get one costume that can help improve the monotony.QuestsThe main story does what I really dislike in games. Involve you with the game's important character right off the bat. I can understand it in Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim. There's a reason for why you get involved there. But in ESO? You just some strange-ass fool who popped out of nowhere-ville and could be anyone with a bad agendaWriting is so-so, but you can tell that they're assuming that nobody reads the quests judging by the ever present Quest-Hints. I read some in the start, but more and more frequently I just skipped everything & just viewed the quest-hint or map marker.CraftingIt's okay, I guess. Nothing amazing though, lots of other games that do it better. Like... Skyrim.Also since crafting requires ingredients, you naturally feel inclined to loot... And then it happens. Full inventory. Oh boy. ""But just  craft stuff then!"" But you need recipes for that. So there's no point in looting ingredients when you don't have recipes that require them, and the recipes don't drop that often.It's at moments like that you can really feel that the game wants you spend real money for inventory crafting space.It is a real drag.At the end I really couldn't imagine myself playing this for any more than the weekend. I understand that in MMOs the real ""fun"" is in the end-game content, but when you get too bored to even get that far, what's even the point...I'd rate it... 5/10, maybe 6/10."
Negative,"No endgame loop.No endgame goal apart from farming motifs to craft cosmetics (house or character).Main selling points are questing and story telling, both are completely destroyed by One Tamriel.Every single quest is a cake walk where you spend 10 hours getting hyped up about facng an epic vampire lord, ultimate vilain, dragon or w/e. You just end up 2 shotting them while they are halfway through their fight introduction sentence. I'm not exagerating, it's kindergarten difficulty level.Story telling is in shamble as you can do every quest in any order, with expansion NPC actively asking you to complete their quests. You end up with  twice the same NPC model in the same room offering you 2 different quests from different timeline, or with a companion that you have to save from an evil prison standing next to you the next area offering you a side quest.Character customisation while vast in the cosmetic side (assuming you're into cash shop/lootboxes) is severly lacking. Every class and race only marginally influence your gameplay and what will define you is what weapon(s) you use."
Negative,"Loved the game until you guys brought heavy damage proc sets and mythic items. they pretty much ruined the game... and when y'all took out weaving lol. i have friends who were new to the game and said the under 50 pvp is some of the most fun they've had in mmo pvP ever , and they were pretty big into WoW. that being said in our opinion your pvE proc sets and mythic items have ruined the experience for us and apparently many of your pvP players.a lot of you-tubers are saying can agree with us aswell.ESO was my favourite game to hop into but unfortunately I can barely look at the title anymore. I hope you guys listen to your pvP community a bit more and this changes so myself and many more players want to come back to ESO.To finish off my rant i recomend this game to pvE players not pvP. Even though the pvP cpould be the best in any mmo."
Negative,"this is not a games it is an information harvester!!!!!!!!!  this is what it says ( ""Profiles and Inferences: inferences drawn from any of the information identified above to create a profile reflecting a resident’s preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes."")  it gets worse but i dont want to make this to long. this is shocking!!!!!I DO NOT WANT THIS! ON MY PC!!!!.. I THINK IS QUITE APPALLING THIS IS ON STEAM.... SPYWARE WITH A FANSY LITTLE GAME IN IT!!!!are you going to pay me for my Private information Bethesda????? no your not instead your going to get me to pay you!!!!!NOT A CHANCE YOU MONEY HUNGRY PIGS!!!!!refunded within an hour tho.. thanks steam :)"
Negative,"Constant log in issues and constant disconnects. It seems like a fun game, but if you can never log in and never stay connected that sums this game up.  Thumbs down!!!"
Negative,Have spent at least 8 hours trying to make the damn broken game work. Currently awaiting support to talk to me about my error 301 when trying to log in. Seen no gameplay despite my 41.1 hours logged on the game.
Negative,"While the world is vast to explore, it is lackluster in excitement. You may find a sidequest to add to your journal, maybe you will celebrate this in terms of lore, but unless you are majorly invested in ESO's lore, you will consider it to be boring. The combat, and I realize that low level combat is always fairly easy, but here, it is completely unworthy to be called challenging. Whereas Guild Wars 2 or Black Desert require dodging, I have yet to meet an enemy whose attacks cannot be avoided by stepping aside, or who even manages to reach me before getting killed. The crafting system is fairly innovative, but by no means could it become a driving motivation to be part of the game as economy, at least not from my point of view.Maybe I haven't given it enough time, but waiting for the endgame to not be completely bored out of your mind is simply exhausting."
Negative,"Very dissapointing, going from playing endless hours of gameplay in skyrim and oblivion over so many years i couldnt wait to play this however just dissapointing, seems like its just a money hungry developer making a game where it feels like it couldve been really good with the main component being playing with other poeple however not nearly as fun as other elder scrolls game, they have taken so many fun elements away and you constantly have to spend more and more money in order to well ""kind of enjoy it"" not going to play it again.great example of a new game with new concepts but neglecting what acctually made elder scrolls really enjoyable."
Negative,I hated this game when it released for its terrible combat system its ridiculous crafting system which what seems like it has 100 ingredients for each profession which is just outrageous. And after all this time absolutely nothing has changed the crafting system is still trash and looks like a child thought it up. The story line was alright if you like the Elder scrolls universe but if your expecting anything remotely like skyrim or oblivion that's not what your getting. I give this game a -5 stars out of 10. They should really shut down these servers and make a good game although that seems harder and harder to do these days. One of the worst games I've ever played. Your better off playing everquest 2 or arcehage at least those games didn't rely on the name of the producing business but their own also they are free so you don't have to pay for anything and you won't feel the echoing dissappointment that resounds from this game.
Negative,"Might be a great game if i could actually get past the ""Requesting Login"" screen. I've tried literally everything from repairing it, re installing it and running as admin and nothing works. Support is no help either. I've played it on console and i think its great but if i cant even log in and play i cant give it a positive review, especially when support doesn't want to help.Edit: If it actually worked i would cancel my WoW sub and pay for the sub for this, but until there is a fix WoW will continue to be my MMO fix and get my money."
Negative,"Just all around meh... could be a neat singleplayer RPG, but singleplayer rpgs don't usually nickle and dime you."
Negative,This game sucks
Negative,"I keep wanting to come back to this game, but every time I do I remember that literally every new piece of content is behind a paywall. Pass unless you want to drop a lot of cash."
Negative,"For an elder Scrolls game it is quite watered down for the public. I understand that we need to have a game everyone can play comprehensively, but Im just going to wait to buy Skyrim instead. Good attempt but not great enough to wow me."
Negative,100 gb of steam download then 50+gb update on the launcher then a new patch update of 80gb.And when you download the game you just delete it because now there is a new patch for you to download the game.10/10 would download again.
Negative,"While I love to play this game, the programmers just aren't that bright.  They're constantly getting mistakes that they've made before and not catching them before releasing to the public.  In my latest round of hours/days of not playing because I had to ""find a fix"",  I discovered a post to a 2014 mistake where we (the players and employers) had to create a host file entry to overide DNS settings.  (Hey, not so un common, right?)  The problem is one person posted ""Instead of disapearing for days, do you think your PAIDED support staff could have remembered this fix from the last time you made the mistake,  or do you truly just not remember?""They also seem to make the same problems over and over again in other areas...each patch brings long load times, then it's quickly address (as in days or weeks quickly).  We the system messes up, they say ""sorry, here's some money for the items that are not obtainable, and took you days to acheive.  Have a dayish worth of gold.""  BUT OH...IF A DROP HAPPENS TO OFTEN, IT'S FIXED IN HOURS...litterally, in October 2016, the game was giving out too many ""widgets"", so they kicked everyone off for emergency maintenance, for 12 hours.  After we got back, the ""widgets"" were back to a lotto style aquisition (1/10th of 1 millionth of a change to win kind of thing).They take my money for a percent chance to win something?  Hell, that sounds like gambling to me...So where's the Gaming Control Boards pockets, I mean oversite?  Each state has one, and most countries, too...Come to think of it, I'm on my way to law school soon...looks like I've found my new devision of practice..."
Negative,"banned for calling a k!ke a small hatedit: 1st time banned for insulting a piece of sh!t and now after the sh!tty update now my game is crashing after 1 min. Don't play this fuccing game, believe me even runescape is better than this horse shIt game"
Negative,"As buggy and hard to run as i have come to expect from Bethesda. Micro-transactions in an MMO are also understandable. Preachy real world politics are where I draw the line however. Hope that ""Modern Audience"" works out for you Todd because I am not buying anymore of your products"
Negative,"says I have played the game for 81 minutes. thats not true. i spent most of that time trying to figure out why i cant stop the camera from spinning. even turned my wifi mouse off. didnt help. glad i tried the free version first. it's really a shame because i am a big elder scroll fan.*UPDATE*here it is 1 year later. decided to try this game again. took 4 hours to download. not a good sign. still can not get the camera to stop spinning.since i'm not going to buy a new laptop/computer just to play this game, i guess its good bye ELDER SCROLLS."
Negative,I can't even launch the game...The launcher is broken
Negative,"I try to play this with a friend, but the quests keeps on bugging out."
Negative,Maybe MMO's just aren't for me
Negative,Just purchased this game and it crashes my computer every single time I run it. Can't even create a character and my specs are well past what they recommend. $60 for an unplayable game.
Negative,Took about 24hrs to download to find out i cant even log in 10/10
Negative,the game is pretty good but why in the hell is the necromancer class locked behind a paywall bethesda? are we doing this now? i mean this is an mmorpg im sure you already thrive off mounts from the ingame store and other stuff literally the only reason i wanted to play the game cuz all the other classes were too basic for me
Negative,"This game is a rule changing game and a game of potential yet fully realized. I play predominantly in pvp. The major reason for not recommending this game is the lag. By saying lag i mean latency and packet loss (spikes). A very large population, including myself have been playing with >300 ms latency for so many years. Ironically, the core mechanism of the pvp are different types of animation cancelling, which requires fluent and fast communication between local and the server. Let me give an example. When you press your block key at the time your see a templar is about to throw you a spear, if you lag is low you can probably block it successfully; otherwise, even you react with the human limit, you can never block the spear. The developers has cheated the community again and again, they claim to have dedicated to the performance. But let me tell you, the lag stays the same after 5 years. Even worse, I can see the entire eso team is so profit driven that they have completely ignored the balance of the game and the health of game is deteriorating in flashing rate. While balance issues always persist in all kinds of MMO, it becomes much worse when you keep throwing new gears into it."
Negative,"There is a cancer... known as the Creation Club, a malignant growth that needs to be cut before it infects the surface.We must protect Bethesda from it's worst enemy... Itself!EDIT: I will not support a company forcing PAID MODS on people. This is by the parent company of Bethesda, I hold them fully responsible.This is not The Elder Scrolls you're afer. A fair attempt on Zenimax's part, it's full of ""lore"" but it all feels half baked, the controls feel like any other MMO and not an Elder Scrolls game.Just wait for Bethesda's next installment of the series if you really want to enjoy a proper Elder Scrolls game.Please don't do this with Fallout, I beg you.Fallout is my bae."
Negative,"BORING. BORING, BORING, BORING. The game is bad and you should feel bad. I will not be renewing my subscription. I think what the problem is that you have actively made the game painfully slow to entice me to pay the monthly subscription.  Also, you have tried to cater to both MMORPG fans and long time elder scrolls fans but you have failed to meet the expectations of either. I do not have fun playing this game. It feels like a job. A job that I pay to work for. I literally had to talk myself into putting some hours into this game just so I did not feel like I totally wasted my money. Now I have to make sure you do not charge my credit card after you forced me to register a card that I have abusolutely no desire to give you EVEN 15 more dollars. I'm not mad. I'm disappointed."
Negative,"Steam thinks writing a second review time travels you to when you wrote the first one. I have 5300 hours, not 360ESO is an amazing game with an incompetent developer team. Since this is my most played game, i have a lot of thoughts on it, and I'd like to split that into sections.DLC, and the first impressions:Firstly, there's no pay-to-win. None. PvE endgame is all DLC content, but you can't pay for power, only overpriced convenience and cosmetics.It's no secret that ESO was not a good game at launch. It shows. The base game areas are often incredibly dull visually and occassionally contain outright bad texturing and map design. This also applies to the base game armours, which are just textures stretched over your skin 80% of the time. Zenimax (zos) seems to be aware of this, and so have made the game's first DLC of Morrowind completely free for all new accounts. Morrowind itself is a nice looking location, though problems arise almost immediately; New players will start out here rather than the curated starter zones designed to ease players into the game, and are now thrust into the largest zone in the game, withdead space between important areas and no direction to discover important locations and events within the game - most notably, the main story.For reasons I can't explain, the main quest does not begin for new players until they finally leave the DLC area in which they began - which may be halfway to the road to max level if they've done all there is to do there - and that means they won't find the main quest until initiated with the game, where it appears in the quest log from nowhere. If they realise it's important and continue they're brought to the base game tutorial no matter their level, forced to learn basic actions again. At the end, they are finally sent to the real starting location, which feels odd to a player with experience. Every player I've spoken to on the subject has been annoyed about missing out on the proper new player start, and it gets worse when you consider the DLC areas in which they begin are continuations of the base game's plot, effectively forcing you to start a plotline you've yet to gain the context for before you can acquire that context. It's incredibly messy, and frankly as a result I can't recommend this game to new players without an existing player as a guide. The new player experience is that bad.Combat, and how the fans fixed it:ESO's combat at it's core is very fun for its limitations. You're limited to 10 abilities and further limited by how you go about casting them by resource pools that abilities can draw from. All skills are on a global cooldown of one second but have no individual cooldowns, which lends to a very satisfying rhythm when you're smacking a boss or a player, especially when mastering weaving, a major damage increase where a player inputs a basic attack immediately before a skill cast. Simple on paper, fun in practice, and it remains just as engaging at any level.Problems lie in tracking your ability usage. Many lingering skills have odd durations which don't line up with anything, and the only tool in game to track your effects is laughably bad and practically unusable. Unfortunately, the only way to enjoy the combat (for me, at least) is with tons of addons to streamline the experience. Ability timers, GCD trackers, saving/loading ability bars and gear sets, it's all limited to addons. Addons are explicitly allowed and supported, but there's a level of jank to many of them that leaves a player wanting. Having dabbled in other MMOs I can see how it may be extremely jarring to another MMO fan coming into this game. My only recommendation is to look into addons for yourself before you decide whether or not you like the combat.Further problems come from the lack of proper tab targeting. Whatever your crosshair is on is your target. You can't really move your camera around to inspect your surroundings (important in many trials) without losing several casts, and a common strategy in PVP is to circle your opponent incredibly quickly, unfairly losing out on tons of casts for motor impaired players like myself.Aside from that, the classes are balanced, though there's a slight favour to th DLC classes, which tend to apply buffs/debuffs that can't be otherwise obtained. This isn't a big problem though, as all endgame raids can be completed at their highest difficulty with no deaths with any class setup as long as all players are skilled. Differences between classes are negligible. All classes play fairly similar, and are defined by a few quirks that are mostly just how it feels to play. Balance shifts a lot, so pick what you like. Unfortunately the game seems to be balanced around PvP, and skills are not separated in effect between PvP and pve, so oftentimes the weakest PvE classes will be nerfed because of some PvP jank.Visuals:Among other MMOs, ESO looks nice. Not great, but not bad. Base game areas are often fairly plain, but the DLC areas are very inspired and are a joy to explore. The Character creator is likewise pretty good, but not impressive. You won't see a duplicate of your face in thousands of hours, at least. The textures are low res, but an addon can help this, allowing access to the uncompressed textures, which look fairly good unless you zoom in super close.PvE?:It's good after 300 hours. Base dungeons are pathetic, their bosses are punching bags with no mechanics. Unenjoyable while leveling up. They get good by the 2nd dungeon DLC, but every piece of PvE content that I like is behind a DLC paywall, and it's a very large price. Skipping straight to that point is also not possible, as lots of leveling is required to meet the base requirements for even the easiest of the fun dungeons. DLC trials are even worse for this, and many trials are a slog unless done on their hardest difficulty, requiring the top gear and research to the fight's mechanics, as well as a dedicated team capable of pulling it off. The problem is that these groups vastly vary in skill, and fast learners can get frustrated when they master a fight before their allies have figured out basic mechanics. Finding competent groups that will accept you with no prior clear is nearly impossible, you just need to know the right people. Still, the PvE itself is the most fun I've had in any game, so whether it's worth the time investment is up for debate.PvP?:No. It's unbalanced, and has not received a proper content update since 2017. On top of that, it's laggy. So laggy it's become notorious for slowing the entire server down during PvP events. This is a major problem considering the targeting system, because pointing at a target under 5000 ping isn't intuitive. I don't recommend this game for PvP at all.RP?:Absolutely. Elder Scrolls has very deep and intricately woven lore, allowing for your character to feel really entwined with the world if you'd like, but it's also up to interpretation enough to give you some wiggle room with stranger concepts. I've met some of the coolest people I know through RP in this game, though my only problem with it is the elitist attitude the RP hub discord can have, the small communities you can find using them tend to be very welcoming and friendly.Updates, and the windows 98 game server:This is a problem that arose in 2020, but it's a big enough problem I need to mention it even if later fixed. 2020, the so-called 'year of performance' for this game was a disaster. Crashes run rampart, with several an hour, and the game still runs horribly for it's age. Server lag is also very common. Even with nothing going on you often get dropped from server, which is disappointing for a game with this much income.Overall, I love this game, but don't play it until the crashes are fixed if you're considering it. That's why my review is currently negative, but I'll be changing that when they're done making 200 dollar in game houses and decide to fix it."
Negative,"Very average game...not worth the buy, you'll burn out really quick because this game isn't rewarding at all."
Negative,"Looks and plays like a game much older than Skyrim. As an MMO it's very mediocre, As an Elder Scrolls game it's quite terrible."
Negative,cant even launch the game really fun
Negative,Combat is decent. Cookie cutter quests...Not much PVP variety.
Negative,"This game seemed wonderful but the server problems are constant, ive bought this game last week and half the time the servers are down. Whether its on steams side or the devs side it shouldn't matter. I can't give this a good review end of."
Negative,"The game is quite good and there is a lot to see and do.....IF you can actually log on.Week after week there are log in issues, time and time again zos fails to fix this issue.The game is plagued by bugs and issues, even the new dlc now has issues.Most people who play's...or try to play find out really quick that free play is not very possible, so if you wish to play this game thoroughly you will have to get eso plus, which is a rip off because of all the issues you will encounter trying to do so.As a paying customer you will lose hours of game play due to the companies ability to actual make and keep the game running properly.They never compensate either, even when a planned maintenance that should take 4 hour end up taking 12 or more , not even a sorry..disgusting service tbh.PvP has become a joke too, cannot mount, fall into scenery, continuous burning status, haemorrhaging and extremely unbalanced game play.It gets even better, pvp is plagued with cheaters , currently they can travel under the map and collect scrolls without attacking a single keep, a single npc or player.complaints including screen shots and videos have been sent but nothing done so even more cheating is occurring destroying the game. It seems zos do not care at all and unfortunately for many players they feel like they have too much invested in the game to just stop, and left hoping at some point these issues will be addressed , even though some of these bugs have existed and remained since release.I have put hours into this game and i unfortunately have spent money on eso plus and in game content so really dont wish to quit but will have to soon if nothing gets fixed.I find it a damn shame, they have a great game series, with many people playing simply due to enjoying elder scroll games for many years but now it has been handed to this careless reckless and useless company totally destroying the franchise because of simple stupid stuff!I would highly recommend avoiding this game before you get stuck like myself invested in a game that should be good and sometimes really good but swamped in isssue after issue that is making the game unplayable...find something similar that actually works and where the devs actually care about their game and their customers unlike zenimax online who do not."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU DO NOT WANT HEADACHESi bought this game in December of last year, and it was pretty fun. Played it together with some friends and we were having a good time, mostly just questing and fooling around. But as time went on then game became frustrating. Overly complicated leveling and combat system that doesn't leave any space for fun. My first elder scrolls games were Skyrim and Oblivion, which both were a massive blast due to the fact that you could play as ANYTHING you wanted. Want to be a heavy armor sneak archer? sure go ahead, a mage knight? nothing is stopping you from using a greatsword and spells, just quickly switch between to the two tings and you're good to go. But ESO... this game... it's horrible. 30 fucking passives that give you a 10% damage boost and +124 magicka recovery... bosses that 1 shot you even though you aren't standing in the area of effect, NPC clothing that doesn't even load in, quests that bug half way through and no console commands to fix it, and the list goes on and on.It may be that MMO's aren't my thing, but seriously this isn't fun anymore, its just grinding your ass off"
Negative,"This was my first and probably last online multiplayer game. It is just too crowded. What's the point in being an adventurer in a fantasy world if everyone else is an adventurer. It's like living in a major city at rush hour. The story and the quests were fine, I just didn't like lining up."
Negative,"This game is basically about 80% runing from spot to spot... waste of time.Boring quests due to constant run to A (5min) than to B (5min) do someting (0,5-2min) and run to C (5min).Inventory managment is a painful (basically you have problems after each 2 quests)- limited slots... yes you can buy more... for money:- in game... awful grind especially that devs made a ton of items... - real money... awful behaviour of company to encourange monthly subscription for a run-here-and-there-gameOn top of that... encounters in dungeons are stupid as they are so difficult that actually almost impossible to to in duo - they were designed to be exlpored in max parties of 4. If sometinhg is not marked as solo dungeon - you just don't stand no chance. Total C_R_A_P. Level 22 - bored... I wish I could get my money back. Droping the game and looking for something better.You can buy on your own risk....And... don't try fishing unless you love doing boring things for no reward :)"
Negative,"Pros :- great graphisms.  Some are really stunning- plenty of dungeons in many forms- you can wield any weapon you like or wear any outfit- housing is not bad- dragonsCons: This is a MMO for dummies:- levelling is way too fast. I am not sure exp is scaled properly as it might take you the same amount of time to go through lvl 10 or lvl 50. You can reach highest level in less than a month even playing casually ! - crafting is completly useless because of it. Why bothering gathering materials for lvl 10 when you'll be 15 in 1 hour? Only useful crafting are provisionning and alchemy. - also don't bother stuff droping before highest level- same thing : fishing is useless- skill trees are linear - you cannot sell anything because their is no marketplace for it, To sell you need to be in a guild with a trader, there are few.- connection issues- most of the quests are just plain boring. Everything that made ES nice is gone. Go, retrieve, bring back - move to the next. Some of them are actually more complex, you need to think and read but they are too rareIt is fine as a solo game, keeps entertained during lockdown, but not really challenging."
Negative,"After this game being out for about 4 years; ""they"" nerfd the bow and the staff after dropping the last dlc.Skyrim ranged weps (Bows and staffs): You can hold down heavy attack and decide when YOU want to attack..Oblivion ranged weps  ^: You can hold down heavy attack and decide when YOU want to attack..ESO: For almost 4 YEARS! You can hold down Heavy attack and decide when YOU want to attack.... Except after the last DLC now you can not, heavy attack just auto fires... WELCOME TO RUSSIA where RANGED WEAPON PLAY YOU!!  ...no im good with that  /uninstall *3 months go by*   /reinstall *play for 45 min* /uninstall ...still not fun at all.Yeah i miss this game it used to be good, i had a hell of a time."
Negative,"Ugh. I wanted to like this game so badly! It falls so short of its predecessors, I have been sorely disappointed so far. For full disclosure, I haven't logged a whole lot of time yet, so this might change in the future.One of the things about this game that has immediately put me off is the inventory management. There are just so many different items for the cool things you can do (fishing, cooking, etc.) that I find myself needing to delete something everytime I come across a new item. Of course, there are ways to pay real money for more inventory space, but for a filthy pleb casual such as myself, this is just not ideal.The quests are just alright compared to the rich storylines of the other TES titles, in my opinion. So far it just hasn't latched me in the way all the other games have. And I sincerely wanted to fall in love with this game."
Negative,"So much hype and such a let down :[    I've been a fan of the elder scroll's universe since morrowind on the OG xbox, so when i heard this game was happening i was very happy but this is not what i expect at all. First of all when you download this game, you download about 48 gb's that are textures and the game launcher. When you open the game it goes to the launching screen like any MMO... and then it downloads 25 more gb's at over half your normal download speed. This is annoying enough but the launcher that you are using to download the rest of this game off of is very unstable and crashes frequently. When the launcher crashed it froze my pc and i had to restart it but when i booted up my pc and open up the launcher i had to start from the very begining. I'm not joking when i say it took me more than 24 hours to finally get to the point where i could design my charcter. Now this may only be a personal experience but it was very frustraiting.    Once i got past the technical issues and started playing i first noticed the game was missing some textures which was odd. All ESO is, is just another run of the mill MMO so if you love MMO's and you have patients for hours of wait time before you can play a game go ahead and buy it, I'm returning this and regreting the wasted time stressing over something so petty."
Negative,"For those of you who are looking for a similar experience to singleplayer Elder Scrolls, you may be disappointed. I find this game extremely boring because the quests are lacking. All quests are easy to find with waypoints, you won't be wandering around, lost and unsure of where the quest is supposed to take place. NPC's have very limited and simplified speech, similar to Fallout 4's failure of delivering a choice of what you want to actually talk about. It is hard to say what you really mean, the dialogue is pre-determined. The quests take a few minutes at most to complete, and are not satisfying. The world looks okay, but it looks like a cross between Morrowind, Oblivion, and Lord of the Rings Online. The graphics, ground clutter, 3D models/meshes, and textures leave a lot to be desired.Overall, I paid $8 and am somewhat satisfied. Glad I did not pay full price."
Negative,playing since closed beta with the standalone client. (probably a couple of years in game time)The game had great times.The pvp focus with a solid pve base was always the strength of this game for me.Broken patch after patch with days of instability broken skills and streight up not working new features complete lack of communication or care towards the community made a once great game a shell of itself.Ugly uncomplete features broken story lines loveless new dlcs and predatory monetization does not even make it a good story game anymore.What a fall from grace.....Performance is so bad that playing my main reason to play (open world cyrodil pvp) is unplayable at almost every evening i still try to pick it up.
Negative,"Please, never spend money on this. Bought game, bought subscription, can't play the game because of infinite queue. New classes unbalanced, monkies coded the PvP. World looks good tho."
Negative,Graphics are great but gameplay is so boring it hurts. Any form of combat can be completed successfully by a 5 year old.If you are looking for a challenge don't buy this game. I regret the time I put into it.
Negative,Was fun playing for some days until the Gold Road update then I kept getting Error 301. I am now unable to play the game. What a waste of money.
Negative,"Amazing game, it's a casual MMO, nothing hardcore. Aimed at people who want to have fun playing this genre. That said, do not buy it from steam. There's frequent issues with ZOS servers being unable to communicate with steam (my reason for not recommending it). On top of that, the client is sluggish to load. The load screens between zones also take long.If there's anything worse to add, it's ZOS support which is essentially a bunch of bots adamantly copy pasting standard replies instead of actually reading tickets."
Negative,What a shit game!! i cant even create a character because any name i try is pointless and i do not receive any error message or anything!!
Negative,if the game would let me download the update in the in game browser i would like the game but i cant even play it so.....
Negative,My profile says I have 15 hours of play time...I am STILL UPDATING!  I have yet to actually Play!  -_-'  It's beyond ridiculous.
Negative,way too pay to winif you want a game like skyrim look elsweyr
Negative,trash!Edit: i still think is trash
Negative,"A stain on the face of the Elder Scrolls franchise. Elder Scolls games have so much integrity on their own, this just feels like a complete cash grab and reversion of everything they stand for.Too easy, to the point of boredom. Poorly designed, a waste of effort."
Negative,"So I baught it a bit back, and my friend recently baught it. He got the morrowindwind dlc with the purchase but I cannot get it without paying over $30 for the stuped crowns. WTF Bethesda, why can't I just buy morrowind from the steam store for christ sake. Too bad its too late for refund."
Negative,"The game is not inherrently bad, especially for what it is. What I was hoping for was maybe a little more of an Elder Scrolls feel, what this ended up feeling like was WoW with an Elder Scrolls skin + First Person. The art style, in my opinion, is really off-putting, and the quest lines feel generic and quite uninteresting. Just the general placement of quest giving NPCs in the landscape feels like you're walking around Disneyland getting on the next ride; definition of a themepark game. The immersive landscapes are hardly existent, and the world just feels plastic. That being said, it's a unique-ish MMO, but it is at the end of the day, just another MMO."
Negative,"Great Game and I love playing it.The reason i am giving this game a bad review is the lack of respect they have for there customers, now that the game has  no subscription required (which i agree with) It has these little things called crowns, crowns are a premium currency that allows you to buy premium pets and mounts and other things like that, now you can still p2p if you want you get a 10exp boost and 1500 crowns a month and any new dlc coming out, but if you were one of the people that payed to play before they made it free to play with no subscription THEY GIVE YOU NOTHING and its fucking bullshit they gave you 100 crowns for every month you payed and a shitty little pet that i dont even fucking want instead of just not being cheap and giving you what you fucking payed for in earlier months, the people that played this game before the no sub required got nothing out of this they kinda just gave you a pat on the back and said ""thanks for the free money you fucking idiot""  im very unsatisfied and i hope someone from zenimax reads this and feels bad those money loving fuck faces"
Negative,"It's enjoyable enough, and I would still recommend it, despite MMOs not being my thing. But I am angered by their aggressive microtransactions. I found out I had some unopened crates, and the guy who gives you the loot crates acts like a stereotypical dealer. Encouraging you to buy more, and that you might get something good. They really pioneered sucking as much money as they can from you, and I'm tired of it"
Negative,Terrible fight mechanics and subpar graphics quality at premium cost. Anywhere but Elder Scrolls next time.
Negative,Weave your way to the uninstall. 3/10.
Negative,takes atleast 5 hours to install then it stops your install and another 5 hours and then you need to wait a year for it to instsall AGAIN ONCE ITS INSTALL ITS JUST FUCKING ANNOYING DONT BUY
Negative,Its more of a generic MMO than a true entry to the Elder Scrolls.
Negative,Idk about this game now mixed feelings kinda hate that it goes away from the other games dont like the pvp or leveling system at all quests very bland too in my opinion then again i only played for a few hours only good thing i can say about this is performance wise its an easy game to run for me
Negative,"Mediocre This game has great potential, that will never be realised by its devs. At first glance the world seems great and vast, and story alluring as any elderscrolls game, but as you'll soon find out this is not the case. Every area has a theme, yet all of its quest are the EXACT same. once you have completed one areas quest, these are all the quests/ story lines you will be continuing to do, just with differently named npc's and locations. All classes feel the same, and there is no real class identity (hell traditional tanks are completely useless in the game due to no aoe taunt, taunting not working in pvp, and no collision,meaning you cant block a shot for your teammate, with blocking costing a an enormise amount of resources.) with one of 2 classes having busted healing and dps combo, making all the others pointless to play in pvp. its open world and dungeons fail because of its very poor and out dated combat system, this game is in dire need of a combat rehaul. which of course it will never get. its faction wars would have been a redeeming factor if it wasn't plagued by zerges because people purposely sabotaging their own faction based on some youtuber or streamer not liking that faction. and pvp 1v1s that never end due to broken healing. this game does a few things right but simply inst worth the time investment an mmo takes to fully enjoy due to its boring combat,  boring zones/ world, and 0 class identity. (also has ugly ass armor) 4/10 mediocre."
Negative,"One of the best MMOs I have ever played but I can't recommend it at the time. While the dev team has a ""timeline"" of when they expect to fix the lag/server issues with the game I would wait and see if they actually accomplish any of these goals before you purchase this game. Some say it is a complex issue so it will take time and there may be some truth to that. But from the amount of content being released and new cash shop items I think they could find a faster time frame or put some more priority behind it. And if you were looking to purchase the game like I did to play a WW..they got nerfed pretty damn hard.  Or will be in this next patch if the combat team continues to ignore feedback from the PTS.Hope they turn it around! it really was a great game."
Negative,"This game generates revenue like a forgotten New Years Resolution gym membership. You subscribe for a month, quit playing but don't unsub right away due to the unsubscribe process being intentionally obfuscated from players, and then forget about it. You mistakenly pay for a few months untill you notice an email from them thanking you for your subscribtion. Bewildered and somewhat amused, you try to unsubscribe once more, only to get frustrated again when you struggle to find out exactly how to unsubscribe."
Negative,"Notifications for microtransactions as soon as you log in. Crown crates. Gameplay that was stale and unimaginative when it released 10 years ago. Add-ons are basically required to make this steaming turd playable. Servers still have issues -- redownloading years later, it took me several attempts to log in.ESO+ subscription is required for the craft bag, to the degree that it is not even feasible to suggest that you do regular inventory management instead. It is constantly throwing junk items at you to incentivize the sub. It's also the only ""economical"" way to play any of the DLC, which at this point is most of the worthwhile content in the game.Without the Elder Scrolls IP, this abomination would have been dead on arrival. It had a ton of potential (see my hours), and seems to be still alive based on the unfulfilled promise of that potential. There are at least 3 MMOs with higher population, better story, better gameplay, better raids and dungeons, better PvP, etc. The main thing on offer here is a shameless butchery of the Elder Scrolls lore in the name of a continuous world and fatter pockets for Zenimax."
Negative,"The game is great if your into Elder Scrolls & MMO. But the worse thing is, there is no Asia/Oceania server so we have to constantly suffer with 270+ ping every time along with lost connections and 999+ ping. Good job. 5/10"
Negative,"If you're here for pvp, then stay away from this game"
Negative,"I'm tired of constantly being disconnected. Talking to an NPC or changing zones runs an unacceptably high chance of a random DC. For a game that's been out as long as ESO has, it's simply not good enough."
Negative,"Expansions just get worse and worse while getting more and more expensive. If you don't have the expansions, you don't get to play with friends in-game in those zones (lol for a community and social game, this sure tries its hardest to keep you from playing with them. Dumb design for a multiplayer game). It's hard forking real life cash just to keep up with friends and guild members playing in new zones introduced by expansions. Bought every expansion up to Elseweyr but that would be it from now on. I say - no thanks to Greymoor. I would not recommend this mmo to a single friend because I'd hate disappointing my gamer friends who have not encountered this game yet."
Negative,"This game is fundamentally broken. Looing for adventure are you? Just speak to Balderiq in the tavern. Oh, he's currently surrounded by eight other players. Well, just form an adventuring group and... oh, EACH of you has to have the EXACT SAME CONVERSATION with him to get the quest. Cool cool cool.Ok, you have the quest, lets go into the spooky crypt! What is this? A demon! Let us fight!Oh, there's like ten other adventurers in the crypt, all wailing on the demon. That was quick. But look! Twenty seconds later, the demon is back! Rinse repeat.You've beaten the demon, now speak to the ghost in the corner... yes, he's surrounded by eight other players... and ten new players are wailing on the demon and... you get the idea.A better name for this game would be, ""Adventuring in the mall two days before Christmas."""
Negative,"A very bad gimmick of Elder scrolls games. Nothing in the game is interesting enough to keep you playing for long. The world map is huge in Elder Scrolls Online , but it's literally blueprint copy paste regions everywhere, if you fully completed at least 1 region, then you can count it as if you played the whole game. The combat also is very bad im suprised it managed to be worse than skyrim's combat. Oh and also be ready to spend money for basic simple thing such as inventory space, oh and the houses have only limited amout of space for furnishings so if you buy a large house you reallly can't style it fully. Also , the PVP is utter garbage i mean its the worst i have ever seen honestly and the developer dosen't give a damn about it , they are  busy locking all good cosmetics behind ""Crown crates"" aka CLOWNCRATES also , releasing same old formulaic dlc for the Nth time .IT IS THE MOST BORING GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.Do not buy this.I regret buying this."
Negative,4+ Hours In-Game without even getting past login! Don't purchase through Steam as Bethesda cant fix their bloody issues.
Negative,"Awful. Game unplayable due to login severs always being down. Attempted to contact ESO support about this and request a refund for the subscription I have been unable to use. Support doesn't contact you back, simply shuts the job with a note saying feed back has been passed on to developers. Basically, a bunch of theives with absoulute contempt for their victims. Avoid."
Negative,"Stay away from this game.  The launcher is horrible and will freeze up.  When it does, you will have to reinstall the entire game.  Even then, it's not a guarentee to work.  Will eat up you data plan doing this multiple times per month.  Avoid!"
Negative,"This game is mind numbingly boring, due to it being ridiculously easy. Its insulting how easy this game is, after hours l, I dont think ive even come close to dying. what is even the point in leveling up, if everything levels up with your character, there is no challenege at all. Theyve ruined this game."
Negative,"I'm not saying this have has no purpose, I'm just saying there's no point in playing. there's no real story or enemy to fight and anything you earn is pretty much pointless other than to make it potentially easier to earn something else which doesn't do anything. If you enjoy running around aimlessly doing quest that once more, don't do anything then be my guest."
Negative,Just a terrible game.
Negative,"it's a big step down from other elder scrolls games, and they've managed to cram in a staggering amount of lazy cash-grabs..."
Negative,Pushing out cash content every update. Won't even take the time to fix spelling mistakes.
Negative,The game seems good and beautifull but the combat system is awfull so no from me
Negative,"Thought I'd give it a go during a free week. The combat from Morrowind to Skyrim is imperfect, but until you OP yourself, it generally works. You select a dungeon that won't one shot you, You choose the right spells that won't exhaust your mana, you need to avoid getting hit by whatever means and you have to aim and hit your enemy whether in melee or ranged or magic. Battles are strategic and bringing down a terrifyingly powerful boss feels like a serious achievement of beating the odds through skill, intellect and often luck. Levelling up felt earned and the story was a journey for the player, not just the character.In ESO. I finished the tutorial and went on a couple of quests. I defeated every enemy, including the bosses by running up to it, standing by it and holding down the 1 key to spam my skill. After a while I got a skill point that meant I had to hold down the 1 key a slightly smaller amount of time before the thing in front of me fell over. At no point was my health bar in any danger of registering an ingrowing hair follicle, let alone a sword slash.I remember the earliest version of Runescape on Jagex over 20 years ago now. That had more depth than this."
Negative,"This game has too many poor scripting, ie. Had location of marker move,  so I fight & sneak toward location, than find the marker is behind me so i fight back and then it appears at same point.  One quest has cased this rage quit, touch this and touch location the other side of void. Looking for a hint after a hour and I find you have to be in the right spot while the fire lasts, but it only lasts a second. So you have to move to a spot in under a second or two while watching a distant point and not falling into void.  Design should put ""timed on"" button near controls or at least a marked point rather than somewhere. It is more annoying when NPCs prattle on about how elegant the design is."
Negative,Honestly the best game in the entire world..... Im joking this game sucks more dick than my friend lucas.....and that is hard to do.
Negative,goofy ahh game
Negative,Fucking cunts spy on their customers.
Negative,"Don't fall for it, not even worth the $9.99 i paid for it. Boring, unoriginal, and not fun."
Negative,pretty shit tbh
Negative,God help you if you ever need support from these people and their horrendous website.
Negative,"The game is buggy, has a strong paywall(almost pay to win), that forces you to purchase expansions with real money to get better grade equipment. poorly optimized so you need a much stronger hardware to play smoothly in high settings. the combat system is one of the worse active combat systems that I ever experienced and the classes are unbalanced.For those who like PVE otherwise, the game experience is pretty decent, cause the voice acting is pretty nice and the storytelling is very good."
Negative,"I don't know, man.I mean,I love the Elder Scrolls games. I love MMOs. So I should love this game. I want to, and I've tried to. I've tried on console and PC. I played when it was premium, and now that it's freemium.But it just isn't fun. I don't even know why. I think I was hoping a hybrid between MMOs and TES would mean the best of both worlds, but somehow it feels like the worst of both.I wish I could give a more detailed review, but everything in the game just feels meaningless. Weightless. Boring. Empty. I can't think of anyone I'd recommend it to; not when there are a million better open world RPGs, and a million better MMOs. Play Skyrim. Play Final Fantasy FFXIV. But don't play this."
Negative,"Tutorial? Not really.ESO-Plus membership is optional? No, you need it.ESO-Plus membership will fix the inventory management? No, it's still awful.You can play as any class with any skills you want? Play meta or play solo. Everyone will flame you or kick you out of groups if you dont have the right weapon or the right race to your class.You need like 10 addons to play the game? Sucks hard, esp. when they dont get updated after a patch."
Negative,"I can't get into this game no matter how hard I try.  Tried the game in beta and didn't like the combat system, generally bland model design, unfriendly interface, and pretty much everything else about it.  Tried the game again in 2017 and still feel the same.  It's a shame because I love Elder Scrolls and I love western fantasy MMORPGs."
Negative,"I beta tested this game way back before public release. I downloaded the massive thing, got in and ran around for awhile and thought, this is boring. This time I thought I'd give it another go because they've had all this time to add to it. Well, I downloaded the extra massively bloated thing, got in and ran around for a few hours more this time, and my thoughts are still the same, this is boring. Here's why I'm giving this game another thumbs down:-The world is bland. It's not like the Skyrim single player game we all love. It's a much less detailed, much less atmospheric environment. -Your character isn't the highly detailed, physics based, almost human character that it is in Skyrim. In this game it almost feels like its apart from the rest of the world. It glides around, all jumpy, like they made the environemnt with one program, then made the character with another. It just doesn't feel like your character fits.-Endless, mindless quests. It never seems to get out of tutorial phase. It's just one ""run here and get this item, then run here and light this torch, then run here and talk to this NPC....blah blah blah"". I don't think I've read any of the dialogue. Just click through the crap till you get the next stupid objective. -They say fighting is ""visceral"". But really, all that means is you have to keep the crosshairs on your target. ""Visceral"" just means theres no target locking. Which is just dumb, and not fun. It's bland combat without target lock, that's it. If that's ""visceral"", then I don't like visceral. -Skill trees are bland. It's nothing like the complex, logical skills trees you see in Guild Wars 2 or World of Warcraft. These are just; level up and put a point in this skill line or that skill line. Then hotkey new skill and press button when in combat. Theres no strategy to it. No planning out combos to make you style unique.-Wierd character class/race combos. Nothing seems to be the ""right"" character. They all just seem weird. If there was one major deathnail for this game, I'd have to say it's the never ending, mind numbing tutorial-esque quests. They're just stupid and boring."
Negative,"i really dont like how this plays. i dont like cooldown rotating, i dont like the weird way they expect you to dedicate time to learning how to weave normal attacks between your skill uses, it hurts my hands to play in a way. not like its super duper fast OSU! type speed but its uncomfortable and not the most thrilling. crafting is alright, but thats because the crafting, unlike the combat, is close to how the crafting is in the other elder scrolls gamesheck, thats the thing wrong with elder scrolls online: its too much like world of warcraft and final fantasy 14, and not enough like an elder scrolls game imo"
Negative,"Although its nice game to play with plenty to do and looks great, the constant cash grab is off putting.I don't like the fact that you pay for the game and then pay for the updates (DLC) and still aspects of the game, needed to play unhindered, are locked away only available to those who pay the monthly subscription. Which is a hefty and currently discounted US$15 per month. This expense is also added to by the fact that you have to further purchase in game currency such as Crowns and Gems for in game character extras, upgrades and other content.  I don't mind paying a few dollars for content and character bling, but this is not clearly explained at the time of your initial purchase and makes it quite expensive to play this MMO. The cost to play needs to be reworked.It is a great offering as an MMO but not cheap to play."
Negative,"absolutly horrible customer support. they leave all of your questions up to the community on a forum so you will never get an awnser.i was playing the game and doing missions that were from the morrowind chapter. got off that night and went to bed. woke up the next day and couldnt finish any of those missions, it said i didnt have the morrowind chapter and couldnt access those cities.i was under the impression that the morrowind chapter now came with the base game, even if it doesnt, why was i able to play it and now not. my character is all screwed up because im halfway through missions that i now cant access.i read on these ""support"" forums and have found alot of people have had alot of serious game breaking problems and there hasnt been any help for them either.the devs obviously dont care if this game works they just want your money and for that reason alone i say this game is absolutly garbage"
Negative,i hate the way they monetize this game and the game play is not fun enough for me to look passed it
Negative,Big ass game got bored
Negative,"A grindy boring MMO, it's pretty though."
Negative,Like its 2022 why does this game not have cross platform play? Lets get with the times.
Negative,"If you have finished the main story, it just gets repitive, you accept that, you do this, you kill that. Good,bad, only two options, especially on *spoiler*The ""guardian of the forest"" final quest, which forces you to pick who dies?! Even though, all explanations were reasonable, it doesn't let you pick the option to kill the guardian and and let that person die. It just stays closed, unlike dark souls where you could even kill the npc. Also, it gets boring on miscellanous acts like ""stealing"", and ""mining"" where you need to ride for 3 -15 minutes just to find the rocks"
Negative,While I am sure this could be a great game what good is that if you cant play it. All i can do anymore is look at a request character load screen and never get into the game to play it. So as of now my recommendation is to skip this game and find something you can actually play.
Negative,"was a good game that sadly has been dying for a while, with Bethesda selling out to Microsoft its now not even playable as it suffers from game braking glitch's and crashes that need task manager to get away from, i cant recommend this anymore"
Negative,Boring and too easy.
Negative,PVP is utter garbage
Negative,Imagine needing a staff to cast spells. If this was a real mans game I would only need to open my mouth to obliterate my foes!
Negative,Despite hours of trouble-shooting the game will not start from the launcher
Negative,Just play guild wars 2
Negative,"For the first time in almost 20 years of being on Steam I requested a refund. Hated everything about this game starting with the Morrowind-level character creation I hated the interface, the constant screen disruptions from messages trying to sell me crap was red flag #1, and all before I'd even picked up my first weapon which felt clunky and annoying right off the hop. Hated everything about this game and didn't expect much to improve with Bethesda's online cash grab, so I'm getting a refund and going back to playing Skyrim.ESO lost me after 28 minutes, I won't be back."
Negative,Combat design is trash nothing more to say since this kills the entire game for me. I'm not one to hold on to other good features to keep playing when it comes to combat and this combat is utterly trashAnimations are stiff and awkward Combat is not impactful or satisfying at all The fantasy of the classes feels weak its more slapped on than cohesive
Negative,"Pros: Love the graphics and most of the content base game.  Really looks great.Cons: 2014 stopped playing due to consistant crashes, (While grouping with other people).  2017 stopped playing due to consistant crashes, (While grouping with other people).  Buy the game, plays fine until your first group crash, then the crashes come more frequent.  So, play for 15 mins group crash, play for 10 mins group crash, play for 5 mins group crash, until you get to launch screen, crash, crash, crash...  Re-downloaded the whole game several times.  And still got crashes everytime I got into a group.  Seems to be save game bug issues.  Getting help is even a bigger issue.  Not sure if this is anything like the TES V save info, but grouping seems to be a big issue on my end.DLC content per Area - Awesome - However, unless you purchase it outright, you lose out.  $15 a month / $180 a year to own a unlimited storage chest and limited access to areas is a joke.  People paying by the month should have the biggest advantage, not the other way around.  Buying  a house is cool, until you find out there is a certain criteria you must meet before basically getting the keys."
Negative,"Clunky animation, boring content compared to other mmorpg. very shitty ping (my ping was never bellow 200 despite other online games running well so definetly the server's fault). Every major update and event have some big or gamebreaking bug and ended up a long maintanence. Everytime they run an event and got a bug and ended up having to forgo maintanence for a day they didn't give any compensation at all, not even extending the event duration. seriously i thought this game would've been diffrent since its run by zenimax but i guess im wrong."
Negative,"Honestly, I can't recommend this. If you love the singleplayer games stick to them, otherwise you'll be stuck in a generic mmo with a slight TES sauce poured over it. And there is a festival of glitches unless your comp is top spec, same for your internet connection."
Negative,"Buying this game - WORST MISTAKE EVER.i played in the beta and really like it, even though it's not like skyrim which is the only reason i even considered starting to play this game. I didn't buy it at first because of the ppm. but when i did buy it when it turened to ptp oh boy what a load of **** awaited me. many features locked because i'm not a plus user and the server barely let me login. on the rare occasions when they do let me in i can never leave the starting island. well i guess that now i can just ask for my money back. Oh wait, i can't because the time it took to update the game used up way way more than the 2 hours i have to change my mind and get my money back."
Negative,Dont waste your money with this game. I bought it for its elder scrolls and i am a fan of that games. They made it like F2P MMORPG games. It doesnt worth that much money.
Negative,Too much downtime for maintenance and always at a rubbish time for UK just to please the Americans.
Negative,I've seen better mobile ripoffs of elder scrolls games than this official Elder scrolls online game
Negative,"I got over 3 bug to play, after a week of play the unable to connect to steam bug finished me for good.You might not be able to play because of the many bugs. Good game."
Negative,"combat is trash, so are the devs"
Negative,my charcter keeps getting locked and the game co help is half assed cuase they dont recognise my email buy the game from the actual company so you have an actual account and an actual customer service line and can easily cancel yer account imm still trying to figure that out cuase steam dont navigate easily to the parent company site btw my main has been blocked 2x once for 5 days now this is the second time im done im no troll and my name is sees stupidity so no name violation figure out why im blocked and ill give you a cookie
Negative,"That game started once great and interesting, but it got worse and worse over time. I thought it maybe ""might"" get better again but it kept and keeps getting worse and worse. I think its now at a point where there is basically no return anymore and it will just continue dieing slowly more and more.1. Ever increasing mindless boring grind. (New players will have literally 0 chances to ever keep up)2. Bugs, bugs, bugs, ah and did I mention bugs? (For example not being able to block for SEVERAL months! (you can guess what happens when the tank keeps dieing).3. A new class / system / set item = overpowered, existing stuff gets nerved to uselessness.4. The probably most predatory monetization system ever (worse then almost all Free2Play games""- Subscription: yes!- Lootboxes: oh yeah!- Cosmetics: sure!- Buy for main game: why not!?- Pay for every DLC on top: hell yeah! (there are more than 30 of them and some cost more than some full price games)- Limited inventory space which you can heavily increase by paying extra (limitless crafting bag): *grunt* *grunt*- Several Ingame advantages you can buy extra: more money!- Several premium currencies...- Plenty more (if I would go into more detail)...5. Steady decline in players...6. Snooze level overland. Its made for the worst players in the world, so that they even have an easy time to kill, for everyone else all the adds are just annoying because they block you all the time from being able to do anything...7. On the other side the difficulty for trials (especially trifectas) is so high, you might be a masochist to try to do them. Especially combined with the decline of players (there are barely any players left that can do them) and the amount of bugs (almost no mech works properly in the game and stuff happens randomly all the time).8. There is literally no middle ground content (90% of the game is made for the 10% worst players and 10% of the game is done for the 10% most sweaties player, there is literally 0% for everyone else left).9. Increasingly more gay, now even with non binary characters and more and more woke bullshit.10. plenty of more bad stuff (but its already lengthy)...Absolutely not recommend for literally anyone who is seeking to start / try it out for the first time. And everyone else that already has tried it out, knows what he is getting..."
Negative,Nope. The bad part of having played and reached endgame on about 20 MMO games like these is that you can easily tell when its not gonna be as fun as you would expect. Iv gotten that feeling. instantly and I can tell you need a dedicated guild/friends to make this game fun.
Negative,So when I at least downloaded it the game was 100 dollars and 100 gbs. I don't if they've lessened the installation size but in my opinion the gameplay is abundant and theres not much to do
Negative,fortnite is betterBoring cycle of the same thing
Negative,the most FAIL PVP MODE u can find in a mmorpg game...always 2 teams vs 1
Negative,"this game used to be fun... Zenimax could not care less about their players, time, or money."
Negative,"Well, I feel deceived.Advertising for the monthly membership claims you get access to available DLC; yet it did not grant me access to the newest DLC, and they want an extra 30 bucks."
Negative,Cannot recommend a game with one of the worst lootbox systems I have seen in my life in a PC game and the release of gold road + the 10 year anniversary event being A MASSIVE FUCKING JOKE make this game a laughable shitshow
Negative,"For a game that isn't ""free"" and has many opportunities to fill the dev's coffers...It is surprisingly buggy.  After 4 hours my guy just shifted through a wall in the middle of combat and I had to reboot to fix it, at the cost of re-doing the quest.  Of course, it's been (4) hours so steam isn't willing to refund my purchase and I see no reason to keep playing on a game that feels more like a free game than a ""good"" game!"
Negative,stuck in requesting character load Screen. Dont buy the game till they fix the bug. I havent been able to play a single min of this game. still trying load my character. (Still Having problem with their game connection. now i am playing using vpn) They should fix their server.
Negative,"Since the opponents are scaled to your character, you can always beat any monster at any level.  The game is bland and boring.Even though you buy the game, you have to pay for a subscription if you want inventory space."
Negative,"This game is okay. Oftentimes the animations feel a little clunky, but the game itself is not bad... The problem comes in with the true costs of this game. Sure, you can buy the base game, but then if you want to explore the full game, you're looking at a LOT of money. $40 for the expansion, $15-20 for each DLC, plus if you want to actually be able to enjoy the game, you have NO choice but to get a subscription because the inventory system is beyond limited without having the Crafting Bag which is locked behind another $15 a month.TL;DR: The game isn't worth the massive costs you'll wind up paying for it in order to enjoy it."
Negative,"Don't buy this game, it does NOT come with a working installer/patcher program app. After two fruitlrss days of trying to find a working patcher, I give up. This NOT worth it."
Negative,"You have to pay for dungeons individually, or subscribe to unlock them all (even if you buy the ""expansions""). Garbage AF."
Negative,Fuck this game its trash
Negative,I can safely say just don't get the game it's honestly trash now.
Negative,I HATE YOU JAYMES
Negative,"Don't buy this game, even if on sale. I've currently spent more time stuck on ""Requesting Character Load"" on the character select screen than I have actually questing and learning the game. There's no fix for it and it's truly a marvel that they can even sell this product while things like this exist with it. Edit (27/6/21): This game now refuses to boot the launcher when I press play on steam."
Negative,"So I bought this game incl. Summerset pre-purchase in package for 80 EUR, not a small amount, only to spend the first day downloading it, then spending another day waiting for the maintenance to be over (which took the most of the day in Europe) and then downloading it again (!) after the Summerset patch (that was yesterday) and today, when I was finally looking forward to enjoy an evening playing the game, they have another technical issue and I cannot log in, the support say ""be patient, we are investigating"". So after three days, I literally managed to get three, maybe four hours of playtime? This is utter failure. I was expecting that the game would at least, you know, work..."
Negative,"waste of time and money customer service sucks and game play is very limiting. all they do to keep players hooked on the game is come out with expansions without making any real gameplay changes (aside from that failed attempt of a class they called the ""warden"" that the company made a big deal over) to combat skills or even relivent game play mechanics. even the skill system is broken. This is an over all pay to win game. If you don't have time to level up and grind you get left behind as a player and when a DLC hits it almost forces you to buy a membership for free DLC or pay even more money to buy it anyways and just have more in gamestore currency a.k.a ""crowns"" because you didn't buy a membership. Like I said if you don't buy the DLC you eventually become errelivant as a player. This whole free membership thing is a huge lie because of this.This is my personal opinion buy it don't buy it, just sending out a warning..."
Negative,"The game is very buggy, does not work with dynamic IPs, patching mechanism is outdated and technical support are just outsourced script monkeys that can only copy and paste, which still takes days to answer.Stay clear from this mess."
Negative,"Sadly, despite me having more than 600 hours, I cannot recommend ESO to many people, the game suffers from a multitude of problems, most of which are caused by an incredibile amount of greed and general hostility towards the playerbase. Why does it take MONTHS of waiting for crafting research to finish? Because you can buy instant research scrolls with real money. Why is my inventory so limited while i need hundreds of different items to craft stuff? Because you can get an infinite inventory bag if you pay for eso+. Why do I have to PRAY that quests (sometimes even main ones) do not bug out because i DARED to do them with a friend in my group? Because this is a Bethesda game, managed by incompetent people. Combat can be seriously lackluster, with most of the game being laughably easy (most normal quests can be done with no gear equipped no problem lol). There are hundreds of sets but most of them are trash which no one will ever use, and when you do want a new set, get ready to repeat a dungeon tens of times while HOPING to get the weapon or ring you wanted, and also be ready to spend hard earned crystals to change it's trait, because 90% of the traits are useless and you don't want them. So, why do I have so many hours in this? The worst part about ESO is also it's best, it's extremely simple, so you can use this game to introduce other people to mmos and generally have fun exploring a nice, really colorful and diverse world, full of cute animals, nice vistas and interesting locales, while accompanied by really nice music. It's clear that there's potential for an amazing game here, but that's not what developers are hoping to achieve, they're aiming for the game that makes the most amount of money and treats its players like slaves. Don't give them money, don't buy crowns, unless you got a friend who never tried an mmo to play with, skip this one."
Negative,Just buy Skyrim so you have something pleasing to do.
Negative,"I bought the game, played 40 h and waited to play 60 h so I recommend it. Manifest, manifest ooo next manifest. I recommend servers, graphics and max boring running quest."
Negative,"Paid $25 to hit a paywall. Just play Skyrim instead, you'll get a richer experience than ESO even with a minimal amount of mods"
Negative,"Pretty boring, vanilla MMO with some elements from the elder scrolls series."
Negative,game is broken and getting worse day by day
Negative,Playing second fiddle. steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2062711152
Negative,"I bought this game on the 23rd of August 2017 with the intentions to dive into a new world with lots of fun and hours of entertainment. What I got instead were endless errors, crashes, glitches and lag in the game itself. I'd try to fight NPC's and the game would come to a standstill where although I could move around, everyone else was as still as a statue. Then about 30 seconds later, it would boot me out of the game. It is absolutely unplayable. Although I somehow got to play 2.5 hours worth of gameplay yesterday without issue, all day today was a whirlwind of errors telling me my ""internet connection isn't valid"" or ""connection to the server has been lost, try again later."" I have good bandwidth and that is not the issue, not in the slightest.I wouldn't recommend getting this game until it is completely fixed up as it was beyond frustrating watching it kick me out of the servers. Very pretty game, the soundtrack is lovely, but for playability? You won't get very far."
Negative,"Do NOT buy this game, the interaction between your Steam account and the ESO account is really messed up. I bought this years ago and still can't play it from my Steam account. Just buy it directly from the company if you want to get this game."
Negative,"The combat system is a complete disaster. Stay away from this game.This is how I have experienced combat in ESO, in no particular order:1. The game interface is designed for consoles. One can therefore not make good use of the buttons that are available on a PC keyboard and an MMO mouse. Even the quite similar interface in Guild Wars 2 is in my opinion far superior to the interface in ESO.2. In MMOs in general, combat often consist of a system of builders and spenders. You use certain abilities to build resources and then you spend the resources with other abilities. However, in ESO the main builder is light attacks done by aiming at the boss and then clicking quickly on your mouse's left button. Overall, this attack does so much damage that all players are forced to click on the left mouse button for every second thing that they do, all day long. This is extremely tedious.3. Lag or maybe just lack of responsiveness means that even though I am clearly pointing straight at an enemy npc and do my light attack, then it is not registered. I often have to point at an npc and click multiple times, before the light attack is registered. Worse, this also happens when I have to interrupt an enemy spell cast. Standard interrupting is a melee action, which is just plain stupid if you are a ranged spell caster. It is done by light attacking while blocking (clicking on both your left and right mouse buttons at the same time). Sometimes, even when I am standing right besides the npc that I want to interrupt and there are no other npc nearby I still fail to interrupt, but it works the second or third time that I do it, using the exact same button presses. On a PC, it should clearly be possible to map this ability to a button on the keyboard.4. Tab-targeting is not as easy and effective as for example in World of Warcraft. The following quote is from a forum post by @jypcy: “It's a slight and vague enhancement of the standard targeting. You can hit a target behind another, but only sometimes. Often you'll still hit whatever's closest, but it does widen the window of opportunity a bit on your preferred target. It seems to work better once in-combat, vs before opening combat. The clearest difference I could see is being able to target one enemy when others were super close together. Further apart, it's harder to notice the benefits.”5. ESO uses a first-person shooter aim-and-shoot interface, while hit boxes, in general, are small. One must therefore aim at the enemy npc's stomach. Dungeon and raid bosses are, however, as tall in ESO as they are in other MMOs. In a particular dungeon boss fight, the boss's only mechanic is that it puts fire on the ground underneath every players, over and over again. The boss is so tall that one must aim the camera in an upwards angel in order to aim at the boss's stomach. While one does this, the boss puts fire on the ground beneath the player. With the camera in an upward angle, one cannot see the fire on the ground and one must therefore quickly aim the camera down at the floor. However, one must also make certain that one is standing in the right side of the room, so one must also zoom out to see the entire floor. This means that one over and over again, very quickly must: aim the camera up, find the boss, zoom in, fire off an attack, aim the camera down, zoom out, move to another location. The flickering on the screen caused by the constant movement of the camera makes this boss fight a mental health hazard.6. In Word of Warcraft, raid encounters are made more difficult by adding more mechanics to the fight. Players must, for example, run to the edge of the room to drop fire on the ground, while other players are stacking to soak a mechanic and at the same time avoiding beams coming out from the boss. In ESO, the main way that developers of trial encounters make fights more difficult is by stunning players repeatedly. This is just lazy game design.7. There is a severe lack of class identity in ESO. You have complete freedom to put together spells and abilities obtained from multiple different sources. This freedom, however, leads to different classes being nearly identical, since all players want to use the abilities that currently have been tuned to do the most damage. In World of Warcraft, a raid leader might say: we need two warlocks for this fight. In ESO, there is hardly any difference between different dps characters, except that some use stamina and others use magicka."
Negative,"There's really only one word I can use to describe this game. Meh. It's not great. It's not awful. It's just mediocre. The combat is fine, the world building is fine, the questing is fine, the characters are fine, the loot is fine, it's all just...fine. With better MMO's out there (Guild Wars 2) there's really no point spending any amount of money on it. If it was free to play, maybe, but $20 for just...fine? Naw. Just pass."
Negative,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME ON STEAM!It might be a decent game, the roomates sure love it. But for the love of god do not buy it through steam. Steam and the game just do not seem to get along, and I have been stuck for a month unable to log in, which is apparantly a common issue specifically with the steam client. And customer service for the game is the most horrendous I have ever seen, three weeks and still no help.Considering the game has a standalone PC client through the website or console options there is no reason to get it through steam.----After two months of struggling with customer service, the only solution was to delete my profile and start from scratch to fix the bugged account. On one hand I never got to play so I had nothing to lose, on the other hand it took two months to get into the game.The game its self is decent, its a step above your typical MMO and has ALMOST action based combat. It has dodge rolls and what not, but it sits somewhere between action and typical MMO combat. If you are a diehard fan of the series you will love the world, its fun to play with friends, but ultimately it is just another MMO with all the drawbacks of the Genere. Regardless if you like MMOs, or Elderscrolls it is worth it, although I would wait for a sale. BUT DO NOT BUY IT ON STEAM! Either get the standalone PC version, or the console version."
Negative,"Hard for beginner, must learn a lot."
Negative,Buy The Elder Scrolls Online Standard EditionNiceMonths laterBuy The Elder Scrolls Online Standard EditionIncludes The Elder Scrolls Online base game and !The Morrowind Chapter!Fuuuudge
Negative,Every animation is cancellable to a point where it's become the meta.
Negative,THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME.I CANT EVEN ENTER IT.IM STUCKED IN LOADING IN LAUNCHER.AND I DO ALL THE FIREWALL THING AND ALOT OF OTHER THINGS BUT ITS NOT WORKING.DONT WASTE YOUR MONY ON THIS GAME PLEASE
Negative,"There are way better MMOs out there and way better Elder Scrolls games. If you are desperate for a combination of the two then yes, this exists."
Negative,"Got hacked and hacker used my account for gold farming. Reclaimed account, got banned for actions of the hacker. Spend your money elsewhere"
Negative,Loved playing this on GeForce Now then Bethesda made Nvidia take the game down because they're greedy corporate stooges. I hope Bethesda goes out of business along with Activision and EA. They are all crap companies that just want more money rather than to make their customers happy. Never giving Bethesda another dime.
Negative,"This game gave me cancer, thought i was going to play The elder scrolls, the world that I once saw in oblivion and morrowind. It just keeps getting worst, if i wanted to play a MMO with clans and similar abilities I would have gone to Guild Wars 2; atleast it's free and doesn't shove products into your face. 2/10 Still the elder scrolls, without the fantasy you thought it would have."
Negative,"Fun with friends, abhorredly boring alone. The game itself though, to make it short, had many pluses along with a greater presence of downsides:Nice visually, cool skill tree, diverse builds ect.But the amount of glitchy and impossible to overlook broken mechanics were enough of a pull back to consistantly spice that sour taste in your mouth right when things almost feel fun.The inventory system - FuckedThe exponential scaling of upgrades - FuckedThe ever apparent money grubbing schemes - Apparent and fuckedAnd for god sake, the motherfucking law system - Absoultely disgustingly fucked.6/10"
Negative,Level scaling ruined the experience.
Negative,This game is weird.
Negative,Very hot game. Love sucking dragon dick. I haven't seen any dragons in it though but I'm sure they are there somewhere.
Negative,as of this new patch they have pretty much shit on old players and geared towards new players just to make more money
Negative,Feels very dry and fake. Not worth all the storage to play this.
Negative,"I really wish there was an ok button for reviews. The game is solid, the gameplay loop is good, the quests can be really interesting and I really like how it plays. HoweverThe money you need to constantly stay up to date and actually be able to play this game with other people is insane, I bought this game on release. Now people can get the base game that I have, and most of the early expansions for less than what I bought the base game for back when this came out. But new expansions can cost almost the same amount. I really cant justifiy purchasing any expansions at this point."
Negative,"This game got a lot of contents that you can do, but the trouble of launching the game is weighing heavily over the good parts of this. After every patch they release, you will get constantly stuck on the loading screen from 1 minute to almost an hour. Restarting the game/launcher does not help, and you will end up resorting to google to find solution that are posted from 2019 all the way back to 2016. If that doesn't convince you not to get this game, then go look at the posts written by other players."
Negative,"While playing solo, there are a lot of fully dubbed questlines which can be interesting (especially DLC content of course), but it starts to be boring very quickly because of the repetitive gameplay. Skill lines may seem to be interestic, but most of skills are boring and ugly.Talking about co-op, I'm usually a big fan of playing as a healer in PvE initiatives, like dungeons, raids etc. I was incredibly dissapointed how easy and boring the dungeons are. They require no strategy, no tactics, just everyone rushing and clicking buttons."
Negative,"Classic money-grab RPG. Everything is paywall and time gated. Or limited inventory so you can pay for upgrades. A lot of mechanics feel pretty clunky, unfinished, or just bad. There's too many mechanics and skills with too few explanations. Also the game has been really glitchy both for me and my friends trying to get it to start up. We played together at the start for about 5 hours and he hasn't been able to get it to run since (and I believe his PC is within the spec reqs). That being said, there's some admirable features too. The map is huge, pretty cool terrains, I haven't gotten much into the story yet but I hear its pretty good. Seems plausible so far. Overall I'd give a 4.5 or 5 out of 10."
Negative,"The buggiest big brand game I have seen in a long time. Every 2 hrs your game will crash atleast once. Apart from that there are game breaking bugs like unable to get out of places, stuck in combat bug. You will have deliberately crash your game to fix it. And please remember. More than 25% percent of the in-game content is microtransaction based. So even if you buy this game you are just buying a part of it. Sometimes it feels like you are playing a demo version of the game. Just played for 2 weeks and I am fed up. Some days you cant even log in to the game."
Negative,Can't even play the game. DOA right from install. Very disappointing! Server time out error constantly.
Negative,"come for the elder scrolls, stay for the friends you make."
Negative,its really a let down. people say pvp is good but you can hardly see any players and not much people play this game
Negative,Down loaded game three times and still get error message 210. Nothing much I can do but a stop payment. I have seen that a lot of others have had problems too.
Negative,TRASH - THE ADMIN BOTS WILL AUTO SUSPEND YOU ANY TIME SOMEONE REPORTS YOU - FOR NOTHING!
Negative,"I enjoyed some parts of the game like the PVP and faction wars, but the quests were repetitive and the story was boring and generic. Also if you are into the TES lore this game will not be enjoyable."
Negative,Save your self the money and don’t buy this it is no elder scrolls 5. DND online is way better then this. It’s just overall boring and the dialogue is bad also they fighting style stinks. Graphics are also bad!
Negative,"Everywhere I go, everything I see... I see a resemblance of Skyrim. But it's not Skyrim. Maybe my expectations are wrong, but I can't help it.If Skyrim was Quality, ESO is Quantity.If you expect Skyrim, you will be disappointed. That was my mistake. Very good MMO though, lots of content. But not a fan of MMOs I guess."
Negative,"I have tried a couple characters on this but i just can't get into it. the story is not as good as previous ES games. PvP and group dungeons are a joke. Since playing morrowind for the first time, i always thought ""oh man, this would be awesome playing with other people!"" Yet somehow, its just not. sure you can ride a bear but you can't ride it into battle. so 4/10"
Negative,Not sure if i just bought this game for no reason ive spent the last 3 hours trying to get the game to even work it crashes on start up the website wont let me reset my password i cant do anything with this game
Negative,ehhh wish they had cross progression so i dont have to grind 2000cp again
Negative,Ever since the One Tamriel Update I just can't seem to stay interested in this game. I like challenging over-world content/questing and the scaling of all the world took that away.  Every time I try to come back and enjoy questing I just get burned out because you can basically default attack the whole world. This will probably be my final attempt for awhile unless they offer some kind of alternate over-world that is more challenging. ESO is just not for me anymore. Can't recommend as of now.🤡 Go play GW2 instead. It has everything ESO does and a less predatory monetization system (Example of a predatory system - Time Gating and selling you the quicker solution - Takes 6 months to fully train your mount or you can spend $180 to get it). Plus you don't have to subscribe. 🤡
Negative,"If I ever am able to get into the game, I may end up changing my opinion. As it is now, I have five hours of playtime in a game that I can't even get to install/patch and launch properly.UPDATE: Having discovered the issue, being two corrupt files eso076 and eso0130, deleting, repairing, etc, we have finally made it into the game. And it is actually fairly enjoyable. Not a 'traditional' Elder Scrolls experience, but I do feel that it keep the essence of the game in this that I enjoyed. I feel like the issues I had with installation are fairly common, and I hope they do get that fixed, because I feel like it discourages people from otherwise enjoying a decently well made game. I look forward to playing this more."
Negative,"There are two reasons why I donlt recommend. First my buddy and I really wanted to play skyrim together since we can't do that we bought elder scrolls online recently as we heard its gotten a lot better. However there is a small problem.... quests in a group suuuucks its ridiculous!!!!!! And its too easy. you can be in a ""Group"" but your not really in a group. You can't share quests, and again the game is too dang easy. Save your money unless you want to pay solo. If you want to play with friends look at another game. Real shame as this had real potential.I mean its a mmo...... I love how your making it not a traditional mmo great call but if im grouped with a freaking friend let us be in a group! et us do things TOGETHER! I am quite irritated....."

AS I WAS TRYING TO SAY, I HATE NIGGERS, BUT TESO IS PRETTY OK"
Negative,Plagued with micro transactions. Great game but the micro tramsactions are what bring this game down.
Negative,"Kind of too easy, and it's not fun to be the Nerevar or the Dragonborn when there's 500 of them running around, clogging up the dungeons. Maybe worth playing with about five or ten of your friends. If you really need that ES fix, wait til it's on sale."
Negative,"I love the Elder Scrolls, and I really wanted to like this game, but this game is wayyyy too easy, and playing it feels mindless. Combat feels shallow and isn't much fun. There isn't anything in regard to armor or weapons to look forward to because the game just lets you put the skin of whichever gear you like over what your actually wearing/wielding even if you don't have it, so it doesn't feel fun to find or try to get loot.  Just about the only redeeming quality of this game is you get to explore all of Tamriel with some pretty impressive graphics, but that doesn't make up for how boring it is to quest or do pretty much anything in this game."
Negative,Crashes on launch without an error message. Absolutely do not buy or spend money on this. Its a known issue and they haven't fixed it.
Negative,"Not until they add Asian Server.. (which will not gonna happen, trust me)"
Negative,Man if you thought modern WoW class design was bad just wait until you try this one.
Negative,"Game constantly crashes, tried 3 reinstalls, using a pc linked account. Used an old character.. crashed... started a new character.. crashed.. totally useless.Shame really."
Negative,"Fetch, Fetch, Fetch. The time & effort that went into this could have been better spent making Elder scrolls 6. A very dull game."
Negative,If you are a fan of small scale pvp battlegrounds are fun but the better you get the less you're able to play bc of their ranking system. They only match you with the same people and sometimes the queue takes 20 mins only to fight the exact same people. Queues are broken.
Negative,"It worked at first but then a update hit and it forever loads then hits me with at ""error login"" code and i've gone through several forums doing as they ask to no avail. sucks i was liking the game. I have also reinstalled the game 3-4 times with no luck. This kind of stuff seems unacceptable at this point in gaming."
Negative,"Good Morning,UPDATE AFTER COUPLE OF MONTHS- STILL SAME SH*T ZANIMAX,BETHESDA AND STEAM DID NOTHING TO MAKE PRODUCT WORK!!!I want play ESO on same machine, same setup, same system like in past. (when product worked) But Launcher still not works!!!BETHESDA PUTS DIRECT SH*T ON HEAD OF PLAYERS !!!I dont wanna buy or play any of their product in future! BYE BYE BETHESDA MILKCOWS! (in year 2023 not working launcher? Amateurs....)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I played ESO little bit in past. After a long time, I decided to play it again.But hey ESO Laucher gives me creeps. I start up ESO and launcher gives ERROR!!! (self-updating error something)After this it goes second error....unnable to load item list :/  (os something like that)Then its stuck so far with loading screen.(launch ESO directly helps but since I have steam acc I need to log in through steam ESO launcher.)Read some tips on net, but nothing helped so far. :/I received game from my friend, but still...IF YOU CONSIDER PURCHASE, PRODUCT MAY NOT WORK !!!(If you do not want play only through bethesda acc and launch game directly without launcher)-IF DEVS FIX THIS, I CHANGE MY REVIEW. (omg every ,,crap´´ game have totally ok launcher and game title like ESO not work properly, like....really? DAMN!)"
Negative,"An NPC in game asks me everyday to buy lootboxes:After buying the game and buying expansions and dlc, you're also very recommended to subscribe or you will spend most of your time organising your inventory. On top of that the game is Pay to Win since you can now sell your crowns per gold and buy anything you want or pay for clear runs. Crafting follows a mobile game mecanic where the more cash you spend the faster you ""research"" something"
Negative,"The easiest and laziest MMO I've ever played. Requires absolutely no skill or even thought to win every fight. Pick ANY move and you can kill ANY monster just by spamming it. Its ""press any button to win"" for as long as you can bear to play it. And the quests? A complete joke. Every single mission is being told to walk 50 feet away and collect something. The ancient artifacts that haven't been seen in an era? Just 50 feet away from wherever the quest giver happens to be. The kidnapped soldier who needs rescuing? You can literally see him from where you got the mission. Fight everything or sneak past every monster - it doesnt matter. Everything will be too easy to beat regardless if youre level 1 or 100. It makes no difference. None of the rewards matter because theres literally nothing to buy. Whether the quest giver gives you 50 gold or a million it wont matter one bit because theres nothing for sale anywhere, except health potions you wont need because someone with no hands could play this and struggle to die even once. At best its a scenic journey through Tamriel."
Negative,Must not be my cup of tea to do meaningless fetch quest all the time.
Negative,Complete opposite of why people play elder scrolls games
Negative,"terrible lags, support is unhelpfull/unresponsive"
Negative,"The Elder Scrolls Online game should be called ""the fix and trouble shoot daily game""  I mean how can you mess up a patch so bad that people have to spend hours and hours to fix their game that they are paying to play. I Have been playing for two years and after this patch I couldn't get it to run, not going to mess with it anymore after ten days of tec do nothing support . Everyone knows it's either ESO or STEAMS fault that the game isn't working right but they are both blaming each other."
Negative,"Enjoyed this game couple years ago. Was gonna install it again, but the ridiculous patch sizes made me switch my opinion on reinstalling... a whopping 25GB patch is something I will NOT tolerate. Maybe time to update the whole blasted game perhaps, instead of patching over another patch? Something maybe to think about Zenimax?"
Negative,"Huge fan of the Elders scroll and fed up waiting a good medieval rpg game (no more Witchers,  no more elder scroll, a neverending baldur gate 3 in beta access, exit Dungeon keeper, exit HOMM... what a decade ;( So I thought it was about time to try out this Elder scroll MMO... After a couple of hours within the Morrowind landscape I was extatic. Some music were back there, the atmosphere was kind of there, the dungeon crawling looks promising but then .. then my friends, the MMO effect kicks in and destroyed everything: this Disneyland ""get in the line please"" kind of feeling, an example: I kick the ass of 3 bandits, I was contemplating my skill choices when they literraly resurrected under me and started attacking me again ... OH COME ON !!! Hate this... GIVE ME MY ELDER's SCROLL 6 BACK !!!!"
Negative,"Paid game with paywalls...If it was a Free To Play I'd understand the ammount of micro transactions and paywalls.Craftbag is monthly subscription only, and they purposedly make you struggle with inventory space. Buying inventory / bank slots 1 at a time or paying $10-15 for 5 :ccskull:Yes, I know, they need the money to pay the staff...but I've just have enough with these business models.Im thankful for the free trial, cos it would have been disappointing to know all that after paying full price just for a base game."
Negative,"I haven't been playing the game that long - about a month, but the game ran okay on medium to high graphics settings, and the quests were mildly interesting and the PVE elements were good. Overall I didn't feel the game was really worth the money but it was playable, had variety and as a fan of Skyrim it was nice to revisit the lore and explore tamriel.After the February 11, 2019 patch/update, I had trouble logging in for hours after maintenance happened; so I clicked the launcher's repair button and tried the game. Presently the game barely runs on the lowest graphics setting, it freezes every 3 seconds, frames crawl by every other second, it crashed my computer at one point and PVE has become almost impossible even against the weakest mobs. I'm disappointed with whichever team runs maintenance on this game."
Negative,"Boring Combat: Stale, clunky and boring animations. You are forced to do light/ heavy attack to sustain stamina which makes the combat longer. You can say that this is just a ""part of the rotation"" but it doesn't feel good at all standing still like a rock while poking enemies with different sticks and traps.Limited freedom in playing a role: The shitty trinity of Tank, Healer and Dps. Hybrid build will get your ass kicked out of  parties in dungeons because it is not effective. You are either forced to be a Tank that just taunt->walk a bit->activate defensive skill-> taunt; Dps which is fine but you will be forced to wait 2 hours in queue because almost players wants to play dps or try being a fake tank and then get kicked out when they see you only have 12k health; Healer is fine but honestly why pick a healer though unless you are already bored of playing dps/ tank.Ugly fucking armors: What's with this flushed out rusted pieces of shit like you just wear pancakes and fishscales as breastplates. Even the new motifs/ cash armors looks stupidly low-res, crispy, boring and uninspired designs doesn't even help when you dye it and does not feel rewarding. Concept art looks good but when you see the models in the game it looks like it is gnawed and spitted out by a dragon making it ugly-fugly pieces of bra straps.Toxic community: Healers blaming dps for dying quickly while they themselves doesn't keep their heal uptimes good because they also want to dps. Dps blaming healers for not being able to heal properly while they themselves doesn't know when to dodge and gets carried away too much in doing damage. Tanks are...just tanks. This is only the pve side. Pvp on the other hand get ready for the ""gitgud"" and ""ggez"" everytime they kill you. All of this are my opinion only and subjective but fuck those ugly armors and polymorphs."
Negative,"I paid money and cleared the computer space for this game, yet it demands more space when i upload the launcher.I wrote steam a message via email and if they don't reply by february, i'm going to ask for a refund. I have searched high and low for solutions, yet I still turned up empty handed.I do not recommend the game unless you have a LOT of space on your computer or until this ""bug "" is fixed.Thank you for reading!"
Negative,Do not have chinese.
Negative,"Honestly pretty boring, hard to play with friends"
Negative,Mediocre. Unpolished. Meh.
Negative,I cant even get into the game
Negative,"If you are looking for something like Skyrim, this is not a good continuation. This is like a Lineage or something like that. Quests are really boring and that sense of discovery in the previous game isn't present. Sadly, it's monotone."
Negative,"The game has a great story, absolutely loved the story.  The down side is everything else.  Connection issues about twice an hour where you get kicked.  I had 3 main quests in DC that could not be completed due to bugs.  The events they hold are not thought out at all.  Even when  the same events have the same issues that never get fixed.  Save you money, save your time and save your disappointment for something else, this just isn't worth it.  Just way to many technical issues to let pass."
Negative,"If you love Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim, skip this. It is not remotely similar. This seems to be a very poor version of a WOW type of game. You can not make progress unless you have friends that you meet online, team up with, and complete quests together. Anything you ""kill"" will regenerate in a few minutes. IDK about you, but when I kill a bad guy, I want him to stay that way. It is so unrealistic! Very sad, because my favorite race to play is Khajit. I was looking forward to a world of them. :( Boo"
Negative,"The NPC voice-acting & quest variety are pretty good, but the combat is a clunky tab-target system that tries to disguise itself as a classic Elder Scrolls action-combat system.You're much better off playing any of the single-player Elder Scrolls games, or one of many other MMO's."
Negative,Game play wasn't even good enough to get me excited to play. Slow story line which you have to follow if you make the mistake of wanting to know about the game before to go into the world. Graphics are okay. Movement and combat felt like I was in a game from the early 2000. Over all with the pain it was to get this to down load it wasn't worth the trouble. I am sure the people that like this series it was a game they looked foward too.  I have played the others and they were better than this. So I give this game a 4 out of a possible 10.
Negative,"The game where you can live a life from selling you're real money and viceversa. The hackers, bots, gold sellers, bug addicts can enjoy game with no life bans, but the ones who speak their voice for all the bs of the players need solve, ignore and ban.   The only thing real is the comunity, you cool, you buy  all their boxes, good boys!"
Negative,"Massive bug i cant even open it, i played for a few months, insane game so great would recommend, but now its fucked and im so miserable."
Negative,Why do I have to use a launcher to download updates instead of just downloading the updates on steam.  Wasting my damn time.
Negative,"Shameless cash grab.A pay to win, that you have to pay to play. Far to grindy with way to few rewards to show for it.Not worth it, Avoid."
Negative,If you want to get max level and gear up(usually that s where the fun starts) you need to have all the expansions and dlc's in order to have acces to the gear you require:(That's a bummer
Negative,so complicated for me
Negative,"Poor UI. Built-in map and compas are absolute trash and no minimap. Almost zero coop functionality for first 3 hours of play. Kinda, boring despite being a MMORPG with story line"
Negative,"I love this game and will still continue to play it, but, WOW the micro-transactions are annoying. It starts to feel more like an EA game rather than a Bethesda game after playing for a while. Game: ""What's that? You want to buy a pretty nice house? Ok, thats only 8,000 crowns."" Me: ""Oh, I wonder how much that costs in real life money, it shouldn't be that much, maybe 15 dollars or so."" Nope, its $99.99 US dollars. Honestly....."
Negative,"The game is Meh, there is no better way to describe it, it's subpar. Subpar combat, subpar armor and weapons. The world is nice but that's the only beautiful part of the game. uite frankly there are better MMO's out there that give you this and more; Guild Wars 2 for example, far superiour in every aspect. Including the story.Don't even get this to try it, installing and patching the game takes 4 hours  at the very least and with the 2 hour refund you're pretty much screwed if you try to get one after (Yes the launcher counts as hours played.) I've tried with steam and they didn't want to help and the official company couldn't either due to me buying it through Steam. Even if you DO want to try it don't get it through Steam, buy it from Bethesda directly. I believed the reviews of ""Oh there's so much more now"" and I don't knw how bad it was at launch, I do know it was very much negatively recieved but this is just boring. All the peoples doubts are true, in my mind of how poor this game performed even with all the potential it could of had wit the Elder Scrolls IP. Then again of course the people who have had it at first will have a more positive view of the game if they compare it to before but comparing it to other MMO's it's meh to bellow meh.My suggestion, don't buy it. If you do, do it through Bethesda so that if you want a refund you have a better chance."
Negative,I guess its a TES game. Its pretty boring though. Stick with the real ES games and just mod them. Youll have a lot more fun.
Negative,"i thought it will be exciting but since first 5 min in the game it become so boring like killing , if i tried it after i got it directly i would ask for refund for sure."
Negative,no aus servers. sad face.
Negative,I gave it a try on the free weekend. The game has extreme loading times every once in a while and it crashed three times when I tried to adjust my settings not to run like a powerpoint each time multiple human players are around...
Negative,"The add-on part of this game sucks big time.  I really need a  basic (BASIC FROM SCRATCH) on how to install add-ons AND without using MINIONS (which also sucks).  Besides from the add-ons issue, the game is cool.  BUT, the standard interface without a minimap is REALLY uncool."
Negative,"I associate the elder scrolls games with a sense of adventure and intuitive combat. Unique feeling races, and the ability to be any class and use any skills you desire. This game has none of those things. One of my favorite parts of the Elder Scrolls games is the bow physics. This game doesn't even have that, it's an autolock system and the arrows will fly through walls and terrain.With the class system and the hold button to fight system It feels like any other MMORPG; WoW, GW2, etc. All pretty interchangable with this. And more worth your time, and money. This game may be only 10$ on sale, but then if I wanted to play certain races with my friends I have to pay more. If I want a mount in less than 20 hours of play, more money. Want certain classes? more money. As far as I'm concerned, if content is behind a paywall, there's better MMORPGs out there.I origonally bought this game to test it out, what I didn't realize is it would take 11 hours to patch. If you're not sure if you want this game, do not buy it, because you'll never be under the 2 hour refund limit."
Negative,"I have only 9 hours, but hear me out. So today, I Woke up, thought, ""hey it's a great day to play elder scrolls online!"" So I went on, and my antivirus decided to start blocking it... I was like ""Hmm... okay this is interesting"" So I decided to take the time, go on the forums, and allow it to repair its self, sure as hell, what happens? That's right! It downloads again and gives me a virus that looks like this *Virus* I should say first off C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steamapps\cmmon\Zenimax Online\Launcher\Bethesda.net_Launcher.exe Yes that is the ""Virus"" that your anti-virus will detect and force you to remove it or you can allow it to continue to be like that, so after repairing and allowing it, it crashed while updating, restarted computer crashed, rinse repeat until 5 crashes later I refunded it. If you want to play a crash simulator, you have found it, other then that, great game on console though, can't play it on PC for dick, unless of course, you have no anti-virus or you disabled your anti virus, which then you are full blown dumb, and you never go full blown dumb.10/10 best Crash SImulator 2016 ~ IGN"
Negative,"To make this game enjoyable you need the crafting bag however you have to pay for it which is absurd when ive spend over 200 dollars for all the dlcs and extras and i still CANT play as you run out of room and NEED crafting bag to play. It is a dumbed down version of skyrim with less skills and you can tell it was made for console as it is a dumbed down version. They should have never gone online and stuck with the old SUCCESSFUL recipe of single player only like the previous elder scrolls serious. A shame they have destroyed this game making it pay to winRNG in maelstrom arena is even worse than that of Path of Exile which is a joke, 40 runs and keep getting the same loot out of the large loot table come on guys you need to fix the rng or allow another way to earn the lootUpdated: Collision detection is comical, you cannot fluently climb up walls or jump over things on the first go and in several dungeons as soon as you enter and you walk straight into a ditch and have to tele out of map as you are stuck. You cannot attack on horseback and you constantly get dismounted when you enter water or walk under archways, last time I checked horses could traverse water. Combat is illogical and clunky, graphics engine outdated, multiplayer is a joke, queues take forever and you get people queueing in the wrong dungeons either they are too low level or have chosen fake roles and if you leave to find another dungeon queue you get penalised for 15 mins and cannot queue. This game should have never gone multiplayer and instead of fixing game play they focus on money making via transactions via cosmetics and useless stuff. Let’s just hope Elder Scrolls 6 goes back to roots of single player, Skyrim was successful for a reason, choice of many skills is a must and do not go back to 5 abilities, forced to use a class system, multiplayer and dumbed down for console or the future of Elder Scrolls is over.Updated 2:Why do you keep releasing new same old useless content seriously put this game to sleep already and move one its dead, outdated and dumbed down for console to cover more players to make more sales and money and lost its essence and nothing like any of the previous successful elder scrolls series have been thanks due to deciding to go multiplayer when these games are meant to be single player, focusing on sales and covering a wider audience and in the process sacrificing the essence of elder scrolls games and this is what happens when Microsoft buys out everyone, we have to accept garbage games and pay higher prices for less! Let’s hope they learnt their lesson for elder scrolls 6 so stop realising garbage for a dead game focus resources on elder scrolls 6 and for the record I only come on for the daily rewards this game is not fun and unplayable without crafting bag and I refuse to play it properly until they release crafting bag to all players."
Negative,"Money and profit bought the game unaware of a required monthly subscription after buying it but even after learning that still seems like money is more important than anything in this crooked corrupt money hungry country or worldwide, nobody will like this review because it don't conform to the marketed policies to support profits"
Negative,"after spending 500 hours its not worth your money. it's pay to win in order for you to craft jewelries you have to subscribe to their ESO+ membership which will give you access to some of their DLCs including the new ones -  it's not bad, what is bad is that crafting should be enjoyed by any player even those who are not subscribed to ESO+.inventory is also a mess. you will not survive with this game without subscribing to ESO+. pay to win? yes.story is good and the gameplay is good don't get me wrong, but when you reach CP, it becomes more and more repetitive."
Negative,Big pile of turd.  Carry on
Negative,">download the game through>open the game>3h long in game download>play 1h>try to refund> ""you cant refund, you played more then 2 hours"""
Negative,bored me to tears aftr only 7 hours of gameplay.  Many said it could not be compared to skyrim but i disagree.  Skyrim is fun this isnt.
Negative,"-vanilla skyrim with online interaction-the mmo part of this game is garbage at best, stating there's no trinity system But asked you to queue for specific role in dungeon(tank/healer/dps) and heavily relies on tank/healer. or perhaps u prefer pvp? sure get ur ass kicked by lv.600 player that is no fun at all.if you want to play mmo with classic trinity system there're Rift, wowif you prefer non trinity there's gw2 (edit: gw2 is equally garbage now they're forcing ppl to use cc on mob )listed a few games here for ur consideration not because they're better but because they're less garbage than this game, some are even f2p. if you got some good mmo and enjoyed playing it plz share it in comments section so I can try them out. have a nice day"
Negative,"If they would have stuck to the theme they originally released the game around during beta and the first year of release, maintaining focus on the three faction war in Cyrodiil, while maintaining quality performance and balance of the classes and sets as they come up with new content.  Instead the developers thought it would be better to water down the combat and turn the ""MMO"" into a housing simulator with minimal interaction.  This game's time to thrive is long gone, similar to the way Activision Blizzard sustains itself off the nostalgia and deep lore of the titles at it's old foundations, ESO and zenimax are essentially doing the same thing.  Pushing a watered down and dull product that feeds off the nostalgia and intrigue of older and newer consumers like a leech in these stagnant waters that are the AAA gaming market.  Just go support Larian."
Negative,"I've been playing this game since last spring (2016), and it worked fine until the update that nullified levels. Now you can play just long enough to get hooked before the serious server lagging starts and you eventually get logged off or booted.To play so much, with or without Eso membership and extras, and end up with a game that barely works is quite vexing. Seriously, there is a problem when a game like Wizard 101 works better then this one.Besides the obvious technical problems, the game has beautiful music, it is graphically better then Skyrim, has a good enough story and great freedom though doing the missions is still essentiel to unlocking certain things. The crafting is a bit harder due to refining and advance material location, but you can add bonus to your items as well as enchanting them. Money is still hard to find, like many of these games, but I've seen worst. Other players are as they've always been, very nice to very...not so nice, but I've mostly seen the helpful neutral type. It is very possible to play on your own and I have yet to find a guild and learn how those work, so they are not necessary if you're a loner.It is a possibly very good game, not the best but quite enjoyable never the less, if you can manage not to get lagged or booted off every 1/2 hour or less. If it wasn't for the technical problems, I would recommand this game when on special. As it is, I can only warn the obssessive buyers like me and tell them to look somewhere else for now."
Negative,"Not my Elder scrolls, feels like a shit version of WoW"
Negative,that not i think
Negative,doesnt even load up on system anymore....
Negative,"This game has no Auction House, it has guilds dedicated to trading with kiosks instead!It's catastrophic to have this in a modern MMO today. If you can't even provide something as basic as a bloody auction house then you devs have no business making MMO's in the first place. Try and learn from the masters, GW2.This is a deal breaker for me, a big one. I don't care about your ""lore"" or your ""immersion"" since nothing breaks immersion more than throwing your dices and hope you landed on a trade guild out of 120+ and hope it has the items you need at a reasonable price after traveling around the world. Why not remove fast travel as well? Breaks immersion too.If i knew this before i bought the game then i wouldn't have made the purchase.ESO community is split between those who want stone age trading system and those who are more used to the modern civilization. The ones that are for this stone age trading usually say ""it's fine as it is! don't change anything!"" for reasons that are just... Quite frankly, intellectually dishonest. Trade Guilds does not efficiently replace Auction House on any level what so ever, it's a farce! I've even read how scamming and ripping people off is a part of the ""lore"" and ""immersion"" being said in forums as if it's a feature. ""With this system it's possible you can find a really good item at a bargain!"", you mean it's possible to find someone ignorant and screw him over his fair share of gold? Vice versa is also possible, overprice a mediocre item to hell and have some poor sucker buy it thinking he got it for a bargain. Or this intellectually dishonest argument! ""I don't wanna compete with every seller on the entire server."" Yeah that's why the entire world has moved on to a modernised trading today where the free market decides the prices. To rid archaic inefficient trading with efficient, convenient and secure trade so people like you can't take advantage of ignorant customers.  Turns out there is a demand for more convenient, efficient and secure trades! Ain't that an eye opener?!I haven't read a single argument that actually has a point against having an auction house, because there is none."
Negative,Installed this game and after entering the website to create an account I had my browser's settings messed with. This is sketch.
Negative,Just buy Skyrim
Negative,a vei.. nao fico legal..os graficos cairam muito.. e nada ver com skyrim.. eh tudo pior... ta mais pra um lineage2 e alem de ser pago.. ainda tem p2w
Negative,o elder scrolls é uma merda papa bless vai te fuder
Negative,this is like visiting a theme park
Negative,"Horrible and boring combat , enough to ruin this game for me"
Negative,Its meh. think of it like brushing your teeth again and again and again that is ESO. Boring combat with a very long grind just to get the game play you think you want and end up with a boring cheese sand wedge. Does it have ok quest? yesAre there things to do? yes always just rinse and repeat is the name of the game.Is it challenging? Nope not at all snooze feast all the way.Is DLC worth it? hell NO Full price for 15% of a full game get out of here.But lets face it all the BOTs will pay for it keeping this going and ES6 in the dark.
Negative,"This game is another example of the casualization of PC games, yes its an mmo rpg for the pc but not primarily. This is a console game first and formost and for this reason alone I'd say skip buying this game unless you'r gonna play it casually with like a controller on a TV or you just don't care and need something to sink time into. But if your looking for good PC game your going to care about... no... I can see why so many people stopped playing that they had to remove monthly subscribtion. You can't take this game seriously if your gonna enjoy it, its a casual console game, dont buy it for PC."
Negative,"I am 33 and have tried this for the second time. I just can not seem to get into it. I will say, after all these years the world is magnificent and the detail is.... Ok. I first went to western SkyRim to re-visit Solitude. Close to Skyrim but it doesnt have the bone-chilling vibe. After playing every Elder Scrolls game, I have to say I loved the idea of having the entire world in one game. But not like this.Not only do you have to spend lots of money for ""DLC"" which are just quests but the game play leading through each quest is for the lack of a better word, immersionless. The first quest I did in skyrim, I missed a barrel and ran through the cave of enemies who happen to re-spawn over and over looking for the last bomb that was going to rip open Dragon Bridge. While talking to one of the quest givers, a saber cat decided to attack me and she stood there. Un-rattled by the large cat swiping at me. I suppose she was busy talking to another person trying to see what easy target is next. I say easy, because why are there levels?? I could go the entire game at level one. Since enemies are only as strong as you.I fought huge bears and Reachmen bosses at level 3. Why am I able to do this? It is not immersion but a ""Hey anybody can play anything at anytime"" product. Which kills everything. Especially when others are running through the same quest and behind them, enemies spawn for you and repeat...repeat...repeat...I will go back to morrowind and skyrim until 6 comes out. I am astonished at how many people like this game."
Negative,"Total WASTE of time and money. Good thing I tried it on free weekend instead of buying it, because they try to scam you by requiring a launcher that installs the game for another few hours after downloading it from Steam. So you will be easily over 2h playtime limit before even launching tutorial. It's P2W cringe cashgrab with boring gameplay."
Negative,I wish I didnt buy this. make a real elder scrolls game
Negative,This game is boring
Negative,MY COCK HURTS
Negative,Developers only care about money and not the playerbase.
Negative,"Ruined it with classes. The entire point of Elder Scrolls is a classless RPG, and by locking skills behind classes they ruined the formula entirely. What a waste."
Negative,Great game other than the fact that ZOS has ruined it with insane lags (especially in PVP areas) and a server that intermittently allows you to log in and then kicks you out randomly when you do log into the game. The servers or something needs to be fixed.
Negative,"This game was immensely disappointing.  It's like, they took Skyrim, and just sucked all the fun out of it.  Do you enjoy Skyrim because you get to customize your character?  Well, you can do that, a little... as long as you wear the outfit that's handed to you... or that other outfit from the guy you killed that looks exactly like it.  Do you enjoy Skyrim because you can go where you like and completely ignore the main questline because you think being the hero is dumb?  Well... you CAN ignore the MAIN questline, but everything else you choose to do is fetch quests that completely disregard your character's alignment and force you into being... well, a hero.  Do you enjoy Skyrim because of the beautiful sights and world immersion?  Well... I mean... there's trees.  You can, like, put a picture of the world of Skyrim on your desk and look at it while you wander through the inferior graphics of ESO.  Let's put it this way: when I'm playing Skyrim, despite the fact I've played it a billion times, I look up at the clock and realize I should have been in bed three hours ago.  When I play ESO, I think about my day at work and what chores I need to get done around the house.  Basically?  This game would be worth the $60 if... yeah, I got nothin'..."
Negative,"I wouldn't recommend, this game is impossible to play without ESO plus (a monthly sub), my inventory is full ALL THE TIME! I'm currently forcing myself to play only to try to get my money's worth from paying for the actual game because I can't refund it."
Negative,Nothing but downloads after downloads
Negative,Not enough anime tits
Negative,"This game has a lot of issues crashing and with bugs. i would consider playing something different, it get annoying looking up what to do with certain issues the game has as well as it crashing all the time."
Negative,the camera in the game goes crazy and starts moving randomly....
Negative,Not for me.
Negative,"I played this game for a while with no problems; took a break for  a year; and now I can't get past the launcher. Reinstalled, checked the firewall, and ran a Run Test with no success. The last few hours ""played"" was nothing but the launcher display or a black screen. I'll change my recommendation if I'm able to get it to work again."
Negative,"Played for the first time since 2018 and store has a fraction of the items, loot boxes, and a subscription that affects gameplay directly. Pretty disheartened by it especially considering that I enjoy the core gameplay, hoping to get a refund. Just wait for ES6 if you want a ES experience that isn't the fifth Skyrim release, and if you just want a decent MMO play SWTOR or FFXIV."
Negative,game looks amazing BUT you can't play itwhen i first log on game was 60 fps super soft fhd high settingsbut when i finish the first mission (the prison thing)game got laggy  all the online players were moving in teleports of 5 seci press ctrl and i crouchd after 1.2 min!!!!its not my keybord or my internet my keybord works fine on moving whit (a.w.d.s)thats on the na virsion i deleate the na virsion and moved to eu because im from euand still baggy as hell animations sucks some of the sounds missing cant sprint cars and staff are not showing and text masseges are delayd too....but to day when i logd in my game rund good no delays at frist was some delays but i got over after i playd for 5 houers i moved for playing csgo for 3 more houers and now when i tryd to log in it  was super delayd server preformense were suck. i tryd to log on many times i play for 4 min its all delay i press ctrl after 4 min it dose crouch and log me off some times i even cant login map dosent load i know you are probebly thinking hoo hes computer suck internet is low but not i never have a single frame drop on many game including eso sooo please consider befor buying it i will recommand bo3 more WORKING!!!!!please eso makers fix server or do a browser or dont let me load all the places in the game i prefer more time loading screens form door to door but no delay i wish you can do that i will be glad if you fix it thanks.....other then that game qualty is amazing!!!      sry if i was wrong wirting my english isnt the best XD
Negative,it sucks total ass
Negative,Game at first was really fun to play but after 2 days.... every quest is same sad story....... boring
Negative,Its F2p only for a short time then its buy to play and also has microtransactions ingame way to go Zin ... btw this is a cheap shitty mmo not like original so dont buy it thanks alot for nothing ....
Negative,"Elder Scrolls Online would be a fun game to play, that is if the servers did not freeze and boot you constantly; when I say constantly I mean ever time you log on and run five steps. The game is not basically, it is  literally unplayable. Once booted you must wait 5 minuets for the server to reset so that you can log back on, run five more feet and then be booted again. I have filled out many reports with the game developer only to have nothing about the games performance fixed or even remotely made better. The game has only gotten worse with every new DLC they come out with."
Negative,"Never have I ever worked harder and waited longer to play a game. and Im a seasoned wow player. This game took so long to download which is understandable given the size i guess, however you have to make an account first and DON'T BE FOOLED! When It says you got the username/password is wrong, it really means you have to input the code steam gives you after you launch the game not in the game itself oh no that'll be to easy. After you create an account(and make sure to put your ""user name"" not email.) make sure to put in the code into ""redeem code."" MAKE SURE TO COPY AND PASTE!! It won't work if you type it in, and after all that what well you be rewarded with? A msg after you try logging in again saying you need to log out and input a random code sent to your email...After three days I just made my first charecter and was excited to play in the morning sense I updated everything last night to find out...theres more updates I'm waiting on...AND DON'T EVEN FRACKING GET ME STARTED ON THERE ""CUSTOMER SUPPORT"" UGH! ...I want to like this game, really I do but it's not making it easy."
Negative,"boring fetch quests over and over. I don't think MMO's are for me to be honest. I was hoping for a game like skyrim but online and the combat in this game is far worse, numbers all over the place, monsters don't react to any attacks. I travelled into this cave and got to the boss at the end and there was other players inside the corpse of this spider just instantly killing it every time it spawned, god only knows why they were doing it but things like that take all the tension and mystery out of the game. If you are impatient and are just waiting for the next elder scrolls game then don't make the mistake of watching all the well made videos on this game as it will suck you in and the next thing you will be doing is collecting notes for people aimlessly back and forth from the map wasting your time"
Negative,"There might have been a time when ESO was a carefree mmo. However Zenimax's new TOS makes me feel a bit sick.  In order to play ESO you must waive your right to take part in any Class action lawsuit against them. They have tucked away within the TOS that they have the right to sell your data.  That is a combination of ask's that seems very shady to me.  They need to preemptively protect themselves from what they are expecting to be a class action lawsuit....  Zenimax is known to have piss poor customer service.Why should I as the consumer need to give away rights, protections or anything else just to play what is an expensive MMO?  That seems like a set up just to get rolled."
Negative,"You literally have to pay a subscription to play this game properly. Developers do not fix bugs. For example: there are minor 8 year old bugs in this game, as well as ones such as the one where you get to crash randomly to the front screen that and it wont let you back in (has been happening for a year and most players experience it). Only buy if you want an addicting experience full of annoying bugs."
Negative,"if playing free on console then there's no problem, but on steam you pay to play and then are inconveniently pressured into spending money for quality of life stuff like being able to craft in your inventory or extra storage. why should PC have to pay while console doesn't if they throw microtransactions in your face?"
Negative,"Here is my biased and one-sided opinion about ESOFirst the pros:- A Quickslot system for items - A Hot bar for spells (Prob my favorite part off the game seeing as how i came from playing skyrim and the menu system was just terrible)- Crafting system (much better than skyrim)- Enchanting system was well done- Huge map to explore (if you are a high level :P )- Better perks for races. Secondly the Cons:- The game felt like a cartoon when i was looking for a more realistic feel.- Overcrowded ( in some dungeons it was hard to get loot b/c of all the other players, and crafting stations in major cities had so many people it can be hard to find where the crafting table actually is)- The leveling system prevents you from getting a full expirience b/c you are confined to one area until you can level up (in skyrim most dungeons and characters will level up with you)- many times i completed quests that gave me rewards that were to high of a level to use.- the story line was difficult to follow.- Quests seem either irrelevant or unrelated to one another.- It was a MMO. Yes i know that it is supposed to be a MMO, but the elderscrolls series are famous for their singleplayer gameplay and I believe that it does not fit in well with the other games in the series.- The crown store (pay some more money for a game that was already expensive Stuff that I didn't like or dislike:- I found that the graphics were good but quite unrealistic- have not been able to try out PVP b/c you can get to the location until you get to level 238634(yes, it does unlock at level 10 but there is no way that you can make it to the PVP area without dying)Overall it is a good MMO but if you are expecting it to be anything like skyrim..... it's not....... at all...... hopefully Elderscrolls 6 will be better. XD"
Negative,"friend got band for trash talk, disappointing game also have fun doing the most boring shit for mythic items literal waste of time."
Negative,"If you want to play elder scrolls, play skyrim or oblivion. This game is a less interesting and less exciting version of both those games."
Negative,This game looks very nice and plays (mostly) very well but whats the point of a game of this standard when you cant even login to it to play it and there is no communication about the issues - disappointed is not the word.
Negative,"It's an MMORPG, so expect everything to become utterly bland, limited, shallow and repetitive quickly."
Negative,"why did i own this game, and now its asking me to buy what the hell i was playing this game last year."
Negative,absolute trash. waste of time and money
Negative,when I dropped ESO plus they booted me off the game entirely avoid this sinkhole.. After Bethesda_Exile3D 's response guess I need to clear it up its not a technical.. ESO for no reason blocked me from logging period .. THEY blocked my account plain and simple..
Negative,"It says you need 80gb when you first download through steam, so I clear out 80gb. Get it downloaded and ready to play, and i need ANOTHER 86 gb to install it. You need to have at least 160gb for this game, what the fuck? Cant reccomend or not yet but be wary of this, its insane. Never seen a game take up so much space. Putting this as a negative review for this reason alone, I had to uninstall 4 games and clear folders just to play this."
Negative,"The game itself is very fun, certainly has problems, but it's fun.The problem is the monetization system. The craft bag is essential, not a convenience, as the developers try to argue when answering to negative reviews, it's essential. And the game seems to be designed around it, with the stupid amount of items that it has. It's a totally different experience when you don't have to go back to town for 10 mins to clean your inventory after you do basically anything in the game, and having to go through long loading times on not high-end computers to go in and out of your inn room to store more items. You can upgrade inventory/bank space, but it takes a lot of gold to get to a decent space amount, which by then you already wasted hours of your life managing your inventory."
Negative,"I have been an Elder Scrolls fan for many years. While this game respects the feel of the Tamriel world, and actually expands upon it, it constantly crashes and is virtually unplayable. I am not particularly difficult to please concerning video games, but i can't help but feel that i have been robbed by purchasing this game. The crashes are not an issue with my machine, since it is the only online game with which i have issues. Very disappointing!"
Negative,everything locked behind a pay wall
Negative,"p2w. unless you pay for the subscription, 90% of your gameplay will be inventory management simulator."
Negative,"This game itself has good content as a standard MMO RPG.However,the company Zenimax and betheda has absolutly serious operation issue,I think.There're so many bugs in the game existing for months even over a year,the studio applied community :we have fixed them"" but it was not.After 3 months the fixed,the same bug comes out again.What's worse,now EU/PC/MAC server become very unstable.You perhaps to have high ping,disconnecting and lagging.The reason is the server is overloaded due to recent increasing customer numbers.However,this issue was known and foreseeable to ZOS since JAN,2019.They done nothing until April 2019 while the server is finally broken during 5 years Anniversary event.They closed server to do maintenance in daytime and night of EU zone for 2.5 days when everyone wants to play and get the event rewards.Now they enable the queue system at the night.To me,it's okay to be in queue to login.However,this system is broken and not work AT ALL to me.It told me to wait 19 min and I actually waited 2 hours at night.It was always stopped at 9 min 9 s or some number like that and never move again.So recent 3 days,I did a experiment:Hang out the ESO queue when the sun falls and waiting while playing other games.I got same result in 3  days:I can't login due to unmoving queue until midnight when everyone goes to sleep.Besides,how many times I was kicked from server and reconnected failed when I was in dungeon or trail?I can't remember.I am 100% sure I had no internet connection isuue cause I DON'T HAVE ANY SUCH ISSUE in other games.It is annoying and depressing when you are almost finished every Boss until final one even though you are tring to do best with high ping due to unstable server...and then,you are disconnected!You tried to reconnect but the server is slowly.When you finally get in the game,the group  leader and teammates voted to kick you out!Your all half even a hour efford is waste.On the other hand,I already mentioned they knew this would happen someday but done nothing earlier for EU server.However,they will do something earlier for NA server.I have no offense but this shows ZOS take EU as 2nd class while EU actually has the most ESO population with PC.I don't know what to say about this...I think the company did some times big price discount which cause lots of new players comes but they were actually not ready and even never consider about this issue.Otherwise,The maintenance in Anniversary should not be happened."
Negative,я был удивлен. вчера лег спать а проснулся в рабском лагере. казалось сон. но не тут то было. жадная до костоей компанния продала мне игру где я должен сливать деньги. и что в итоге? - 40 евро а эти пидоры все требуют денег.
Negative,"The game graphices is lower than we used to, plus too many daily long updates of the game that waste my time, and finally its online game but  almost everyone are playing alone"
Negative,"A really casual friendly MMO. Its not really for veteran MMO players.its one of those ""hold my hand and take me through a storyline"" MMO's. My main pros and cons:- Pros -Fun crafting/professions Good voice actingStoryline- Cons -Level based nodes. (lvl 5? low lvl herbs/ore/runes even in endgame areas)Grindy (But if you pay $$ its alot faster)Auction house system is ran by player guilds. Each guild has their own AH. Makes little sense.RNG Microtransaction Loot chests (Infesting another MMO)Horribly ugly character models and bland graphics even on the highest settings"
Negative,"First you buy the game, then you buy the DLC, then you pay for eso plus..."
Negative,"I would have loved to play this game on the free weekend to decide if i want to purchase it or not. But, an endless amount of bugs that decided that i could not even load it made me think again."
Negative,"Nerf, Nerf, grind, grind, grind. As soon as you finally get your character sorted there will be more changes and more nerf, nerf, grind, grind, grind....Disappointing and frustrating since the game mechanics had so much potential and the story line is really good.ESO is the stability of instability. They just can't make up their minds."
Negative,"This game is awesome! I'm not kidding... the reason why I'm disliking it is because I have to pay every month a VPN in order to play  because of zenimax ""megaserver"" won't let me play without it... I got this error message every time when requesting character load, already tried all solutions on the web, unfortunately nothing works but VPN."
Negative,this game doesnt work for mac anymore so you should stop saying it works on mac. and for some reason it wont even let me comment on their message board even though im logged in to eos onlineshady bullshit
Negative,game takes up 150 gb piece of shit
Negative,"I can't even log in.  Installed through Steam, installed the launcher, installed patches just fine, created an account, but when I get the game open and attempt to log in, it goes to a ""requesting log in"" screen for about 5-10 seconds before it crashes. Happened 5 times in a row before I uninstalled both the game and the launcher, reinstalled both, and tried again.  Same results.  Will not be contacting the support staff, read other reviews to see how that went for people.  Glad I tried this during the free week, would have been really disappointed if I paid for this kind of result from a company I have trusted for years to make great games."
Negative,"The lack of having an Asian servers made me refund this game.Good latency makes an MMO a good and playable MMO, which on my case it is not. I spent my first week downloading this game on steam, patching the game, fixing some launcher issues (which is alot), it gets frustating on the first week of having the game. All in all it is a good game and has alot of potential. I enjoyed my first hours playing it, alot of adventures, fun quests and great dungeons and people are friendly (atleast at my level). What kills me is that it only has two megaserver which is NA and Europe. Me as a player on asia is experiencing a latency of 200+ ms and after about a minute it would go up at about 999+ which is sad because it kills the game for me. I don't hate the game, I loved it so far, but putting on consideration that there are players not just on NA and Europe but on Asia and Oceania too. I would totally recommend it for people playing on NA and Europe, but not on people living in Asia/Ocenia part of the world. It's a good game kudos for that and besides it is pay to play ;D"
Negative,"14 hours of my life wasted on this game i want a refund besides every city has almost the exact same layout, battles are monotonous and with no instructions (online purchase not sure if its any better with a cd purchase. finally got pass level 30 (and apparently most of the quests don't scale to your level) and got stuck between a floor and the only way to get unstuck  is to type""/unstuck"" and you have to pay 500+ gold ? i mean seriously i have to pay for crappy design engineering ?on top of being monotonous fights ?and i'm also sorry restoration staff & destruction staff its a damn staff i'm a ""sorcerer"" if i can use a staff it shouldn't matter whether its a destruction or restoration"
Negative,"its a shoddy WoW clone, with the majority of dungeons are pay blocked, plus loot crates...Loot Crates...LOOT CRATES"
Negative,i really enjoy the game the only issue is that you cant play it without the game crashing and kicking you off.  it is not an issue of overclocking or a system issue but the game will show you an error report and kick you off the game. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON A GAME THAT YOU CANT PLAY LONG ENOUGH TO ENJOY
Negative,"Pay for the game.Pay for DLC.Buy in-game premium.Grind 24 hours.High DPS(and pvp) locked behind thousands of hours(prestige levels).Non existent lore, you won't get anything useful from side missions. Bad graphics.Run the same dungeon 6 gazilion times a day.You can't switch your builds for free.New content and highest dps / best money farm methods are locked behind paid DLC.You need to mod your game with different addons, so enjoy wasting 10 hours of your life looking at mod menu and researching different addons.Stopped playing for a couple of months and decided to go back? Enjoy being cukd by new prestige level cap, and your gear is outdated and new players are higher level than you.Hardest game mechanic is your inventory management. You simply have no inventory space. ( you have unlimited inventory with paid premium :)))) ).One of the best gold-farming method is literally being a cottonfield m-cricket. Enjoy logging into your game and running from one plant to another. Oh, and you will probably get scammed at some point and support team won't get you your gold back. You don't need to farm gold if you have a premium, you will passively accumulate paid currency over time and you can just sell it.A lot of skills/passive abilities are locked behind paid DLC (you won't see this stuff even in free to play games).If you ok with paying for a premium, this game is really good. You will get the access to every DLC and you won't have any problems with your gear, gold, progression or skills. Also if you planning to play with premium, just buy a standard edition of the game."
Negative,40 hours? more like 30 hours of waiting for it to load / download / update . 10 hoursof gameplay.
Negative,When the game takes so long to download so you cant refund it when you finally realize that you don't like it.
Negative,"Tried for an hour to get it to start and doesn't even get past the bethesda logo. Great event, glad I got to try this shitty game."
Negative,Did not like it at all
Negative,Could not get past the initial loading screen to the character creation. Another fine example of bathesda garbage that doesnt work.
Negative,"It was playable. Playing with a few friends or exploring different areas made the game appealing. The gameplay had too many aspects which made it irritating to play. Step out of an enemy's area? They are fully healed and running back to their spot. Homing arrows? You bet! Just spent a while clearing a room? Some other player just ran in, now the enemies are back again.Not a fan of this game. Honestly expected something a bit better for the price."
Negative,"Game ended up breaking itself and customer support refuses to do anything about it.Money grubbing asswipery, nothing more, nothing less. A typical Elder Scrolls affair. Buy your games from companies that actually care instead."
Negative,"MMORPGs are largely unreviewable. They're designed to endlessly consume your time so they're functionally massive and it's almost impossible for your average game reviewer to experience everything (or even most things) an MMORPG has to offer in a reasonable amount of time. But this is going to be a review because I've seen enough.In the year 2018, what is an MMORPG? I struggle to call what The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) is a roleplaying game. While I play a character with a spreadsheet full of statistics and character-defining numbers of my own choosing, I'm not really roleplaying in the traditional sense. The roleplaying I'm doing in ESO is the role I would fit in for some endgame boss fights: tank, healer, or dps. But none of my actions in this game world amount to much. They can't. Everyone's doing the same quests, fighting the same world-threatening evil. Everyone is the only person who can save this world. There's no reasonable narrative explanation for this. I'm saving the world and so is every other person playing this game.Since I'm not roleplaying, what am I doing? Fighting monsters, crafting, or fishing. That's kind of it. None of them are particularly rewarding or well done either. Combat is hitting my combat skills and waiting until the cooldown is done before I hit them again. To craft, I have to scour the world for materials, then I go to a work bench and hit the ""craft item"" button a few times and it spits out a thing. Fishing is fishing. It's as simple as tossing your line into some prearranged fishing spots and waiting until something bites.If I don't sound enthusiastic about any of this, it's because I'm not. Looking back at the time spent, ~40 hours, none of it stands out. I ended up wasting so much time playing ESO because this was a long winter and seasonal depression hit hard. It was sort of comforting to get into ESO and kill an evening doing very little actual gaming. In retrospect, it wasn't a good way to spend my time, but it was all I wanted to do for the month of April. If that’s something you’re looking for, a game to carry you through a seasonal funk, the I guess ESO is one you can count on."
Negative,"Tried to log in as usual one day to a lovely message spammed accross the screen: Account banned, contact Sustomer Support.Pardon?ZoS customer support letter claims my account is 'detected', by their servers, running 'Cheat-Engine' on multiple occasions. No dates or times, no evidentiary proof, just an allegation by ZoS that their server 'detected' this program running on my machine.How do I even respond to that?  So I google 'Cheat-Engine' to learn what I've been banned for.Hmph. Interesting.I contact customer support to request more information and an explanation. More information is not provided. Still no evidence. Nothing I can say or do but scratch my head.However, a pleasantly worded lecture about the 'severity' of my alleged 'offence' and a fixed decision regarding the ban are given.Um.. Huh?400+ hours of game time lost. Still scratching my head.On a positive note; I learned about 'Cheat-Engine'. I suppose I might as well learn what it does. At least that way if this kind of thing ever happens again I'll know what in the hell they're talking about.Good work ZoS. Absolutely magnificent Customer Support.Zenimax Online, you have lost a Customer and a recommendation.As if they care."
Negative,"Now look i know my hours might be low but i have played for over 5 years now on console so hear me outeso is the biggest money dump you'll ever play and it's obvious they just care about how big your wallet isthe game has gone from ""Play how you wanna play"" to (Sure you can play this way but you will be kicked out of every vet trial and dungeon"" every update they nerf sets released with the base game to release stronger sets in a $100 dlc that looks identical to the set that was nerfed (iceheart and troll king and unchained agressor is one) unchained was nerfed because 25% damage boost for 6 seconds? too strong..so let's release a paywalled item that gives you 25% damage forever!if you play console you are looking at close to $300-400 a year due to xbox/psn live and the eso plus which doesn't even come with the advertised items and if you don't wanan grind for weeks on end that 300-400 can go way way up with race change tokens allince tokens all the good shit crown crates too hey you wanna buy a irtual house? $200 pleasei could write a fuckin essay but im not gonna be bothered"
Negative,"general gameplay requires you to switch between 2 different weapons, each limiting you to 6 skills.   Game is tailored to console and is not worth the money needed to play all the content"
Negative,"Just personally don't enjoy this game... I didn't find anything wrong with the game itself, it just makes me incredibly sleepy every time I play it."
Negative,"the optimization on this game is horrid and the ""mega"" server is mega bad i get average of 150 ping, its hard to enjoy the game"
Negative,"Its like World of Warcraft, just with much more worse graphic...It should be for free for players for all the time."
Negative,"Banned 10 days after purchase for a character name that was not vulgar or offensive at all.  Customer support does not respond, all crowns I purchased are still on the account and no easy way to get a refund for that.  I'd recommend staying away from this game.  Seems to be managed by the PC babies from South Park."
Negative,"I wanted to try it, because I loved Morrowind back in the day and wanted to see Vvardenfell in this game, but the game is just boring.Graphics are dated.Most of the quests are fetch quest: ""find x amount of ..."" or ""go there, do something quick, run back"". Combat is real basic, no challenge at all. Hard attack, soft attack, max 5 skills.Limited inventory space.World scales with you.Now I remember why I downloaded so many mods for Oblivion and Skyrim. Bethesda just makes mediocre games."
Negative,"Elder Scrolls Online was likely produced by a loving and competent team, after which a group of disgusting sharks came in and designed the exact amount of non-VIP limitations so you can still play but feel limited and frustrated at every corner. I played for 400 hours, became the richest in my guild, and was still limited as if I was playing a f*** F2P game although in this one, you have to purchase a copy. (+ DLCs) I guess Bethesda is genuinely incapable of producing a decent game nowadays.Here's how you get people like me to pay more for your game:1- Do a good base game.2- Produce Expansion/DLCs with some degree of effort (no re-releasing the same game 5 times, I don't touch that)"
Negative,"fallen from grace. no longer recommend. its LACK OF REWARDS, GREEDY CASH SHOP and BRAIN DEAD open world mkae this hard to love. they focus so much on the questing content but the quests are so dam easy that there is no steaks.... so the majority of solo play is really not fun due to how brain dead easy the game is. meaning if u are like me and feel bored by how easy it is you cant play the content that takes up the vast majority of the game..... in additon it feels like the game is becoming more and more casual focused... end game players can only do Vet trails and DNGS....."
Negative,"Amazing game with loads of things to do but has become a pay to participate and do any event, the lasts event is just and example.You have to pay to get the dlc so why do i have to pay to get expansions to participate in an event .Game dev's have got to hungry for money"
Negative,ESO are unable to maintain a stable game environment. Your choice to try or endure. This is a comment to state BUYER BEWARE if you know the meaning of you bought a LEMON. Then you will be harassed and bullied either directly or indirectly by other players/workers with no real consequence to these bullies. Then you will be receive error messages stating that it must be you or your equipment platform causing the unplayable game.Last time i checked the game was receiving over 6000+ error fix requests per day. YOUR CHOICE
Negative,Only thing you do is walking and talking. Nothing  else
Negative,"Incredibly boring - spent a couple of hours trying to get engaged, and absolutely nothing of it stood out. May be MMO burnout, but... I just couldn't get it engaged."
Negative,"Unsurprisingly, it looks quite dated now."
Negative,"Laggy servers, latency constantly fluctuates beween 80-120 with game freezing at spikes to ""+999""(whatever that means), meanwhile WoW somehow manages to keep it at 55ms."
Negative,"dumb game, cant even play it cuz my mouse sensitivy changes every 10 seconds to a really high setting and controllers dont work"
Negative,"So I've been trying to play for the last 2 weeks now, have submitted multiple help tickets, have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times, have manually combed through my entire C drive and device manager just in case there's something I need to delete, any residual file that is preventing the ESO launcher to launch, etc. And nothing. So far, with download times alone taking up around 28 hours and this process having gone on for nearly 3 weeks now -Yes, I've been counting and keeping track- I'm at the end of my rope. And because of the installer error I received, I was unable to get a refund for the $100 I invested because it counted the error as time I was playing the game.With the customer support, The guy or automated response ""helping me"" is and was terrible too. First, they said I needed to update NVidia drivers when I have no Nvidia hardware or software in my entire computer system, as I use AMD instead. Then, they completely ignored me and what I wrote for about a week, then copy-pasted the stuff one can find on their forum/help-yourself page as though I'm an idiot and haven't tried everything there first before contacting them. Next, they decided to ignore me yet again, ignore everything I wrote, and ignore everything I'm trying to get help figuring out in order to play their game, and so far, it's been nearly a 3-week process just to receive 2 responses that help nobody and show nothing but ignorance or that they're ignoring me and my issue.So TL;DR, Customer service sucks, not at all worth the $100 investment I made for game + DLC, and there's nothing I can do about it.Don't buy. If there's an error, refund asap, even if the error won't go away. If the error won't go away, restart your pc. Otherwise, you lost your money and Steam thinks you're playing."
Negative,I would rather play Skyrim again than this. It is too boring.
Negative,THESE GUYS WILL KEEP TAKING MONEY OUT YOUR ACCOUNT EVEN IF U UN SUB AND CANCEL THE SUB
Negative,"Is Elder Scrolls Online an actual Elder Scrolls game? Half n' Half but I rather just say no because. I was excited to download and play this game while it's free for a limited time to play this game after those 11 hours of download. I had to go through a launcher to download directx and for some reason it closes itself out and just never did anything after that. I had to opened it to update the game within the launcher and then it closes out again just to tell me that it have an app already running in the background. I checked and there was nothing related in the task manager unless it was hiding like a pleb this game is.I ran the game again and it finally launched the game and then it I had to go through a bunch of policy and important stuff that I'm sure most people don't really read anymore. I then created a character and it was pretty nice except there's no big changes I could really do. So I stood with a busty Brenton Summoning girl except for some reason I could not use summoning because this isn't Elder Scrolls. It doesn't matter what race you choose. There's a class section and you have skills you can pick from and you don't really do specific things that you wanna do at all. It sucks and I wish I never had to see that again in another Elder Scrolls game.I started the actual game and it felt nice like other Elder Scroll games. It was great, the combat, sneaking and other mechanics etc. One of the things I did not like was, you wanna pick a butterfly? Press ""E"" on it and go through a small window saying that there's a butterfly inside a butterfly. Same with everything too. I don't feel like you have an open minded world that you can freely explore. Either I haven't played enough of the game or you have to ""Upgrade"" if you want the full experience of how Elder Scrolls Online actually is. Some is great and most stuff I witness was not and made me disappointed with how the game is. 2/1000"
Negative,"Cant even launch the game. Apperantly theres a bug that doesnt actually give you the access when requesting it through the client. Tried so much trouble shoots and what not. Emailed support, started ticked, waited for days with no replies, sent follow up emails, nothing. Yeah give me money back."
Negative,Died to a high level player...
Negative,"combat, movement and menus feel like a console portGW2 is bettter and the core game is free"
Negative,"After hours playing, My character got stuck in a wall after being attacked. No way to get it out of there."
Negative,Cant Cancel the subscription for crowns. been like a year LOL
Negative,I spent 30 hours trying to install this game once
Negative,Unplayable with steam link.
Negative,"а жаль, прикол игра если бы не сервера"
Negative,Dont buy this game on steam you cant even log in to play it.
Negative,"1. There's NO Shouts anymore, you're any longer the DragonBorn.2. All Spells and abilities changed completely (most of them sucks).3. Expansions are Great! but EXPENSIVE.I recommend to the team, to add again all the shouts and all spells and abilities from Skyrim."
Negative,"This game is good....really that's all I can say it is, it doesn't feel elder scrolls to me, nor does it feel mmorpg too me, it just feels....meh. The game itself is alright, combining things from games like everquest and putting it with certain things from elder scrolls. One would think this would be epic, but in all it sort of just turns out meh, now, this is my opinion of the matter, and is not shared by all, but I really do feel that something is missing from this game. At times it doesn't feel like an mmorpg, and more like a solo, and at other times it feels too much like an mmorpg and less like a solo, there just doesn't seem to be a balance too it. Also from what i've seen alot of people have issues with both dlc and expansions existing at the same time, which is understandable."
Negative,"Uninteresting, old, and the same bullcrap as all other MMO's. A cash and grab that just sucks up your money. I'd rather play freaking Runescape and the new version that THIS"
Negative,"installanywhere don't work, login errors, infinite loading, random crashes, worst customer support i've ever seen, launcher problemsthis is basicly a patience simulator"
Negative,"graphics ehh, interface with other players ehhh, story ehhh...."
Negative,social anxiety go brrrrrrrr
Negative,Servers are shit
Negative,"First off, not a bad game it does have a few things to do at best.If you want PVP this game is NOT for you at all. It's completely dead. Battlegrounds are the worst, with only being able to queue by yourself means no friends for battlegrounds. The odds of winning are slim at best. If you aren't getting wrecked by 2 teams together you get stuck with crappy teammates.Quest's are go here go there, come back here, go back there and here have a little exp... Crafting is bland and pointless because of the rate gear drops. Only thing needed would be cooking....Only thing worth exp is dungeons, and that is about it. So if you're not grinding your levels with boosts on gear or dungeons its just another bland game. So over all, is like a single player, item mall, cosmetic, online game.  Simply put ""single player"" mmo."
Negative,"Just installed the latest 35 update. WARNING for MAC ARM processor gamers: forget about this game. It crashes right after you've launched it. Two days ago I switched from windows-machine to macbook pro 14 with m1 pro processor to play this game with better experience and now I am reading at community ESO forum that they literally don't care as they don't intend to support new processors. They advise to play via cloud. Ive purchased tonns of good on ps4 version and then here at pc and mac version. ""Don't care"" approach of the support is similar to spitting in face. Deinstalling and looking for alternatives. Two years of experience go to garbage bin."
Negative,Its a fun game when it works.
Negative,"The whole game is nothing but a time sink and if you disagree, get help, you are way to deep in this addiction then.There is not a single reason to get anything, because everything, literally everything, scales to players.Level 10 characters will be queued with level 3000 people, because it will be scaled accordingly and there is no ability to ""power fantasy"" around... how... fun.The whole point is to spend money, you disagree, open your eyes. Basic functionality like inventory space is locked behind a paywall.The base game offers you ""content"" which leads to a point where you need to pay to advance.The ""DLC"" model, does the exact same. You bought something? ZOS does not care, you will get a certain amount, but the ""full content"" is of course locked behind the paywall, which usually starts at around 15 bucks currency units.So overall, on paper, it has some nice things, but this is just... seems kinda malicious.The whole lore is broken, too, because they just stated ""This is set before any other Elder Scrolls, ever"". So nothing now makes sense, we already learned how things were in the past and it seems next to everything in the games lied, i guess, which now in the aftermath leads to every SP title being what... dumb bullshit? This retconning in Online was the worst by far.The designs are just pure.. generic shit. If this game had no text, i wouldn't have noticed it's Elder Scrolls. Not a single enemy has the distinct coloring or overall morphology they were known for, it's just... everything looks the same, everything sucks about this.And that's the main thing here, it appeals to everyone, everyone should be able to enjoy it ( as long as money flows ) and everyone should be reminded of... Skyrim, not a single other game, please customer, please remember Skyrim, do you?So in the end this game appeals to all those zombies who want to throw money towards them. Took me 10 years and a free week to finally try it, buy it and experience ( at least that was the plan ) everything it has to offer. Turns out, it actively repells fans of the first games.Just play real videogames people and don't spend time or money on any mmorpg/live service/bad scam.It's all so obvious, yet millions enjoy it... Just get drugs, that's way more social and humane."
Negative,"the worst MMO game i have ever played. this game was released after skyrim but somehow got graphics from 10 years ago, the game not only looks bad but plays bad too, unlike skyrim and other Bethesda games that have a easy streamline inventory system, eso decided to make it as difficult to grab things from your inventory as possible - 1000000000000 social credit points, 80% of the map is locked behind a paywall and to access them you must give out outrages amounts of money.the best bet for this game is to destroy it and rebuild it from the ground up with real graphics this time."
Negative,"Lag is crazy, it often reaches 500 ms - 999 ms +++"
Negative,totally a shit bro
Negative,do not play this mobile game
Negative,"2000 Hrs review here (almost)first of all : putting PvP tag on this game is straight up false advertising monetization is worst than raid shadow legend (im talking 3 earnable mounts out of like 200  ) , LOOT BOXES LOOT BOXES AND MORE LOOT BOXES  genshin has better ratesIMPORTANT : you HAVE to buy the sub and don't let anyone tell you otherwise , it is hands down impossible to go more than a month without the subyou pretty much have to buy the latest expansion because it wont be available with the sub until the next one drops and the set/mythic that drops will be BISBalancing is none existence devs don't care about what you say , try to even mention problems and you are BANNED launcher is a mess , good luck running after the updates gameplay loop is abysmal (and i played legion from start alright)guild system is poopooevery single damn class is the same in pve , i played every single calss stam/mag/hybrid , zero class identity just diff colors and numbers overland content is boring as hell questing is trash , there is voice lines and thats all it is , total waste of time"
Negative,Can't play the game because of the retarded freezing launcher. fuck bethesda.
Negative,"I was in the queue for one hour - are you just kidding me? Why is it still inaccessible to us to explore the sea, why can't we dive? Argonians cannot use underwater breathing, as the sea and lakes are restricted areas in this game. You can't dive in this game. You can't climb in the game, the mechanics of interacting with the game world are very outdated - you can't cling to objects, climb, you can't chop down a tree or move by boat. The game is very outdated."
Negative,"The ""craft bag"", which provides unlimited inventory for ingredents, is only available when you shell out dough for this game _every month_.Without, the game is essentially an inventory management game, where you have 60 slots which must hold EVERYTHING. Trivial stuff like leaves stack, but larger items like weapons and apparel do not.Not to mention, most of the items you collect, like swords, cannot be sold to merchants, so they are worthless."
Negative,"soooo i just bought the game, got it downloaded, super exited. i go to play it and it says make an account, so cool i make an account. i then put in my CORRECT account information and hit login. I then get the message ""login error, incorrect login information given"". I then spell it in every way possible and still no result. I then made another account thinking maybe i messed up when creating it the first time. same result... i really want this game but if I cant even play it i want my money back."
Negative,violated tos 2.8 section for essentially saying noob and using capital letters during peak zone hours and got permanently banned.
Negative,this game s bad
Negative,worst game ever
Negative,"Is this a good game? I don't know. I have yet to play it and not for a lack of trying. I try but always get the same error message ""Connection to server timed out. Please try again later"". I have been trying back later for over a month now. Tried contacting Support they but gave me the same things to try that I've already tried before contacting them and still not able to play."
Negative,"All the reviews for this game seem very positive, supporting videos and youtube videos show a great game but alas i was unable to see any of this first hand.Right out of the purchase gate I was plagued with connection problems (error 200 mostly) i spent 2 days trying to get round the problem, the official response was to open ports blah and blah to get past the issue,  this is a pretty poor official responce, we have the software technology now where servers and clients protocalls can communicate without the need of risking network security, so to require this for a CLIENT to connect to a service and require port forwarding is so 2003 and should not be required for todays networking world. So after the 2 days of struggling with connection issues i have tried the following..reinstalling OS on both my alienware laptop and the desktop pcattempted to connect after antivirus and firewall package was removed (as part of computer reinstall)Forwarding ports as requestedTriggering ports as secondaryTried 2 alternate internet connections other than my ownSo i think ive officialy give this game more effort than any other game to get working (even more than debugging DOS doom exotic sound cards lol) and still ive yet to play it.So even though i bet its a stunner of a game, especially if you like skyrim and other titles from the developer, i cant reccomend this game because of the poor coding and technology used in the networking for the client. The game for me however was refunded by steam, Thanks steam."
Negative,"Came in for a similar experience to Skyrim came out immensely disappointed. boring quests, ugly zones, bad soundtrack and overall very bad and unimmersive questing experience. PvE with a skill gap so big between casual players and hardcore ones that you will find yourself barely able to do veteran content after 200 hours of playing plus bullshit pay to win subscription that that costs 20 USD per month for a game i already payed for. honestly no idea how i managed to play it for so long"
Negative,ESO is a great singleplayer game. In reality having the option to do whatever you want as a character will never work because there is of course a correct way to build your character and if you don't you'll suck and ruin the dungeon experience for everyone else.. 10/innovation would whipe in dungeons with a dual wielding nightblade tank.
Negative,"If you treat this as a subscription-based MMO, it's actually very great, but I would NOT recommend this if you are not going to subscribe or buy DLC. In that regard, its vanilla version, it's awful. Simply awful. I am not sure whether I should give a positive or negative review, but I guess I'll give it a thumbs up since I enjoy the game with subscription. The crafting is probably the best of any MMO out there, and I love crafting (which unfortunately forces me to subscribe)."
Negative,"The gameplay is very different from a normal Elder Scrolls game. I assume it was changed to fit better in the MMO crowd. The problem is that it is now incredibly generic feeling, only maybe slower/clunkier than expected. The graphics and level design that I saw were again nothing special and I had to use the map frequesntly because nothing was really standing out. The actual install size is ridiculous and it requires use of their ESO launcher rather than Steam launching it directly. Last, but definitely not least, the game has one of the most greedy bloodsucking monetization models I have ever seen."
Negative,"Enemy scaling is awful, every enemy as strong as a boss no point in leveling up, i got to level 40 i guess some quests are kind of fun and they are fully voice which is awesome, and the reason i got to level 40, but the luck of progress constantly feeling weak make this game sucks. if they ever give an option to disabling the stupid level scaling then i can recommend this game but as it is right now then NO."
Negative,this game should be delisted from steam
Negative,"Lack of a UI is annoying. i like having action bars and icons and the game is kinda.....boring....ive tried getting into it, but it put me to sleep i'm not even joking"
Negative,"Refunding this ""game"" wont even install or run"
Negative,if you are new you will struggle greatly
Negative,"Your pvp is garbage now. it was no pony ride before, but it's a dumpster fire now. fix your no group making"
Negative,"Warning, the game will require additional time to download via the launcher, this counts towards what Steam sees as ""Played""... so even before you ever launch the game, it will be non-refundable. For the game itself, it was really underwhelmed. Gave it about an hour before I was bored sensless... But Steam does not care, they've got my money. Guess I'll have to find another method to redeem the value from a Bathesda title... That's the Fallout from this cruddy transaction."
Negative,I was continuously getting Error 102.  I went through the FAQ and followed all options.  I had it installed through Steam.  I checked out the FAQ at Steam.  Went through all options there.  I tried a number of different fixes.  Nothing worked.  Another computer in my house had zero problem installing the game for a different account.  If you are not finding your fix in the FAQ you are straight up out of luck as there doesn't seem to be any way to contact the company for additional help on the install.
Negative,"This game is beautiful, but terrible inside. I have a feeling that there is a dedicated team of sociopaths who design and code dungeon bosses and their mechanics just to screw up everybody's day. Example: Wayrest Sewers 1 on Veteran mode: noone can survive unavoidable 1-shot backstab, and dont tell me I should 'get gud', you cant get any 'gud' against this guaranteed wipe. Stuff like this happens all the time, no research or self-improvement or strategy or group coordination can help. 'A dunegon' feature is terrible, people often do whatever they want to do, and this is a hell if you play as a healer, noone listens to chat, dps often queue as tank role to get into dungeon faster, HUGE RNG and lootboxes, literally pay-to-win or gather resources for months to improve your gear. Absolute garbage, waste of time and money - just as probably any MMO in this day and age. This game has no soul.PS. Also, the game is very heavy on PC, AMD A8-7680 Radeon R7 + nVidia GeForce 1050 TI - and its SLOW on below-average settings. The game servers are slow, people disconnect during dungeon run quite often, at least one person per run, login 30 second queue (!!!).The so-called ""Support"" is virtually non-existent, responces can take DAYS w/o guarantee the problem solution. Web site requires 'invitation' to register - I bought thisgame on Steam and never received ANY invitations, this means I cannot register on the website and use forums, cannot post complain or discuss anything with players.Recent EULA update literally legitimizes spying on customers and collecting ALOT of their personal information for future sell/trade with third parties. No, thanks.Update Feb 15 2022: No, I still do not recommend this game because none of the problems it had has been solved, and some more added:- with every DLC number of materials for crafters increased, gently forcing to subscribe for 15$/mo, because you have no place to keep all those ingredients while subscribers have access to bottomless crafting bag;- random dungeons with fake tanks / fake healers / overcaffeined overpowered speedrunners plague; it can and will ruin the day; this problem lasts for many years and is not only unfixed - its just ignored and refused to even acknowledge it exists; the system rewards rules-breakers and rules-avoiders, while real tanks/healers are non much needed and respected once the DPS is high enough, so if someone likes playing classical roles as a tank or healer - better to find a guild and play together, completely avoiding random dungeons. More to say, if someone complains - they labeled as 'toxic', this can result in ban according to ToS, so guess what - they will ban YOU if you complain about rulebreakers abusing the system and benefitting from it, makes perfect sense;- the game client is still slow, it seems it just ignores video card and runs only on CPU;- still no invite to forum, web-based account says I need to purchase the game first to get an invite, strangely enough I played 1342 hours somehow so far, including most of DLC I bought; you have to submit a ticket and beg;- the company still 'reserves the right' to collect personal info about its customers, and use it at their own discretion, which may or may not include selling to third-parties for targeted advertisement, or maybe submitting to goverments, who knows; if you play long time and build up some fortune and in-game assets, and friendly community, when ToS change you have a choice - either allow to spy on you, or abandon everything and quit the game;- in-game shop does contain 'pay-to-win' items that allow progress faster and cut the corners (experience scrolls, powerful potions, research scrolls, mount training scrolls), despite the fact that company's representative denies it; you either spend real money to buy those, or grind for weeks or even months.No, I do not recommend this game. It became something different than what I loved years ago.Update Dec 22, 2023: No, I still dont recommend this game and I probably will quit altogether. Imagine many player guilds buying cheap items from NPC vendors then selling those items in guild vendors scamming unsuspecting players, newcomers. The company ignores tickets, forum posts being deleted after many players commenting its ok to scam newbies because its free market and its newbies' fault for being scammed. This raises many questions about moral compass of this game's community and the company who tolerates malicious activities with obvious evil intent, ignoring legit concerns."
Negative,"I enjoyed this game for quite some time, but not only is the balance a joke, and game breaking bugs becoming increasingly abundant, but they nickel and time you to a point it feels more like a mobile game in the monetization than a proper MMOI'd sooner recommend WoW than this thing"
Negative,"Dont get this game if:-You don't like grindy, boring gameplay-You aren't a fan of in game purchases-You have a mediocre internet connection-You are a fan of The Elder Scrolls seriesDo get this game if:-You get turned on by stunning graphics-You are a fan of awesome character creation"
Negative,Opens GameMakes CharacterGrabs Bow WeaponAttempts Block Can't BlockHolding Right Click per InstructionsSpam Click Right ClickGame CrashesNow can't open the game. 10/10
Negative,"This is a review based off customer support. If you buy this game and run into an issue, even a simple one and cannot login or play, expect that to never get fixed."
Negative,To much of this game is dlc if eso6 is like this i wont be buying it
Negative,"0.05mb left to download, error.Go to Hell both Zenimax and ToddTheGreedLord."
Negative,"I love Elder Scrolls and I played this game for a while. I enjoyed it then (I think), but going into it now, the menus and interface are extremely clunky and the combat is very repeitive and simple. There are cooldown timers for most artisan crafts (forging, smelting, cooking, etc.) that are painfully long, and the story isn't that interesting. It is cheap and requires not subscription, so buy it if interested or on sale, but no more than that."
Negative,"It's either the game's launcher isn't working well or the Steam integration isn't working well. But i was unable to start the game as it was complaining about inability to connect to steam, when i actually just launched it from the Steam a second ago. Login to Zenimax page using the steam account wasn't working either.So if you like to play the game when you actually doubleclick it - this isn't the game for you, it's very clear. But if you like to troubleshoot installations, integrations, connectivity issues, contact support, google for error codes etc - please, enjoy."
Negative,"- Creates character carefully choosing the faction- Goes through tutorial that teaches movement and combat- Arrives at Morrowind, collects skyshards- Finds out factions don't actually matter- Steals things for money, 0 gold given for each item- Arrives at first city, gets a quest to talk to benefactor- Gets sent to a new tutorial phase that teaches how to loot items, combat, and what skyshards are-Gets sent back to place they just came from, story says its your first time there"
Negative,"I have purchased this game and spent some time playing it, but after seeing the recent ""You Belong Here"" trailer, I don't want to have anything to do with this ever again, and I am very ashamed to admit I've wasted my time on this 🤮"
Negative,"So they gave a limited time to play it for free. I downloaded the game and took a lot of space in my drive approximately 70 Gigabytes. Once I opened it, the ESO launcher downloaded more stuff into my drive for patches for the game. What I can't understand that as soon as everything is installed, and all you have to do is to login to their servers I get an Internal Error to both NA and EU! Tried to repair, check the status of their servers, and restart the game a bunch of times. I live in the Philippines and I used Steam to launch this game for those who want to know. In conclusion, I am really disappointed to not even try the game itself and I hope they try fix the issue but I will never try to download this game again."
Negative,"Bethesda seems to be following in Ubisoft’s footsteps, churning out disappointing content. If Starfield is any indication, the next Elder Scrolls will likely fall short as well. Don’t expect a strong story. If you’re lucky you might get a non-binary companion instead."
Negative,Cant log in...
Negative,not my cup of tea.
Negative,the game is pretty good but the pvp system is unfortunately an almost unplayable dead joke you'll prolly enjoy GW2 more in most areasMy rating: 3/5
Negative,"if you have a bunch of friends, eso can be very fun gameQuests:- story modes are boring, and get repetitive after 3 quests, like the rest of the game- the npc audio is like netflix autoplay, everyone wants them off, but company wont allow it Buy to play:- any chance of decent experience, will require the monthly subscription- anythng worth having is behind (usually several) dlcsxend game:- you ll spend 20-30 minutes looking for a group, to play a 5 minute group eventif you just want an mmo keep looking.if you have a friend group, can recommend."
Negative,"This may or may not be a good game. I tried it during a free play weekend to see if I was going to enjoy it as much as I enjoy the traditional Elder Scroll and Fallout games. Unfortunately, after downloading the game from Steam twice and spent several hours trying different solutions, I am still unable to get the Zenimax installer to operate correctly and the game is still not ready for play. From what I have read online installation has been and continues to be a hit or miss proposition and Zenimax shows no sign of being able to solve the problem. If and when Bethesda and Zenimax resolve these problems I will consider buying it. Until then I will get more entertainment from a pair of socks."
Negative,"I didn't play this game for long, but I want to share my experience with it.The game is very confusing and not friendly to players that are trying to start the game. They drop you in this world and don't tell you what to do and where to go. You start as a very weak creature and you keep dying, because you can not handle the amount of enemies they threw at you. I trying to get into this game  times and both times it just didn't feel fun or interactive for me. So definitely not very friendly for people who are just trying to start. I have pretty powerful computer and usually play games on high quality graphics. In the ESO I was only able to play it on low. Whenever I put it on Medium it bugs and doesn't run smoothly. So everything looked horrible and primitive to me.Did I mention that it will take a ton of space on your PC too? I would not recommend to buy this game. They run free trials time by time - get it then and try it first, before you buy it."
Negative,"As it is today this game, if you dont already have all the endgame stuff you need., is impossible to enjoy. Ive decided to quit and cansle my sub. The game preformances and comunity is beond repair. They have destroyed one of the greatest games of all time due to lack of care for the product and evolution of game comunity. Also dumed down the game to a point where any other game like it would sufice. The only reason for an end game player like me with all the achivements to return is for the pvp , bgs and new dungeons., but the groupfinder is BROKEN after they patched it to work and they dont even care. They focus on puting out more and more content into an already broken game instead of fixing everyhting that is broken to make the game enjoyable."
Negative,"The first quest you will be entrusted with is making an account to play the game. Of course each individual account is linked to an individual game key, because Bethesda doesn't want to miss a single penny of your money. Now that I have forgot one of the names I put on my account I am not allowed to play a fully priced game that I payed for. Additionally, DLC is forty dollars for one expansions. You buy this from crowns not money...."
Negative,"I have never had so many problems trying to start playing a game that I paid for. I've been trying for 1h to play this damn game and I can't use my ""steam linked"" account because it wants me to buy the game first (which I have). I created a separate account and it wouldn't use that either.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!"
Negative,The gameplay at first seems to be exspansive and exiting after an hour or so it becomes quite bland and repetitive
Negative,"Asked for 85gb, then asked for 65 more. No."
Negative,"it is not working, i'm stuck at loading screen"
Negative,Dont waste your money i spent 70 min troubleshooting the game to get it to work to no avil not worth buying off steam
Negative,"I'm not a big fan of MMO's, but I gave it a try. Well, it might be better than others, but it still a fracking, lame MMO nonetheless. The quests has no real challange and it's pretty disappointing (at least for me) that instead of NPCs who are trying to behave like ""normal"" people of the realm, you see people running and jumping around everywhere.So, I'm still waiting for a real, OFFLINE, SINGLE PLAYER Elder Scrolls game!"
Negative,"A relatively fun mmo if you enjoy cock and ball torture. The funniest part of the game is the character creation where you name your Toons anything until randomly months later Zenmax bans your for your name Rip ""Boundless storm inma ballz"""
Negative,"Game seems to be getting worse over time as server performence is deteriorating while the cash store becomes more ridiculous.Many basic and essecial UI perks and game mechanics are lacking.The worst drop rates I've seen in the industry.Overall, another ""could've been great"" but can't recommend to friends."
Negative,"This game is quite redundant and doesn't offer much new to the genre. As a MMO veteran since EQ1/UO days I like to try most MMOs out there. I got to max level and got CP120 or so. The content is pretty stale, combat is pretty mindless and limited. I obtained my level etc by just doing daily dungeon and running Dolmens a bit. Joined a guild and ran around in PVP area. Pretty empty and numbers dependent. Can't recommend people paying for this type of content."
Negative,"As any other game it has a good side and a bad side, story is good, inmersion is good but the combat sucks, being an stamina class on this game is awful since sprint, dodge, block, interrupt and sneak all cost stamina the game basically forces you to play magicka."
Negative,Backing up and reinatalling the game is a Royal Pain in the Arse.I won't be buying anything from Bethesda again. Ever.[And they wonder why folks download cracked games]Not worth the money - not even on sale.
Negative,Fascist Company. Extremely self-righteous and hateful staff.
Negative,"Grind, grind, grind to the point you are worn out. The only excitement is when ZOS rolls out a new expansion."
Negative,"Laggy, bugs all the time, crashes, log in issues. You would think after being in business for however many years, they could figure this shit out. No wonder why its a dying game. very sad."
Negative,"snowflake of a game. got banned for littlebrownman as a name. say its discriminatory, sexually graphic, hateful, harmful, or excretory in nature but also rates the game Mature 17+ (blood and gore, sexual theme, use of alcohol, violence)"
Negative,"I couldn't get through the early game. New player experience is incredibly boring, skills are very one-dimensional and boring like ""slash an enemy for x damage"", and they don't seem to work with multiple players even when stated that they affect multiple players. Very slow gameplay and honestly way too easy, i couldnt die if i tried most of the time. I killed my first boss at around lvl 6 even though it took a while for me to kill it, simply just because the one healing ability i had unlocked outhealed the damage of everything the boss threw at me. The boss also dropped nothing, which is hilarious. Poorly executed concept that is too slow and not nearly chaotic enough for what should be set in the elder scrolls universe,"
Negative,"I've never experienced a game with such a terrible launcher. I've spent over a week in contact with support and they just give you answers from their knowledge base without actually trying to figure out what the real problem is. In the end they just tell you to go look online for a solution and then they just close your ticket and forget about you. They don't offer any real support to players that have any tech problems with this game. It's worth trying, but if you have any problems with the launcher at all, just get a refund, because if you have problems now, and you actually manage to get it to work, expect more problems down the road, and their team won't be able to help you through the multitude of problems that this games launcher has. Find something better to play."
Negative,"I have followed you since the beginning, tried your difference Elder Scrolls releases.In this release it was tried to make an Online version of their game, a combination of online multiplayer but it failed horribly IMO and many others.The game feels boring, and very non interesting, It feels like I'm playing some old Elder Scrolls combined with a bad WOW copy.I AM a fan of your Oblivion and Skyrim releases and I know this is not the same, but that said there is a ton of online games like what you tried to make here. It is good but not good enough to beat the kings in this genre that there is at the moment, but I know what EVERYONE wants from you! I'm not kidding!Every single one of those whom has played Oblivion and Skyrim will agree with me  if they have any sense for originality, you should NOT go for MMO but concentrate on ""Skyrim Online Co-Op"" concept and expansions.You should have made ""Skyrim Co-Op Online"" so it is Skyrim with Online Co-Op gameplay.It would be easy to make as  you have the game  already made, no change other then these few things when playing Co-Op. - More mobs with raised mixed lvl - Ability to play up to 4 players in Online Co-Op - When Co-Op all players should follow same story line, if one player activate a mission other players will also get mission achivements and so on. - more items, gold, that will be even distributed to the players. - The most important is that you KEEP Skyrim as it IS, with Dragons and all, from now on you can make expansions with more mobs, better graphic packs, Online Co-Op and so on.More can be added later on as expansions and so on.I personally think it would become a bigger hit then eny of your former releases"
Negative,"On Xbox and Steam, I have a combined 3,400 hours (give or take), all the while paying for ESO Plus (Xbox only).After hearing about the new companions, I will no longer be paying for ESO Plus.Know that the companions they are adding into the game are an optional purchase, the fact that they are adding real world, nonsensical, meaningless feeling politics into the game, is a no go for me and many other players.The game itself is amazing and I loved to explore the world, but no longer."
Negative,"This would be a 3/4 start game, but the fact that it's frequently not possible to login makes it a 1 star game (-1, actually). It's 2023 the issues of server / bandwidth are problems that are easily solved by competent software developers."
Negative,"Got it while it was free and played for a few hours. It's decent, i love the first person and 3rd person view, i really hope they keep the scroll distance like that in ES6. The helmet details for other races is finally there, i also hope desperately they take that into the next elder scrolls. It reminds me of oblivion but with way better graphics. The UI is better than skyrim IMO, i hated how bland and depressing skyrim UI looked so this was a definite plus for me. Farming feels pretty good, i loved mining, it was really satisfying. I dread if they go back to how you mine in skyrim when the next elder scrolls comes out. The character creator is pretty awesome, they are definitely improving. I did expect characters to look a little ugly for a MMO but its pretty good for one. Combat and animations is kind of clunky, and the bow animation is really bad. No changes to it yet and i saw people ask for that nearly 9 years ago so i really don't have much confidence in stuff like that changing for the better. I just got turned off from seeing all the little QoL things they could have added like other MMO's do. I looked up how to get a torch and you have to buy it from the crown store, use an emote or find another source of light in some quest later. I just felt kind of defeated and didn't want to put time into the game anymore if i was going to keep finding stuff like this. I also wasn't much of a fan seeing classes and races locked behind paywalls, i feel like that should be going towards cosmetics, not in game activities and builds.Overall i would give it a 6/10 for pulling it together a bit since the release. I just expected a lot more from it since i come from other MMO games that did better in quality of life (though not by much). To be fair i barely put in any time and this is a huge game so this rating is kind of pointless lol. Can't wait to see ES6 and play my favorite khajiits to death!EDIT: I put some more hours into it and the grind was pretty fun. Then i found that players could steal chests and resources as it was first come first serve. Apparently public dungeons also do this for chests. I do not like that at all and i can't find any other reason that would be implemented other than trying to make the game more grindy. I don't want to be punished or punish others for playing together or helping out. This game definitely ruins coop experience in my opinion."
Negative,why i cannot start game? only connecting after start?
Negative,"bad game, no bugs, not as buggy as skyrim"
Negative,Tried to install twice. Told me my 1TB free HDD space wasn't enough. Wish me luck on getting a refund. Buy straight from ESO site
Negative,"If you like the elder scrolls games and the gameplay, don't bother with this game. If you enjoy MMOs and games of that sort then this game is for you."
Negative,"This game is utter shit.It is extremely bland. You get none of what you feel from Skyrim, or any ES game for that matter. Look at Fallout76. That's just multiplayer Fallout 4. Not the best, but hey, it's multiplayer Fallout, nonetheless. This game however, is something else entirely.You can't pick up whatever you want and move it around like 76, the combat system is an extremely bland repetitive routine of spamming the exact same moves for the exact same monster, with a different texture applied to it at best. The monsters don't flinch when you hit them, the animations are locked in and can't really be interrupted, there's no depth to any of it. It's just bland. I would rather play New World.They released an Arcanist class which can just 1-tap you. I've just lost a full bar of health in Cyrodiil out of nowhere, not only from few arcanists, but the hackers that are in the game as well. A common thing that happens is someone will turn into a werewolf, go invincible, and just wreak havoc on non-hackers. Type of garbage you leave back in 2012 games.Overall, this shits bland as a muthafukka. The only reason I play it is when I get a free week of plus, then I can get lore behind some of the locations, which is canon to the other games. I was glad to learn of how the Dunmer disappeared, but it was a very lackluster, bland, kill this bring me that questline, all for a random purple item at the end. Just garbage..."
Negative,300 hours of grinding and im only level 400. I would rather grinding BDO if i have to play 1k hours
Negative,I cant create a character without getting disconnected :( There goes $200/10
Negative,"Game wouldn't even download. Decided to try it out during the Free Period, but after hours of downloading it would stop and say it was ""Missing File Privileges"", tried looking up fixes in Discussions, Online, and the Main Site, but everything I found to fix it did absolutely nothing."
Negative,"you could beat this game blindfolded, no challenge whatsoever..."
Negative,Unexpected error when attempting to log into their servers. Excellent...
Negative,"I really tried to get into it, I just don't understand the questing system and I don't like that you literally have to pay to get into area's and access quests that really dumb to put into an mmo"
Negative,Takes forever to get into the game in the first place.....downloads and more downloads and then verifying those downloads.......don't buy in 2020 or later
Negative,"It's still garbage..... Just less garbage if you don't play with others, do pvp and it will tell you everything about zenimax."
Negative,"Sadly the game cares more about your money and your in game time than your enjoyment. Alas I still play it because my friends are on it. Be ready for some crazy amounts of grind, and tight restrictions on inventory space, amount of stolen items you can sell daily, storing even the smallest amount of loot, and and overpriced economy made to get you to spend unbelievable amounts of time on everything(aint nobody got time for that). ESO sends me running back to modded Skyrim"
Negative,PVP is impossible to play without spending many days first to upgrade your character. Otherwise you'd be dying to everyone. You would spend 90% of your time travelling to battlefield at nearest fortress considering how slow your mount is before you buff your speed
Negative,Gameplay ripped straight from Guild Wars 2. Forces more items onto you than you have inventory space for to try and sell you their subscription for proper inventory space. Microtransaction and lootbox hell that's shoved in your face since minute one. Do yourself a favor and go play Skyrim Together instead.
Negative,"The game itself looks great, has a ton of stuff to use to make it your own.The game play reminds me of Dungeon Seige, upgraded to be sure, but it feels very reminiscent.The one thing I would tell folks about the game, stay away from crowns, or really ANY purchases using real money.Te forums are awash with a long list of instances of people buying crowns and either taking days (5 or more) to get them, or they simply do not get them at all and ""support"" simply ignores them.I am on day 7, after buying the game and a few add on packs.  Of the 7000 crowns I should have, I have the 500 for the game and 1500 from a pack.  Support said to wait three days, (and a whole list of other hoops to jump through), I completed everything they asked, then they stopped responding altogether.Day 7, about to be day 8, with no response from Bethesda support or Steam support.My advice,  Dont buy it and if you do, DONT buy anything expecting to get crowns."
Negative,If you're looking for a good Elder Scrolls game look elsewhere because you will not find one here.
Negative,Graphics are dated and cheesy
Negative,game is nice and all but don't buy it from steam if you don't want to waste your playtime. Buy the game from the developer site
Negative,Scaled right to the recycle bin.
Negative,"Even in 2023,  it has so much bugs and issues with performance and fps drops that makes the game unplayable"
Negative,70 hrs in and not a single sweet roll? Dissapointed
Negative,"I have been trying to get my game to work for the past 3 hours, I have not gotten to play at all. My game is forever stuck in the log in screen, and it never times out. As most log in screen simulators go, this one didn't have bad tunes. But unfortunately, I never got to see the character creator. This was the most cheap digital brick that I have purchased with a weight of over a hundred Gb"
Negative,"I tried this game for a while and was a big fan of similar games, but the truly game ruining restrictions for inventory/bag/bank limits makes this unplayable. Other than that it was okay, but having to use other player slots just to hold inventory is not enjoyable. The do need to get paid obviously, but it seems to me their pricing model was off. They need to balance it more so that people can plan the game with these restrictions and just encourage people for optional extras."
Negative,"Terrible game imo. The combat is really really bad. You will be smashing 1-5 all the time or spamming LMB. Your fingers will get sore. Constant DCs at log in screen, at character selection screen and when loading between areas. I would get in game and decide, hey lets kill some monsters , but they're so few its a pain in the ass and you're forced to quest. You have to add addons for any sort of QoL improvements, such as quest tracker, minimap, hotbar.I did enjoy the story and I did listen / read through all the dialouge for the first 10 levels or so, then you hit the ""big"" zones and you are bombarded with quests from all direction, slow talking NPCs so you just spam E thru them. Quests then devolve into repeatbale kill quests or talk to NPC quest blah blah blah. They offer vast customization but in reality there's classes/races which are better suited for certain things and same with skills. There's lots of skills but chances are you won't be unlocking them cause A) they're useless B) they don't go along with your weapon. Example, playing a bow weilding nightblade , well too bad nightblade only has skills that are meele.TLDR: Animations suck, combat sucks, questing is ok till you are overwhlemed with a million quests with meaningless objectives (save them, kill x rats, talk to him etc) Garbage game, do not bother picking up. Maybe it would've been ok if this was 2007 but nowadays I expect more."
Negative,"1, Download the game with steam at 100%2, Run3. Wants to install a second time, dfq?4, Launcher says it doesn't have enough space, need 20gb more....5, After a hour or so installing, it finally completes, and it ain't required not even a gb more so IDC why it said that it needs...Idc what it ""installed"" in the first place as I already downloaded everything with steam beforehand, but guess quality game development hits hard there...Login:Asks for my age.After accepting a half dozen of wall of texts it asks my age again, not like I wrote it in 10s before it, the quality development clearly visible...Game is ugly as fuck.There are no auto graphic setting setup at first launch in 2018... no problem, I adjust it by hand.Still ugly, but at least it's no longer pixilated.There are loots of customization options.But too bad 99% of them are extremely UGLY. Anyway, let's jsut play:Pros:-You can steal, kill the citizens-Complex craftingNeutral:-It runs smoothly. It would be a pro, however with such graphic it ain't hard to achieve smooth gameplay.Cons:-Terrible combat. Ppls joke that wow going to have simpler combat than a MOBA, which is true, however this game literately have simpler combat than a moba, lol...-Since the combat is terrible, the PvP is terrible too.-The skills/spells/talents/etc not complex enough. Literately, lol is much more complex than this MMORPG....-Ugly characters. Even wow have nicer looking heroes.-Bag space is not enough, and the whole system is terrible. A single apple takes up as much room that a 2H Axe does...-Retarded design, like you can only create items one at a time. And creating a single food or drink item not even gives 20% of a level, so hf clicking / waiting dozen of times to level it up.Oh and each food item takes up a extra slot?I wanted to dismantle a sword, it required 4 empty bag space and guess what I got in exchange? Nothing...Why does it requires so much empty bag space if it ain't gives not even a single stuff?This game is good to have fun with the friends, like run around, explore and stuff, but it ain't ended up begin a failure for no reason... It's a great singleplayer MMO..."
Negative,"I saw that this was free for trial. Expected to try it out and love it, considering I've loved every MMO I've played...instead i uninstalled it 4 hours after the tutorial. The funnest part was designing my character .Super boring, the quests are not interesting. It makes playing with friends extremely difficult and hard to grasp. For a MMO, the multiplayer accessibility is very disappointing. Sometimes the voices between two characters sounds like one person talking to themselves. The quests are a series of button mashing and boring paragraphs. I'm completely let down after this game, and i forced all my friends to try it anticipating great things, but it ended in us yawning and uninstalling after a few hours of struggling to figure out how to share a quest, and never finding a single interesting mission. I didn't expect it to just be multiplayer Skyrim, but I expected more than whatever that was. Ashamed i made my friends play thisOther than that, the skill tree were fascinated and the ONLY incentive to keep playing so you could duel your friends and beat them because other monster were that boring.  Would not recommend unless you need to be put to sleep"
Negative,"Pros: - Some really good main and side quests here and there with fun characters- Fun levelling- Monetization is not too badCons: - Terrible combat and clunky movement- Dull classes and builds- Graphics average at best- VERY bad combat (repeating for emphasis)- Definitely not dead but not nearly as active as its peers- Has probably one of the worst PvP experiences I've had in an MMO- Did I say it has truly bad combat?I did not expect anything nearly as immersive and rich as Skyrim when I started playing, so my expectation were low, but after 100 hours I can safely say this game is even worse than that. Its below average as an MMO experience and definitely not something you should play if you are looking for a Skyrm-like RPG experience."
Negative,Neverwinter has more content for free and dont charges you for 10€ for fucking PVP
Negative,"This sure is a game! I like the character customization, but other than that, it's sort of... unremarkable? The NPCs, story, environments etc are all just kind of ""eh""."
Negative,"too confusing for beginners it needs to start off simple then slowly introduce game aspects slowly. The website doesn't help the graphics and combat are wack, like it looks like games from before i even existed."
Negative,"As a PvP player this game still has many flaws. While I do still play it, this is mostly from a community standpoint (a small selection of the community) that keeps me here.They don't update PvPThe community is mostly toxicLots of inbalances in the game still.UPDATE: This game is still ass. Do not buy if you like PvP.UPDATE UPDATE: game is still Omega ass.UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE: Game's newest BG update is bad."
Negative,"Apologies I cannot give this a well-rounded review, see I could only bare playing it for a little over an hour before I realised that not only is this game NOT for Elder Scrolls fans, but was developed entirely without any of the standards of the previous games. It starts with a lacklustre character generator. Totally impossible, I imagine, to create a truly unique looking individual, or even just a freak like in previous games. The textures also look recycled from TES3: Morrowind. The hair modelling certainly is. And the range of bodily customisation ranges from average heighted woman before Christmas lunch to tallish man after Christmas lunch. The post-Christmas lunch analogy will continue because it felt like I was on the verge of falling asleep for the reminaing minutes I played. I had to choose a faction, without the game explaining the significance of the factions and then choose a class, because it seems you will not be doing whatever you want in this game. I chose a dark elf assassin. Or whatever they'd chosen to represent ""assassin"" in this game. ""Twilight Stabber"" I think it was called.As I had chosen a dark elf, I was, yet again, starting as a prisoner just off the boat in Morrowind. At this point I am wondering if the entirety of TESOnline is just a pale imitation of the previous games. Like a collection of the various regions with ""lite"" stuck on the end. Anyway, some sneaky girl met me in my prison to let me know she was rescuing me. Punched her in the face a few times to test out the combat and then proceeded to look for a few bits of tat in order to progress the quest. I was sneaking about but there seemed to be no baddies about. I believe I was coming towards the end of the quest when I needed to go to the toilet. On my return I couldn't be arsed playing another moment, so exited the game and promptly reclaimed those 80Gbs.The graphics look like a game from a decade ago, even when I'm running them on ultra, which is funny because you'd assume an 80-fucking-gigabyte game download would have something nice to look at. I don't think I even saw a single shadow in the game. I was just walking about in a sort of omni-lit grayish brown collection of plants and buildings. The UI is shit. Makes Skyrim's original inventory system seem genius. It looks and operates like a game you try a demo of from an old PCZone cover disc, whose name you'd never even heard of before, but because you're bored, you're giving it a try anyway. Mousing over items in the world to detect whether they are interactable or not is hell. Some items are, some are not, whilst using identical models. Which means you spend ages trying to find a couple lootable barrels in a cellar full of barrels. Also the tooltip is very hit or miss. Sometimes it shows up when you mouse over something, sometimes not. You'll undoubtedly end up leaving behind some special treasures.Only fought that sneaky girl at the start, so have no idea what the real combat is like, though it becomes apparent that you start unlocking timed abilities you activate with 1-6 etc. Like WoW or other games that are not an Elder Scrolls game. There was sound and music I'm sure but made so little an impression on me, I can't quite recall. At least that means it wasn't jarringly shit.I am giving this a 2/10. It is terrible and the download is abysmally large for the poor quality of game you get for it. I did get to play it for free on their free week though, so that's why it's a 2 and not a 1, though I shan't be ticking the ""got this for free"" checkbox, as the download itself cost me time and patience.EDIT:I forgot to mention the fanbase. Genuine ultra nerds who fanboy so hard they cannot see the shit for the shit in their eyes. They talk like TESOnline is the king of games/MMOs, when it's clearly just a moneygrab by Bethesda. It is in no way representive of the REAL Elder Scrolls games, yet because it has ""Elder Scrolls"" in the title, they fool themselves into thinking it's fine, that it's genuine, that it's not just a trinket to play with while Bethesda get their act together and sort out TES6.Here's a selection of the retardatry these dickheads say:- ""you clearly do not know what an MMORPG is""- ""I kindly suggest you go back to cod where you belong. ESO doesn't need toxic kids like you.""- ""Im so glad you dislike ESO.""- ""On behalf of the ESO community, thank you for leaving and not bothering us any further with your pathetic life.""- ""Nerds like you get destroyed with 0 effort in ESO and since you're too dumb to figure out how the game works, you cry here instead. It happens a lot.""and my personal favourite, cringe-inducing comment:- ""You wouldn't last a single second in the easiest dungeon of ESO.""It's painfully obvious that if you say anything negative about anything, the indoctrinated will do all they can to attack you rather than defend their view. It's the same in modern politics with social justice warriors. All passion and zero reasoning. Very childish.I think I will make it a 1/10."
Negative,I wanted to like this more than I do. It is a good game but feels like a job. Every MMO feels like a job to some degree but this one has me feeling stressed by level 20(of50)... Roommate bought it so we could play together... still felt like a job.
Negative,"Game is insanely boring.  Quests are garbage, and involve talking to several different people over and over again, and then maybe you go kill some incredibly easy mob once and then go back to your marathon circuit.  Game isn't an adventure rpg, it's a walking/talking simulator, and I've been told it doesn't get fun until the END GAME lmao.  I'm not wasting hundreds of hours just to MAYBE get to the fun part at the very end.  TLDR: Beginning of the game is far too boring to hold my attention, didn't bother playing the rest."
Negative,I feel bad as this game was bought for me by a friend. But this is the most boring lifeless MMO I've ever played in my life. I'd need a lobotomy to want to play this game. What on earth were the developers thinking? Who is this game for? It certainly isn't for Elder Scrolls fans. It isn't worth the space on my harddrive.Uninstalled.
Negative,"Don't you hate it when you play a game so great that time passes you by without you even noticing. Well forget about that sheety feeling with this boring repettitive re-skin for Runescape while you complete fetch quest after fetch quest followed with a mediocre voice acting. Did you loved the gameplay mechanichs, the graphic style and the general ambient feeling of the original games? Well have none of that with this generic click smasher-equipment driven-lvl aimed excuse of a game.Now seriously, if you're looking for an elder scrolls game with an online aspect don't go for this. This is just a Generic MMORPG with TES lore where you don't even need to interact with other players."
Negative,"This game is aweful and comes nowhere close to the Elder Scrolls experience you are undoubtedly buying it for. The first thing to note is the 3 hours I had to wait to download 75 GB of data for a game that is entirely online. In addition to the aweful leveling system and other gameplay issues, loading screens take forever and you wil be logged out of your ESO account at random. Also, if you intend to download it to try and just get a refund if you don't like it, be careful. Between installing that takes place after you've launched the game and the incredibly long initial loading screen that takes you to character creation you'll already be an hour or so into your 2 hour limit for a refund, and there's not a garuntee that a bug that prevents you from typing your name won't make you go through the same loading screen a second time because you had to relaunch the game."
Negative,"this game gets worse every year, not to sure if theyve lost there mojo for it or just allowing there worst few teams to keep it going but the lack luster feeling from these cash dlcs are a joke , not only do they now make the most boring looking zones they might create somthing that seems fun like the new scribing system and then completly ruin it by a tiedious questline and then make all the scribing leads be in ways you never do like imp city dailys , world event dailys etc forcing you to go and fill the ares a game that are dead. fun seems to be a element this game no longer has and is just a misserasble experinece to play now . year 1 to 3 10/10 now its simpy a 5/10 game"
Negative,no cross progression
Negative,"Not a rewarding experience, barely worth the effort it takes to progress"
Negative,"Don't let the cool movies fool you, this game is tired and looooooonnnnnnggggg!    In fact, you can't even get the cool stuff unless you pay even more, monthly.  Controls are clunky, lots and lots and lots and lots of reading.  Awful!"
Negative,"I love this game but the issues involved..... I do not know how they were able to survive so long. Ridiculous information are thrown into the air to justify disabling PROC sets recently in PVP play to satisfy some PVP players..... Helloooooo!?! Its PVP! Every loss to another player is blamed on something. Slow server, PROC sets, unfair settings.....Listen here, I paid hard earned money, to buy your DLCs, so that I can collect those ""PROC Sets"", to use them. Now you say I cannot use them, what about a refund on 1} time spent to grind for the sets, 2) Money spent for the DLCs. You talk about ""more enjoyment"" in PVP removing PROC sets.... what about ""fairness"" to your paying customers? In my opinion, this game does not equitably reward its customers for time and money spent, better off playing something else."
Negative,"It's pretty sad that this game is one of the top MMOs as of today. MMOs really did not evolve, they have degenerated in many aspects.The combat is just a traditional TAB target system in disguise and it plays just like that.I can't wait for New World. One of the few MMOs that really bring something different to the table in terms of combat mechanics."
Negative,"What can I say about the game when it has a well known bug that doesn't allow the launcher to run the game? Zenimax knows about it and still won't fix it, but instead blames you, the customer. Not worth it. There are plenty of top tier MMOs out there, so avoid this one until it's fixed."
Negative,What used to be a solid RPG that took itself seriously has deteriorated into a WoW style clown show of cosmetic selling. I guess the almighty dollar wins over staying true to your product. It really sets a poor tone for any future Elder Scrolls games.
Negative,pay to win unbalanced trash bag dog shit game.
Negative,Games very toxic and just not fun anymore its all zergs if your a casual player you will not enjoy this
Negative,I really wanted to like this game.... After playing swtor and liking that game I kinda felt like a New mmo was in order... Wow I was really wrong... The story is really not gripping and lacks the passion other elder scrolls games have. The combat is ehhh it is really good for an MMO and it is one of the better points of the game. Armor early on is drab and boring and no real variation can be found. As I have said I really wanted to like this game but its boring story and its empty feeling left me bored and leaving it for other games.... I am I die hard Elder Scrolls and Bethesda fan but this game did not hold my attention... I would save your 60$ for something else. Its just not all that great.
Negative,"If you've played an MMO before then you'll recognize all the usual stuff. Sprawling slandscapes, resource nodes, random quest givers that have you do trivial tasks...What you won't recognize is the complete lack of class fantasy. Use class abilities that require magicka? You're using cloth armor and a staff. Doesn't matter what your class is. Sneaky Nightblade assassin, cloth and a staff. Dragonknight? Cloth and a staff. Want to actually play to your class's fantasy? Too bad, you're massively gimping yourself.For me, what keeps me playing any MMO is playing out that class fantasy. If you show me my character with a sword and shield in heavy armor during the character creation screen, then you better let me play as that. ESO doesn't."
Negative,"Here's why you shouldn't play this game.  You, your friends, and all content is scaled to Champion level 160.  As you pass level 50 and start earning Champion points and get towards 160 points your character will actually feel weaker.  As you pass Champion point 160 you will finally start to feel ""endgamey"".  This is the laziest and clumsiest attempt at ""getting players together"" I have ever seen from an MMO.  Thank god this did not catch on in the other MMOs, holy crap.  (I'm sure it did to some small extent)  And at no point is this explained to the new player.  Enemy levels are hidden from the start.Yikes."
Negative,"Tried to play during the free play period, all I've ever seen is ""Login Error: Connection to server timed out. Please try again later.""Garbage"
Negative,this games server is real bad i purchesed this game 2016 i still cant play couse of server i allways got error message when i trying to login. i requested assistant from dev's they sad cant help i ask from my isp they also cant help. i jast trowed my 13$ to trash.  also i tried to play in steam platform still cant login. dont buy this game untel they fix..
Negative,"Just downloaded this for the Free-to-Play period and already stuck on ""Requesting Login"" for the entire duration of my ""Play Time."" (~80mins) Was actually considering on buying this but if it's like this after spending money on it then hell no."
Negative,"I bought this game as i had friends that played.  I figured it would be a good time.  prepare for two overnight download events one when you buy the game throught steam and another when the game updates through the third party.  Then my experience was consistant crashes EVERY time when loading the game through steam.  I finally found the direct launcher and was able to make an account and finished an intial quest line to get to the first area.  When i tried to get to the first area I had about a 30 minute load wait for the area which never completed.  Finially decided to exit the game so I would be able to request the refund.  I may try it again in a couple of years if the game is still around and the loading issues get fixed but right now I can't reccommend the game.  BTW I have a new tower, max memory and a  T1 connection.  Not an issue of hardware on my end."
Negative,Patches are hell.
Negative,"So many bugs. At the first start with launcher Errors. Then they can't even send you a email to login your account. Full of bullshit. Bethesta basically dead company , someone should throw on their graveyard some soil."
Negative,Scalling totaly destroys this game. It's not RPG.If I want to play Necromancer I have to pay for DLC...
Negative,"GAME DOES NOT RUN. gives me an error after multiples reinstallations. ""the application was unable to start correctly (0xc00007b)"". Even upgraded windows and downloaded multiple .dll redists. Support wont respond to any emails, junk...."
Negative,"Meh, It's 2021 now and it feels like I'm playing a game from 2000. The Hexagons are hughe! Sai Sahan's head looks like a fucking Turtle shell! :) Buuuuut. the stories are at least mediocre with a hugh percetange of %0 of twists! So it's got that going for it. Apparently you can make friends but all I see are some cool costumes that people have paid additional monies for, And the occasional dudes zipping past so out of synch with the NPC's It's like ""oh fuck there goes a dude; Where was I anyway, what quest was I on again"" cuz it takes you out of the game worse than a slap across the face. Oh, and I forgot to CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION SO I WAS CHARGED OVER $150!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BIIIIITTTTTTCCCCCCCHHHHHEEEEESSSSSS! fUCK I'M PISSED.  :)"
Negative,"This game had a lot of promises, and I respect a lot of things they did to kind of revolutionize the genre, like being able to go any where, and not be restricted by your levels.  EVERY MMO should follow this design, thank you so much ESO for thinking outside of the box.It also has a lot of good classic RPG elements like stealing loot, and getting busted for it, then having to pay the guards.Sadly...... too much about this game still feels like a normal MMORPG.  Targeting combat ( which they say it does't have, but it does)Fighting the same mobs over, and over again even though this is supposed to be more explorative I found my self killing the same group of 3 mobs to level up.  Classic mmo run here talk to this guy, run there talk to that guy style, uninteresting quests.THE BIG COMPLAINT:  Another thing they claimed was that you can enter pvp at level 10, and it will be balanced in such a way that you could still be useful, deal damage, and not just get one shotted, your stats scale up, but it is pretty useless still, and you might as well be a naked level 1.  Don't bother pvping at level 10 like they say you can do, you will be doing 0 damage, and dying instantly."
Negative,"Story seems bad, Morrowind poorly recreated, quests are incredibly lame, the introduction is stiff and seems like a budget project. You don't feel creeped out at all, as a matter of fact you don't even feel like spending the time reading the dialogues.Plusside is the classes, skillsystem and crafting. But i didnt get to explore it much.2/10"
Negative,"Recently ESO for me just disappeared from my library. When ever I visit the store it says I already have it even though it is not in my library. Its a real shame too because other people have been having the same issues. I am currently trying to fix the problem but honestly this well polished and good game should even have a problem like this. I really would give this a good review if I could just play through the rest of it. Bethesda support doesn't even address the problem on their website, not even Zenimaxs' website either."
Negative,"The game is way too easy. I just go from quest to quest killing whatever is in my way with nothing really posing much of a threat. The quest aren't intriguing enough for me to pay attention to the details. All and all the pace and world building is not what I was expecting. This world is much more empty than Skyrim. It's an alright MMO, but I feel Wow does everthing this game does but better."
Negative,"Spent about 8 hours downloading and installing the game twice.  Could not get game to play from launcher.  Submitted for refund which will probably be denied because I have 4 hours of ""playtime"" which is how long it took me to install this game twice.   Don't bother."
Negative,Way too much content locked behind costly DLC pack and monthly subscription. How much money does Bethesda wants to make??
Negative,"Don't buy on Steam, constantly down. Great game on the standalone client."
Negative,"""This game didnt work. Launcher didnt start, and therefore game wouldnt open."" -MistMasterWorked ok for me though"
Negative,"Just another MMO following all the same formulas as all other MMOs out there. Nothing new, nothing unique, and the graphics aren't nearly as good as they were hyped to be."
Negative,"Only crashes, no thanks."
Negative,"It took twenty four hours to download the data files, just for the launcher to claim the file was corrupt, and download for nother twelve houes. Then when I go to steamto verify the data, it starts the 60GB download again. So much for a free weekend, what's thepoint when more of it is spent downloading. Was keen to try this being a huge fan pf TES, but fuck this game and the three day download"
Negative,"Elder Scrolls Online does nothing better than any other MMO out there.The graphics are fine, but look like plastic dolls.The quests are quite ok, but not ones that you'd want to do on your next run through.Combat is your typical WoW style DIKU method of tab target.There is no feeling of exploration, you are guided by the quests and you just feel like you along for the ride.For me the killer is you are going to be fighting with the bag space long before you find any challenge in combat.Don't even contemplate crafting unless you pay the monthly subscription, which the game doesn't warrant.It's Buggy and does blue screen crash from time to time.I even had to go into Safe Mode with Internet to get the game to Install from Steam after reinstalling the game.Overall if you are bored of other MMOs this is doing nothing new and does most things worse."
Negative,"Extreme amounts of content and looks good from a distance.BUT it's all bland and extremely exemplary how Bethesda and all other big publishers bank hard on easily monetisable online content with too little soul and gameplay depth. If you liked Morrowind, this is not your game, AT ALL. If you liked Skyrim more, this might be your cup of tea if you're willing to overlook some glaring MMO balancing and lack of detailed character and world building.It's just a lot, big map, big player counts, lots of zones, lots of options, but it's all more of the same and pretty bland. Worst thing is the monetisation which is way too much and everywhere, sure people will tell you it's fair and you can easily play without, but really it isn't."
Negative,"Good game to players who do not wanna make hard content, game is made to fit casual players and does not reward hardcore players at all. PvP is terrible, cyrodil lag is massive like 70% of day because servers cant deal whit massive groups what is needed to take objective. Battlegrouds does not have macthmaking at all, it not fun to play when you are max lvl and BiS gear and enemys are lvl 10-15 players, also Zos takes their time to fix even smallest bug/glitch in this game. Trials are only good lategame content in this game but after you run them like 3 times they got bored.Good side of this game is that if you enjoy questing there is alot of that and all quests are fully voice acted, games combat mechanic is rly good and fun. Game world is massive and there is lot world bosses dungeons etc what you can do whit your friends if you are in to that type of gameplay. But if you are looking mmo where you wanna be rewarded by your skills this game is not to you, you can get bis pvp gear less then 3 hours and these sets will carry you even if you do not know how to play. In to pve you can get trial gear (not bis) in 6-10 hours and you get dmg what is needed to do all lategame content.5/10"
Negative,actually the game is quite good at first and you enjoy playing it but after a while it gets boring and there is nothing to enjoy anymore. also the whole gaming experience is quite difficult and there are so many things that you have to learn about different dungeons and quests but the good thing is that you can find these things on youtube or just search for them in google (which eventually gonna take you to youtube).
Negative,I would love to recommend this game and I would... if the servers weren't STILL complete and utter shit 6 years later.
Negative,What's the fucking point of this game dude.
Negative,"No matter what fixes I tried, this game's launcher is absolutely broken and will not even allow me to play the game."
Negative,"If you like runescape, you'll like this game."
Negative,"Bought the game yesterday. Tried to login and got met with a constant ""login timeout"" message. Searched through forums to eventually find a fix. Tried logging in again, get told my computer needs an access code to be able to access the account and its been sent to my email. Check my email and no surprise its not there. Check the forums again only to be met with fixes that dont work. If i buy a game, i should be able to play it. $26 out of pocket for something im not able to play."
Negative,"First a disclaimer, I really love elder scrolls games, played this during the beta and hated it there.  I heard from reviews that it got much better after the release and decided to give ESO a shot but honestly I really can't recommend this game after 37 hours and a 1 month subscription.Though there are a lot of good things in this game I'm going to start with might complaints as this is a negative review.  The storyline is dull, the leveling system is very grindy and confusing.  They make you feel like you can be anything and combine anything but in reality there are only a few different weapon/armor/skill combinations that are actually efficient.  The economy is terrible in that if you want a specific item there are no common trade hubs/auction house/trade chat to do it in instead you have to seek out various guild stores placed randomly around the world.  This also makes pricing and selling items near impossible without the help of mods.  The combat system is like a very boring version of guild wars 2 where you get a small number of skills and one ultimate ability.  Also the lack of cooldowns makes you feel as if you just need 1 skill to spam for damage and then all your others just become utility of some kind.  PVP is litterally just a giant zerg fest where only stealth classes can solo anything and everyone else runs around in packs for an ultimately pointless conflict.In terms of positives I think the achievment system is great in that it actually rewards you with armor dyes for completing them.  The elder scrolls universe is fun and diverse and they did a good job at capturing the feel of alot of the previous games.  The DLC's from what I saw were quite fun and well written but were so high level they made the rest of the game seem kind of pointless.  Overall I'd give it a 3/10 for an elder scrolls game and a 5/10 when compared to other mmos."
Negative,"Meh. TL;DR: Bad immersion, no character specific dialogue or any personality for that matter.Not even different reaction choices.It isn't bad necessarily but it's still a disappointment in my opinion.Two things that bothered me most is first of all there is no character-specific dialogue.This is a huge deal breaker to me considering how it breaks the immersion, and badly.Firstly my Khajiit character shows no connection with other Khajiit NPCs at all, again coming back down to the character not taking racial or class-based traits into account at all. (Racial? The Elderscrolls: SJW Online?)Take my intro gameplay, my character is a sneaky Khajiit assassin type character (not sure exactly what the class was called)The lady proceeds to explain she has a contract on the slaver leader, now bit of context for those new to the elderscrolls : Khajiit is a race known for being sneaky, thievish assasins, so my sneaky assassin Khajiit proceeds to ask why he would help an assassin implying he thinks they are bad people....Bethesda, Bethesda...Please, have you EVER played games that do custom characters properly like Mass Effect for example?Apparently not because you don't seem to be able to grasp the simple concept of immersion and character traits.Am I being harsh? Maybe.But with Bethesda's recent bullshit the community (or the majority) is more sensitive to this stuff and that includes me.So no not recommended, if you want your own good character try Mass Effect and if you don't like futuristic stuff try some other MMORPGs, there are way better ones out there...Truly a shame as this had HUGE potential (Bethesda seems to be more interested in the money potential as usual as of late)(Played free trial, was enough to make me decide not to buy, bet that's not what they expected with this temporary f2p thing)Too long, did read: Not recommended unless you don't mind lack of immersion."
Negative,"I put a decent amount of hours into this game (probably half of it was actually downloading it). The download file is massive. It takes up about 50 gigs on my hdd and there are usually updates that are around 5gigs. For a person with slow internet, this isn't very fun. But once you do get into the game, it's pretty fun. The game is alright, the graphics are nice, but the questing is pretty boring. I was following the questline and I somehow wandered into a way higher level area and started doing those quests without even realising it. Untill I started fighting shit, that is. I can't find out how to get back to my level zone (they should add something like the system in WOW where it shows you the level range for the area). The questing is very tedious (like most mmorpgs) that I find myself logging onto my character then logging back out after 5 minutes of walking around the city because I just dread the questing.The graphics are nice.... Too nice in fact that my shitty computer goes down to 10fps in pvp. But outside of bgs, the game looks very appealing and the enviroment is immersive and beautiful. I'll most likely give the game another chance in the future because I spent $30 on it and I really want to like it."
Negative,"Game started well till Elsweyr, then the devs dropped the ball down a well and then dropped the well down down an ocean trench. Constant, data heavy updates to install new, expensive, useless cosmetics. The story line is written with zero intelligence, 100% predictability, and minimum effort. The graphics in the game look good and there are a million and one ways to customize your characters, but you will suffer constant crashes, heavy lag, gank ridden pvp, mind numbingly easy story content, and 0 progress for your leveling. That's right, there is no level progress, or gear progress, or weapon progress, or skill progress after about lvl 200-300 (about a week or two of good playing). If you like spending lots of money to dress up dolls or gank people in pvp, only to crash half way through whatever you are doing and have to start again, then this is the game for you! Though I heavily recommend giving ESO a wide berth and waiting for ES VI if you are a fan of the ES series. If you are looking for an MMO to play, just about anything else would give you a better experience. This one is just milking its population with cosmetics until it's taken out back and shot once people run out of money for cosmetics."
Negative,"It's definitely a solid Elder Scrolls experience from the bit I've played, but it's missing the old flair the single player games had. The fact thatit flopped with its paid subscription is evidence enough that it will probably not last too much longer. I don't think I can recommend it because of what Bethesda has tried to pull lately with other games and I fear that it kind of infests this one too. When I briefly played this as a paid sub game, it was good but I got bored fast. Honestly, not recommended if you're a long time fan, but otherwise I guess I would if you're just an MMO junkie (of which, I'm not really)."
Negative,"$10 during sale (and free-to-play weekend)a poor translation of Elder Scrolls gameplay.Combat FEELS like Morrowind combat (or a F2P MMO with poor combat animations); sort of ""floaty"" if that makes any sense.if you are planning on getting into alchemy or enchanting kiss your inv space goodbye. (and possibly cooking if i could afford recipes; i found a roasted corn recipe but i haven't seen corn in nearly 20 hours of gameplay)you earn points to unlock whatever skills you want (two-handed, destruction staff, light armor, ect.) so you can build whatever class you want - but you are limited to 1 weapon eqipped at a time (later you unlock the abiltiy to swap between two weapon sets) and 5 abilities (weapon skills and magic) and 1 ultimate skilllooking at your stats you might have a hard time determining how much damage reduction you actually have on what armor - higher = more, yeah but how much difference is ther between 10,000 and 10,500 rating when you're not even level 10. the numbers feel arbitrary. ""spell heals 7832 health and costs 5402 mana to cast"" (and i haven't even unlocked the ability to enter dungeons)small gripe about the crafting aspect of the game is that you need to purchase an item to craft weapons and armor in the style of your race (i was argonian so i needed to buy flint) which just eats up more inventory space.and the resources are not instanced per-user, so in the early parts of the game everyone is fighting over the same iron nodes and jute plants (something that FF14 fixed by having harvesting nodes individual to the player and not the server; so everyone has their own and you don't have to worry about other people swooping in to grab the resources you've been running around for) [if you want to spend the skill points you can get an underling that gets crafting resources while you're offline; i've been using the skillpoints i've earned on things i use while i'm actively playing so i don't know how much they actually bring back]if you're the type of player that uses 3rd person camera while playing it might be stuck to being to the right of the player, i play in 1st person so i never tried to see if you can swap shoulders."
Negative,just like ur gf - moneygrabbing
Negative,"Beautiful graphics and content, but absolute garbage stability/constant crashes."
Negative,"Elder Scrolls Online is a great game with a solid concept and a firm grasp on MMO type game play the grinding is not excruciatingly boring, the combat is fun, there are plenty of different combinations of armour styles and dyes, the quest are intriguing to the point where it almost feels like you are playing a singleplayer elder scrolls, so overall the game is very good. But, there are some problems like laggy servers that are unable to handle holidays, sales, and dlc releases; and bugs that would make you have to leave the game and log back in.  Although minor it can be a major inconvenience and turn off to someone starting out the game.At this point in the game development I would wait for a couple patches and check to see if they improved the servers and bugs before you buy."
Negative,"Utterly ""meh"" in every way.Thanks to the free weekend, I didn't have to waste any money finding out that this game just isn't worth playing.  Everything feels stiff and unpolished.  The combat and character movement is slow and clunky.  The controls are tripe.  The game doesn't explain itself very well despite numerous revisions since it's launch 2 years ago.Pretty much the only thing that feels remotely okay is the world itself.  It's nice and vast and...well, that's actually about it.  It's not particularly interactive.  It's just vast.Unless you're feinding for mmo in the world of Tamriel, just go and grab Skyrim instead.  It does everything better, is cheaper, and thanks to mods, has nearly unlimited content."
Negative,"não valeu a compra , não tem nada a ver com the elders  scrolls , você não tem liberdade pra montar seus  skills ."
Negative,"ok lets start this with I played this in beta and now again. I also have more than 100 hours on ps4 version of this game. That being said I wanted to really like this game. I know some fan boys are going to hate me for this but here we go. This is a cash grab simply. Having spent countless hours in other bethesda games like skyrim, oblivion, morrowind, fallout franchise, and doom I am sad to say this doesn't add up. The music is great! The world is not rendered the best but hey its a mmo and we want to target to as many people in one area that we can. What it should have is some sort of real theif system. It is a weak imitated version of what is found in the other games. Local economy really does not exist either. There is this guild shop system that is kinda there....and you can trade things there for the most part but a good ol auction house would have been fine. The crafting system is horrible and some parts are actually locked behind pay to clear time walls. So here we go into pay for advantages to further something in game over those who just play. There are the loot boxes in this game that can give you real game advantages that are almost gaming breaking. ESO plus membership gives you an advantage in small gold earned, in game currency, and access to all dlc while you are eso plus. Well that is a fat lie you do not get access to all dlc. There is alot you have to pay for. Calculated if you pay for all of say.....FF14 expansion plus the subscription its less than paying for the dlc and the over priced eso plus. That all being said its hard to get behind this game for all its cash grab money fest that ESO is. PLus it really is just a better version of everquest and isnt even doing anything exactly new.  Oh yeah and get ready for the crashes that will come with owning the pc version of this game. In the end if your looking for an MMO maybe shop around a bit more. Its obvious this game isn't going to change how they want to market it...and if you want to see THE WHOLE GAME you are going to have to spend spend spend spend. Do not let these people tell you otherwise there will be fan boys of this game but if you want purchase the game and actually look in the crown store and play over a few hourse of the game. It will all become clear. In the end on a scale of 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest I give this game one jello pudding cup."
Negative,I played this game once and it never worked again.The only reason that I played so much is the damn loading screen.I try to play it but it just doesnt work.4.5/10
Negative,Not worth your timeNot worth those 3k hours either... 🤦‍♀️
Negative,"Virtual worlds are cool and its always fun to travel but this game is just a cash pump. It might be all-right if you'd pay only the ESO+ and could go with the in-game currencies for everything (again over-complicated currency system meant to pump more cash out of your frustration or ignorance). It is stealing your money every time you want to buy certain things, also systematically slowing your progression and stealing your time ! You get quests that are necessary for certain gear but you have to spend weeks farming idiotic things only once a day in the same quest setting : go kill a dragon or anything is ok occasionally, Yeah, you always farm or get out of your preferred way to do things I personally hate to do, in order to get what you NEED !I keep coming back because I like an online virtual word, but this is no better than Second Life at rewarding your efforts ! But I think its beyond what I can tolerate now... SO the single interest would be multiplayer, but there is no serious in-game mechanism that don't deliver a social experience (guilds are flimsy with insufficient structure and services)... I THINK I'LL QUIT, what I need is not there..."
Negative,"Definitly does not feel like a Elder Scrolls Game, I feel like a am living in a extremely scripted world with no freedom of choice.  For example I have played through the first set of missions and they were all scripted with no real choice of picking sides or branching trees as far as choices.  Also I can't steal or attack anyone I want I was able to just walk into people's homes and just take thing right in front of them with no reaction.  Speaking of taking things you can't just pick up whatever you want there is maybe less than 10% of items the game will let you pick up or interact with.  So in summary the game does not live up to the name Elder Scrolls and feels like your living a linear scripted storyline with no freedom to make your own chocies in the game which is what I felt made this series so great."
Negative,Game is great until they decide not to let steam players log in. Got tired of paying for something I couldn't use.
Negative,Won't even let me login with a new account and everything
Negative,You can get banned for teabagging.
Negative,"Game is ass, Its pretty much a delivery simulator."
Negative,While the scenery is pretty the game is just a constant grind. The story is boring but at least you can skip it by just clicking. Not a game I would ask others to pay to play.
Negative,"With all the extra crap to purchase the base game should just be free. I might play it then. I played for free and still dont recommend it though. Just so much stuff to spend money on its ridiculous. literally defining ""pay to play"" $100 in DLC plus a membership? No thanks. All extra buyable content aside, I personally didnt care too much for the game itself some nice visual updates to creatures but the quests and loot were very unfulfilling for me. I wanted Skyrim online buts it felt more like runescape."
Negative,"Quite the money grab.Most of the time goes to trying and managing inventory, because unless you cough up more cash you're forever woefully short of being able to play more than 10 min before returning to the bank or seller."
Negative,"When playing multiplayer with friends each quest is individual and not shared. (you cant work together to finish objectives.)Wouldn't let me join my friend to do a PvE story because of not being in the same alliance, had to make new characters.It's supposed to be ""online"" but the quest system seems very counter intuitive.3/10   kinda lame."
Negative,"Kinda Boring, Only played a few hours before i ran out of content"
Negative,ESO steam website is difficult to navigate. Difficult to pay for sub with paypal. Have to add funds to steam wallet to do so. Lag out rear. Its just not an enjoyable experience for me.
Negative,It's not TES it's yet another asian MMORPG
Negative,üyelik fiyatını bir gecede 2 katına çıkararak içine ettiler. wow bile aylık 135tl ama eso 300tl. sanki bana 100k online lı mmo... 10-15k online var saçma sapan fiyatlar...
Negative,This game is just your average MMO with the Elder Scrolls lore and story. Pretty bland if you ask me.Waste of money tbh
Negative,"its a good game, but you need to pay the monthly in order to actually play. its like buying a demo and paying to play."
Negative,"The worst Elder Scrolls title by far, ugly graphics worse than even older titles such as Oblivion/Skyrim, along with a clunky combat system, poor controls, and uninspired versions of topics, locations, and gameplay elements seen previously. I played it on release and could barely tolerate more than a few hours, despite having a combined 3k+ hours in the other games of the franchise. Gave ESO a second chance again this year and regret the time spent downloading the game, much less the minimal new play time. You're better off spending money on something with more value like paperclips or rotten milk."
Negative,Fucking dreadful. Cant even do half the quests with friends without faffing about with a load of different menu's and the quests don't even sync. I just wanted to play some quests with friends but it turns out you can only do dungeons with friends despite the fact we are in a group.
Negative,"I've obviously gotten my money's worth. However the recent non-stop connection issues that decided to plague me have made the game completely unplayable. I lose connection to the server at least once an hour, sometimes just after a few minutes of play. Can't log back in for a while due to 'account already logged in' messages. Repeatedly come back to my own corpse. Would have been a great game otherwise. Tons of PVE content; probably the most elaborate varied single-player RPG there is. PVP is more janky but not at all bad by MMO standards.I wish I could actually play this game."
Negative,To many dlc offers
Negative,Don't be fooled. It says I played 100+ hours. But most of that time was spent patching the game.
Negative,this game is too lag for malaysian player. dont bother buying
Negative,"AVOID,Honestly after 13 years of playing mmorpgs this one has special pedestal on my list as the thing I would call ""BETHESDA FINAL CREATION"".  Sadly, it did not take me any long to get to the ""end game"" which is a complete failure in my opinion but that is not the issue in this game. The issue is that you are constantly hitting bugs (ofc I could expect it from bethe but they have passed my imagination): running into things that you cannot just find without google help and the masterpiece ui that won't even let you know WTF happens to your arse. On top of that melee classes having plenty of range on ""melee"" (kappa) skills. Complete lack of balance and hardness of simply understanding things as there is absolutely no information what is going on in this game, is simply unacceptable for me.TLDR: If you are lorelover who doesn't have to do anything with other people, you might enjoy running big world. Anyone else should not bother. There are plenty of better games."
Negative,"Currently I can't recommend paying for this game.  Even the $30 version.  I have been able to actually play a total of 3 hours with triple that alone in download time.  I'm not complaining about the size and the game is fun but I've been experience infinity load screens during logging onto the character selection (logging in).  It actually will time out before connection (5-10 minute wait time to be told I can't connect).  When I'm able to actually log in the load time in game and the graphics run smoothly.  This has been very frustrating and I kind of wish I could get my money back at this point.  I'll change my review as soon as I can log in and play during my very limited free time.  So - the reason I'm not recommending this game is due to the fact that it won't even allow me in the game 80% of the time.  If it ran 90% of the time, I would say yes pay lots of money."
Negative,"This game is so bad. Story is terribly written and just gets worse each expansion, they lock content behind paywalls forcing you to buy their premium sub giving the illusion that the game is buy to play. Combat is so boring, gear progression in this game is just a repetitive grind and rng based. PvP concept is alright but held back due to many of the games flaws. If you are looking for a good buy to play MMO go play guild wars 2. If you want a good sub to play MMO play final fantasy 14."
Negative,"Ok comparing to other MMOs. This one looks really below average, animations are bad too. Story is kindof average. Combat is slow and bad. The game doesn't look at all like the illustrations or Trailers. Lol there is no UI , you have to download custom UI. Only 2 out of 10 times I could log in the game, other times it kept on looping in the game login section"
Negative,I got ripped fam. When I made my account it never sent a verification email but it still allowed me to make a character even though my account wasn't official yet. Because of this it wasn't allowing me to get past the character selection screen. I tried making a new account and this time it did send the verification email but it said I didn't own the game. I tried linking this account to steam but it will not let me put in my login credentials whenever I launch the game. It just logs in automatically to the non-verified account and there is no option to logout. Quite literally unplayable.
Negative,downloaded the game on easter sunday ... never was able to start the game :-( play elder scrolls without issues... down loaded this 3 times thinking bad files ..sad day ...
Negative,"I do recommend the game as it is a decent game to play with lot of quests to do. However, I would not recommend playing the game through the Steam Cliant. As it is literally bugged with log in issues ever since the Launch of the Summerset expansion."
Negative,This game did not work. I happen to have one of the list of ARM Macs that the game does not work on.
Negative,Pretty terrible game....
Negative,loads of bugs and sometimes you can get stuck under the map and have to relog if a boss throws you just right
Negative,sea/ oce sever pls ; (
Negative,"NO!, just no!"
Negative,"I have tried to install this game 9 times over the past 2 months and it will not install despite all of the varies websites I have read to try and fix this. Computer techs cannot find a solution to this problem  either. This is apparently a really, really common problem. Steam will not give me a refund as you have to request a refund immediately - they don't care that I have spent two moths of grief trying to fix their faulty software. Their customer service is dreadful. Do not download this game from Steam."
Negative,As much as i try to like this game this game feels stale & empty compared to the Singleplayer game.Pro's:   <> Pretty good looking for a game out of 2014.             <> Ok netcoding            <> Load times are not too long            <> Quests are not very stale            <> Wide variety in Races/Classes            <> Towns look nice.             Cons:   <> Characters feel emotionless.            <> Lack of furniture in buildings.            <> Input lag            <> Sloppy combat system            <> They tease you with the 'This MMORPG has no monthly fees'  but in the end they try to milk the living jesus out                    of  you with you paying real money for a house or dumb crates.' TL;DR Game is good if you have no other game competetors. If you do have other game interests then don't buy this game.6/10. Just the fact that they manipulate you with the 'no monthly fee' gives me sufficient reason to rate this 6/10. Still a high rating since they've done quite a lot for this game.
Negative,"Got this game in a Humble Monthly Bundle, not expecting it. So, while I didn't get it for free, it was a ""pleasant surprise"" that I received it. However, I really don't enjoy playing it. It doesn't feel like TES, and, at least for the few hours I played it, it was a relatively boring MMO.I would have LOVED for a game more like Skyrim or Oblivion, but multiplayer. Heck, just a non-MMO multiplayer option, maybe some couch co-op split screen, or some LAN, or some matchmaking would've been awesome, but a TES MMO sounds like such an amazing idea. Playing the game just felt boring, thoughEveryone likes different things, and people even have different moods for which games they feel like playing, so I can imagine that you will find this fun for a while. But it's not for me, and it definitely could've been better."
Negative,The constant moon-walking is too annoying. Animations aren't timed realistically. Health bars are very ugly. Characters and world look no better than old-timey Runescape. I was hoping it looked more like Skyrim and less like Oblivion.
Negative,"This game is just a cash grab. The questing is pretty good. The entire game revolves around getting you into the cash shop. Anything that looks cool or is original in any way is in the cash shop. Buy this game if you like having loot boxes and fancy items that are not in the game advertised to you always. Any in game housing that's remotely cool costs 100$ or more. The shop is also filled with experience boosts and enhancements that are totally pay to win. It would be a 10 star review and an actual great game if most of the items you could get were in the game and not the cash shop. It literally feels like there are more items to buy with money than to find in the game. It's a real bummer that such a cool series with great lore wants to turn players into payers. If you like Skyrim then imagine that literally all armor besides the armor you can craft costing cash, that's what the ratio feels like.Edit: This game  uses Google and Facebook for advertising of it's Loot Boxes and Pay to Win items, so if you use those brands while being an ESO player you will never escape the Loot Box and Pay to Win ads that will surely either upset you or leave you paying actual money for pixels. These ads will be everywhere that you could see a google ad.. so I hope you have good will power to survive a daily relentless barrage of items for sale for the game you play while just trying to live your life.On top of all of that. The game is pretty much a single player game 99% of the time unless you really are trying hard to get that MMO aspect in. So even if you spend all that money for the cool items there's nobody to show off too.. and even if you do show off.. we all know you just paid for it.I would recommend not touching this game and just play Skyrim or something. Anything that's got items to collect in the game and not for cash beats this."
Negative,"skill and potion delay still present 11/19/22 avoid Cons -1- Mount speed isn't link to each character yet your bank and house are. Meaning you will have have to wait 40-60 days before you can get moving on just that character. Hence punching you into buying mount speed books. By the way there are 3 stats on your mount, speed is just 1. Yes it's costly per character.  You'll will see this through the game.2- Race in this game those matter unlike what the developers would have you believe. An example of this would be Redguard / Argonian. If your familiar with Elder Scrolls  you'll know Redguard  is a d.p.s race yet in this game the Devs choose to turn Redguard into a main tank. In game its says - The racial skills of the Redguards reflect their ancestral legacy as SWORD MASTERS, giving them bonuses to SHIELDS, base stamina, stamina recovery, movement, and duration of effects from food. Their ability to flow in martial combat is unparalleled.Sounds Disconnected? That's because it is disconnected . In this game they gave High Elfs weapon damage no joke. Ugly = Damage. You'll will see this through the game. 3-  Classes in this game are odd. As a number of class skills are in weapons skills and guild skills. Making a number of classes redundant and repetitive. It brings into question why even have classes. Not just because of this but because its a elder scrolls game. You'll will feel this through the game.4- Auto aim for projectiles even through walls you will notice this in PVE and PVP. This also adds to a number of server side issues and game balance issues. You'll will see this through the game.5- PVP and PVE are link. This leads to PVP nerfing PVE or PVE nerfing PVP. Yes it happens a lot and it getting infuriating. This is a thing for as long as i can remember. This leads to you having to change your armor and weapon sets every 3-4 months or so. If you do intend to play DO NOT GOLD out your armor. You'll will see this through the game.6- Housing don't think you can buy a massive house/Mansion and store armor and weapons in there buddy. Collecting to much random furniture/items isn't a good idea as you will eventually have to buy or sacrifice a house for your main house because your furniture has a small limit even with Eso Plus which doubles it. All of this makes house basically useless.  You'll will see this through the game.7- Champion point (Levels after max level 50) grind is real. If your just here for PVP you need at least 600 cp that's after you get your character to level 50 each. This goes for PVE as well 800 cp is recommended for vet Trials and Dungeons. 3600 cp is the cap but your full gold should be 1400-1500. Getting cp takes a mind numbing amount of time. Some people it toke 5 month or a year plus. so prepare for a grind. Don't get screamed at or lobby dodged.Pros-1- Lore is heavy. you'll also get to a number of the land masses, a ton of books and a number of revealing quest.2- House Decorating can get crazy.3- Art is amazing, the 3d models and texture are great, even the loading screens are something to look at."
Negative,shit is boring
Negative,good(edit) nvm boring
Negative,"Honestly not worth your time or money, to quote another review:""Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will ""sell"" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising).""Do Not Buy This Game.It has a multitude of issues that I had to work around to get into the game itself, on top of that it still has major server issues and I was met with constant disconnections and lag, I was running this on a RTX 4070 so without any doubt it's the game itself.The equipment stats are also a complete mess, for example; the starting equipment you get has a four digit armor stat for each piece. It's completely unnecessary and just looks bad.And it's completely packed with microtransactions, two of the classes you can pick aren't part of any DLC, they're just something you have to buy from the premium shop."
Negative,"I tried liking this game i put as much time as I could but man, this one is a chore to play. Combat and questing is alright and the PvP is some of the most fun I have had in an mmo, but the writing and characters are so bland. I struggle to name a single character or moment in the games story that sticks out to me. When your biggest moments of fun are mid 2000s purple monkey dishwasher humor, you lose me. Not to mention the fact that despite this game not requiring a subscription it might as well. Playing without crafting bags is such a chore and the perks of ESO plus make the game almost ok. I just really wanted to like this game but felt like I was working at a second job."
Negative,"Back 5 years ago i bought this and was severly disappointed. Bugged quests, dungeon finder was working an hour per day, animations of charachters are just bad, classes are completely unbalanced  and included most laggy pvp nonesense i ever seen in an mmo. Fast forward to today, basicly everything is same to a lesser extent. Some bugs are fixed, dungeon finder works most of the time , classes and pvp are still unbalanced and laggy af. Basicly its like a degenerate child of guild wars 2 or wow. Only thing good in this is story telling throught  popular lore tbf i dont see why would anyone whos into mmos paly this over wow or some other mmo."
Negative,"NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL , PAY TOO MUCH to get killed all the time , npc have no lvl warning , start some maps or dungeon ok but then npc gets unkillable.....dont know if i ll spent any more money on another game that is supposed to be mmo but we play solo.UPDATE:i will not renew my sub on this game , this is not worth any money at all....its a game of grinding and  it is a money sinkhole.NO fun to play at all."
Negative,Decided to give the game a chance since i thought mindlessly exploring the world would be fun. Turns out most of the map is locked behind multiple pay-walls. Uninstalled after finding out i payed money for a small part of the game.
Negative,"Started on Xbox back on release and played it for years, decided to come to PC as it has a bigger community.Don't waste your time, I've lost multiple gold jewellery randomly and I keep seeing more items disappearing from my account, checked all characters(3), inventories, banks, storage units etc and my main items have just vanished."
Negative,"I really can't give any positive opinions to this game and certainly will never ask anyone I know to purchase this game , because I can NOT play this game, the 0.7 hours I wasted in this game was all in that Fxxking game launcher, every time I opened it to upgrade it crash. I have to admit my patience runs out. Do not buy this game, that's all I can say."
Negative,just like lost ark rujn around in circle and do useless tasks stupid game i hate it
Negative,"Can't log in. every time i verivy local content, it reallocating and all the data are gone."
Negative,"I wish I could recommend.Not a huge amount of time spent playing, what I have played I've enjoyed. If you're expecting Skyrim or Oblivion forget it, this is an MMO with Elder Scrollsish feel to it. Which is still fun. Sadly I wont be recommending as I CAN NEVER PLAY, THE SERVER RANDOMLY THROWS ME OUT CONSTANTLY. I understand this may just be my connection, and yet not a single other MMO or online game does this to me. ESO constantly lags, then sometimes throws me out, or just wont even let me log in. Every time I start it up its a coin toss. Man people might stop hating on this game on the web if you guys just managed to do what every other AAA MMO has managed to at least kinda do, and create some stable servers please! That and quit the cashwhoring DLC you keep throwing out. Please, let your game be as good as it could be. Megaservers are dumb."
Negative,"steam blowsAllow me to further quantify my complaint, Elder Scrolls Online = Good, would recommend. I do not recommend Steam. Mostly it's because of their connector, sometimes I cannot play the game but everybody that bought directly from elderscrollsonline.com have no problems. Happens two or three times a year, inevitably during a special event or important moment.And I cannot transfer my game progress over to a ""normal"" account on elderscrollsonline.com"
Negative,"I started playing this game last week really enjoyed amazing game. I invested in a 3 month subscription  to my dismay as it now seems to take 3 months to load again now ........ Problem is that every time steam tries to run this game it decides that it needs to reinstall & the launcher wont fire up without checking steam. its 80+GB plus updates after it has downloaded again the launcher has about 2 hours of updates after this. Thanks but no thanks steam its a 5-7 hour wait wasting time & bandwidth to reinstall this every time i  turn on my computer to play. If your lucky you wont have issues i know 2 other people who got the game through steam at the same time who can run this with no forced reinstall. but for me this weekend after the 3rd forced install if it does not work properly i'm quitting it & hitting the delete, (by the way back up your steam install ready to reinstall then you can save the 80GB forced re-download). you will still have 2 hours plus of updating the Elderscroll's launcher again. WARNING a lot of people are getting this problem it seems from the comments online."
Negative,Poop.That is all.
Negative,horrible server performance.
Negative,They really need to fix the issues after DLC patches I spend more time at loading screens and attempting to list items then playing the game.
Negative,"Huge download and huge waste of time. From you moment you play the game it tells you all the things you can't do and need to spend money on. So what did I pay for? If you want a Free to play game make one, if I buy the game I expect the game.The game is just so boring and the more you try and do the more pop ups that tell you spend more money. I got this for $8 on sale and its way too much money for what you get."
Negative,"After spending 30 minutes downloading 70+ GB of data I have to spend even more time downloading patches (20 GB)?!?!? And why the heck do I have to do that in another game launcher with a download speed of only 15 Mb/sec? Under the system requirements it reads that the necessary disk space is 85 GB. If my math is not totally wrong this patch will exceed that! And where on the Steam store page does it mention anything about this? Do I recommend this game? NO! Not only for the reasons mentioned but due to the constant lag, FPS drops, IAP, and overpriced DLC's. The gameplay is okay for an MMO (it won't beat Skyrim)."
Negative,"I've paid 40$, downloaded 60Gb, passed thru weird and confusing registration process - and after all that it crashes on the Login Screen! Miserable :("
Negative,typical. hidden launcher runs up the clock before I can refund.
Negative,I just cannot get into this MMO after playing New World (with all its problems). ESO bores me to death... maybe I should give it more time but I cannot seem to force myself to do it.
Negative,Coming from WoW to this... extremely disappointing
Negative,"Nice servers, fagsUPDВы сыграли еще 2765 ч.Рекомендуете ли вы эту игру другим пользователям?НЕТ НЕТ НЕТЭто все еще одна из худших ммо"
Negative,"It's not pay to win, It's pay to have more Quality of life perks such as the ESO Plus with the unlimited bag space for crafting materials. I'd rather play skyrim with free mods that do this for me. Which leaves me with the final review score 3/10"
Negative,"The Elder Scrolls Online is a decent MMO but a mediocure Elder Scrolls game. The game is somewhat enjoyable with friends and if you lack friends you can just follow a ""Dolmen Group"" to glory. However most of the gameplay is lackluster. The combat mechanics are alright when your journey starts but after a while the cracks begin to show. For starters the same combat music plays for all of the fights. Additionally enemies can land successful melee attacks on you regardless of distance once they have approached you in the fight. This means that even from several feet away when a sword swipe visibly misses your character you will still take damage. Your standard inventory is rather limited and can only be expanded with in game gold which takes a nasty amount of grinding to earn all while you will be save saving gold for supplies or houses. The game is fairly active and new parts of Tamriel are opened periodically however, you can only access these areas by purchasing dlc. Overall my opinion on the game is determined by your playstyle. If you are playing alone, then stay away and just buy Skyrim.If you want to play a multiplayer Elder Scrolls game I would recommend that you look into ""Skyrim Together"" a community mod in the works that will probably meet your expectations better than ESO. If you just want to play an MMO with friends then in that specific example I recommend you buy ESO."
Negative,"Devs are incompetent, that's all you need to know - bugs, server issues, desyncs etc. DLC's are usually coming out with OP stuff at launch so people buy it and then nerfed in a couple of weeks and it never ends. The story and the content in general is recycled with every expansion, so basically nothing really new to the story, same nords or whatever shits existed for 99999999 years, no twists, new races or anything, just bland and recycled."
Negative,"The game is boring: 1) most of the quests are boring (yes! i read them)2) inventory limit is annoying - it fills too quckly and then they offer to solve the problem by buying super duper cranky plus account, but i already bought the game(!), so, most of the time u simply look how to free your inventory3) i start to fall asleep in dungeons: too easy, the best way there is to get the wrong party pros:1) elder scrolls lore, thats it"
Negative,"Its not what i expected to be honest. I dont know what I expected, but it wasn't this. Not awful, but not anywhere near worth the asking price, and to think in the beginning they tried to hit you with both a 60 quid bill and a monthly feee. Lol, no wonder they changed that out..."
Negative,I can't even log into the game and every thing I have done from Elder Scrolls help to my own. All of it did not work and i advise people not to buy the game on steam!
Negative,"Need to download twice(an apparent bug), to much work to fix it to make it worth playing. Really wanted to play it again but game wasn't that good to go through all the effort"
Negative,it is a money sink...nice graphics and game play but not falling into the commitment nor the investments of funds ..like the one price covers all aspect and treasure to excel not found in this game. skyrim was better.
Negative,Do not buy this game thru steam if you want to actually play it!
Negative,"Engine and graphics are not ugly, but you can see it is outdated.Gameplay is grindy, repetitive after a while and generally not much fun."
Negative,pay to win. most of the game is locked behind dlc which isnt cheap either.
Negative,Dreadfully boring. Nothing like Skyrim or any previous game. The archery is totally ruined in this game. Arrows sort of lock on to enemies and follow them until they strike. There's no skill to archery anymore.The quests are generic. The landscape doesn't look very interesting. Major downgrade from Skyrim.
Negative,"I purchased The Elder Scrolls Online Greymoor bundle and played about 2 hours on end then got banned for no reason(No 3rd party programs, no addOns, no gold selling/buying or anything like that). Actually it happened just right after I finished the tutorials. It was so frustrating for me who spent a half hour on creating my char. After googling the random ban, I found random mass ban happened alot, and some ppl got banned after a long vacation (here is the link-> https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/284313/banned-for-no-reason ). It's ridiculous. So be careful before buying the game."
Negative,"I mainly do PVP at EU server and the problems drive me insane. First of all, as many people have pointed out, EU server is very problematic compared to US server. There is constant lag and graphical issues. And last week's botched maintenance only made it worse.The other thing is the long running bugs. One of the most annoying is the ""in combat"" bug. Sometimes even if you are safely at your own alliance castle, you got stuck in combat mode, so you can't mount or teleport.Another issue I'm experiencing a lot at Cyrodiil is, sometimes parts of ground textures are not rendered properly. And many times I got stuck at these unrendered textures, can't move or do anything, finally get killed by the enemy.And many times the map becomes unusable as well. So I can't teleport or respawn.This game has a lot of potential, but unfortunately it is wasted because of those technical issues."
Negative,"This game has a lot of content how ever this game has 3 problems for me :- This game has optimization issue although it has been released for 5 years. Especially after summerset release, many players have huge fps drops in game even for dated computers- The pve questing is quite boring like other mmos. The main quest is fine, but 98% of the quest have boring and repetitive story, lots of characters which you will never remember after the quest. Every quest is something about ""XXX released a curse on this place, help me to cleanse this curse""- The ""No game subscription required."" is a big bullshit. You basically need a subscription to truly enjoy this game because of inventory space problem. The eso+ service gives you unlimited inventory space which is a HUGE advantage compared to non-sub players. If you don't have a sub you will have to maintain you inventory and go back to town every 20minutes to spend 10 minutes to sell your stuff, bank your stuff and deconstuct your stuff- This game only has NA/EU servers. So if you live in Asia/SEA be ready to play at atleast 250+ ping"
Negative,i dont recomand this game because u need to buy acces to specific areas if u want to play the game so i say no to this game
Negative,The game didn't even work if I'm being honest with you
Negative,"no compren esto, se freezea al iniciar el juego y se crashea, te mandan un monton de guias para solucionarlo, firewall, antivirus, c++, repair, reinstall...etc. bethesda te odio."
Negative,So very disappointed with Bethesda.
Negative,"DON'T BUY ! The game runs like crap and I have a pretty decent PC (Ryzen 5 2600, RX 5700), there are like 2003 NPC animations, the combat is GARBAGE, graphics are s**t, you need to pay real money to expand your inventory, and overall the game is boring af. I would refund this, but I've played more than 2 hours already. Anyway I only spent 8$ on it so... it's not a big deal"
Negative,"The world is beautiful, quests are interesting, lore is nice too. That is all the good/positive there is.Everything else, unless you are somehow immune to MMO features and dont mind (or actually live for) daily grind (you know, the equivalent of 5 or so hours required to mill the wheat/barley to make a loaf of bread each day), is atrocious. And an overpriced to boot cash (that is Crown) shop with atleast 3 currency types (one for cash, other one from gambling lootboxes - that is crates, and one that you get from grinding your time). And then there is that craft bag and subscription (seems like the game is designed to force that on you).In retrospective, cash shop and daily grind are minor things, when compared to level progression and the slogfest that is leveling and level-scaling. Nothing breaks the game as much as that (atleast for me), because you only actually start playing the game after level 50 and CP (Champion Points level) 150 (because only then your loot - items - stop leveling). By the time i reached that, i was completely burned out.A very disappointing game (for me)."
Negative,"Early game PVE (didn't make it to late game) is like being overleveled in a Pokemon game.  Everything scales in level with you similar to Skyrim and there's no way to make the game more difficult short of being naked or having your character horribly unoptimized.Unfortunately as I understand a large portion of the game's content is based around exploration and questing, which is extremely tedious to grind through with how trivial it is."
Negative,"Your company is a low life piece of shit. You Scam people, you won't refund, I've tried reaching out and being civil. Unfortunately I am tired of being nice. So give me my money back, then you and your company can go fuck yourselves and have a pleasantly shitty day."
Negative,Doesn't work on Steam Deck
Negative,It's really limited.....
Negative,"The combat's garbage, the quests are bland, the skills are useless, and the crafting is unbelievably terrible. It's also crammed full of micro transactions."
Negative,"Gave this a try. While the Devs have come light years from Beta I-III, the game is riddled, and I do mean riddled with bugs. (Check their forums)I don't care about the monetization. (But after WoW, no way in hell am I got to pay for base game, expansions, AND a monthly fee.What finally did it for me is trying to play and a full 50% of my abilities stopped working. Sprint? NOCombat ability two? NOCombat abilities three? NOI thought my KB was having issues, so I reloaded the UI. NOLogged out. Logged back in. NOFinally tried using dodge, and that fixed sprint. No rhyme or reason for the sudden inability to use 40% of my combat abilities."
Negative,"so, how do i get morrowind without buying this game again?"
Negative,No clothing shops.... I just want booty shorts!
Negative,"This Game is so Bad-To many bug-hard Load Chart logging-infinity Loading ScreenUntil now no resolve Trust me u if u play this game u ill angry coz infinity loading screenu can looking prove,searching at google"
Negative,This game is effectively an afk clicker game for 90% of the content. You can stand still and it'll take three minutes for mobs to kill you. There is no challenge. No reward. The most you get from this content is the story and lore... Which is the only reason I'm playing.The remaining 10% is fairly basic MMO stuff. Nothing that stands out as unique.The amount of toxicity in the player base is too high. You have friendly and helpful players sure... But they are few and far between.I cannot recommend the game in this state.
Negative,"Game is shallow, boring, repetitive, and just generally a poor MMO. Also a bunch of stupid things that make you angry and you can't turn off FOR NO REASON like glowing feet every time you dodge and magical glowing hologram shields that fly in front of you when you block just make it seem silly and juvenile, idk. Game sucks ass"
Negative,"a beautiful game with too many bugsthe launcher is shit and i have to re dl the game because the launcher is just bugged as fuckdon't buy this game now, wait for more patchs"
Negative,"Tried to play this game, installed but it won't play at all.I have tried multiple methods and still cant get it to play.So I would say DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS."
Negative,Launcher keep getting stuck on loading  for some reason. Can't find solution anywhere that work. seriously the game has been out for like 5-6 years and you can't get the Launcher to work properly?
Negative,"UI is cancer.Edit response to the devs: Honestly I wouldn't even know where to begin to give advice on it, it just isn't very intuitive, probably needs it's own tutorial to show newbies/people who aren't familiar with normal mmos how to use it, and ended up confusing and frustrating me. I came to this game after playing the other games in the elder scrolls franchise rather than coming to play it because I like mmos."
Negative,"The game is ok, but I'm glad I bought it on sale. I was expecting more, considering all the hype. For me it felt flat and lacking, because the races and classes are a little too cosmetic. They are so ""open"" to crossover, that it doesn't feel there is much difference in choosing one or the other. And then there are so many tweaks you can buy, that characters have no distinctive flair. Which also makes this game a great money pit for players into building mega-characters. But the deal-breaker for me was that, something about the visuals caused me vertigo. No matter the adjustments I did. Tried switching perspective, reducing head-bob, and just about any other recommended tweak. I couldn't play for more than 45 minutes without getting nausea. The funny thing is that a friend also got vertigo from the game, but playing it in a console (PS). I looked around and vertigo seems to be an issue for some people.So, no, I wouldn't recommend this game."
Negative,"It's a scam, p2w, money-grab, lag-fest. ZO$ have built a massively unrewarding,  inconvenient, soul sucking grind disguised as a multiplayer Elderscrolls ""game"". They're doing their best to avoid creating any meaningful gameplay or fun for their paying customers and instead just set up pointless hurdles to then charge you more $$$ to alleviate them. Oh yea and GAMBLING!!!! It's all about their fucking slot machine mechanic loot crates. That shit gets updated more often than any other aspects of this pathetic excuse of a game. Should be f2p trash at this point.After 6 years still has the worst performance of any online game I've played. The megaservers are a failure and the incompetent devs refuse to do anything about it or even acknowledge that there's a serious issue. Their standards are apparently extremely low. PvP is an absolute joke full of exploits, bugs and huge lag. Same with end-game PvE. It's a total mess. This game is the reason I will not be purchasing anymore products from ZeniMax Media Inc. and their associated developers. I would highly recommend NOT giving shitty companies like them your money or time.Unless MS does something to fix any of this (lol yea right!)... RIP ES"
Negative,"Pure Pay to Play with a Zenimax sell al your information to everyone, Don't buy into to this. Game is fun for initail 2 months with the the Blackwood edition w/o EOS +, but after that it is all about spending most of your time managing invenory, because even w/o the $14.99 monthly subscription and the Zenimax we sell all your personal information to ANYONE (to any country including and communist country). Do you really think with what is going on in the world with ""Let's Go Brandon"" in charge the people that just want to ""make your life better"" want yout personal infromatoin are buying that data? The Blackwood edition w/o ESO Plus subscrition is fun, but with out ESO Plus, it becomes a non-fun to play game. Don't ""Drink the Colade"" and skip this game"
Negative,This is the most toxic money hungry MMORPG I have personally ever seen. Adding up the amount of money a person could spend is astronomical and simply not worth it. I feel stupid and robbed that I fell for the base game price tag and thought it was worth getting. Bethesda deserves to burn and be ruined as a company for such practices
Negative,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time trying to get beyond the character select screen during the free weekend. Though I have yet to figure out the secret to actually logging in, the song is quite exhilarating. Despite scouring the forums for answers, none of which worked for me, I must say we had a good run together, this game and I. 64 minutes of uninterrupted error messages. I hope I am in the minority here of who this happened to because it does not bode well on a free weekend when you cannot even log in."
Negative,"Takes a game series that was all about fluid class creation and plops you into stale classes that have little overlap.  Doesn't feel like a elder scrolls game, just an everyday MMORPG with a TES filter.  Also the grind to get meager pack expansions (not to mention how you pack actually functions) is just silly.  Also all the NPCs look like dolls, not my favorite art style...."
Negative,"I have never seen a game with worse designs. By design I mean armors,robes,clothes etc. This game is an rpg with no equips you would like to have. They are all ugly as hell. I am 14 levels and I see 50 lvl players and we both look the same. Ugly. As. F*ck.Physics is also crap. I feel like I am playing with a toy figure rather than an rpg character. Also I feel like there isn't much strategy in this game build wise. There may be but I haven seen a reason for it. Just do missions and level up.Because of everything above you get no pleasure from fighting, completing missions, competing with other people etc."
Negative,"I wanted if to ages. Exploring tamriel sounded great. Then i got it and realised i needed to install it twice. Hence i can write this review because installing it counts as play time. Then i realised my small ssd is gonna be filled with this game and i thought screw that. *refunded*Then i started thinking about this game again after a while and i started looking into it.check yourself but i heard If you want to reset your character you need to pay real world money, if you want more then one character you need to pay. Basically theres a micro transaction for everything. And i Stopped bothering before i began"
Negative,nothing close to skyrim...this is just ideal playing
Negative,"Havent been able to play the game for months due the ""Zenimax Self Extractor"" bug. Their support is garbage and dont care about fixing the issue. Waste of money."
Negative,babi dont play this fking game i waited 1 day to download and not worth it
Negative,"I Dl'd the game and the launcher hung for the entire logged time. I never played. Asked on several forums and such as was told it was my pc, couldn't be the game......so Refund. Ask someone who has actually played the game I guess. Looks fun. Oh well."
Negative,game crashes more than a blind man trying to drive also its a sub based game that was never said before i got it the game makes it overlay difficult to play if you dont buy the sub like no way to get storage chest with ingame gold it all costs crows which funny anuff you can buy in the ingame store for real cash imagine my shock bathesda nickle and dimeing the player with ohh youve got a problem well  we will sort that for you if you give us real money
Negative,"First of all, I would like to take a moment to rant about how UNFAIR this game was.The launcher included with ES:O when you install the game is just fucking AWFUL.Steam counts that, when you download the whole game IN THE FUCKING LAUNCHER as playtime, which voids the refund policy.The game itself doesn't suit me at all, and I was BLINDED by it.This game is a SCAM for the people who want a refund, and Bethesda is exploiting the refund policy by including a LAUNCHER inside of the game, just like TROVE. (Even though its free)I do not recommend."
Negative,Average MMO that does not try to improve over its predecessors in the genre. The mechanics involve a typical MMO combat system and a very basic crafting system. The game combines well established but outdated mechanics with elder scrolls content.
Negative,"amazing game but as of recently i cant long in, the launcher gets stuck in a loading screen and never opens no matter what fixes i try i re-downloaded it from awhile ago to get back in but i guess i cant and wont be returning anytime soon just because of this issue so just pray this dosent happen to you good luck,"
Negative,uncontrollable lag with crashes. The game as of late is unplayable
Negative,"Too long to load, Skyrim is what you want.  Back to Morrowind...?? Really???"
Negative,"pretty boring, and I play runescape"
Negative,don't waste your money ridiculous animations ugly outfits characters makeup and ...........
Negative,Somehow worse than Fallout 76.
Negative,"After only a few hours playing ESO during the trashfire launch, I decided to pick it up for the $18 promo.After playing a few hours with friends, we put it back down again.I find the decor and the graphics to be a little bland.Quests are difficult to follow and navigating the world felt awkward.With no Oceanic servers, the lag in duelling combat made it difficult and unpleasant to fight other players.Mobs and monsters in the starter area of Morrowind were dreary and uninteresting.For $18 it was worth a try, but ESO still hasn't succeeded in enticing me into playing beyond a few starter quests."
Negative,Guess where bethesda found their scummy buisness moddle!
Negative,"i thought i could get same taste as i got from skyrim but its not even near of that. this is the very very very cheap version of wow. dungeon system so stupid while wandering around. LFG system is exactly same as wow. but when you adventuring, questing in world if you go in a dungeon there could be dozen of players doing same things with you and thats killing the spirit of adventuring."
Negative,This game PvP is horrible for beginners you are either stuck going up against pre made team or veteran players that smurf battlegrounds stomping on newbie. So if your loooking for a MMO with good casuals base PvP I would highly not recommend this game....
Negative,"If engaging and entertaining combat is something you seek, I do not recommend this game.If being able to walk around the world Tamriel without paying a 30-40$ toll every ten yards is something you seek, I do not recommend this game. If you fancy yourself a blacksmith, but don't want to pay 15$ per month so that you can hold more than a pocket full of iron ingots, I do not recommend this game.My main issue with this game is the garbage combat system. You essentially walk up to a creature, spam 1-5 for around 10 minutes, and then the creature dies. It is honestly the most unsatisfying experience I have had playing an MMO. Albion Online even feels better than this and I hate that game. If they COMPLETELY overhauled the combat so that abilities felt meaningful, the animations were somewhat engaging to look at, and killing enemies didn't feel like an absolute GRIND, then maybe I would revisit this review. But as it currently stands, I consider this game to be the biggest waste of money, by far, in my steam collection.If you have got money for days and are hell bent on spending it on each of the 9 trillion dlc zones in this game and you dont mind slogging through hours of absurdly not-even-mediocre combat, then go ahead, buy this game. The quests are not totally awful and there is plenty of nostalgia to be had playing this game, provided you are willing to pay with your wallet and soul."
Negative,I BOUGHT THE GAME AND I CAN'T EVEN GET IT TO DOWNLOAD... 3 hours later LOL returning this now..
Negative,very terrible game would not recommend 0 stars
Negative,PS2 era character models and animations
Negative,"I had some fun playing the game for a while with the base version, until I took a look at the map and saw half of the game was covered behind paywalls. The map looks really large and all but half if not more of the map is paid. Don't get stooged by buying this, to buy the entire game with all dlcs your looking at about $60 with discount."
Negative,"我都一整天没上过stm账号了怎么登入上古卷轴这款游戏？怎么作弊/剥削行为？我才玩了一天，创建2个人物，合起来还不到25级，都是慢慢打怪升起来的，2024年4月6号购买的游戏就4月9号当天玩了14.5小时然后就再也没上过线，期间掉线不下10次，我怎么剥削?以及作弊了？14.5小时里面掉线和站着不动被踢下线合起来10几次，你们来解释下吧！你们是真不要脸啊！我这游戏还不是在免费游玩期间下载的！而是用钱买的，最多不是没打折前购入而已，你们是真穷到这几十元都要贪吗？ How about cheating/exploitative behavior? I only played one day, created 2 characters, combined less than 25 levels, are slowly rising, the game purchased on April 6, 2024, played 14.5 hours on April 9 and then never crossed the line, during the line dropped no less than 10 times, how can I exploit? And cheated? In 14.5 hours, dropping the line and standing still and getting kicked off combined 10 times, you can explain! How shameless you are! I did not download this game during the free play period! But with money to buy, at most not before the purchase of no discount, you are really poor to these dozens of dollars are greedy?"
Negative,"Oh?! Another MMO? Crafting? Dungeons? Gear? Quests? Skills? Mult-Player?  Leveling? Seriously?  OMG! I gotta get this -I am pretty sure this is a unique one - right?Sort of reminds me when HW tries to make a movie out of a book. Doesn't work there either. I know this has a ""mostly positive"" however, I am gonna guess and say that just because of the TES title. They say ""...good story telling"" - MMOs are not known for their story telling - Just ask WOW(I have 6.5khrs in that one). TES is much better at their solo games (3,4, excellent, if not stunning stories -  sorry 5 sucks too IMO) There is nothing new to this MMO outside its name. Same as much of modern ""MMO""(GW2, FFXIV) with a TES skin. Wanna play? Watch some youtube footage, I mean REALLY WATCH about an hour or 2. You'll see. same-o-same-o. If you are a TES fanatic - get it. But looking for something different - pass. Actually starts out more like KoR.Again, IMO. Yours may vary."
Negative,"I bought this with high hopes, but I only played it once. I don't play games that do not have single-player mode (even if they are MMO) and I don't play games that take up 95Gigabytes of hard disk space, basically because I want to have space to install a few games (around 30Gigabytes is my limit).So, whatever the game play, I don't like the game because it doesn't take a sufficient range of gamers into account."
Negative,"I just came back to see if I could remember how to play the game. I wondered if the latest expansion... the Isles thing might be interesting. Things have changed. I've purchased most of the EOS expansions. I over paid for the original Imperial Edition of the game. I didn't mind doing that at that time.An interesting experience from then to now. I read an earlier review written by a player who was 49 years old enjoying EOS. He believed this was special. Move over friend. There are people well into their 60s, and older, playing the game. It's been around long enough. I'm sure a few players have made the final keyboard face plant playing the game. Was it worth it? That's a better way to go than watching the nightly news, listening to a lawyer on speaker phone, leaving behind a half full beer. There are better places to be than on the internet.  I have played a few other online games in my absence from EOS. Most notably... Minecraft. You could be a 110 and still have fun playing Minecraft alone, with family, and with good friends. I was thinking on buying two of my teenage children EOS accounts. We've tried playing things like World of Warcraft, Neverwinter, Ark: Survival, Black Desert, Fallout, Grim Dawn, Valheim, Far Cry, and a few Warhammer franchise titles. There always seems to be a point where interest wanes because of advertising, general community experiences, and then the game quirks. My teens are happier playing Roblox. I won't install that program on a Windows computer I use for fun and or work. I know better. I can compile a ""Hello world!"" program on several different platforms. I've had to clean up my kids computers as a result of their Roblox experiences.  Is EOS any worse or better than everything else? That's subjective, of course. EOS is about a B- grade right now when it comes to online gaming experiences. It's better than WoW, Grim Dawn, Neverwinter, and a few others. It's not as interesting as Minecraft. Not even close. I found playing Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim better with my kids. That was an ""A"" experience. The challenge is... with that; you have set up game hacks to play multiplayer. The hacks break and can take months to be fixed. If they are fixed. It's been more than a few months since we've tried to run a multiplayer Skyrim session. As I remember how to play an EOS character I levelled up to 50... I thought to myself. I'd rather just play this multiplayer in closed private sessions; preferably running my own server. So here is my suggestion.Lower the price of everything EOS to a point where it's cheaper to just let you do that for me.  Or sell me what I need to setup my own server on my own iron. You, EOS, can make money selling hosted servers. If want to sell toys and eye candy; if that costs more than a coffee, donut, and a smoke, then it's already too expensive. Major expansions... if they are worth it we'll pay for them. I'm looking at an EOS 2023 sale... the prices are not too bad; but! The price is still too high to pay to subjugate my kids to an online shopping mall that can't seem to get maintenance to replace broken light bulbs. Then there are the dirty floors and the food court garbage needs to be cleaned up. Last thing... the clowns running around who bother everyone. Right now.... unless the game price drops to something like $3.99 American, that's generous, with the present issues... the game is too expensive. If you happen to be one of those people with too much money, not enough time, but having the thought that you can pick up an angle paying for an EOS subscription. There is value here. But the valuables are rare diamonds in a truck loads of coal. I noticed twice that ""players"" were chatting about investments and then there was other chat advertising other stuff. If you're going to pay people to play the accounts; well. That's good for what ever economy ends up with a little extra financial fluidity.  I've met people who use online gaming to research and track... stuff. People pay to play how ever they like. The motivations are many. It's still cheaper than buying lottery tickets or going to Vegas with better long-term returns. It's your money: give it away and play!If those suggestions help the EOS team rethink opportunities.... then maybe EOS wins. Hopefully the game becomes more accessible and improves for it's audiences. That can be a new audience, present audience, or returning interests. No one loses if the game improves and stabilizes. I certainly don't want EOS to end up like Warhammer Online. Too bad about that one.I came here to remember, rethink, and then spend some money. My interest in spending money subsided quickly playing and watching the interactions in chat. Then there are the quests that are... basically advertising. I'm glad I hit a couple of those. That pissed me off. I stopped playing WoW because of that type of bait, hook, and reel in, approach.  It saved my credit card from a little bit of wear and tear being pulled out of, and then returned to, a wallet. I'll check back in a few months. Every so often there are miracle sales at Steam.... I'm waiting for the next one. I'll rethink my opinion of EOS, the prices, at a later junction point. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy your New Year; stay safe."
Negative,"literally not playble bugs, login issues, so long loading times, we have to get unlinked from steam. this game not working well with steam"
Negative,"Good game Dont buy through steamEdit:Also its a mmo, expect pay-2-win options."
Negative,This is nothing like Elder Scrolls.
Negative,why?i can't play
Negative,"endless patches, it says i played 29 hours, Ive played zero thats all patching time"
Negative,This game is a joke. How can it be worse than Morrowind and Skyrim ? Just make it single player and polish it. It has no depth. They nerfed every feature from Skyrim. You have all the cons of a MMO without the pros. The main thing it's lacking is IMMERSION. Every few steps something breaks your immersion. Quests are dull. Skill system is boring...
Negative,"I don't generally like MMOs, and I don't like their high subscription prices, gatekeeping content, and ridiculously priced DLC. I played The Elder Scrolls Online when the Morrowind expansion came out, and I really liked it. But it's just another generic MMO, and I stopped playing it. I'm not going to buy any more expansions, which are probably necessary to still enjoy the game."
Negative,"Yet another game where animationms and films presented here on Steam have nothing incommon with the in-game experience. MMO where initially you spend most of the time playing on your own - no matter if you play a backstabber, tank or squishy mage. The only moments when you need to cooperate are rare bosses (found just a few such locations on the starting island looks as if those were soert of daily quests). Other than that - you can easily kill everything on you own. And this is a big no no in an MMO Game. It is worth mentioning it is a rare occurence to see people looking for groups to fight those rare bosses...All in all - do not expect to see such a fight early in game...Fighting system feels kind of awkward, unpolished. Hand to hand - feels as if you were fighting using a wooden plank. This is something that was good in games like Dark Age of Camelot (I used to play it ages ago). Magic? oh gods... where is fun in that? You just stand in one place spamming 2 spells and that is it. Even ""customisation"" of your spell line (modification of spells etc) is boring and does not affect i.e animation of the spells too much. It might be really difficult for me to get any further so probably my review will be branded as written by someone who has no idea about end game content. And this will be true. However better this than to be bored to death when ""enjoying"" this game..."
Negative,"If a freshly installed game won't run after rebooting and being launched as an Administrator, the game is broken and I will not recommend it. At least I was lucky enough to download it while it was free."
Negative,"meeh probably wouldnt even play it 4 free... graphics are medeocre, moving feels like floating, environments look like a typical mmo and it seems like thats just what it is"
Negative,PIle of buggy mess. Whole zone not responsive for 5 days and no fix. Game masters are non existent. I considered subscribing but frankly it's not worth the frustration.
Negative,Keeps disconnecting. Asked refund.
Negative,"A quote from ZOS, ""If you're Australian, get fucked lol. We'll take your money but we won't give you a server to play on. Enjoy your 300+ ping and unplayable PvP noob."""
Negative,This game is awful everything needs a dlc and it's boring as hell
Negative,"Everything is unintuitive and I spent more time trying to manage inventory than playing the game. 3/10, it feels like 1999 everquest, but the graphics are great."
Negative,"Didn't get to choose where I played.  Was forced in to Morrowind.  I had fun for a bit, but the questline kind of bored me.  To be fair, I played during a free weekend.  My experience may have been different if I bought the game/paid a subscription/whatever."
Negative,"Can't swap classes. New expac came out or got tired of the already lackluster combat/animations and want to at least freshen it up a bit with another class? Well, too bad. Either stick with it or let go of hundreds of hours of progress and redo everything. Why they can't add class swaps in 2021 is beyond me, FF14 got this down many years ago but I guess MTX rules over all. They need that progress boost MTX cash flow"
Negative,"Абсолютно скучнейшая игра, подойдёт вам если у вас только 3 пальца на две руки, боёвка скучнейшая, все активности сводят к скучнейшему однокнопочному гринду, в том числе пвп. Советую к покупе только по скидке в 99% и если вам надо забить 90гб места"
Negative,"Well, I thought it was going to be something like TES previous games, so I thought to give it a shot, for free so whatever, but this game doesn't feel quite like TES AT ALL!. It literally took me more time to download and install the bloody game than uninstalling it.I have been playing TES since Dagerfall and Arena and this game doesn’t fit the bill, I am a fan of TES but not of MMOs and this game didn’t help with that. It was for free and still felt like they ripped me offCombat system is good can’t complain, graphics as well but that’s about it.Now the bad, the TES games are all about exploring, looting and crafting and this game you literally have to be racing other players for materials and loot (that’s why I hate MMOs). Then the subscription fees and horrendous inventory management . . .Thanks, but no thanks. I rather re-play the previous TES games than this thing.Bethesda, what have you done with TES?"
Negative,"I wanted to return to this game, but i hate Ads and Microtansations that are rigth in my face in a game that I have paid for. Also in game menus ar scaling wrong and evrything looks bad, I managed to fix it by manualy editing settings file."
Negative,Game is goodCombat sucks
Negative,Crafting is one of the main parts of the came. Crafting bag is locked behind the subscription.
Negative,"I mean wtf... WHY is the game so blueish/violette and totally unclear/foggy? Your eyes just hurt after a while, its so ugly. I mean skyrim looks literally better :O....I play the game with ultra graphics but I REALLY had to download the program reshade and preset for it on nexus that makes the game sunnier and clearer because without it, the game is unplayable, even skyrim looks better...Thank god reshade exists. I hope they make a patch and fix that.4 Years later no fix at all, they didnt reshade it... bethesda bad as always"
Negative,"You download all ~80 gigs of this game through steam only to be greeted by the launcher which will force you to allocate another ~80 gigs then download years of updates because steam only keeps the base game. You literally need 125 gigs of free space to download this game and nowhere are you warned about the 2nd half of the download.I spend 4 days downloading through steam only to find out I don't have enough drive space for the game. What the hell? It's a big game, whatever, I wouldn't mind if they'd fucking tell you, but noooooo. Download 80 gigs only for the launcher to tell you you don't have enough space. Oh, and the launcher doesn't even tell you HOW MUCH SPACE YOU NEED: it only gives you an error code that once clicked on throws you to a website that says you need ""at least 125 gigs free"". Why can't it say that on the steam page? Why can't steam download the full game? Why can't I just clear space on my computer? It was already a squeeze to download the initial 80 and maybe I wouldn't have deleted things to clear the space in the first place if I knew I would actually need double the space.Literally just wasted 4 days of my time."
Negative,"FOR ANYONE WHO ARE ABOUT OR PLANNING TO BUY ELDERSCROLL ONLINE:1. You are not buying the full-game!! To actually unlock everything you need to pay around $100 more, buying the game only give you 1 DLC MORROWWIND. I f***ing hate this!2. It look nothing like the trailer :v, I was too hype for this game and end up dissappointing myself :( 3. The combat is not challenging as Skyrim, I found this to be the biggest set back. The roll regarding using a bow is very boring. Shooting a bow in ESO is like clicking the mouse and auto attack the monster4. The story is boring, very boring, no hype, no climax, its ok if you are interested, but this is not Fallout, your choice of dialog does not matter (sometime it does, on the side mission lol)5. Very out-dated, the enviroment are very limited, it looks big, seem big, but it lack player interaction.6. The control make no sense! Why bring all the MMORPG element but still move by using WASD, wouldn't it be the same as clicking because all of the attack is semi target lock.7. You can't climb rock, low edges, which is non-senseI have been playing mmorpg for 10 years, countless of similar genre such as ESO, I was just looking for something new and guess that I didn't do my research enough before trying ESO.If you want to try ESO, be my guest, it is still a very fun game, may be, but not for me."
Negative,"It's a beautiful game that plays too much like an MMO and not enough like an elder scrolls game.If you like grinding, and you like elder scrolls, by all means this one is probably right up your alley.If you were looking for a game where you could have the playability of the elder scrolls games in a world where you could join your friends... this isn't really it.Get ready to learn the best way of building your tree and which buttons to mash in which succession, assuring that in the end you're simply playing any other run of the mill MMORPG game.As a person who logged countless hours into both oblivion and skyrim on console and PC, this game left me feeling uninspired after only about 30 hours of play. Where skyrim would have rewarded you for exploration, ESO only punishes you for finding yourself in an area you just weren't supposed to be in yet, which in my opinion flies in the face of the older games. Sure there were daedric quests and things with level caps, but I never felt like finding one of them was also putting you in an area where backtracking your steps and fleeing monsters far far out of your level was the only option for progression.I'm sure its a fine MMO, it is not however a fine Elder Scrolls game. I certainly hope they don't stop making games like they did in the past to focus on this."
Negative,i tried playing this game but i simply couldnt. Theres something really messed up about the camera movement that feels like the sensitivity jumps from 100dpi to 10000 at random. Simply unplayable.After googling a bit some (but not all) people say this can be fixed by getting a new mouse. Well my mouse is really good and i play a lot of games and never had such issues. If you need a specific mouse to play this game then f* it all together.
Negative,"Not a good game.  Was bad 4 years ago and has not aged very well.It is like one of those cheap browsergames that exploit the human mind by offering daily login rewards and a ton of cosmetic shit to hide the fact, that they offer no rewarding gameplay.Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim are way better - by a mile. An unmodded Skyrim has even better graphics and presentation. But Teso runs on a potato, I guess.Stay away from this garbage."
Negative,"Got game subscribed, game didn't start. Went to ESO support, the conversation ended with tech saying fix it yourself, in a nicer fashion. Don't fall into this mony pit!!!!!!!!!!!! Plz don't!!!!!!! this is a pointless cause of frustration. Even though I still want to play this game, I have backed away, hopefully never to return."
Negative,"They deliberately try to make it as difficult as possible to delete your account(if it's even possible, i tried contacting support who i hear is terrible) or have any say over your personal information, very sketchy company. Also, if you don't want to do tedious inventory management all the time, you need to pay $15 a month."
Negative,"I spent two days trying to install, patch, and then play this game. At first I installed this game from steam library. Everything went fine, but when I started the game, SetupAnywhere appeared, went to 100% and that was the end. Then I downloaded TESO client directly from TESO website, tried to install the game, but result was the same - SetupAnywhere, 100% and then nothing. AV disabled, firewall turned off, pc in router's DMZ. I googled somewhere, that in my TEMP folder I would find a .zip file with the Launcher. So I found it, extracted, installed the game. It was patching whole day. After that I could run the launcher, but I got always ""Login failed"" (errors 200, 201, 210 and without a number), although I could log in to my TESO accunt via website. After two days of trying every fix I could find on the Internet I gave up."
Negative,"I own a mac and was excited to see ESO be released for my platform, so I hurry and buy it then click the download button... It took days to download I have now idea why. All the other games I've bought took no where near the amount of time ESO took to download. SO when it finally finished downloading I clicked launch as soon as I could but was disappointed when it crashed time and time again. My computer runs all the other games I have gotten from Steam completly perfectly fine. But didn't like ESO for some reason. So I go to the help center and spent literal hours trying to figure it out. I couldn't so out of fustration I just returned it. Really sad I couldn't play it, I'm sure it would have been really fun too. It's a shame that mac games have so little support and games in general. I hope that developers finally bring attention to these issues and I'm sure a lot of other mac users would agree."
Negative,"Played for about 250 hours. Multiple characters/classes/builds. I guess I played for the nostalgia bait, it's really not a good game by any means. Just a decent time waster if you're a multi-tasker and want something to do while listening to podcasts or watching TV. It's got no real challenge other than the pvp and that gets kinda stale after a while. Any ""difficulty"" just comes down to spongy bosses and one shot mechanics. It's more frustrating as opposed to being skillfully challenging. Builds, both pve and pvp are pretty much ""meta or don't bother"", you can buy almost any gear that you might want in game, grinding money is easy as whales will pay for crafting mats so they can save time. Cosmetics and ESO plus are the only content that ZOS puts any quality care into and it's just boring reskins. (There is a pay to skip the grind mechanic for real money also.)Overall, if you can get it on sale for $9.99, it's worth playing around for a bit. I wouldn't put any money into it of bother buying any of the extra crap that does nothing."
Negative,"Bugs, glitches, not happy at all with this game"
Negative,"With the latest update, you can no longer do the simple functions of the game. For instance, queuing up for a random daily does not work anymore. Doing things in the guild trader you can not do anymore. PVP you can not use abilities anymore. Buyer beware!!! Game is on a downward spiral."
Negative,Most of this play time is AFK. Good fun game but I live in Oceania so really bad ping 450 - 500 + makes this unplayable.Sadly this will never be fixed. Zenimax won't set up an Oceania server because pop is too low but Oceania players try it and leave because of the terrible lag so the pop stays low. Catch 22 love it. The MMORPG search rolls on
Negative,"The game bug of keep freezing have never being fix, every 5 -10min the game freeze with background still going on with sound. An hour or two gaming time require you to restart the software more than 7 times, do not recommend buying this game till the bugs have being fixed.The search engine is fill of this bugs of thousand of players having same issue but no solution to it."
Negative,Good mmo but don't buy it on steam. #elderscrollsoffline
Negative,Character customization is really weak.
Negative,"Just a ES branded, dry, standard MMO that doesn't captivate you in the same way that previous titles did. Granted, immersion isn't supposed to be main part of mose multiplayers, but questing with a group is just monotonous and boring generally. I don't know if by endgame the experience is uplifted and more animated but for me it lacks depth and character that made Oblivion and Skyrim so excellent. 5/10Voice acting, character customization, bugs 10/10"
Negative,"This is a great game, but the company that owns it is completely garbage at handling bad situations or even running the server properly. Currently the game is not running half of the time and when it does, the lag due to connection issues with the servers is unacceptable. There is a huge quality leap between NA and EU servers which adds fuel to the fire."
Negative,"Easily the best mmo I have ever played, and this is from a hardcore, die-hard World of Warcraft player who has been in competitive ranks.EDIT: Since my first review, I played 1700 hours. I regret to say that with every patch and update, the quality of the game declined consistently and without fault. The game in its current state is a shell of its former self, and to all those who are considering picking up the game in 2020 or 2021, I'd recommend you not to.The combat has degraded to an unenjoyable unbalanced drag. You are forced to play with single target DOTs but have no way of tracking them. All forms of AOE spells are useless. This means that even when you pull 5-10 enemies, you are still required to use the same generic DOTing rotation of 6-7 boring spells on each and every single enemy instead of using your AOE attacks. This is a clear and unmistakable design flaw. Moreover, this has removed any identity from the classes for them all to become a generic re-flavoring of the DOT build. Servers have not received an update since the game's creation. The lag is absurd, wPVP is still not playable even years after and who would want to play something that is THAT unbalanced. For any PVP lovers, this game is not for you.Being able to keep gear relevant across patches and expansions is one of the best designs I have ever seen. However, the evolution of set bonuses has locked classes into meta's instead of giving choice and flexibility. Nowadays, there is only 1 correct option. A few years back, I remember friendly disagreements in guild or general chat over which setup was best. You will not have this anymore.The game's optimization is still shoddy. I have a killer machine and internet connection and can run 144 fps with 2 ms latency in World of Warcraft on maximum settings. This game feels like it's still in 2012 coming out of some college kid's dorm: unoptimized engine, huge lag and fps spikes which kill the weapon-swapping system, poor texture clipping, and overall broken systems and bugs (lol Group Finder)."
Negative,"An offline mode with all multiplayer aspects removed is what this game needs. Tried to enjoy it but the combat is uninspiring and the iconic Seyda Neen doesn't even have an easter egg in the census office referring back to Morrowind. Why have the start point be in Morrowind's Seyda Neen if you're not going to even add a nod back to the games island? I also do not enjoy having my backpack arbitrarily limited to a certain amount of slots, even an encumbrance system would be better. I spent 15 minutes walking around trying to pick up all the mushrooms and plants littering the floor but I found they were just meshes and not actual containers holding any alchemy ingredients. Which is quite disappointing when every game prior had more to loot. Also thanks for the life changing 4 Gold. Totally going to buy a scrib jelly pie with that.... Oh wait yeah I cannot afford a scrib jelly pie..... <---- Turns out they're not even a thing! Thought this was supposed to be a fleshed out world? Sure though I guess the 3 slops of potion scrolls and spells cut it right? Elder Slop Online. One SlopI understand some people love this game for having all of Tamriel but I just cannot enjoy this game myself when I have to play around dungeons and quests with other people spam jumping and running everywhere breaking the immersion, I might as well just spam 1 to skip all of the dialogue so I can get away from the other players faster. No point in pressing left click either when some guy can just run into the same crypt and kill all of them for me.Like seriously the first quest where you escort some guy through an ancestral tomb right near Seyda Neen so you can ask Mr Mighty Vivec some questions is a terrible intro when You can just walk in there and see other people killing the NPCs for you and just sprinting through the entire thing as if they're on some sort of time limit......I KNOW there is an addon that makes people invisible but why would I want to larp as a schizophrenic seeing NPCs in the distance just randomly die or fight the air? If that was on my RP list to be a schizophrenic breton from high rock stuck in a swamp with NPCs fighting the air sure, I would consider it, but this game just needs an official offline mode."
Negative,"Could be a good game, but between the new pay to fast (borderline pay to win) in the store and the state of the EU server (unable to log, load time between 10 and 20 minutes and in game latency beyond 1kms, was 100ms last week) i cannot recommend it.Tips for zenimax, never go full fallout 76... oh wait they are the same..."
Negative,"The servers are so shitty it blows my mind that people actually play this game. I thought maybe the beginning area might just be a laggier than the rest, but sadly it's just their servers. I get kicked out and D/C'd all the time and this is not so with my 250 + other steam games."
Negative,"*Cynicism ahead, be warned: *I bought this because it was on sale and free 2 play, i'd been in the beta too. My immediate thoughts were, this isnt so bad, after 2-3 hours of play i couldnt help but compare it to skyrim, and world of warcraft. It's neither of those games. The engine running at ultra is pretty poor when comparing it to Skyrim, which is understandable considering it's an MMO. I personally found it difficult to differentiate between NPC's and Players in towns. Weapons and armour have durability, which is a pain in the face if you're playing a squishy class or want to go full healer or something - the AI is actually better in Skyrim from what little of it i'd seen in 2-3 hours. On the plus side, it's a whole lot better than it was in the beta, it just doesnt have the same pull and depth as Skyrim, and it doesnt have the addictiveness of WoW. Which is a shame, because it really could have been a wonderful co-op game.  Typical MMO model, pay to get better stuff or dont and grind hard. If that's your thing, go for it. If you're like me and wanted a skyrim substitute dont do it. Preorder Fallout 4 or something."
Negative,"Not worth the hassle.First you download a huge package of data (75 GB), then you find out it is an installer. After you install the data, you'll have another package to download, namely an update package.After installing that you can have various issues why don't you connect. Some have server troubles... I had them too. The update package could not unpack itself, which resulted in the package being present, but not installed correctly. So I had to repair the game, which involved checking 32 GB of data and then another check of 45 GB of data and then download of everything that was missing. After that I couldn't get through loading screen after creating my account.So I spent 36 hours only getting this game to work and it offered me a boring hack and slash experience.The only thing that makes it a little bit better is the fact that I got it from humble bundle, so I wasn't forced to pay a penny for this game."
Negative,"Multiplayer is awful. Super difficult, to just join and the quest sharing never works."
Negative,Don't waste your time(like I did) oh go ahead waste all the time you want. i just cant quit you
Negative,dont waste your life on this game if you like pvp its busted as all get out
Negative,It's still bad.
Negative,"This game unfortunately was a little disappointing, it didn't have the same Elder Scrolls feel to it compared to games like Skyrim or Oblivion. It got boring after about 3 hours with simple repetitive quests. I definitely feel that they could've done this better. I also didn't like the graphics style, it just didn't portray the way Elder Scrolls should look. Unfortunately, not recommended."
Negative,"I was disappointed how they reused a map from a previous game with graphics worse than that game, and although i didn't play that long it wasn't up to par with the videos shown on steam."
Negative,"DO NOT PURCHASE! The patch updater is completely broken and has been for months, and Bethesda refuses to do anything about it.Also, any time spend in the patcher will count against your ""hours played"" in your Steam account, so if it goes over two, you can't get a refund, even if you never get into the game.This and the Fallout 76 fiasco is showing me is that Bethesda is utterly incapable of making a functional MMO."
Negative,wasted a whole year of my life on this god forsaken game dont play biggest waste of time
Negative,"bit crap, just get skyrim"
Negative,cant even start the game up and my playtime just keeps going.
Negative,"Great game, when it works. I get kicked out of the server once per hour in average. If you are considering buying this game, make yourself a favor and find another great game that will not drive you crazy. Seriously, dont buy this game."
Negative,"Came back after about a year and it simply doesn't work any more; continual black screens and lockups after the splash screen.  I managed to get to the character select screen once, where ESO hard locked and required yet another reboot."
Negative,"I expect a payed game to at least to run/start, especially if it is a big title like this one. To my surprise (despite my computer meeting the requirements) the game won't even let me get through the launcher. Let's just say that I have never owned a game with this level of functionality; that functionality being that it does not work at all. The game only endlessly loads in the launcher, doing absolutely nothing, among other stuff that made even getting to play the game virtually impossible.As a payed customer I can hardly be expect to do the developer's job of making their game work. This game was published on 2014, it is fair to assume that this level of non-functionality would have been fixed or updated by now by the developers. What I have heard is that the game does not have this problem if you buy it directly from ESO site (cannot confirm this for myself though), thus I will say that I really cannot recommend buying this game (via Steam at least); it simply may not function at all if you are as unlucky as I was apparently.I am deeply disappointed. 100% refunding this one.PS: To answer to the developer's response. I tried multiple methods/remedies/fixes to the problem I described earlier, including the one you mentioned and unfortunately none of them worked to fix the problem. Thus the problem persisted to the point of frustration. No game should have a problem of this caliber this late after it's initial release."
Negative,"i do not recommend buying this off steam....nothing against steam ive bought games through steam before and no problems for me this game is broken from steam and they need to fix it apparently it works fine off the eso website? and i hadnt even been able to even play the game, yet steam says ive played for 9hours? could my account be hacked? anyway im stuck with it now and will continue to see if they actually fix the problem eventually! i see the same problem since 2016 appearing on numerous sites and still no fix? please get this working id love to be able to play it!-------------EDIT----------------                            It works now"
Negative,"I'm a greater fan of Elder Scrolls Series, but this game was a waste of time : / , only 5 hotkeys skills to use, and all with same animations without relying on weapons... The adventurer is a little cool to the history hunters, but the skills and combat are very poor yet... AND I played with 4 friends...Still Boring :("
Negative,"Privacy policy is such shit that nobody should agree with it, holy hell this game is not Free to Play and even has an in-game shop, so why sell your data, insane third party abuse. I would like to keep my data otherwise I would sell them myself ... damn thanks Bethesda."
Negative,"I had over 150GB space, but still couldn't play this game. This game exceeds 85GB limit."
Negative,"Very good Elder Scrolls game. Very bad MMO.I don't want other people in my Tamriel experience, I found out.I played the free trial. All I wanted was to explore the world, do some side quests to aid people.Instead, I was forced to do quests, because there are no caves or bandit hideouts I could loot for items. Yet quest rewards were hidden until I obtain them, so oops, all that effort was for handful of gold I get for selling them. So much for ""Play the Way You Like"".As for the exploration, I don't even know how to leave Vvardenfell where I started. Can I leave it before I complete the story quest there? I have no idea, the game hasn't told me anything. And if I leave it, the content won't scale to me, right, so I'll get stomped. Already had that experience with a monster that was apparently a party boss.I'm sure the game is fun for a lot of people. Not for me."
Negative,"To be fair, there are elements of this game that are very well done, Almost all of them are undermined by silly, nonsensical  design decisions that make the game more frustrating than fun to play. Lack of basic MMO features like a functional auction house and a competent group finder are the deal breakers for me. The game experience quickly devolves into a badly designed inventory management simulator.I should write a more complete and in depth review, but life is short and I'm not going to waste the precious moments. I ONLY recommend this game if you can get it on sale. It is not a game that has much long term appeal. As a casual short term experience you can probably get enough short term value out of this at sale price, but the full sixty-dollar buy-in is not a good value."
Negative,"The game is buggy, the bosses are sickeningly easy, the monsters are just puny, and the quests are boring and insultingly dumb. But what really gets me with this game are the DISGUSTING MARKETING PRACTICES.They market the game like it's a one-off purchase, but what you get without the ESO+ monthly subscription is an utterly and purposely broken version of the game: no accessories crafting, nightmarish item management, countless areas with all the important gear and the most fun bosses are precluded, traits research is impossibly long, and the list goes on.Honesty, I only play this game because I want to play an MMO and all my dumb friends have it. Go play Black Desert if you can."
Negative,Meh... time sink; pay to win structure is poo poo.
Negative,fun game at start but very repetative i wouldnt say its worth the meney
Negative,My character seem very weak with yellow gear/weapons on.  Seems like this game isn't for solo players.
Negative,"While it's not a bad game per-se, it's not worth the price of admission. Only consider this game if it's massively-discounted, and don't bother with the overpriced DLCs even if they are.Also, you see where it claims to require 85GB? Yeah, that's a lie. The game requires over a hundred GB at time of writing, and that's only going to increase as time goes on."
Negative,"As a elder scroll lover it was most epic MMORPG i have ever played untill i learn...DarkBrotherhood --- DLC Thief Guild -----------DLCImperial Race --------DLCWarden Class --------DLCEvery content in this game is DLC and they are not cheap at all. If you are asking money for every f..ing content why the hell you call it Tamriel ""UNLIMITED"" its nothing but bullshit."
Negative,"The game visually attractive. Character control is pleasant and fills solid.I did not get to do crafting because the 120 items I looted were not a sum or combination that would make a single food or drink item. I assume, like may parts of the game I did discover, they expect you to go on line and search HOW TO DO THIS IN OUR GAME or ask other players in an INANE and unexplained chat system using an ancient UI format for people with 20/20 visionI did not get to do any instances because the community of newer players or low level players is non-existentI did not see a town. I was able to be given access to a bank in a players house. Housing looks..massive and I would imagine burdensome, but that's only speculation.There is no direction in game. You meander until you find a quest. You will stumble on to dragons at level 2...Do not go near them, this is not Skyrim. I wish it were more like Skyrim as then, at least, I would have an idea on what direction to goInventory, which was my need for a bank, is idiotic. It is limited to a point of intention. The game makes it's money off of a 14.99 subscription that unlocks crafting inventory capacity. That means, in a fantasy MMO, if you wish to craft or save items for later use, you have a hard cap UNLESS you spend 14.99.I disliked the game overall. Not new player friendly by any measure and no clear direction on what to do or how to do it...lockpicking, jesus...It's all ""after the fact"" when it comes to warnings. One of the pluses was death penaltys. For me, at least, they were non-existent and that makes exploring far more friendly.Still, I would not recommend the game for new players at all, regardless of how smooth and pretty it was."
Negative,"In a genre defined by looking at your stats and watching the Number Go Up, ZOS have managed to create the world's first Number Go Down MMO."
Negative,well it's fun but many dlc missing ... i guess i have to buy all of themedit:game gone woke it's trash now. just deleted this game. it's sad that game industry doing this.
Negative,"The account you have to make at the start is too clustered,be carefull when buying this,dont get overwhelmed by the whole multiplayer thing,there are issues."
Negative,"I Don't recommend this game to Middle-eastern players, the ping so high above than 200 when playing in Dubai you won't even enjoy the game especially PVP. i regret buying this game."
Negative,"Almost no one is playing the game anymore, and the dungeon queue takes a long time"
Negative,"The amount of time this game has become ""unavailable due to maintenance"" lately is becoming a real problem. Especially considering I spend real money on a subscription for this game every month. How is this even legal?"
Negative,Bad Game I would not get. My friends are booboo for playing this game.
Negative,"after 437 hours of gameplay my launcher isn't working. i've tried several ""fixes"" for this problem, but none work. i hit play and it just say loading........... forever. i'd just like to thank steam for being a complete trash bag of a company when it comes to third party games, and hope that it won't cost to much to repurchase direct from bethesada. steam has no phone number to call for support, and emails go unanswered for weeks, and just tell you to do the shiiiiiiite you've already tried. great game, but when it comes to third party steam can suck meh arse."
Negative,"there are better mmos, better rpgs, with better communities, from less cancerous publishers"
Negative,"its still not Skyrim ,ok!   XD))boring"
Negative,the game never installed a file that it needed so I was never able to play
Negative,Did not enjoy the game at all. Just running around from point A to B back to A.
Negative,Would be nice if Zenimax stopped deleting my ratings and stopped paying Twitch streamers to give this bland game more positive ratings.
Negative,"When I think basic, vanila mmorpg this is what I think but maybe somebody is enough TES hungry for something like this, not me though."
Negative,I am finding it hard to enjoy this game when i cant get past 4% when downloading the patchs. So i have no plays time as i have spend my 48 hours waiting for the patches to finish downloading - but as stated i am stuck at 4%
Negative,getting rid of the use of half the games content an especially built lizards who summons seven things is really sad you can not butcher the game anymore then you now have the new developers already have you ruined player count drops every month an you took away mostly every persons build again (except this time you played with the summons an proc sets in pvp!) you will have even less players next year cause the new individuals in charge of pvp needed to be canned two years ago when they started failinghave supported a few dlcs an have played sense alpha on an off will never return to the game in this butchered state you cater to insanity like the ark developers making the same mistakes expecting different results an hoping to hear what you an want an to ignore what needs to be herd foolish foolshalf the content in the game is put in an never touched on again leading to massive bugs zenimax does not finish things an instead has a chart they make up on a daily as needed there is not much of a plan other then to try an keep individuals paying with there dlc releases an plus an for the poor folks who probably will not see an end game cause the servers an the game will be pulled from be milked seven years to longan alright an decent game destroyed by a new team who probably can not handle themselves let alone cooperate alpha was great morrowind summerset an eleswyer where also fantastic everything that came after from the new team has hurt the community sorry for being harsh tho your team has no care for anyone or there time
Negative,"The content of this game is good, I wont deny that. The creative department does their job. But the way it has been managed and maintained is horrible. The developers are either only working on new content or really incompetent. Some of the bugs have been happening for years, the servers are as unstable as ****. And if a new DLC is released the servers just grind to a halt because they simply cant handle the load.Crashing is frequent, which is unacceptable for a big title such as The Elder Scrolls. And if you contact support about that, they try and blame it on your drivers etc. Your skills simply wont proc, you can notice the 2/3 of the keypresses are simply not recognized.I have always loved the ES titles because of the content, but in this state I would not recommend anyone on sinking any money in it, because you will get frustrated rather quickly, and will regret any money and time you could have spent in advancing a character in a game that actually is playable.The crownstore (real currency store) is holy, so if any bugs occur there, they are fixed as soon as humanly possible. For the game-play bugs, well like I said, some have been around for years and are simply not deemed important enough to fix. Probably because it doesn't make them money.All the positive aspects of this game are overshadowed by the lack of interest/effort that the company puts into making the game as good as it could be. Which is a shame, because with a little more effort this game could've been great.Response to Developer response:Nice of you to mention that I could submit a ticket, as I am currently in the process of trying to troubleshoot crashes. However all the ""support"" team does is:- Blame my drivers (which are up to date)- Blame windows (which is up to date)- Blame my internet connection (I have glasfiber, and no connection issues)- Blame addons (which also shouldnt give problems, since the addon system is an option offered by the game)When I try to actually steer towards the problem you can notice these people have no technical experience and are just reading from a playbook. Every time I make an argument it is just ignored and the reading of the playbook continues.And saying that your team ""works to ensure that our players have the best possible experience"", is also just false, since there have been bugs and reports of them (on your own forums also) that have been around for years.However releasing new content and letting people pay for that seems to have the highest priority while some parts of the game (Alliance war for instance) are just unplayable.As can be read from several other steam reviews:- ""Skills not firing, disconnects, lag, bugs, you name it, ESO has it"", review By Blossam- ""but even with 20 people on the screen it starts to lag and sometimes gets disconnected"" review by Chef-117These bugs have been around for ages and have not been adressed properly since.About ""We never add items to the Crown Store with the intention of making it harder for our players to enjoy ESO"", I have never said you added items to make it harder. I said you give priority to fixing bugs when they cost you money directly, and ignore bugs that affect playabilty of the game.Stop pretending that you care about anything else than the bottom line."
Negative,"The game is nice when it does work, however it very often gets stuck and you just wait and wait and wait hoping it is a long load screen and not stuck.Customer support responds relatively quickly but are not very helpful, they seems to have programmed answer so I am not certain if it is a bot or an actual person."
Negative,"Honestly, I picked this game up because I'm a fan of Open-World RPG's, but this game is just plain boring, not really worth the money even on sale."
Negative,"Devs have been focusing on housing more and more aggressively, the game is turning into SIMS the elder scrolls mod."
Negative,I had more fun writing this negative review then I did playing it. Had a poor time
Negative,"Assumption you are a veteran player. Limited help on what you should do, boring, sold spare weapons and armour in my bag, knowing I was safe wearing my kit, lost the lot, had no weapon to fight with, no warnings at all. Lots of books to read with many pages of boring rubbish to read and absorb, If I wanted to read a book, I would have gone to the library.  heavily imprinted that you pay out more for addons, FFS I have only just paid £15 and find it hard to see the value."
Negative,"Purchased this game to play with my best friend, after bethesda's e'3 depressed me again.. I really wanted to like this game, and still play it as an excuse to play with the homie, but there are some things you should know before spending 30 bucks. There is almost no player run economy. I hear rumors about guild trading and selling, but you have to be in a guild to do it. They of course explain none of this to you. I know they want to be different from other mmo's but at least try to explain your game mechanics. The combat is ""ok"" and hasn't put me fully to sleep yet. Although im in the early levels of the game I feel completely unchallenged. The difficulty could definetly use a tune up. You have very limited inventory unless you buy more, so you find yourself ridding it of all the food and cheap things and filling it with ""green"" drops that will sell for something at market. Microtransactions are everywhere and dont look to be worth it to me (One of the player houses on there goes for 100 actual usd). This game will sit in my library as a constant reminder that todd howard spit in my mouth and I pretended to like it while I wait for tes6."
Negative,"If you're in to games that act like a Free-to-play that's going to nickel and dime you for every bit of content it can, that hides behind a Buy-to-Play shroud, you'll probably enjoy this.Bought the base game expecting to atleast have access to a decent amount of content, only to open my map and see multiple dungeons locked behind a paywall, that aren't even part of Summerset.No thanks, already paid a base price, I don't need to have MTX shoved all up in my face blocking me off from content.A paid base game having a cash shop that completely locks out some content and having an optional sub is just being greedy as piss, hard pass. Refunded that garbage so I could go spend my money on a game that isn't going to pressure me into buying extra crap.If you're after a good Buy-to-play MMO, just go look at Guild Wars 2 instead, atleast that cash shop is only cosmetic."
Negative,"Updated review as of 5/25/2024:This game really feels like that ""That's good! That's bad."" Simpsons meme when it comes to the subscription model.Zenimax: ""Our game is 15 dollars a month, the same price you'll pay for a FFXIV sub, which is arguably the better MMO experience.""Me: ""That's bad.""Zenimax: ""But you can play it for free!""Me: ""That's good!""Zenimax: ""But we have the worst inventory bloat ever seen in a video game, and you can't realistically manage it without a subscription.""Me: ""That's bad.""Zenimax: ""But you get all the expansions for free when you sub!""Me: ""That's good!""Zenimax: ""But you lose access to them if you're not paying the sub.""Me: ""That's bad.""Zenimax: ""But we'll give you crowns, the money currency, every month you're subscribed and you can eventually buy the DLC with that!""Me: ""That's good!""Zenimax: ""But there's over 30 DLCs you need to buy to have complete access to the game without the subscription.""Me: ""That's bad.""It goes on like this.If I was an avid MMO player, I'd probably put up with it.  But I'm not.  I still play this game once in a blue moon for about a month, but, again, I'm not really an MMO player anymore.The Tales of Tribute card game is really fun.  And I like the flexibility of the class customization.  The housing mechanic is there, if you're into that.  The story is pretty good, and I was surprised at the star-studded voice cast who definitely did not disappoint.But I don't like how empty the world feels, especially the cities.  I was very excited to see places never before seen in the Elder Scrolls universe, but felt pretty let down by how empty and bland most cities felt, and everything just feels kinda.... meh visually.  I'm a huge Elder Scrolls nerd yet I'm consistently underwhelmed by things in the game that, on paper, I should be excited about.  Like Elsweyr.  The home of MY PEOPLE!  Yet, it didn't feel like the home of the Khajiit when I got there.  It just felt like... any other location, if I'm being honest.  The immersion just isn't there, for whatever reason.I like to think my sense of wonder is still with me, even after years of playing games, but it definitely wasn't with me in this game, even though it should have been."
Negative,"Not a fan, at all. This ESO has a messy quest system. You can pick up quests everywhere, at every town, without any level restriction. I spent 2 hours just to figured out that I was not doing the main quest line. And after 3 hours, i started clicking on the dialog chat with NPC unconditionally without reading it. I couldn't follow the Lore, i couldn't follow the game, and I spent time running back forth just to do stupid quests across towns and worlds. No, thank you, no more!"
Negative,"I dislike the game because I can never play it! I created an account, successfully activated it, logged out and have never been able to login again. I have successfully  reset my password several times, but then the new one won't work. I went through this same BS a year ago on another free to play weekend. I can`t get support because I have to log in first.VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!  Don't waste your time."
Negative,"its an okay game. Great community for the most part.But its not able to hold my attention for longer then 3 months. Feels like a cash cow game. Many issues in ESO and bugs that make the game kinda not worth putting serious time into not to mention the limitations like only have 30 slots to sell your goods on market or the fact that there is no singular market for the game its all scattered around many many guild traders that are fought over with bids and the like makes being a trader somewhat of a annoyance. I would go on but ive played long enough to write a book. my biggest Issue with this game is its way to dependant on addons and the game feels 75% complete without any addons. (I didnt have an issue using addons just that its extremly annoying that i must complete the games ""features"" with someone elses work other then the game developers themselves thus being Zenimax mostly or Bethesda) And no i dont have a problem with 3rd party addon devs just find it highly annoying to have to install and keep up to date with everything while also never knowing when ull have to ever reinstall the entire game or etc etc etc.Hope this review is somewhat helpful in your dicision to purchase id def just buy when its on sale!(u can buy things with crowns in game also btw... sometimes its required and there is even a subscription option.)Thats my 2 cents ... enjoy!"
Negative,"All this years later, despie all the patches and morrowind content pack and quests and stuff the game still sucks by a huge margin."
Negative,120 hours of people not actually dying as its pretty fucking useless to die in this world and being flash banged.Can't believe Toddy did it again.
Negative,You'll download 62 gbs then they'll ask for another 89 gbs so you probably wasted your time waiting for those 62 gbs to download.
Negative,"bought game full price, still have to pay for random junk all the time if you want to keep playing the way it was supposed to"
Negative,"Can't even get past the create account/login screen, as it won't accept my email address!"
Negative,"absolute scam, patches are getting worse, alot of bugs, company wont listen to consumers feedbacks (even by most known), mechanics are bugged and horror. If you even think about buying it, please, i highly advise you to reconsider. hard grind for low rewards. and if noone wants to belive check the ""no eta"" meme :^)"
Negative,No Support For existing issues; no email address to get help; needed a total of 160 Gb of space (80 for download 80 for install); complete waste of time. Hours of work to make space and without troubleshooting help (the one possible error was erroneous (I have direct X 12 and it's working properly) cannot play the game (have all spec requirements). Not impressed with the company and have even uninstalled the mobile game from my phone too after this.
Negative,1) Buy Game2) Download Game3) Download 10 Gbs worth of patches4) Find out you need an account5) Make an account6) Sign in7) It doesnt work8) Use code on website9) Sign in again10) You need code from email11) Wait 30 min for a code to log in
Negative,Cant recommend the game anymore
Negative,"I downloaded this game for over 30 hours, it tanked my wifi, and now the launcher's play button doesn't work. Waste of $20 and time. Find a different mmo."
Negative,crashes every time i play
Negative,"Game seems pretty fun, was able to level up and get somewhat far into it. Quickly starts to get boring though, there's nothing in particular that really engages you into the game and the quests felt really random without much story. The armor all looks the same with barely any difference between cloth, mail, plate etc. which I think is one of the biggest flaws of the game. I understand it's supposed to look more ""realistic"" but I'm not playing a fantasy RPG game for stuff I could see in real life.I think my biggest complaint is just the armor looks so bland and boring."
Negative,JUST GOD DAMN USE THE STEAM UPDATE SYSTEM THAN YOUR BROKEN ASS FUCKING LAUNCHER. I had too remove 3 games on my HDD just to update. And what did I update? DIrectX and uninstaller + a patch that took only 10 secs to download(I have around 10 mb download speed on speed at max.I had around 30GB free. It needed 87 to update these things. So. Now I need to install 3 games just because of this shit.
Negative,"Pretty but boring, expansive but begging you for money. Quests that are mostly just talking to people, no way to group with friends properly. pass.Edit: now the launcher is completely broken. and the error has no known fix. garbage game."
Negative,"Very good game, but there is a huge chance that you will not have a chance to play that, if you are in Europe. They dont give a single stick about our holidays, so the next monday you try play the game - you will see ""Server maintentance"" so beware, that even if you install this, you are probably still going to play other games. Not recommended."
Negative,"Still can't get passed Launcher. Updates a few % then closes itself. Try to open a ticket, log in button doesn't work. Been trying for a week now. Online forums are riddled with posts about this issue and there still hasn't been a fix for this. Why am I wasting my time? I've given up.."
Negative,go play wow
Negative,I got banned for buying money. Best 55 hours in 3 days ever. Best game!
Negative,Just spent an hour and a half trying to find out why the game wont launch. Had more fun troubleshooting than playing the game. Tbh don't even want to play anymore
Negative,"I wish I could enjoy this game but after more than spending 300$ I still can't. I've never been a fan of MMO's even though I absolutely love TES 3 Mor, 4 Obli, 5 Sky, and legends. This one is just not for me. My biggest complaints are: 1) I hate the learning curve, cant be bothered to f with it.pumping most of my points into either stam or magicka is lame as hell for me2) The weapons and armor go waaay out there, which is cool i guess for some. if you like WoW aesthetic XD 3) the females and males cant be tailored much to look non-binary or androgynous. bite me, i like it. 4) meta. if its anything that kills a game for me its meta talk, I want to play a way that looks cool, has a cool back story, etc etc not effing META! 5) so so many micro transactions. 6) lazy reskins with copy-n-paste animations. 7) I'm a huge lore nerd, so i cant read anything in a dungeon because everyone wants to blow through it in 2 minutes. 8) the enemies in the dungeons arn't worth fighting as they give almost nothing in return, which like the last games id clear everything left to right, top to bottom, inside and outside."
Negative,"I've really really wanted to get in to this game over the years, the questing I've done has been fun and the production values are very impressive.  But HOLY HELL every other aspect of this game makes me hate the ever loving crap out of it.  Character progression (and how it's done) feels not the least bit fulfilling.  Loot was boooooring.  There are WAY TOO MANY redundant, useless annoying game systems in play.  Checklisting galore.  Manufactured inconveniences galore.  Habit-building daily enticements.  And my personal favorite sin, TIME GATING!  Got the cash for a couple inventory slots?  Naaah son, come back tomorrow!  As if that's not all bad enough, it's all glossed over with the sickly sticky vaneer of SALE! SALE! SALE!  EVERYTHING MUST GO MY FRIEND!  YOU MAY CALL THIS JUNK I CALL THEM MICROTRANSACTIONS!  SERIOUSLY, I feel like a money balloon whenever I load this game up.  Carnival barkers are less abhorrent than this game's monitization.  I get absolutely ZERO immersion here.In a nutshell, this game is the epitome of shady, shitty MMO design.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, even for free."
Negative,"the games quest line glitchs there moves the grayhome mages uses that are like mortal combat moves it not the elder scrolls the runes have no chest in them u can,t pick up weapens in the runes u kill dadrea u can,t examine them u can,t take there weapen u have to crfat every thing u can,t find ingots u have to buy another dlc just to be able to make dadric armor this is a big waste of money u could just buy skyrim the elder scrolls  the real game don,t waste your money and now the tempering alloy ore is nor part of the game u have to buy a sperate dlc witch is almost shy of 80 dallors to have tempering alloy ore witch what u need to make master weapons  that not right now the game whon,t let u load into the game"
Negative,"Jesus Christ, why would anyone want to torture themselves by playing this disaster. The combat is HORRENDOUS! The NPC's are from oblivion! The graphics rot your eyes and yet it somehow is a 100GB download..."
Negative,"I would love to be able to write a review of the ACTUAL GAME, but sadly i cant because i cant play it! I tried and tried to get support on my issues (im running on a mac which obviously sucks) but no support could be found. Not only can steam not help, but it sends me to websites that also just send me to talk to OTHER USERS experiencing the SAME PROBLEMS who also cant figure it out. SO do not get this game if you have a mac, and dont even bother trying to get support on your ESO problems."
Negative,"If you want to play a good elder scrolls game then just play any of the last 3.If you want a great time while playing them use mods. If you want a good mmo play wow, archage or tera.If you want to support a company that is paving the way for paid mods to be a industry standard and have no fun while doing it, play this game."
Negative,"Well, after 47 Hours & counting of downloading Updates to Defenations, I thing I want my money Back....   Went to Support page. Followed instructions to the letter, But no still no game!!!!!!!! All I get is MORE Updates......... Some one please explain how to get past this problem.   Thanks to any help       At this time I would not recomend this game! !!!"
Negative,"Talking,talking and talking"
Negative,"Игра скатилась в жесткий донат! Цены подняли на все! постоянные баги, зависания, очереди в игру! Однозначно не рекомендую к покупки, графика убогая! Самая отвратительная игра в которую я играл"
Negative,F*U*C*K ALL YOUR STUPID DLC'(s) I ALL READY PAYED OVER $150 JUST TO ATTEMPT TO PLAY THIS TRASHY GAME
Negative,"This game honestly sucks, it’s garbage nothing like any elder scrolls games if that’s what you were hoping. So pissed I wasted money on this and I couldn’t get a refund when my 2 hours playtime is from loading this dumb game up. Horrible graphics and awful gameplay. 1/10 I don’t suggest purchasing this game."
Negative,"Combat, combat, combat. They have a great game here, so many systems done well from life skills to the voice acted quests a detailed world and it looks good to boot. But sadly it all falls apart when youre bored out of your mind loathing when a quest sends you to murder something again, or the objective is behind a hallway full of walking damage sponges(in which case running through it, dying at the end to loose aggro and simply resurrect is the most valid strategy since engaging the enemy when the quest doesnt require you to is completely pointless and unrewarding). The combat is very floaty, doesnt have any sort of impact nor weight to it and the over done levelscaling removes most sense of progress. Sure the numbers go up and now instead of pressing 1 and 2 you can press 3 or maybe even 4 and 5 but thats just a slight distraction. Casting every skill in hopes of doing something but then you realize youre fighting a damn skeleton with a wooden club why the hell am i sweating my ass off spamming all my skills on this one guy. Theres no real need to press 3,4,5 since theres no cooldowns or casttimes or animation locks for most of the skills im 50/50 with this, a good balance with cds, cts and anination locks can make wonders and make a world of difference in classes, monster hunter world with its animation locks is on the other end of the spectrum but i damn well enjoyed it once i git gud and cast right things at the right time maybe even have a bite to eat if the baddie isnt looking.The classes feel like mass effect 3 endings, yes theres nice animations and maybe even various colors of flashy lights but in the end youre still just preforming gymnastics around a skeleton with a wooden bat.Im not recommending the game cause after all these years there still no actually slooty cosmetics being pumped out, so much for the lusty argonian maid."
Negative,It´s so boring to run across a vast plane of featureless textures just to meet a crab. If only the actual gameplay would be at least half as complex as endless complexity of systems made to protect you from PvP and chaotic beauty of social interactions.  Who in their right mind will grind ore watching boring animations? Who wants to complete another fetch quest?  Just lie on bed and look at the ceiling - think about something. I guarantee it will be more fruitful than playing this game.
Negative,"Save yourself time and money. If you have nothing to do, try masturbating yourself, go for a walk with your dog or pet your cat. All of these activities are much more interesting and are truly free and satisfying.I hate myself for buying this game and even more for wasting almost 80 hours in a game that was only interesting at the beginning, as it actually never gets any better or more fun, just being continuosly annoying and boring with its mechanics and combat system, with a huge world hidden behind a massive paywall (even after buying ultimate edition). And it only gets worse once you realise that in order to access the rest of the locked areas and have enough inventory space to play smoothly you need to subscribe to ESO Plus.It does look somewhat more realistic with its random weathers, sunsets and dark nights, but it's actually still just slightly better than Oblivion without any mods (think of something between Oblivion and Skyrim level of detail), with a suprisingly low performance and DSLL doesn't help much as graphics gets very blurry if using automatic or performance setting and framerate still drops to 30-40 at times."
Negative,"Well, the combat is monotonous as hell. Even while at the first sight it seems dynamic, it all falls down in few levels, and new skills do nothing to improve that.Storywise, I've got nothing substantial to say. In 12 hours I've seen nothing interesting. Even zones have the same sleepy feeling to them.Crafting is hell. Good gods of RNG, what hellish spawn of Vaermina is that?On top of that, after You buy FULL game You will be encouraged to buy extra dungeons. I get why developer would sell cosmetics, but fukken dungeon? Bag space?All in consideration, there are much better games than that. Not many of them are mmo's, but even Neverwinter knew how to make combat engaging. Hell, even WoW has more action during leveling quests than tESO.Unless dev publish some magically enchanced expansion, I'd strongly suggest You to avoid this game."
Negative,"It's a good MMORPG experience. Has all the things you might expect from an MMORPG.However, I was not looking for an average MMORPG experience, I was interested in an average Elder Scrolls experience.I get that in order to attract the average MMORPG player they chose to make certain design choices. However, it felt like a Elder Scrolls looking game with a completely different thing to it. If you like WoW or LOTRO and don't mind it not really being an Elder Scrolls game then it's a real 9/10 gaame."
Negative,At first the game was fun to play with friends but late game is just too boring. I regret wasting my time on this game.-If you seek good pvp content then this game isn't for you. Pvp is laggy and broken.-Pve is ok. Lots of dungeons and trials but they get bored quickly.-Class system is very simple even a monkey can do an excellent build.-Story lines are *sighs*-*sighs*-*ZzZzZzZz*
Negative,"Got to level 34 as necromancer, couldn't really get into this game.  Each level didn't seem to make me kill anything faster even with new skills.  In fact every level reduced my hp/mp/stam and damage overall until I found more gear at my current level (probably because of w/e scaling they use).  All quests were very boring and on the level of side quest even for the major ones, you have to love elder scrolls lore and want to learn more or else it'll be monotonous and boring.  Kept dying to some world bosses because my health would desync and I couldn't tell what % I was actually at.  The scaling that they have allowed me to go anywhere and do any quest but it made everything so easy that there was no challenge beyond desync and bugs.  Tried to duo the early 4man dungeons and had no trouble, could probably have soloed them with ease but it would be too time consuming.Armor was 90% hideous for everything, I know skyrim armor looked better than this shit.  Even the cosmetics in their store weren't nice to look at, everything was just generally ugly.  Even their loot boxes had nothing worthwhile in them in terms of good looking outfits or mounts, the mushroom themed mounts were particularly hideous to look at and didn't fit elder scrolls at all imo.  Speaking further of the crown store: I have never seen an in game store that is as greedy as what they sell.  While there wasn't any p2w I could see there was so much gated content that I couldn't do unless I subscribed to eso plus (basically mandatory if you want to enjoy the game) or bought each dlc separately for a lot of $ (think it was something like 2000 crowns ~ 20$ for the dark brotherhood quest line).  Houses in the crown store could be incredibly expensive and I can't see why anyone would buy them since they weren't all that amazing to walk through in the previews."
Negative,Just bought the game on sale. Doesn't launch. I actually already own a non-steam copy and that one actually worked. Bought it to play online with the SO. yay.
Negative,"Fun for a single player experience, all of TES lore in one game is pretty neat. good story and exploration. Combat is limiting, feels like a mobile game where you can only use 5 skills at a time. elitism is very present in this game for any PVE content, people will flame you if you dont have the most optimal meta build for your class. dont play if you want an MMO, play if you dont mind single player."
Negative,Game refuses to run . tried for 2hrs to get it to run . tried to get refund but steam says i have been playing for 10hrs and will not refund . How is this possible if the game will not start . Will never buy through steam again .Cant recomend a game I have never and never will play . Good luck all.so reloaded game 3 times cleared the caches tried all the fixes and still getting error 210 . after 3 emails steam still insisting I have played for 10hrs so no refund .Enough is enough for me . For £4-50 its just not worth the grief . For those that can get this game to run I wish you all the best . finaly got the game to run but had to rebuild my computer . yes I like the game but disapointed that almost everything you want to do is gated behind  a paywall . so can only recomend to you if you have deep pockets . and thats not me .
Negative,"I bought this game and played it for a while, then a DLC came out that i didnt wanna buy, however i realized that the entire player base went to that new DLC spot and i was left alone feeling like i needed to buy the new DLC to keep having fun. I bought this game thinking it was a one time purchase, but if that DLC controls the flow of the game this hard then its almost as if players are obligated to buy the DLCS to have fun.I put a negative review mainly because i think this makes the game a bit misleading, the DLC's are great and all, but if there made to control the population of the game so badly they should be free. I signed up to play with a reasonable amount of players."
Negative,"Hello TravelerDo you like doing missions where you waste time running from point A to B to C and a hour later on point Q you realize you somehow switched missions and are now hours away from where you started?Do you like tons and I mean TONS of side quest and missions?Do you like having a ton of abilities that are all basically the same that you can never use so you have to limit yourself to a few?Do you like having 2 bars to put your abilities but unless you have the same ability on both bars you won't get the same effects/may not work?Do you like settings up abilities so you have to press them in order when in combat over and over again instead of actually fighting?Do you like trying to make your character better only for it to seem useless?Do you like FREE stuff YES FREE stuff that you don't want to get rid of because it may be useful later in the game but it fills up your inventory (which you have to purchase more slots to hold everything)?Do you like having limited inventory that is constantly filling up?Do you like wasting time trying to manage your inventory?Do you spending hours looking for things on maps, going through inventory, checking gear?Do you like endless dialog from NPC?Do you like there being so much crap that seems pointless and having no idea what any of it means?Last but most important, do you love MONEY grabbing games? YES, they love your money and they will try to keep getting more.If you like any of these then you should try out ESO.  If you are like me you may want to avoid this one.  There are things I like about the game like leveling abilities by using them and sounds like they tried to make the grinding less of a pain in the last update.  I spend more time not playing the game then actually playing it because of the above.  If you do plan on trying it out I would recommend waiting for a sale and getting whatever version has the dlc included.  If you do like it, it will cost you more in the long run.  If you don't like it you probably wont be able to return it because of all the time wasted doing other stuff.Peace out"
Negative,"I have encountered the same problem as xboxfan1992, unable to log into account, have never gotten to play the game, have spent hours trying to fix it and enter my account. SHAMEFUL on the devs to make a system that tells you you have the wrong password then fails to let you fix it."
Negative,"I spent nearly $100 on a game, just for the two quest-lines I was looking forward to, the Dark Brotherhood & Thieves guild, NOT to be included and cost about $30 each on top of having already purchased the deluxe edition. No, I would NOT recommend this game to friends - or anyone. They already got nearly $100 for a game, and yet it isn't enough for them!  Greedy b*stards! Bethesda are unscrupulous common cut-purse money-grubbing thieves!"
Negative,"This is just my personal opinion. For a B2P game, ESO deviously make an only subscriber access to the ""crafting bag"".Even B2P GW2 game do not do these to their customer. I really regret buying this game. Now, I am not sure what other hidden stuff that are meant for only subscriber.   Really disappointed with this game."
Negative,"Coming from a person who greatly enjoyed all the Elder Scrolls games before this one, I went into ESO hoping to feel that familiar joy that I got from playing Skyrim or Morrowind. Unfortunatetly those feelings died within the few hours I first played the game, but hoping those feelings would surface at some point I continued to give ESO a shot and greatly regret that decision.ESO is unlike any of it's predecessors before it. If you come to think that ESO will hold that great Elder Scrolls feel you're used to, you are greatly wrong. ESO lacks the heart and soul of what made its predecessing games great and ultimatetly fails to stand alone as a game because of this. The several hours I spent grinding in the game can barely form a sentence to recollect what it is that I've even accomplished in the game. From the difficulties of the bosses that you have to solo fight on your own and ultimatetly die every single time trying to do so. The bosses simply are too overpowered and with weapons and gear that you seem spending more time and money repairing than actually using, fighting enemies and bosses that will ultimatetly kill you a few seconds into a fight isn't worth it, not to mention to spending hours trying to find crafting materials that never appear, to the PVP feature that never seems to pop out in your face and a storyline that feels quite boring compared to a player's journey to embrace their dragonborn heritage to quests that don't stand out ESO isn't all cracked up as trailers and other reviewes make it out to be nor mention the multitude of problems in the game. In my opinion a player would be better off strapped down in a chair and forced to play any number of video games from the Spongbob Squarepants seriers than playing or putting any money into ESO a game that suffers from laggy graphics, long loading times, and a game that crashes, freezes and logs out a player at the most random and inoportune times."
Negative,my mouse sensitivity doesnt work
Negative,Ever sense I moved to a new computer I cant even run the game. I have tried every possible thing and the game will not load after install. Not even the launcher will launch.
Negative,I want to like this game but maybe i just have my mind wrapped around Elder scrolls being a solo game...
Negative,"cant get this game to even load no matter what i try, non of the solutions work for me, do not buy"
Negative,Steam and ESO = bad comboBuy it through the official store.= less crashes and login server downtime...Game is good
Negative,A mediocer game theres literaly nothing special about itgraphics are mehgameplay is repetative and boringhalf the ui is cash shops if you have a dlc you cant turn it off and you cant play the original game ever againnot like you would want to because theres nothing engaging you in the first place
Negative,"The game is meh.Good graphics, environment, and combat, but the lasting appeal isn't there.The game's quests are dead boring, story is boring, and accessing new content requires microtransactions or subscription.Feels like a quick cash grab game."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR GOOD GAMEPLAY.Aim-Assist on everything, so require no skills. Combat is incredibly stiff and the AI is very bad. Enemies just charge towards you and their pathfinding is not good. Skills are aim assisted so there really is no challenge. It's almost like an AFK game and level up."
Negative,"I havent played this game since i quite, which was a LONG while ago during the expansion of Murkmire. Why did i quite? 1) They nerfed Magicka Sorcerer to the ground.. i couldnt run my famous, unknown build anymore, and a year later i still refuse to give out what it is.2) The PvP used to be good, and it gets worse and worse every patch with the lag and terrible servers.3) PvE is easy as hell.. its a joke.4) look back at 1-3.5) Look back at 4.Ive got like 1600+ hours on STEAM.. ive got over 3k hours on the launcher with a total of close to 5k hours overall.If youre buying ESO because of videos youve seen online posted a while ago.. the game is NOTHING like what it used to be, its worse now. -I Define Op (If youve seen that name or heard of it, its me, my MagSorc)"
Negative,"I played and played ESO for about 6 months. I liked merching for a while so did that and got over 20 million in value.I get an email saying I need to stop trading with fraudulent accounts.I ask which accounts so I can stop trading.They reply saying they can\'t tell me.I reply I think I know who, which I stopped trading with this person, and I asked if they could tell me at least if that wasn\'t the person or only person. I trade with friends who are selling at legit prices, not unreasonably cheap.I try to log in says invalid information.I check my email says I'm banned.I argued my point of the story and all I got was replies saying final decision without addressing my points at all. On a lighter note being banned was the best thing that happened to me with regards to ESO.I went to play other games and realized how garbage ESO is.The game is trivial at best.If they allowed like 15+ spells to be barred at once PVP would actually be fun.The PVE is a joke. I would give the rating lower than an F if I could.Don\'t waste your time on this game."
Negative,go buy it not from here cant even log in
Negative,Only worth buying if you live in EU or US apparently not enough people from Oceania play Eso thus we don't get a server.MAYBE IF WE HAD A SERVER WE'D PLAY IT??????
Negative,"Bethesda took a perfectly good series and trashed it by putting it online. If you want a WOW ripofff this is for you. If you want a good story, open world exporation, immersive rpg with npcs that make the game feel alive then either play dungeons & dragons or purchase skyrim, oblivion, morrowind, bloodmoon, ocarina of time, or pretty much anything but this game. The animation isn't terrible and the world is quite large, but I do not like the engine they chose to use, and I could not play the game for any longer than a couple hours (if that). The respawns don't work. They're not buggy or anything like that; they just don't make the game feel realistic and alive like the previous titles. When I can watch someone kill a buch of enemies, wait a few minutes and then I can kill them, or I can stand around and kill them again it makes such a great series feel like a very pretty and very overpriced runescape. Maybe there is some good story if I continued on with it, but the point I'm getting at is I didn't want to. I've tried this game a couple of times with a couple different expansions and I keep finding myself dissapointed and going back to play skyrim hoping there are some new mods or dlc out. It really says something when I choose to go back and play an older title, invest more time and money in an older title, etc. after purchasing and giving the newest title a shot. It says something more when I'm not the only one. For this style of game it's great, but it feels very child like (reminds me of my days in middleschool of playing runescape, as I said before). Fans of the elder scrolls series had a certain expectation as they played through the series, and when elderscrolls online came out, to me atleast, it has been nothing but a huge dissapointment, and I have abandoned the elderscrolls series (minus skyrim). However, don't take it as me not appreciating all the work that went into it. Animation, character and game design isn't easy work. However if that big of a shift had to be made just don't call it elder scrolls, call it something else because that's exactly what it is--something else."
Negative,How am I suppose to actually try the game with it's limited time to play for free if the launcher just freezes and automatically closes after 30seconds?
Negative,Gw2 is better
Negative,Too ez. I tried to complete a dungeon with my eyes closed with my friends guiding me in a VETERAN dungeon. I completed it with ease. In fact dungeons can be completed with 2 dps With 2-3 AFK. People say oh u can buy expansions with harder settings. They re the same with an additional one shot mechanic and if u dodge that 1 skill (which is easy to dodge cuz cast time is like 3-5 sec boss is literally pausing) its the same. Quests are nice if u wanna enjoy a story but thats all. I dont even know why this game is hyped soo much.
Negative,"ESO is a solid game for what it is - lacking in passion compared to other ES games, but still good in it's own right. Absolutely no subscriptions for me - especially for an old dinosaur of a game like this - HAAH, what a JOKE. If you have more money than you know what to do with, this is a good game.Guild Wars 2 easily fills the void this game leaves - for free."
Negative,"I had to buy this game a second time (through Steam this time), because Zenimax won't solve my account access issue, after several months of PLUS membership. They just tell me to wait further investigation.Turns out I cannot even create a new account through Steam because all my mail accounts are ""already in use"" or ""invalid format"". Don't even think on trying to log in my original account.Disgusting Customer Service-- Check"
Negative,"not letting me log in, and its not letting me make a new account or change my password"
Negative,just cant get in to it and my hours on record is forme times i left my pc on with the game runing
Negative,"boring, go play Skyrim instead"
Negative,"Compared to Skyrim this game is rubbish,Graphics are lame, dialogue is bad, it isn't clear how anything works. Loading takes ages.Ripoff."
Negative,Since the big update some wks ago playin the game iz horrible every thing az changed I cant portal to any where usin the portal stations. The past 5 days or so hav not been able ta access the login screen because the game iz usin nrly all of the capacity of my CPU.
Negative,"I've now played 24 hours total in The Elder Scrolls Online. I've been there before long-long ago during beta, until I tried FINAL FANTASY XIV. They had free weekend though, so I got it from Steam, linked accounts and tried again. Especially, since they now have proper gamepad support, which was one of the reasons I preferred FFXIV. So a bit of comparison between the 2.I started in Morrowind (because I did not purchase any expansions at that time and it was the starting zone for a new character). It hit right in my nostalgia of TES3, because it looked so familiar, until I reached Vivec from Seyda Neen in like 2-3 minutes. It's scaled down quite a lot compared to original. Although, I can't say that Vvardenfell is that small still, and if you consider the rest of the world out there, you will definitely have something to explore for quite some time.And this is the main attraction here it seems. TES games were about exploration, after all: you set out on a main quest, but before you reach your next main quest destination you visit a few caves or ruins and, maybe, pick up a few side-quests. Those side-quests are slightly better in terms of story quality and somewhat depth (voice-over helps a lot) compared to FFXIV, but they are still not that intriguing for me. They felt shallow. I did not feel involved in them, I had no stakes in them. In FFXIV it was clear, that I am a ""mercenary"", you pay me - I do. In ESO, I am sometimes called hero, but... It does not have any weight to it, especially, since I have not done anything in this region, let alone in the world.""Main quest"" (or rather the zone quest) is not that better, too. To be honest it seems on par with some of the larger side-quest chains in FFXIV and it definitely does not come close to their main story (which is not perfect, still, but it is consistent, as well as the whole world around). I think, one of the reasons to that is lack of ""cinematics"". This was also true for previous TES games, but somehow it did not stick out that much. Perhaps quests were better then, thus there was simply no need to have some action movies being played back, as is done in FFXIV.Speaking of actions: ESO feels repetitive. Do not get me wrong, FFXIV has a bit of that, too, but... You have skill chains there and buffs, not on global cooldown... Here, skills are not on global cooldown formally, but they are locked still (animation lock perhaps?) and you can't chain them. In the end fighting feels more like a button mashing, and not an actual tactical fight. Granted you may have some skills to be used at more specific situations and you need to watch your mana and stamina, but otherwise... Weapon-swap unlocked at level 15 does not help here much either, at least because you still have a lock even if your are swapping only your skills. FFXIV is more streamlined in that regard.And I think this is what makes FFXIV a better MMORPG in general: it does guide you better. It explains. It teaches. The best example for me here is dungeons. I've went to a dungeon in ESO, notified, that I am a newbie. No response in chat (in FFXIV, at least, people great you). And then... Just clicking stuff to death. There are roles in this game, same as in FFXIV, but they are so... Irrelevant. You do not feel any sense of teamwork here, which is the point. And it's barely understandable where you even need to go in this dungeon. And people are rushing ahead even more that some do in FFXIV (rarely, but happens).So, in the end, ESO feels like a good game to explore it in solo mode, while getting aggroed by everything around you, lagging (which seems to happen more often than in FFXIV and looks really weird in 1st person mode) and getting stuck in ""in-combat"" mode (looks like a very old bug, which no one is fixing) and use quests as means to an end of a better loot. You do that until it gets too old and then forget about it, until you get another case of nostalgia for the sights. As an MMO, though? I do not know. I did not feel it. It did not get me involved with people as FFXIV did. And as an RPG it's not as immersive, too, even though you have tons of stuff to do, that you do not even know about, until you try doing it.I think I will finish up all my active quests chains and then... Probably forget about it. FFXIV is still the MMO for me, even though it gets a bit grindy in places.I am selecting ""not recommend"", because this is MMO, which does not feel as MMO. For exploration - go at it."
Negative,"iMAC user. Played the other day but the screen wouldnt stop spinning so i unistalled the game and even reinstalled the system. Now I'm trying to install it, it tells me I don't have enough space. I did not download any other games/files/anything on my Mac for god sake. F*** it"
Negative,"Couldn't get into this game, but i realize now that i'm probably not an MMO person. This my first MMO.  I haven't played Skyrim but am moving on to that instead.  The graphics are good, the combat isn't bad.  I just didn't find the same type of immersion as I did with Oblivion.  Its not that the single player is bad, it just lacked to me.  You also can't really pause, which is a problem if you have a crazed beagle."
Negative,"Group decided to go to Cyrodiil.  We went into a Delve (dungeon).  We all got infinite loading screen.  We had to crash out to get back in.  Upon logging in, which there were many delays even with a SSD, I was falling infinitely in the world.  However beacuse it was Cyrodiil I can't /stuck and so I was stuck permanently falling.This pretty much describes the ESO experience.  These issues have gone on for years and were never addressed.  Log in issues.  Grouping issues.  You can find any number other examples with a few google searches.  Avoid this if you can."
Negative,Still no central market.  Group finder doesn't work.  No quality of life updates in 2+ years.
Negative,It's so bad I can't even be bothered to write a review.Imagine being stuck in a bad 90's cartoon. That's the game.
Negative,It just doesn't work.
Negative,HATE ALL PVE S.H.I.T.T.E.R.S+ add insta heal to sorc (dark deal is ass)
Negative,The thing that makes the elder scolls amazing hasn´t been captured here. This is just like all the other MMORPGs
Negative,"Gets boring quick, waste of money in my opinion."
Negative,5 skills bar thats it you can lvl about 50 skills but use only 5 + summoned creatures take one skillbar 1 you need for filling soulstones so what left is 4 skillbars thats nice when you want run around and swing a sword but not as a mage. pvp is a mess. after 2 day plaing everything start looking same. lv 100 or lv 20 monstars feel same what is point.
Negative,"It's alright, sertainly way better than its launch lead me to believe it would ever be. I get some changes had to be made for the whole ""MMO"" thing. But buyer beware, their is a lot of content that is pay-walled off. if you're OK just not playing those parts, buying each part individually, or paying the subscription to have access to all of them, carry on. Also, you need the active subscription to have access to what is called ""Material Storage"", which is an extra and unlimited storage tab for crafting materials... Without this, you will quickly and repeatedly run out of storage space. The game is of coarse playable, but inventory management isn't really a driving force to keep coming back. Still, it's got its moments. I'm going to say ""No"" to most new players, simply because its a real pain in the ass to get groups for low-end end game content, ""free"" end game content, and you are going to be demolished in PvP because people have had about a decade to min/max their character and perfect their stealth 1shot combos on people way better at the game than you will be. IF you ignore my warning... Good luck."
Negative,"Game requires use of glitches to succeed. They call it animation canceling. It breaks immersion. Also the grind is insane. You finally get the gear you wanted only to find that the gear has been nerfed and is no longer meta.....oh yeah and there's a meta. You can't just really pick up a difficult to obtain set and expect it to work well. You have to do incredible amounts of research to figure out what's best. Then once you've finally got the right gear everyone has moved on from doing the dungeon you want to play and no one is there to help you run it. Also you finally get your gear and discover you need a light helmet instead of a medium....and you already got rid of your light helmet. Oh and also you have to do heavy research as to what class to play before you choose. I wanted to tank and chose the heavy looking Templar, but who wants to tank with a Templar even if he has the best gear? Templars are for healing they say. Nevermind that you can tank with other classes.  This game was a waste of a year of my life. Poor balance ruins it."
Negative,"Game requires a separate installer outside of Steam to complete.The process of updating the game during this installer takes a significant amount of time, even at 35 mb/s (multiple large patches, some over 20gbs).The game is ultimately okay - not exciting, not overwhelming.you'd be better off just playing Skyrim again, or maybe even playing one of the older games you haven't played again (Morrowind is my recommendation). It's a lot of hard drive space for something that's basically pretty bland."
Negative,"If you are in to PVP, this is not the game for you. Whoever thinks otherwise has no clue what competitive PVP is. You will have to learn some absurd exploits what they call is the actual game mechanics, which is obviously not. A person with some basic programming knowledge can understand what is going wrong with it.You will encounter some players with hitpoints never going down to 99% one-shotting you. Some people may claim otherwise, they may say this is happening because you don't know how to play, but they just don't have a clue how mmorpg PVP actualy works and how it should be. You will encounter unbalanced gear in every single patch and there is this PVP buff for damage reduction which keeps going up, now it will be 60% damage reduction in PVP because obviously they have no other option to balance PVP but this will cause some hardcore players who uses animation cancelling, bunny jumping-blocking some shit and doing weird stuff to become even more invulnerable. And those players are not even skilled players they just know how to exploit the game mechanics. And you can obviously use 3rd party softwares to even trigger those exploits easier. They say its forbidden but there is no way they can detect them. This game is not even close to provide any PVP content, ever. Overall its a good game for a single player RPG. But you may as well just want to play Skyrim instead.PVE is boring as hell. I can't find any reason why someone would like to play this game. I tried really hard to love this game but it's not working. If you are old enough, have a reasonable MMORPG background and you are more interested in PVP aspects of them, just watch some videos of this game a solo player wiping whole raid and you will understand my point. I've been a hardcore player since Ultima Online, I have played DAoC, Warhammer Online, Guild Wars in some of the best guilds, I have even played games that seriously lack PVP balance like Star Wars, Wildstar, Archage, Rift, Final Fantasy, Age of Conan and countless more but this one is the worst I've ever seen in my life. It's like a joke. I actualy did dedicate myself to this, learned every exploit they call mechanics and geared my self with meta builds, and I actualy did very well, but this shit just kept going more boring and irrevelant. Zero calculations were made creating that combat system, it is completely math-less. I hope they will release another game with completely different core mechanics and stop fooling themselves that they made something works because this crew has a lot of potential to create something works for everyone. They just obviously missed some very important points doing this one. This had to be a single player game.Sorry I had to uninstall this game today, now I will need a 6 months detox to cure myself. Not recommended."
Negative,"bethesda kontol anjng,crash game simulator"
Negative,"Comparing this game to skyrim, this game is absolute crap"
Negative,"The Good: nice audio and mostly high quality graphicsThe Bad: Boring, unacceptable lag on a 10Mbit/low ping connection (up to 5 seconds delay for special moves and dialog requests, found myself warping back to a NPC to chat 10 seconds after I pressed the E key once.)  No idea if your strikes hit, swords pass through enemies and do no damage.  Sloppy QA, NPC's change voice actors mid conversation (see my videos). Did I mention BORING!!."
Negative,"ZeniMax Online Studios SHOULD be extremely ashamed of what they are doing it is ethically wrong on all stand points except to fill the void that game development creates on the funds department for online games which is still extremely Iffy at best, yes we get it you ZeniMax needs money to make a good online game and maintain it I get that, we all get that but the need to spend upwards of 200 to 300 dollars (if where new and not bought it along the way) just to play a game that in its complete form is just ludicrous (even if i had that kind of money regularly I would not spend it on a 60$ title all at once) and I really don't think they need all that money it is obviously partly a scam and we all know it and still buy in to it and yeah you could play this with out all the stuff but have you ever tried to playing a game like this, lets say borderland 2 for an example and not wanted/got the DLC because of your friend's and everybody has at least one of those wealthy friend online and ZeniMax knows it (even if you don't have a rich friend), oh boy do they know it, not to mention when you go on the crown store it is basically made to confuse you and make you buy other stuff, most things are not categorized correctly just so you buy doubles, it's even like that on the steam store page as well for the DLCs, its just sad because they keep digging them self deeper in a hole and trying to fill it with money that some kind of money eating bug is devouring it all at break neck speed's at the same time, that sounds like insanity to me... you see though the problem isn't the money but the amount needed to play the whole thing and everything you would need to buy is all in one place in the right way maybe even a little off because I am buying all the stuff at once if I don't want the membership and yes you will end up paying more for the membership one way or another then just buying the DLC and other stuff out right not to mention you are basically buying crown's and a invisible coupon code with the membership so why isn't the other stuff free then hmmmm, I will not be satisfied until Zenimax, Bethesda or who ever is doing this comes out with 100% reasoning on why they are doing what they are doing and I suggest you all do the same unless you like being sheep for the wrong shepherd then thats your choice, just warning everybody even though everybody knows this stuff anyway and I am just ranting to a wall...  (I played about 30 hours or so on PlayStation so don't listen to the 5 hour thing.) This game COULD be way more entertaining under the right circumstances :'(     ""end rant"""
Negative,"If I had known what the state of the game actually is I wouldn't spend a single dime or time on it. The mega servers approach with low quality servers and incompetence devs who 'fix' things (at a rate that is slower than a snail on a mud) on their patch notes that somehow doesn't fix completely and add more bug, this game is a cluster fuck of bugs, lags and desync, there are bugs that exist to this game from the laughable launch of this game.If you live near the servers, you have a decent game quality than most people but that still doesn't mean you evade everything. There's no MMO without its hiccups but this game is on another level specially if you play from far away, the anti cheat system adds anywhere fro 50-120ms and sometimes more which doesn't help at all. Almost all the things that they recently 'fix' are lowering game quality, they 'fix' as if the client side is at fault while the server side is clearly why most of the bugs occurs. You cannot simply play in Cyrodill normally majority of the time if you are not close to the servers, I should pay less much less for ESO plus with the gaming quality I am given but alas they charge the same. The current state of the game is too low of a quality for me to recommend to anyone to invest their money and more importantly their time. I do not think that ZOS will invest in upgrading their servers because the source code itself is buggy and un-optimized where most of the original devs who build the source code left the company. Even with Microsoft in the picture there is no reason for them to rebuild from scratch since making a new game would be much cheaper and less time consuming. Saving, storing, retrieving,etc of user data alone without losing or corrupting, causing bugs alone is gonna cost more time and effort than what any reasonable company would want to invest. So, we are left with a low quality mega servers, buggy and un-optimized source code with no original devs, mega desync, lots of bugs in general, low gaming quality for people who are not near to servers, slow patch that doesn't really fix which in fact adds more bug without fail every time, etc etc etc. I don't see why anyone should invest in this unless you're a filthy casual and roleplayers. I don't see this game last 2 years with the current state that it is in."
Negative,"Not worth the price tag. Another mmorpg built around questing with with no real ""elder scrolls play"".  May as well be called The world of warcraft online. I'm tried of quests, they don't make me feel like I'm acheiving anything when they are so pervasive. In my opinion, the only quest player should be getting are those for raids or pvp.  Bethesda's time would have been better spent developing the world map than developing the world map around quests and instances. Charcter development could have improved as well. So much is marked on the map that you find yourself looking at your compass and map more than your surroundings. Over all unoriginal.   A generous 5.5/10."
Negative,"Garbage. First of all, the UI is too complicated for someone who is new to the Elder Scrolls series, too many sections and categories to go through. The combat is very barebones and quite clunky. Gameplay was boring for me as the majority of what you do in the first load of quests is read through character prompts and move from point A to point B and back and so on, it was really a pain. I found myself checking the map a lot. Also, there's a ton of micro transactions. I really tried my best to get into game but I just couldn't after almost an hour and a half of playing because of those reasons said."
Negative,"Monotonous, gimmicky, none of the classes necessarily fill unique roles, toxic community, and the devs just want to cash in on the aborted fetus that is Skyrim. Find another mmo or burn your money, the latter is basically the same as buying ESO."
Negative,"I've spent hours upon hours (roughly 2 days) trying to tinker & research a way to fix the ""Requesting Login"" crash bug. But everytime I've attempted to fix it, it still crashes. I even uninstalled the game and painfully waited whilst my Australia internet reinstalled the game in hopes it would fix itself, but to no result.I've done all of the below.Reinstall the GameRepaired the game via launcherTried launching the game from source filesETC.0/10, people have had this same issue for years and still hasn't been fixed!"
Negative,i spend more time getting updates than playing
Negative,The worst action MMO of all time
Negative,Another Brainless MMO formula designed to eat up all your time and money.
Negative,Greed. That's all you need to know. They want your money and don't care after they get it.
Negative,"As you can see, I have clocked 8 hours on this game. Except, I haven't clocked a single minute in this game because all 8+ hours have been spent troubleshooting/trying to get the game to actually log in and let me play. INSANE that a game this large and popular has issues this catastrophic. I absolutely do NOT recommend buying this game right now."
Negative,"Honestly I was so excited to buy this game only to realize that not only did I waste $20 but, no one in customer service will help you.I have 7 hours on that game only 1 1/2 hours was play time the other4 1/2 hours was me fighting with the game and trying to click play to actually play the game. If you go to either Steam or Bethesda Softworks all they are going to do is pull a Fallout 76 on you; they will just ignore you. So in short: DONT buy the game save your money and buy a better game that has staff that listens to you and a game that you will have much more game play. You wont be allowed to get a refund, Customer Service will ignore and how help you."
Negative,"To make it clear+     Game is good, full of dialogs, items, recipes, weapons, armor etc etc.     Everything works, didn't stumble upon any errors (didn't finish the game)     It's Elder Scrolls Universe-     Boring     Boring     BoringTried to play it 3 times, this is third. I prefer play WoW starter pack, than this.++++++++After 1 hour of play I wanted to get money back but ofcourse  I could not because after steam downloaded the game, the launcher it self downloaded an update which was big, and there fore before i started playing it was too late. Tried to retrieve money but no success... TY Valve"
Negative,"Simply put, the cash shop (crown store) in this game is really bad.  Vast majority of everything beyond very bland generic content is locked behind paying crowns for it.  Unlike in games such as WoW, where you can earn lots of mounts, gear, cosmetics, etc from playing the game... ESO locks all of that behind pay shop.  You can play this game for free (or cheap) and experience most of the content but you'll look and feel like a hobo for most of that experience unless you pay.Just watch most YouTube reviews or written reviews since this game went ""buy to play"" and they almost all outline these issues in better detail."
Negative,"Talk to the npc's simulator. As a former wow player(TBC times mostly), I can't bileve what I have seen in a few hours. Non stop talking chain quest and as a finish 5 second easy peasy ""boss"". A huge unchallanging grindfest."
Negative,"I've played for more than 20h. This game is very well designed. But someone came to an idea of ESO Plus. It made this game kind of boring and limited. I will be playing more because base game is expensive. But there are better games right now. And you as a potential buyer should consider that you are paying a lot for quite old game, where number of players is decreasing."
Negative,"As a seasoned player (+40) - this game is waaaayyyy too easy....i thought it would be a ""ES-game"" - but it is more like a trainer for 12-13 year olds who wants a break from wasting ppl in CS - to hack'n slash ppl medieval style. May sounds harsh - i admit - but you just roll through everything without much tactics. Im currently lvl 45 - i think i have died maybe 7-8 times in this game.....solo'ing as much as possible....because quests are ridiculous easy when you are 2 or more players. And even if you end up in a fairly difficult cave - some lvl 50 big shot just rolls by you and kills everything in his path....so your 5 min. tactics-planning goes down the drain :-(. Bommer ! But it is not all bad - by far ! Beautiful gfx, great theme, sounds in generel. Quests up the wazooo ! Even at lvl 45 i havnt grinded once (!)  - and i think i can max. out my char just doing quests ! Respect ! ....but most quests feels like grind, because of the difficulty....so i dunno how much kudos this really gives. Some dungeons (for raids) give parties a challange, but i dont play a Elder Scroll game for raiding Dungeons 24/7 - im too old for that sh*t ! HUGE game map(-s) - very diverse landscape and ES lore en mass. Havnt had all these technical issues which ppl are talking about - even though i bought it here at Steam store - but my antivirus program (avast) removes the .exe file every 2-3 days...just fetch it out of the bug-bin and you're good to go. I only bought the basic game - no way in H*ll im paying for a subscription....and i feel bad for giving this game a thumbs down, but i just would have loved that you could enter caves either by yourself or in a raidparty....and not this hack'n'slash game - polished up to look like a Elders Scrolls game."
Negative,Yo this game is dogshit
Negative,Bit torn on the recommendation as this game is so dull I end up doing housework instead. So if you're looking for a fun game to play look elsewhere but if you want motivation to do some cleaning then get this.
Negative,"never write reviews but this game has sufficiently pissed me off. played on PS4, made the mistake of buying again, played on PC for a while then stopped. tried to open the game after a few months and it wont even update, just stuck at 12%. long story short don't waste your time trying to play this just play WOW or FFXIV instead."
Negative,DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  YES THE GAME HAS ITS GOOD QUALITIES BUT THE MAJOR ISSUE IS YOU WILL NOT I REPEAT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY.  Their servers are constantly down during peak hours this includes the entire weekend
Negative,"Jesus Christ the download was ridiculous for this A 62GB Steam download then an addition 87GB client download was insane. Bad/10The game is literally just watered down Elder Scrolls with some other people. I guess that's what they were going for, but some interesting changes and modifications would have been nice to see to make the game more appealing to an actual MMO market. It's wonky and feels off, but an MMO has to have some sort of solid or mathmatically understood combat system that TES just doesn't work for. Overall the game could be a lot worse but not worth picking up as a new MMO unless you're a diehard TES fan, not an MMO fan."
Negative,"Not my piece of cake. I usually enjoy mmo rpg and grindy games but this one did not sit right with me. Off-the bat the game throws its confusing levelling system at you will all the different skilling trees. Additionally the game tells you nothing about how you should build your character. Looting system felt bad together with the inventory. Bad framerate drops in bigger areas is a thing i have not met ever with other MMOs and frequent crashes made it incredibly unenjoyable to play. Combine that with uninteresting, empty and uninspired starting locations combined into a bad gaming experience for me. I would not recommend it from my point of view, when you can just play a game like World Of Warcraft or OSRS instead."
Negative,"DON'T BUY THIS GAME THROUGH STEAM!!!There's some SERIOUS communications problems which seems to be specific til the STEAM version of the game. I've spent  too much time trying to log in to the game, or getting kicked out over and over again. The problems seems to be related to server load, as I can log in to the US server (requiring creating a new character), when the EU server is impossible to log in to, Or I play another game instead.  The problems seems to be worse in weekends and on  holidays, and seems to follow the day cycles. As the heavy load times for my local server is when I most want to use the game, this is a serious drawback. My friends that DONT use STEAM have not seen this behaviour.I and others have reported this, I've also requested a refund from STEAM, which I didn't get (note that as lomg as the load MENU is active, Steam counts the time as ""Playing"", even if you can't log in...).The game itself is fun, but if you want to play multi-user, this is not the version you should get."
Negative,"Steam says 85GB disk space required, what they don't tell you is that this is on top of the 65GB space to download it, plus the Steam version is massively out of date and so needs another huge download to bring it up to date after install.My advice, skip Steam and download it directly from the ESO web site."
Negative,pay 2 play
Negative,"I really wanted to like this game, but i just can't.It's trash and so are the devs as it's a giant cash grab.Your better off with modded skyrim or oblivion."
Negative,60 Canadian THEN another 20 a month to play??? LOL Really would like to play but this game is not for poor people.
Negative,"No supplement for a true Elder Scrolls game. I don't think it is worth paying for, better to wait for ESVI."
Negative,"No Just no, Even after all these years. The combat in this game still looks like its a rip straight out of one of the most basic VR mmo games. its just bad. and its not even ****ing vr"
Negative,"Tried to play it during the free to play event, it kept trying to install via shared libarry"
Negative,in compare of MMO games like SWTOR this game is nothing its full of uncharted quests and main story is ruining the world of elder scrolls and overally fighting systems and animations are boring it can be fun and boring at same time it only worth to buy it in heavy Sales if you are looking to buy it in normal price my idea is do not buy it and wait for sale.and yea servers are awful
Negative,"I DLed this game for a free weekend to play. Everything was going great until the Launcher.  It would freeze every time I tried to update this game.  I tried about 10 different work arounds to try to get it to update, and every one of them failed.  Very poor product for a game that has been out forever."
Negative,"I am seriously disappointed with this game and I'm certainly glad I only wasted $15 on this game because IT MOST DEFINATELY IS NOT SKYRIM or anything like any Elder Scroll game. IT'S A CASH GRAB as in if you want anything nice in the game you have to PAY EXTRA. This may seem trivial to some but the one thing that bothered me the most was the point values assigned to measure health, armor, etc... Why is it necessary to have 10,000hp at level ONE??? I've played many Bethesda titles over the years, and have been satisfied with their performance over all. It is painfully clear that Bethesda handed of the bulk of the work to other producers. I was told by a few people online and off ""do not by this game"" for a myriad  of reasons and I should have listened."
Negative,"Just bought the game, and I have to warn everyone. This game downloads an initial 60gbs, which is advertised, and an additional 40Gbs after it installs. It does NOT come with one month subscription, which you would think they would give you for making you pay and making you pay to play. Additionally, if you want a refund, you cannot get one. This is because the game uses its own installer after being installed which counts towards your game time. It takes about 4 hours on a good internet connection to download. All around, my game experience hasnt even started and I am 100% dissappointed. I feel that the loyalty I have had to bethesda since the beginning has been met with insatiable greed.As a result, I do not recommend this game."
Negative,wish it was easer to get started
Negative,mmo garbage dont play
Negative,"It used to be fun, the newest update with scaling took away what I enjoyed. Want an example of how broken it is? Limbscather, an early world boss, has 1.8m hp. It's ridiculous at this point."
Negative,"do not buy, as far as im concerned, i only brought it for the price point during a sale."
Negative,Games great but i cant play it because of the servers. this latest problem has been going on now for 8 hours
Negative,"If you think this is a multiplayer added version of an Elder Scrolls game, you are wrong. This game has much grind and chore as any mmorpg.+ Slightly bearable story- Akward and buggy grouping, missions sometimes work, but sometimes doesn't- Doesn't feel like Elder Scrolls- Crowd of players doesn't help to the atmospehere, it actually ruins it- Can't focus on story and voice chat at the same time, so either you focus on boring story or you do chores with your friends- Too expensive even on sale- Needlesly big filesize- Extremely long loading times even on SSD- Low immersion, feels like an empty shell compered to SkyrimDon't buy it unless you're okay with classic mmorpg grind."
Negative,"Even for Bethesda, this game is ridiculously buggy. I played the game once a few months ago and did the intro/tutorial quest then quit to do something else. The game always froze whenever I tried logging in again. Recently I decided to give it another go. I can't progress past the character creation screen. I can't even finish designing a character (and FYI I don't usually spend hours making a perfect character, maybe 5mins, 10 mins max.) before the game gives me a generic error message and asking me to wait a few minutes. This has happened the last few days in a row and I'm ready to give up again. For the  money I spent on buying the game, at the very least I'd like to see what my finished character might look like, even if actually playing the game is too much to expect."
Negative,"This game is constantly giving me World of WarCraft flashbacks, and not in a good way.  I played the bejeezus out of that game, and ESO just feels like a Skyrim-skinned WoW with more crafts and an oversized skills tree to figure out how to optimize.   When I first played it I thought, ""I've done this before, I'm over it.""  There are even greater number - a bewildering number - of choices to make about your build, about what to do in the game.  I don't care  to learn every little detail about this artificial world and how any given skill may or may not help me.  I  already have a real world I need and want to learn about.  The point for me is to have fun, but there's a point where there are so many features and details it becomes overwhelming  There's too much lore, too much crafting, too much.  There IS such a thing as too much and this is it.  Sort of like this review, I guess!Next the game mechanics.  The UI is okay but the controller support is wanting.  The combat system is fine and it's similar to what you'd be used to for any other MMORPG.  But crafting, I still don't really get it.  I can buy only certain things at vendors and I have to farm and grind for the rest.  It seems like there are ten steps just to make, for example, an enchanted piece of basic wood elf armor.  Who even knows how I can level up to make more advanced stuff?  I can't find certain ingredients for food and there aren't any hints about where to get them.  And you are able to make your own --furniture-- in game because....?  The skills tree still confuses the crap out of me.  Am I supposed to choose an element to specialize in for my magic? What's the benefit of this familiar and why does this other one seem so weak?  Why does everything have a dozen attributes?  Sorry but I'm not gonna visit a wiki to learn how to character.The most infuriating thing is the umpty-odd steps I have to go through just to actually be in the  game, playing.  First there's the update.  I wanted to play just a little more today to refresh my memory for this review, because I haven't signed on in months.  But before I could do that, I'd have to wait for a nearly ONE HUNDRED GIGABYTE download.  Launch Steam then launch the ESO launcher, which launches the updater.  Oh make sure you're logged in.  Ok now you click ""Play"" but you're not playing once the launched launcher has launched the game!  I have to accept the terms every. single. time.  I have to choose a server, even though only one is listed.  I have to choose a character even though I only have one.  Then once I'm actually IN the game, it doesn't default to my controller so I have to go-o-o to the settings and enable controller use.  And then, only then, Cinderella, you may play ESO.  I mean why bother saving these choices?  Isn't friction the best thing ever?I noticed a few snowflakes whining about some DEI / inclusion updates. I don't know about this but what I do know is, if this is true then it's ABOUT FRICKIN TIME because I and literally thousands of others have complained about the opposite problem in the gaming world.  So tough cookies.  Now you know how the rest of us have felt for flipping decades.Anyway.... I did play with a couple other people for a bit but group play didn't really help.  It's not fun any more.  I'm wandering around a world where everyone are going through the same quest lines as fast as they possibly can, ignoring everything but the objective, and the single-mindedness of that is contagious even though it actually makes things less fun.  Mini-bosses that I just defeated respawn within minutes.I guess I'm just tired of  MMORPGs.  Many of my complaints about it are more about my personality not fitting with this game's style, but there are some things that are objectively bad.  Even if you don't care about some of the MMORPG-related stuff I mentioned,  I still can't give the game more than a 'meh' rating."
Negative,it used to work but now when i tried to play it just goes on a black screen and the support doesn't help and i tried to do the reddit it doesn't work also.  so if your buying this its prolly gonna give you a blackscreen maybe due to the update but who knows.  all i know mine don't work no more.
Negative,"dogshit game, shouldve died 4 years ago"
Negative,this game was 80 gigabytes ive never wanted to fall asleep in a game so bad. ended up killing everyone in blackreach barrow
Negative,"Make mount speed account wide! And don't buy through steam, great game otherwise"
Negative,Not as good as Skyrim with mods.
Negative,Played the game. Ignored by the online community. No real sense of direction in the game. Play to win.
Negative,"Nope, just a chaotic mess, makes no sense at all."
Negative,Right now the game is simply unplayable... 600ms + all the time...
Negative,"This game is a cut of the mill RPG, nothing really exciting about it, I played for a few hours prety much what you would expect. Lots of quests and lots of crafting things, quickly you realise that thats all there is to it, there is a story in there somewhere  I didnt really care for what was happening. I got this on sale so im not too bummed out about it. I dont really see myself ivesting a lot of time in to something that 10 other MMO's can do just as well. Unless you like the grind and having to learn all new lore I wouldnt recomend it."
Negative,"Elder Scrolls Online is a great game.BUT it is unplayable without the crafting bag, which you get with ESO+ subscription.They force you to pay, so you can play a game properly you already payed for...The game is great, but the greed destroys it."
Negative,"From what I can tell, The Elder Scrolls Online is simply a run-of-the-mill MMO (with all the uninspired design and mechanical conventions that go along with that) in a fresh coat of paint (i.e. it happens to be set in Tamriel), and nothing more. Perhaps the MMO gameplay formula was enough to keep my attention back in 2005, but I genuinely can't imagine finding this kind of experience engaging now in 2020 when there are so many other more interesting and innovative multiplayer games on offer. No judgment if that does happen to be your cup of tea, but for everyone else don't let the premise of multiplayer Elder Scrolls fool you into assuming that ESO bring anything particularly new to the table from a design perspective.EDIT due to developer response:I appreciate Bethesda taking the time to respond to my review, and I feel obligated to provide some further detail around my criticisms. In addition to what I previously said about the gameplay systems feeling dated, bland, and generic, I think ESO could use more onboarding content: not around basic mechanics like movement or combat, but giving the player a better sense of a direction or objective for after they complete the first couple starter dungeons (particularly since, unlike a singleplayer Elder Scrolls game, a lot of the content is level-gated). In addition, I don't like the fact that the vast majority of ""loot"", at least that I saw during my first several hours, literally has zero value (worse than that actually, since it takes up limited inventory slots)- why even have them drop then? Well, I later figured out that you can sometimes salvage the occasional low-value component from them through the rather inconvenient crafting system, but that takes significantly more tedium than it is worth. I understand that balancing an MMO economy can be challenging, but to me when you can purchase in-game currency that just feels like you are depriving players the ability to gradually earn money the natural way for an Elder Scrolls game."
Negative,"stop making mmorpg's and keep making skyrim and oblivion struff,you suck on mmorpg's"
Negative,Not worth getting into anymore. Just a sweaty fat nerd fest. I recommend just going outside to touch a bit of grass.
Negative,until they allow me to transfer my account from xbox to PC this game can suck my butthole.  The players have been wanting this for forever and still nothing.
Negative,"very stupid setup for multitiplayer, tried to recover account from ps4 and was a dead end, started up a new acount and it still wont log me in, I want my $80 back, but doubt that will ever happen.                                                                                                  almost feel as thogh I was scammed by steam and bathesda, straight up BS."
Negative,"I'm not a big fan of MMORPGs in general, so take this with a grain of salt. This game is no different - boring and repetitive quests (go here and kill X of monster type Y, find Z, fetch A, B, and C), immersion breaking monster respawns, basically the same grinding and looting mechanics as other MMORPGs. Not for me."
Negative,"The good and the bad....Bad Things:1. Too easy... Way too casual for an MMORPG... enemies do literally no damage to you... no challenge = boooooring....2. Inventory will CONSTANTLY fill up and you have to very slowly empty it OVER AND OVER AGAIN... Sub = more inventory slots, meaning it's intentionally annoying to try to get you to buy a sub...3. Cash shop has the ONLY good cosmetics... So you WILL be paying real money if you don't want to look like a level 15... (not an exaggeration, extremely plain gear)4. The start hits you with a ton of stuff at once which will be overwhelming for new players... kinda just like drops you in the world without explaining anything...5. When you first start up the game you can get an infinite loading screen so you have to repair the files before it works... this is an extremely common problem that they've had for many YEARS and not fixed it still...6. Starts off with extremely minimal UI setting so you'll have to go through almost everything for it to be normal... (ex: chat bubbles: off, damage numbers: off, nameplates: off, health/mana bars: off, etc...)7. Kinda bad skill balance, so some are far better leaving others useless... spending a skill point on 1% crit lol yipee 1%....8. Health/Mana/Stamina/Damage numbers are HUGE... 30,000 HP on a level 7? Why?9. Although it's an elder scrolls game, it's a VERY different feeling than morrowind, oblivion, and skyrim... it's not bad, but it's certainly not the same feel...10. Items literally NEVER feel rewarding... you won't be thinking ""whoa check out this really cool weapon I just got!"" because they are all extremely bland and basic...Good Things:1. Game played really smoothly and I wasn't having any latency or anything...2. Character movement and attacks feel/look fluid and nice (except jumping cuz you can't change direction in air and I hate that)... I really like the dodge roll...3. The world looked very good and makes you want to explore and look at things...4. Abilities were pretty interesting and you get to pick which route you go... not really a skill tree but sort of like a skill tree...5. No real skill cooldowns, certain abilities use more resource so you CAN use things multiple times but at a resource cost...6. Quests are voice acted... you only have to read what your reply will be but every quest is fully voice acted...7. Really great character creation... like one of the best ones in any mmo...8. Mega server means the population is pretty good so you will be seeing people pretty often...9. Auto targets enemies in front of you so you don't have to hassle with targeting things while also allowing you to manually target at the same time...10. Hidden things around the world were exciting to find...Overall it's not a BAD game... It's just waaaaay too casual of an RPG for my interest... Decisions have virtually zero impact at all and you're not going to be struggling for victory during your time in the game lol...It just got super super boring really fast for me...If you're looking for a challenging, fast paced, rewarding MMORPG where decisions actually matter, this is not the game for you...If you're looking for a game to play where you can turn your brain off and press keys, then this could be a decent game for you..."
Negative,"Was going to get back into this game, but Microsoft ruined it like they do with all their products from greed.EDIT:Kraken,Lets be honest, no store should exist in a game, and cosmetics or not, the Crown Store is the main product given the most attention, not the game and barebones expansions. I have given many monetized games ""a try"" - especially ESO for a bit being a die hard TES fan with 1000s of hours on TES5 xbox360 - and they have yet to prove why I should be paying more for assets in a price gouged store vs those assets just being included in large, fairly priced expansions like every gen prior to Gen 7. It's greed, pure and simple and I will not support it.I'm not going to debate whether or not microtransactions ""affect the game"" or the ""customization or convenience"" excuse when again it could all be included in a large, fairly priced expansion - earn-able in-game or simply included in inventory/obtainable from an NPC after expansion purchase - the real option for players. NO real store or monetization should ever exist in any form whatsoever - like it was Gen 7 and prior before this mobile model infection that has maliciously conditioned youth into accepting it. 100% clear microtransactions are always, without question stealthily price gouging assets even in their most seemingly innocent form.It's greed, and with bare bones expansions only used to rehype the Crown Store, I'll avoid this scam even more.  Now I only support flat price games and LARGE expansions or its a scam, as is the crown store."
Negative,"Don't waste your time or money on this trash game.  Very unfulfilling progression as far as an RPG.  The grind is so bad they just hand out EXP and gold on a daily basis just for logging in to make game-play tolerable. The grind is not really based on player merit. It's pathetic.  Nothing but eye candy, -past that the game is terribly tired, cliche, and often buggy rubbish.  The majority of the established player base seems to be nothing but unhelpful toxic anti-social elitist A-holes.  Good ole' Elder Trolls Online!  This crap is basically just a glorified pop-up book more than it is a game.  The makers of this game are nothing but greedy unethical unimaginative trash who don't really care about their product or customers as long as they get their little rat claws on yet another nickle.  Remember Daggerfall?  It had/has the reputation of being the buggiest game ever published. When they did finally patch the game back in the day, the so called patch broke more than it fixed.  This is how Bethesda does business and it obviously persists to this very day.  P'sOS"
Negative,"Now that Micro$oft has purchased this company. It's going down hill in a hurry. Waiting in line with a log in queue is normal now. Constant disconnects which makes a 12 person raid a slow moving headache. The group finder system has been broken for about a week. Everybody in my guild is upset and looking for a new game to sink some time into. Our last trial raid, the boss and some trash mobs were spawning inside the walls and pillars. We couldn't hit them and couldn't advance any further. Needed to reset the instance and start over. The devs claim that they upgraded the servers. I think what really happened here is they had to move to the new owner Microsoft servers.Update months later!I moved onto GW2 and could not be happier. Tried playing this a bit and the game was unstable. It is totally unplayable for me on my brand new high end $3000 laptop. The devs gave an apology for dropping the ball on this latest game patch. This attempt to drop in on my old guild for a raid night wasn't even on the schedule because the game is too unstable for the majority.  I had to laugh when I see a constant notification asking me to update this review. Well, it's updated lol."
Negative,"If you love playing games that crash non-stop, this game is for you,  If you can't get enough of the rage that burns within when the game freezes and you rejoin the server dead, well this here game is what you're looking for.  Want to increase your rage quitting abilities? This will take you to the next level.  Masochists, this is your game. The pain involved with partaking in this journey can be equated to eating glass or drinking bleach.  My blood pressure has skyrocketed in recent weeks, and I owe it all to ESO."
Negative,"Unplayable if you live in Australia dont waste your money 300-600 ping in open world, lag spikes and massive animation lag.For an Action Based MMO with combat rolling and dodge mechanics the ping is painful."
Negative,An empty shell of what this game should have been. Emphasis on empty. This is coming from someone who loved the previous titles.
Negative,"I use to love this game, until i realized all they give a shit about is money stop with the damn money, MAKE THE DLC FREE this is absurd you make classes that only come with dlc then you make them broken as hell. Are you serious? absurd screw this game not worth it."
Negative,"Downloaded a massive game 90gb then some more patches.. after installing buying the game and starting a brand new character. The entire game mechanics break from the massive lag in even the most basic of combat and looting. I spam the loot button and literallt 10 seconds later when ive already ran away from the corpse, the loot window pops up.. or I'll spam left click to attack the crab,, and the character just stands there while the craps are glitching around me and attacking. Its absolutely terrible. Looks like a beautiful game, sure its fun.. Maybe there is a fix. but right now Im unhappy and wish I could get a refund."
Negative,"Ok, I am a noob, but in my 1st 40 hours in game my character has been stuck 5 times in the wall with no way out except /stuck command, which cost 60 gp and has a 1 hour cool down. Quitting or logging out won’t fix, so tell you party to leave you behind.  Lots of comments about it, especially bad if monsters are close by and don’t kill u bacause the game thinks u are in combat and won’t move you to safe location.  Also bad if in ethereal plane where ghosts knocked my leg into stone wall 3 times, but regeneration locks you in the same plane..... and contact support button does nothing.  That has been my main complaint and again with all the posts on the web it is more than this noob or his computer in this bug! Fix or take gold and timer off!  Don’t think it would be a competitive edge to quit before dying and getting sent back for free.  Still takes time to get back to where u were!"
Negative,"This is a pretty game and it does take from the Elder Scrolls world quite well.It has the lore and tons of easter eggs from previous incarnations.Unfortunately its souless,continuing the trend of dumbing down the series the combat,skills and talents are all greatly simplified and to top it off there is no real point in levelling as everything in game will scale to you turning what had been a relatively fun game with easy and hard points into a bland mush of same shit different day.Its free so dive in and look around just remember the experience from level 1 to level 170 is virtually the same no matter where you go."
Negative,"90% of my playtime has been spent trying to fix the patcher. 100Gb download into 30GB updates, then it breaks and you have to download half the update again. The game isn't even that fun. The combat is just watching enemy numbers drain while you're practically invincible.Edit: I tried for a refund but because of my time in the launcher they woudln't let me. Usually Steam will Refund even if you're over the 2 hour mark if you have a good reason (like the game doesn't work for you). I guess Zenimax has them by the wallet."
Negative,"I had this game, really loved the Elder scroll series, but having to buy the game and then monthly subscription really p****d me off. I can understand buying new DLC's every so often, but a subscription was one step to much."
Negative,"Few words as a PVP oriented player.First of all this game has A LOT of lags in PVP. It shows 60-100 ms letancy but actually has a lot of delays, desync, skills don't work after pressing buttons and other annoying things. PVP feels like you are fighting against game server instead of other players. This PVP will make you nervous instead of relax and having fun. Short resume: 0. Buy to play? No. To play comfortably you need to buy subscription every month or buy all DLCs. A lot of in-game purchase. Developers just think how to force people pay money, but not creating something really new and interesting. Even existing things (like PVP) are broken.1. Graphics - poor 2. Optimization - poor3. PVE - good4. Quests and story - fine5. PVP - don't waste your time it is broken and boring. Classes are not balanced at all. You will meet people with almost same builds and equipment in PVP.Why does this game has different classes when the meta is one class in same build ? 6. PVE (Open world) - like in any RPG, nothing interesting7. PVE (Dungeons) - super easy. Sometimes stupid damage check. Nothing interesting8. PVE (Arena, Trial) - stupid damage check.9. Just a subjective opinion, but the design of weapons and armor is terribly poorConclusion: Buy it only if you don't have anything else to play or a big fan of The Elder Scrolls or like PVE.PS: balance in PVP in this game is so terrible, that I can say there is no PVP. Never buy this game for PVP. This game is about PVE only."
Negative,"I haven't played this for too long, but this feels like something other than elder scrolls. If you are someone who loved Skyrim and want to see more of the series I wouldn't ever recommend this to them. the player id recommend this to is someone who already has previous interest in mmos who also happens to be extremely into the lore of tes. i wouldn't even recommend this to someone who enjoys mmos and liked skyrim but didn't really give a shit about the lore. there are better mmos than this.but in the very fringe case i put forward I would recommend eso.mmos personally aren't my thing, but I intend to play eso just because of my insatiable hunger for more tamrielic adventures."
Negative,"This game is absolutely amazing. Just like an extended Elder Scrolls game, great story and interesting quests, active player base, immediately addicting.But holy shit, fuck Steam. Do not buy this on Steam. How can you be this large of a company, paired with Bethesda, and have infinite launch, install, and crash issues with your stupid fucking client? I have already had to reinstall within 5 days of purchase because of crashing, and the install is a double install and takes forever. THen I had to repair my fucking reinstall. I have never seen these problems in non-Steam versions.Please buy this game and come have a blast. Please NEVER use Steam for this game."
Negative,"Nah man, I tried to get into this but this just ain't for me. It feels slow, the battles are sluggish and the grind is way too much and I clearly don't have time for that. Not anymore at least."
Negative,Playing with salar ruins everything
Negative,"bad combat, terrible movement, boring progress"
Negative,"Game itself isn't bad, but monetization is awfull. If you could just buy full game with all it's content for fair price, but we have b2p system, also you need to buy LOTS of DLCs to enjoy game and separately you need some dungeons, because you want to get cool armor sets. So beware, you can not buy full game, be ready to invest some extra money to enjoy most content. As the base game is nice, plays well, haven't encountered any errors/disconnects/crashes (unlike any ubisoft game), though I have not met so many players when autosearch for dungeon party."
Negative,"Honestly was a fun game for the first few hours till you reach the second town, that's when the game gets very overwhelming. Quests don't make the most sense and the quest bar that you follow gets filled and too exhausting to follow, once your past the first city quests become even harder to get from point A to B with not much info on how to get from place to place also not the best game for party play."
Negative,"Glad I had the chance to try this instead of buying, the game is not what I spect it, skirym is way better in all aspet from graphics, content, inventory etc. Dont waste your money not worth it! You get tired after a few missions!"
Negative,nice game BUT0 balance in pvppeople having million health and still being able to oneshot you in pvp is so cringehalf of the content hidden behind monthly subscription paywall including gear and spellsone of the most expensive games ever when it comes to microtransactionsdisgusting
Negative,"As a rule, I'm a huge fan of all the Elder Scrolls games, and this game should be no exception. I say it should be because unlike the other games, which I have put hundreds of hours into; this game is so broken that I have only been able to play 8 hours of it. I would say that my problems have all stemmed from the weird issues that have been arising from Steam trying to work with Bethesda, and not from the game itself. I seriously wish that I could play this game (especially since I paid for this pile of garbage) but after several uninstalls and reinstalls, running the repair settings in the app, I am unable to and I am really over it. A game should not be this hard to play!! I would recommend buying this game on console instead."
Negative,"Up until recently, this MMO was very good.  Probably the best MMO on the market, to be honest.  The graphics are great, the acting is great, the quests aren't boring, but actually fun. The only complaint really was that it was too easy. Even dungeons and outside bosses were a breeze. I play a templar and never have to use any healing except the regeneration spell, otherwise, I'm pure dps. BUT they recently did a major overhaul of the program interface. What used to be intuitive and easy to use is now horribly clunky, keyboard driven, and extremely hard to use. I have no idea why they changed it after so many years of working just fine, but I can no longer play the game! It's that bad. If you are new to the game and thinking of buying it, or an older player thinking of buying the expansion and coming back DON'T! Save yourself the money and time and skip it!  The game in it's current stage is not playable! I hate saying this, as up until a few weeks ago, the game was my favorite MMO."
Negative,for some people it's boring.but for some people is good
Negative,Boring generic mmo
Negative,"It's not a bad game at all, but the micro-transaction monetization design is preditory and extreme."
Negative,Not quite an interesting game.
Negative,im done with this game.im not got sit through another error 334.fix the game.its that simple
Negative,Too much content behind over-priced paywalls and DLC
Negative,"İ like the game but there is only 5 skill slot in the game you have to use them with portion as well. So you can only use 3-4 skill in the game, Very big disapointment"
Negative,"After a 4 hr wait, it wouldn't install and recognise spare room on my hard drives. Another 40 min of wading through the msg boards to find it is a common problem and not a simple fix. I pay for it to avoid fixing the developer's problems. Just a refund and move on, which is a shame."
Negative,thos 11 howers where it downloading and i cant evin play cus of en erer so f you befesta
Negative,The only MMORPG with micro transactions that forces you to buy its dlc.
Negative,"More then 25 minutes waiting for dungeon, if you group with someone, even stranger, you will get there in less then 30 sec"
Negative,probably the biggest waist of money as i payed for it and it wont open or run..follow online solutions as the game developers have set no manual to assist us and the game still wont open :)
Negative,my 5 hours were spent downloading files for the game
Negative,"Do not buy this game if you are from ASIA. The lack of asian server makes the game very frustrating to play because the consistantly high means you are sitting duck in PVP as the game buffers you by. You know you are skilled, you develop those skills over time but you cant execute it because it lags so hard in PVPs. You are also forced to compete with player who gets items by spending more and more. Get cancer instead.EDIT: TRIED another 1224 hours. Its the same."
Negative,"If you don't usually craft stuff and loot everything when you play these games, then this is a thumbs up definitely, a really good game.However I'm one of those players that does enjoy exploring around, taking my time to loot everything so I can craft and level up all the skills. If you are like me, then know that this game basically requires you to play the monthly ESO+ subscription.If you choose not to play, you will find yourself out of inventory space very quickly, the game is generous with loot, you will be getting lots of crafting materials, gear, various collectibles, potions, food and drink... Unless you ignore most of these and only take some of the loot, you will soon find yourself in a position where you will need to get rid of things, thus halting your crafting progression. For the way I like to play, this is unacceptable.I used a 3 day free trial of ESO+, which allows you access to a crafting bag and suddenly the game was so enjoyable. Other people would just pay for it, but I'm not going to do it because it's not a F2P game. This is a clear example of a game that is designed to be annoying without the subscription, to force you into paying for it.If a game has an entry price, I expect an enjoyable experience with the base game. A subscription could add perks and some extra content, and I would gladly pay for that, since as I said, the game is really good. However this is a game that holds the fun to ransom unless you pay for the subscription. Which is a thing you would expect from a F2P game, and not even the good F2P games do that...So yeah I was enjoying the game, it is a shame but I will stop playing now, I'll probably log in some days to get daily rewards, maybe with time I'll have enough gold to buy enough bag space... But I'm definitely not going to let them treat me like an idiot and subscribe. If your game is not enjoyable without an ""optional"" monthly subscription, I see no incentive to pay for it.Oh and if you read this and thought it's not big deal, WoW has a monthly subscription, well WoW is not really a good example, a game with an entry price + monthly subscription + a good amount of microtransactions. I'm not going to be taken a fool by these ""Triple A"" game companies. I'll go play a game that doesn't insult me and try to milk my money out of me."
Negative,"ohh where to begin,ESO is the longest download you will ever endure. This game took me about 5 hours to download on steam, then another 5 hours to download on the bethesda/zenimax page. Had i known better i would have just purchased this game directly from the official site and not had to download it twice. Afterwards expect a 3 hour update to get caught up to the current game add-ons etc.I have spent the last week playing this game intermittenly and I actually enjoy this game alot. The combat is fresh for a MMO and the crafting and story are top notch for this genre of game. My beef with this title is the fact that no optimization exists at all! I'm not running the most up to date PC but i did my research and compared my rig to the recommended requirements and i definently have the equipment to play this game, well at least i hoped that my computer would be able to play this game even dumbed down some I would feel was acceptable. The FPS is great some places and absolutley awful at other places, this whole idea of a fucking megaserver for north america doesnt work. 100 people jammed into the fucking bank in Daggerfall causing huge FPS loss is shit. I have never played a game where my FPS fluctuates so vastly, i go from 60 to 30 to 11 to 5 and back just by running through one fucking zone of this world. Please Zenimax optimize this game, compress the download files and maybe change the requirements on your specs because clearly you need better gear then you claim to play this game.Although it is fun and refreshing, downloading this game and then experiencing the horrible bouncing around of my FPS in game leaves me to say this game isnt worth a buy. This title has been out for a few years and lets be honest due to the number of console players that Zenimax want to cater to aswell as the PC players, i think the compression of the game and optimization of the in game quality will be left in the dark to bring out more DLC shit for console and better high end PC players to enjoy.Thank god i didnt buy any in game crap, as I doubt i will ever return to this version of Tamriel ever again..."
Negative,"I bought this game when it came out years ago.  They preached how they were going to add more content in because there was literally nothing to do in the game when it came out.  Once they released the content, they pulled one over on the customers and said that they would have to pay for it.  Never again."
Negative,"tried to get back into the game recently... but once you've had plus, you can't come back to the game. $15 a month for a material bag isnt worth it. and there's just no space for anything without it now, especially if you're a major farmer and crafter. shame, it's a decent game otherwise."
Negative,Game too laggy to play. Player from singapore.
Negative,most unbalanced trashcan dumplster fire of a money scam microtransaction cesspool pay to win BS
Negative,"Boring game, quests are tiring, combat is meh. not for me"
Negative,"Not as chaotic as Skyrim, and player movement makes me feel unnatural. It's not fun to me, because sometimes I just like to watch them fight."
Negative,Get FFXIV instead
Negative,"not at all what i expected cons-not as visualy pleasing as skyrim-trailer isn't eaven close to representing the actual game-uninspired gameplay that you can get in other games like path of exile( this being free to play)-the imperial race is locked behind a pay wall-class explainations are vague and ultamatly mean nothing becuse any class can use any gear-FUCKING MICRO TRANSACTIONS!!!!-could have just simply ripped the combet from skyrim but instead went with generic combat-it's unengaging-throws out established looting systems from previous gamespros - John Clease is a voive actorWhen I saw the trailers for this I was shown it by a freind, we both had invested countless hours into skyrim and the trailers made it seem that they had expanded one of our favorite games and made it multiplayer. then it came out with initial reveiws turned us off instantly. My hope was restored when i heard they reworked everything and I was unimpressed, boring combat and nothing feeling famillier dipite starting in skyrim. if you want an MMO with similar gamplay just go download Path of Exiles, its free has better combat a better tutorial, and justifed micro transactions."
Negative,Just let me play the game!
Negative,"garbage, they dont understand hit boxes. glitchy aswell"
Negative,"The Game is ok when its working but when you cannot get past the ""requesting character"" part for several months of trying it kind of makes the game trash so thats where its at, it trash. was a fun game but cant be played anymore."
Negative,"Never had less fun playing a game. Its like Todd Howard realized after making some great, immersive, groundbreaking games, that he could really use a money printing machine like an MMO. So he started pumping out half-baked sh*tbricks like Fallout 47 and ESO. This is the video game version of someone jingling keys in front of a baby. True that it may just not be for me, and if you enjoy it more power to you. Im just disappointed we didn't get another stand alone and instead they've put out 7 expansions for this hollow mess of an excuse for an experience. I really wanted to like it too."
Negative,"no refund, so much disappointment, there's a paywall in front of everything"
Negative,"Typical MMORPG, too time-consuming and repeatable."
Negative,Did not convince me based on the free weekend.
Negative,"Due to all the cosmetics and the spastic (real use of the word, so please close your Twitter tab) movement of players which destroys immersion, I just can't manage to enjoy this game. However, I barely enjoy Skyrim because it's boring and the loot sucks. The loot is worse here. If you don't open chests and go ""YEAH!"" then what is even the point?I'd pass on this and just play something else. You won't be missing much."
Negative,"I would really like to play the game I purchased but Bethesda made this impossible to get my account started. I owned it on Xbox, bought it on PC and now i cant register my account because they wont let me use my email. Thanks to there over complicated system this game as been rendered unplayable. thanks bethesda for being lazy...."
Negative,"the player know the game waaayyy better then the developers , developers always fix irrelevant issues and ignore the community needs . defiantly lots of pay 2 win elements . developers dont care about the pvp community at all ."
Negative,"Initial price to buy the game is only the beginning, they require you to pay quite a bit more money if you want to get anything worth while.  Unless you want to pay the subscription service or pay an exorbitant amount of money for ""Crowns"" to be able to purchase extra doodads in game you won't be able to have the best."
Negative,Its not fun you start off with a carring capasity of 50! and you have to buy all the dlc with money just to explor tamriel and its hard to earn gold in this game Especially when other players take all the items that are good
Negative,Cant justify the grind and the hours dedicated with zero support and only a focus on clearly money. Sloppy dlc releases and a pretty meh community. I encourage you to avoid this money and time sink. It will try its best to convince you to spend more money.
Negative,"thought it would be a good game to play to get to know the universe, i didnt like it when it came out but i thought it would be better now, it wasnt, none of the quests are really good and the characters just seem to drone on and fail to explain the story, all i got from the main quest was something about abissal pearls, thats all i got, and at the start of the game it leaves you so underpowered that if you make some bad desisions you litteraly have to go from the start again with a new character as the difficulty is impossible, i really want to like this game as its from bethesda but i just cant say anything good, ive had people say the graphics are nice and they are sometimes, but most the time there all blurry and look like graphics from oblivion, sure the musics nice, when there is any, when anywhere in the world its just devoid of music, i understand bethesda worked hard on this, but going online was not the way to go, the game glitches soo much with the heavy amount of players, and because its online and enemies are constantly attacking you in dungens, if the knock you over you might as well be dead as it takes way too long to get up and you cant even drink a health potion because the enemy will kill you since it doesnt, anyway 2/10 would not play again"
Negative,"Maps? Paywall.Skills? Paywall.Quests? Paywall.Levels? Classes? Races? Currencies? Literally any form of progression or content you can think of? PAYWALL. Installing spyware on your PC and Mobile device? Not only free, but you have no choice, boy. [/bA game full of drug addled soyboys and their literal Gestapo Wu-flu Admins.You'd have to be ""going full r-word""(Robert Downey Jr. [in blackface] ) to support anything this trash cooperation released or maintains. This is the more extreme, scuffed version of skyrim-themed Fallout 74.Don't waste your time.Don't go full ... by wasting your time with another Bethesda cashgrab."
Negative,"TL;DR; Game is an amazing mmo but dont buy it on steam or you will suffer. Read til the end for explanationOkay, I'll try to be as short as I can. TESO is an amazing mmorpg in TES world, classes, abilities, pve and pvp, crafting, the game itself  feels nice. Big open world, a lot of good quests with well written naratives, huge amount of lore books if you are into that. As I said - its a very well made mmo. Id even say its flawless. The one and only problem there is, is not connected to the game itself but to the steam service. You see, when you buy a game in steam, you tie your TESO account to steam and therefore have to buy everything via steam. ""Not so bad"" you may say, but wait, theres more! If you want to play the game with steam-linked TESO account, you have to do it via steam which means you CANT run the game if steam servers are broken even if the game servers are fine and steam servers break every time there is a patch to the game. So you will miss a lot of event-time and other fun stuff due to broken steam servers. Again, DONT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM, ONLY ON THE OFFICIAL GAME SITE. And also, please sign this petition in order to help Us fix this problem!   Petition [www.change.org]"
Negative,doesn't start after i click /play/
Negative,This game sucks! Not fun at all.
Negative,"This is not an elder scrolls game + Its online - Unforgiveable loading times - Linear progression - No freedom whatshowever  - You cant travel to the next zone without finishing the right quests - Living up to the modern RPG standard of forced quests to progress - You're forced to be the ""good guy"" because of this you have no choice in the matter - Appearantly a good 2/3rd of tamriel is closed off to any given factionComing from someone who's first experience in elder scrolls was Oblivion on my xbox back in around 06 the idea of an elder scrolls mmo could only be a distant dream. Playing elder scrolls with other players and perhaps even friends would've been the best thing ever. And this is what we get for it.It's quite poorly optimized, for me it loads a minimum of 15 minutes and runs at a framerate of 10 unless the game is set to the lowest graphic settings. Even than Im only getting around 20fps even though at the best settings it looks much worse than skyrim which I can run properly so I dont think it's the fault of my PC.I'm not wanting to be the bad guy. I just want the option to not be involved at all, but appearantly that option doesn't exist in modern RPG games like this. Yes every Elder scrolls title has you involved with the main plot to some degree oblivion and skyrim being the worst offender making you ""the chosen one from the emperors dreams"" or ""the dragonborn"" (im sick and tired of that all together) but even there they let you go to explore the world however you want after you escape.  I dont really get what people have with wanting to be the best by default. Not earning it, but instead having it be their birth right.In this game however if you wanne explore the whole game you're forced to play in this role pre-fabricated and forced onto you. They allow you to make your character however you want to give the player a feel of having their own identity (even that is pretty restrictive) yet they force you to play the game like everyone else, just another number on the server juming through hoops. Take Dark Souls for example, yes you're also jumping through hoops to beat the game, the difference is I like that game series. You could consider me a hypocrit because of this. What makes ESO different from Dark Souls than? Unlike Dark Souls it's an Elder Scrolls game where you're expected to have an open non-linear world where the choice wether you're a good guy, a bad guy or completely not involved is entirely up to you. If you choose to say only travel the world after escaping Helgen in Skyrim without having seen a single dragon cause you never did the main quest you can do that. That's what I love about the Elder Scrolls games.In Dark souls you're just a nobody that everyone talks down to, you have to earn the right to be considered anything worth while through hard work and effort. But elder scrolls online isn't open and non-linear and this isn't an Elder scrolls game. This is just another MMORPG where you're the stereotypical chosen hero to save the world and a mediocre one at that.I could go into detail about what I think of character creation, what I think of the restrictive nature there. What I think of the armors and weapons looking nothing like the source material. Or how you're pretty much locked in a weapon class once you start investing in it. How the easily reached level cap pretty much ruins and demotivates any training. But I think I've said enough about the forced game progression alone that I don't really need to go into detail about this.If I wanne play an open world rpg Ill just go back to Oblivion. I made this review after my vacation so I think my time to refund this has been expired, Im still within the 2 hour limit, even if i don't get my refund. It's good to get this off my back. Its nice to see not much has really changed since the beta and Im really not missing out on anything worth while. Confirmation on this is worth the 30 bucks I put into it even though Im completely broke. Im uninstalling it either way cause I kinda need the 100+GB of space this takes up."
Negative,"Worst UI ever made, poor co-op features. Questing is confusing due to UI choices. A headache to play."
Negative,So many microtransactions
Negative,A disgrace to the previous TES Games. If you like them you are very likely to not like this game.
Negative,"Aggressive and predatory monetization with ""limited"" time deals and loot boxes. Subscription gates off 75% of the content and yearly expansions cost as much as a full singleplayer game. Pair that with constant maintenance along with extremely poor server performance and you get an extremely frustrating experience.The game itself is great but in the age of live service games, get ready whip out your wallet to really experience it."
Negative,"Have 3 hours in the game and yet to log in.  Logging  in requires an access code that is sent to your email that I am not receiving. To get help with the problem you need to log in to the support page, which requires the access code. Figured I'd change my email to one that might work. Problem is, you have to log in to the support page. In researching a fix for this, I found people from two years ago with the same problem with no resolution."
Negative,not recommended for new players. this game need a lot of add-ons to play. ordinary people don't know how to install useful add-ons
Negative,"Where's the ""good game"" DLC?"
Negative,error 206 patch manifest error  unzippgame can not be played and  i wasted twenty dollars
Negative,"While its a noteworthy attempt to make the Elder Scrolls franchise multiplayer, it just didn't land for me. Skyrim still feels like the superior entry in the series."
Negative,this sucks booty hole
Negative,"Just don’t, it’s not worth anyone’s moneys. The installer is 85 gigabytes, the games another 87 gigabytes, and while installing the game using the installer, it adds to your game time meaning if your unfortunate enough to buy the game like my friend, by the time you get to play you probably won’t be able to refund it. So just don’t."
Negative,"Not recommendedThis has been my experience so far. - Around two days to download the 60GB Client. - Then the game needs to install. Downloading another 10GB(Install took six hours) - Create Account on ESO website. - After creating account can't log into game or on the ESO website. - Reset password, but still can't log in.(Tried this about 4 times) - Try to backup the game on my PC, but steam can't verify the game files. - Click verify game files, download starts from scratch.About 3 days to install a game and haven't played a single minute.I hope this helps someone else before they waste money on this peace of crap.PS. And the best part is it shows 8.4 hours played when I havn't even logged in yet."
Negative,"Just a warning - there's a subscription to this and it's kind of expensive as far as subscriptions go.   Watch your bank account, and if you do continue on to purchase this game. remember that the amount of time you have to put into this game in order to get value from the subscription cost, will be a detriment to your life and a waste of the finite time you have left on this planet. Have a great day!"
Negative,Bad Game  :(
Negative,i fuckin hate this game
Negative,"This game is alright. I don’t think it was worth my money. Overall, a 4.5/10 if you get it for sale, not on sale 2/10 definitely way better games, play all of those first."
Negative,"I bought this game with a friend, hoping we would be able to do missions and play together. Unfortunately, the content is mainly solo-game (in a world full of other people instead of NPCs).The game also is pretty boring - most of the quests I have encoutered are ""fetch 5 MacGuffin"", ""Kill 3 MacGuffin"" etc.Waiting time can be long to login and the game lags pretty often.Also, adding Redshell is a low move, and hopefully it was removed from the game."
Negative,"This game as many nice features, but it is annoying as hell!Examples: Getting logged out of the game during login because of inactivity - do not forget to click on the load screen during login every minute.So waiting is the main feature!Got a quest to kill a boss? Find him - but he is not there - It just got killed by others - so wait for 5-10 minutes till it is back or roam around and check back several times. Got a quest to clear out an anchor? It just got cleared? Wait for 10-15 minutes or search for another location. You switch country? Enjoy the loading screeen.The community? The worst of all MMORPGs. Found a chest but need to kill the aggros around? While you are busy another one will open the chest because they only fight you.Immersion feeling? NPCs everywhere will ask you for help . Running to city because there are to many enemies? The guards will enjoy the show how you get killed.Did I mentioned that I forgot to click on the login screen during writing this comment? Ahhh, yes, kicked out because of inactivity.Today I watched something.... and when I wanted to continue: Logged out because of inactivity.... I really hate this"
Negative,"Bought it, been trying to connect for last 2 days. No exegeration after 50 connection attempts i managed to get in to play the tutorial.Got disconnected after i finished that tutorial, when i was supposed to be sent to the game world.Tried reconnecting again 10 times with no success. Stuck at 'requesting character load'Not the only one with this problem, quite a lot.I am looking on a refund."
Negative,"You have to buy digital currency to buy furniture to store your items. Due to this, I'm most likely uninstalling and calling it a lost 10 bucks. How are you gonna charge a subscription fee for virtual currency in a game you play twice a week? I'm not about to pay 20 bucks to buy some storage chests. The things advertised as chests and trunks DO NOT store items. What were you guys thinking? You could have had such a great game and you threw it away over a grab at money."
Negative,"This game is really just a response to people wanted to play Skyrim on multiplayer.As an MMO, it doesn't play very well and you're better off playing World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn.If you want to play Skyrim with your friends though, this is what you want to get."
Negative,"The best way to descripe:The Elder Scrolls® Online: Tamriel Unlimited™Is wasted portential.The game is neither a good mmo or a good elder scroll game.In its attempt to be both it fails at being anything.The mmo part feels shallow(more so then most mmo's) and the elder scroll part....what elder scroll part?They could have renamed it elves online and you get the exact same feeling.The problem with The Elder Scrolls® Online: Tamriel Unlimited™ is that it offers nothing other mmo's dont do better.It doesnt have the immersion of wow(seriously when are mmo makers going to get in into there head we want big open world not zones with loading screens and none interactable worlds)It doesnt have the story element of swtor(not that mmo's are abouts stories) nor does it have the fluied combat system of that grindfest called guild wars 2.It doesnt have the freedom of eve online.The resourse gather system is poorly done, the pvp is 90% zerg 10% pvp guilds, the combat is chuncky, etc, etc, etcElder scroll fans will be dispointed.Want to defend yourself againt (un)just arrest and fight your way out?Forget it.Want to murder the obvious traitor?Forget it.Want to put naked corpses into funny piles?Forget it.Want something as simple as sitting on a chair?Again forget it.This game reminds me of the sublte thing that makes an elder scrolls game.The freedom to do what the fuck i please."
Negative,"Now this is a good game.How ever I can't play it, too much bullshit updating and it never seems to end..So no I haven't played for 8 hours, I've left it sit all night.,,"
Negative,"They almost had a customer. I was excited to play this game during the ""Play for Free"" days, but I kept getting a ""Connection to server timed out"" issue. So I looked up the issue to see if the problem was on my end. NOPE. People all over the internet have been complaining about the lack of feed back from the devs concerning this problem.  So....maybe it is a good game. Maybe its amazing. But I'll never know. And they'll never get my money."
Negative,I bought this game 2 days ago and was not able to login yet. Apparently this is a known issue for the Steam version. Do not recommend. Neither of the involved parties has posted relevant information or a time schedule for a fix. The communication is abyssmal.Login issues in an Online RPG are the worst. Only buy this game if you like login issues.
Negative,"This is the worst thing possible. My wife was trying to uninstall and reinstall this game for several hours because she was upset it wasn't working. It would not launch properly. We tried asking for a refund but we exceeded the allowed amount of time that you're allowed to ""play"" a game before you can return it. I just wanted to get the refund to buy her a new game."
Negative,"All the time it took downloading all the updates, patches, and the game itself was technically ""playing the game"" and now I can't get a refund. This isn't skyrim. Doesn't feel like skyrim, doesn't play like skyrim. Not fun."
Negative,This game has one big problem and that is the constant massive patches my internet is realtivly fast most games download in a few minutes or maybe an hour for the big ones but this game has massive patches almost every few days i have not been able to play the game as much as i would like because of this so don't try this game if you have slow internet.
Negative,"I will begin with my largest gripe, as I believe all those who make the move from Console to PC or visa versa will experience this and it must be changed with strong community feedback. I recently switched from console to PC, and the characters, items, gold, etc. do not transfer. This is understandable with an entirely new purchase of the game required for the new console. HOWEVER, I think it is poor business etiquette and, frankly, terrible to not allow access to purchased and PAID for DLC, pre-order bonuses, and collector's edition additions through the crown store. There is zero logic to creating or linking a 3rd party ESO account to this game if they are not going to honor paid for downloadable goods that are already associated with said account. it's 2022, there is no excuse for this aside from a money-first business model. Aside from the way the game is run in this era of ""micro""Transactions that cost as much as the games themselves, the sheer amount of content and population of this game in 2022 is great. There are so many ways to enjoy the game from PvP wars, battles, and duels to PvE exploration, story, and dungeons. Plenty of cosmetic items to grind for as well as special gear to make yourself a cut above the rest. I'm glad I purchased the High Isle edition on my PC after i quit playing on my Xbox, however seeing all of the special gear, houses, and cosmetics I was granted for being a part of the game and supporting it with my hard earned money locked behind a paywall that I already paid for is infuriating."
Negative,"I am just so overly unimpressed with this game. I'm a MMO and Skyrim fan so I figured this would be right up my ally.  I'm barely into the game so I cant criticize it as a whole but from what I can see, most of what makes skyrim amazing just isnt here.. while a lot of what makes skyrim clunky is. My biggest complaint is that you can walk into a dungeon, and just walk by everything. Either other players are swarming around killing everything (and then it respawns moments later) Or you just straight up walk around it. There's no reason to stealth. One of the missions was ""Stealth around the enemies"" Sort of task.. yet I just walked right by everything, not even sprinting, not even avoiding anything. The quests seem to be typical kill/fetch/talk to quests with no real meaning which just isn't what I'd expect from an elder scrolls game.I'm not sure what kind of drugs people are taking that say this game looks amazing, it doesn't. It seems to look the same as skyrim did, maybe slightly better, and that's barely an improvement. There are real beautiful games out there, and this doesn't even come close.Combat seems like it could get interesting.. This is what I was most excited for once I saw how the combat system was, but it's BORING. I'm sure some boss fights must be fun, but it just feels like you need to put in effort just to kill low level creatures.. and then do the same thing, again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again or like I said, you could just.. walk right by them all because it doesn't matter... I think I'll go try modding Skyrim again."
Negative,Can't even launch the game. I've been googling and attempting fixes for 20 minutes now but honestly? I have no time for this.
Negative,"This game compared to The Elder Scrolls videogames is like: ""Spiderman ----> The Amazing Tarantula"".Tarocchissimo as fak."
Negative,just another mmo
Negative,"Although they do not show it on the pictures and videos above, it is a creepy horror game, only for necrophils.The original Elder scrolls lore is also fucked up just to justify the weak pvp system."
Negative,Game is fine but the Error 209 is totally unacceptable.  The server will lock you out for days.  Do not waste your time with this terribly flawed set up.
Negative,"""We are continuing to investigate issues that some Steam users are having logging into"""
Negative,"account creation / linking failed, connection time out, what a trash"
Negative,"Its an MMO, a boring MMO."
Negative,"I might've just saved my money and computer space, but Steam considers 2 hours of downloading to be 2 hours of gameplay, so... yeah. I'm out of options. I played the game for a bit, and I got to about the point where you set out to find a.. Dragon Priest..? Story and questlines seemed pretty jumbled when I played it through. First it was bandits, then it was somebody pretending to be a skeever, then it was a Dragon Priest? It was confusing, but to be fair, I guess an MMO has to keep the players occupied. It just didn't work for me. I then stopped playing for a bit. It didn't nearly have the charm that Skyrim, Morrowind or Oblivion had, but that's not the fault of the developers. I must say that they did a decent job with the visuals and animation, and I appreciate their hard and seemingly constant work to make the game better and better. It keeps happening in the corner of my eye, but I see they add new chapters and DLCs occasionally. But sadly... I can't count it for a game I'd recommend. I could play some of the main Elder Scrolls games such as Skyrim or Oblivion, and they'd take me away on a magical journey as they always do. This game... it's alright, I'll say, but it doesn't have that same spark (as I said earlier). It's like any other MMO I know, for example, World of Warcraft. Same systems, such as mounts, combat, etc. We've all seen it before, and ESO is nothing truly new. You're not the master of your own story unlike the main games, and that's what takes away for me. You're just a little fish in a huge pond off to destroy some Daedric prince whose name and motives I forgot. Whelp, that's all I have to say. Know that this is only my opinion and it's based off my best knowledge of the game which, mind you, isn't as great as other matters. But, during my time I played this game, I did not necessarily enjoy it and I do not strongly recommend it."
Negative,"Does not feel like an Elder Scrolls game. It's more like Runescape but in real time. Although, the graphics are nice."
Negative,It will never be as good as Skyrim....But it's better then most free MMO's so it's worth a try if you an elder scrolls fan
Negative,combat is very boring. 1/10
Negative,"Don't bother with this one. Play Skyrim, Oblivion or Morrowind"
Negative,"please make server for asia, we need that"
Negative,"The game literally is boring as you start the game with max health, stamina and magic. you don't build up to anything because all of the enemies and bosses are easy. when you level up the stat increases are a drop in the bucket. The enemies can't touch you with that much health. HARD PASS. I really tried to give the game some time but it is just boring. I don't like cheating in games and this just feels like you started out with God mode activated."
Negative,"They just made the new patch make is to that thousands of people's computers no longer meet minimum requirements. It makes absolutely no sense. Are you also making Xbox One no longer compatible with the requirements to playing the game? The game came out in 2014, why are you making us get new hardware for an 8 year old game. Should be ashamed of yourselves."
Negative,"The game continues to disconnect me every 40-60 minutes for no reason, with no error. I can be in the middle of a dungeon run or in the middle of a boss fight, and it fucks me over every time. I'm even a ""plus"" member, yet that apparently grants me nothing in the form of a stable connection."
Negative,"When I played this game around two years ago, it did not have much direction in terms of how to join friends, or how to progress.However, this was one of those ""over the weekend it is free"" type of things that happened, and this is my recollection of this."
Negative,Genuinely don't know what the goal of the game is. I walked around for hours killing things unable to make any progress.
Negative,down loaded this for 3 days thinking it was like skyrim or better...it was not.
Negative,This game was such a disappointing follow up to Skyrim.
Negative,garbage game bad ping bad everything
Negative,"worst mmo, play warcraft"
Negative,"character creator kicks you out after 2 minutes of idle, spent over an hour making a character only to lose all progress."
Negative,"This is the only game that constantly crashes on me and the ticket help is absolutly worthless. i've done the ticket help at least three times. It always gives the exact same ""help"" followed by a BS excuse that has nothing to do with my problem.(I believe they're automated.) Now I'm stuck with a game that doesnt work and cant even refund it because its past the point of the refund policy."
Negative,"ESO has an over abundance of doors/locks that need picked even for certain quests that need completed.. Lock picking is very difficult, lock picks are 9 gold (in game currency) The good items are mainly found  as a result of group events, so you'll never have the good stuff unless the gold farmers put it up on the market place, or you get in with a group that will ALLOW you to get what you need. This game varies very little from WoW, except your character can't fly or swim underwater. Bag space is very expensive."
Negative,"I am so glad i got this for free, a whole 30 minutes played. Not only was it a colossal waste of data to download this 90GB game, but the fact it was released the same year as Farcry 4 and still looks this horrifically bad is just a testament to bethesda's commitment to fucking as many people over as they can for profit."
Negative,"Downloaded 87GB over three hours. Pressed play and the launcher wanted to re-download it all. Removed from computer, garbage."
Negative,horrible staff team HIGHLY DO NOT RECCOMEND.
Negative,completly not worth it
Negative,"I really enjoyed not playing this game. Everyday, I can take solace in not playing this game."
Negative,spent half the time spamming E and running back and forth talking to people. Spent half the time finding people and spamming left click half the time in combat.
Negative,"I'm just going to run down a list:1.)  No matter what your build, you'll use the same three moves (your 1, your 2 and your heavy attack) over and over and over,  If you want to get really fancy, you might use a fourth move once in a blue moon, but you don't really need to,  Combat is monotonous.  2.)  All the enemies are basically model swapped/palette swapped.  There are 5 enemy types (caster, archer, fighter, aoe spammer and boss).  You will fight these same enemies in every zone, in the same exact way, over and over.  Again, combat is monotonous.3.)  Moving to new zones gives no sense of accomplishment or progression, because the game just isn't built that way.  You can visit every zone you've unlocked within 1-2 hours of gameplay, if you wanted.4.)  The game is level/gear auto-balanced, except for a handful of special trials.  What this means is that leveling up, getting a new skill, getting shinier magic pants really doesn't mean anything, because the difficulty level *always remains exactly the same*.  That difficulty, by the way, is very, very low.  Unless you try to solo a world boss or just fall asleep while playing, you will not die.5.)  Finally, I'm old enough that paying for a game, plus paying a monthly subscription, is not some shock to me.  What is shocking is just how little you get for it.  This game offers no more, and generally less, content than a crap-ton of F2P games out there.  I play a F2P *mobile game* with no subscription that has thousands of hours more depth than this,TL;DR  :  Don't waste your time, don't waste your money, get something else."
Negative,"I'm enjoying the game, but I think I'll have to give it a negative review just for the awful business practices. Although you have to pay for the game, in many ways it mimics a free to play/pay to win game in that if you pay them a monthly subscription you get all kinds advantages over other players.I think the thing that has annoyed me the most though is that just like most pay to win games from pretty much the start your inventory is clogged up with endless amounts of garbage. You can mitigate this somewhat buy saving up for and buying bag/bank upgrades, but as of 16 hours in I've constantly got a full bank and about 30-40 slots free at any given moment in an 80 slot bag. Oh, but guess what! If you pay them £15 a month you get a ""crafting bag"" with unlimited space! F you.Prepare for the grind - I worked out that if you want to max your horse riding skills you'll need to play every day for over 6 months. There might be more egregious grinds in the game, but I'm still low level.Ring/Jewel crafting is locked behind a DLC?! lol what?Researching takes 6 real time hours per item per trait. I can only imagine so you further clog up your inventory with items you want to research to push people towards the monthly fee.I don't know if I'm just sensitive to these things after years of these shenanigans, but everything seems to be pushing you towards spending more money. Everything in the game including the story and quests take a back seat to saving up for bag/bank upgrades."
Negative,Tons of content is locked behind DLC even though it claims to be one time purchase to play the game. I purchased a plus subscription after buying the game for myself and 3 other friends. After the first month ended they permanently banned me until I purchase another month of the plus subscription. Also you get banned if you say anything they don't like in the in game chat. Stay away from this game and get skyrim online mod instead.
Negative,"I have played 200 hours and I think I should write a review.First of all I stoped playing this game. Yeah the main reason is the community.You can play a lot of solo content but in the end game you have to rely on players/groups to get through the trials and vet dungeons. If you want to experinece the story within a dungeon or trial while doing them without your guild.........forget it no timing speeeeeed run......realy annoying.As good as the story is and the different classes with the CP system (which is like paragon from D3) realy are working well.....the community at times is crap. If you search role playing guilds....nah forget it. If you are searching for relaxing guilds ok you may find several but you will only have 6-9 players online at the same time at max.Or you go to big guild.....like 230 + Members....where you can forget building relationships cause the size is just to big.The graphics are realy nice and the customizing of the characters is a real beauty.The class system with 5 active skillls 1 one ultimate kind of reminded me of Guild Wars 1.But it works realy well. You can realy explore a lot, and it is what you expect from an ES game. Everything is very detailed.But what also crushed it you don't have an auction house. You have to join a trading guild (you can joind max 5 guilds) then the guild must bid for an merchant and when you have outbid every other guild you can place orders there. And hope that someone wil buy your stuff. Sure you can sell within you guild but.....I even gave Morrowind and the new warden class a chance but the whole area was overun......Ah yes for geargrinding fands at level 50 with CP160 it ends from gear side. You can level through the 1000+ CP but the gear stays at cp160.Well enough said for me it was not wasted time but I will move on. :)"
Negative,"I'm not sure whether to recommend this game or not. I haven't put much time into it, but from what time I have invested, this is my opinion.After playing a couple hours I feel like the story seems to be interesting and could grow into something really fun. Most MMO stories don't suck me in as much as I would like and this one puts in a better effort than most. I'm also quite impressed with the graphics considering the game came out in 2014.My biggest negative comment is the controls. The in-combat controls feel laggy and uncoordinated.- Melee weapon swings have a longer delay after each attack than seems realistic. Additionally, they don't always hit when it feels like they should.- Dodging requires a very quick double tap of the WASD (whichever direction) that doesn't always recognise the keystrokes.- Bows don't let you hold the draw for very long before shooting.- Blocking is very reliable, but interrupts don't always work.I think Skyrim had more realistic combat and more responsive controls.PS. Characters run weird"
Negative,thhis game has loads of issues on steam i cant even login i bought it and havent even been able to try it still waiting on my money back
Negative,100 GB for this shite
Negative,"Can't get past launcher without infinitely updating. Can not register for account because my gmail is an ""invalid format""40 minutes later and I still can't even open the game I downloaded 115 GB for"
Negative,"Just keeps saying invalid email, cant play."
Negative,Just too far away from your expected MMORPG version of Skyrim.
Negative,I haven't been able to play why no one knows as soon as I turn on the game it crashes Until this fix this with out the need to be a software Developer I don't recommend buying for now this is a refund for me as I took 3 days to try and find out why.
Negative,"-Ok good MMO BUT Dlcs are really expensive and worthless, they divide 1 dlc story into 2-3 pieces and sell them as different dlcs... cmon zenimax.... (the dragons dlc and the high isle dlc work like this).-Great voice acting and all that (music etc).-Not paid monthly so it's a freaking huge good thing to be able to play whenever you want.-Classes? good u can do wathever u freaking want with them.-races: most than any mmo basically so it's good, altough i wish i could be a titanic cat (the cathay).-main quest is cool and all.- cloths and armour, kinda good, u need to farm really hard to get so really cool sets and some of them are paying only.... with real money in the crown store... yeah they need to make money on top of something besides the pets, mounts and all the 50000 dlcs that are REALLY expensive...but it's a good game, i play solo mostly, but i did play with friends and the experience is equally good to both sides."
Negative,"You can play sometimes, then its fun. Most of the time, and I mean most of the time, you get kicked from the server every 45 seconds. Making this game unplayable and a waste of money.     Enjoy the 6 hour load time which means you can't get a refund.  Do not buy this on steam."
Negative,"VERY pay to win with almost all content and systems locked behind paywalls in the game.  Want to scribe? have to buy it, want to transmute, have to buy it, want a companion have to buy it, etc etc  Would not recommend to anyone who doesn't want to pay the monthly fee for ESO plus."
Negative,CRAP    WEN   E6
Negative,I got kicked in a loading screen.
Negative,Not as fun as the original game. very tedious and requires many dlc's to have any real fun. Look it has the main concepts down but it is really lacking in the freedom of travel.
Negative,"Skyrim was an incredible game with many bugs, but playable. ESO online is an ok MMO, with some bugs."
Negative,"Still in pre alpha!Don't buy it"""
Negative,"It's a MMO with a TES skin, which would be fine, as far as MMOs go, this one is not bad.But the DLC business model is inexcuseable, don't get me wrong, if this was a subscription game, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place, but I wouldn't hold it against people who did, but charging for the base game, then micro transactions, and holding content hostage behind a pay wall on top of that is top scum behavior.There are free MMOs that are comparable to this that have more content, and if you want TES lore, just read the wiki.Regret buying this 100%."
Negative,"Una estafa. Pagas por el juego, y al poco tiempo te das cuenta que te obligan a comprar la Membresía Plus para que no se te llene el inventario cada 5 minutos, y para poder recolectar las miles de cosas como hierbas, materiales y runas que son necesarias a lo largo del juego. Pay To Win."
Negative,No Auction House.  Each Guild can have a store to sell your stuff but its only viewed by a limited number of people each day.  Sales are weak and a strain on most guilds to maintain because you have to bid on the stores.No Mini Map.  You can have one but you have to download and install a add on.Server is down often for very long periods of time.  Subscribes are not reimbursed for this.Finding Delves even if you have the add on to show where they are can be a pain at times.Most quality of life features have to be gained from an add on. Inventory management is a big pain. I got this game in 2015 played to level 35 then moved on.  Seven years goes by and I keep hearing on gaming reviews how much better it now compared to when it was released. I've been back a month and in my humble opinion its no better than way back in 2015.I wish I could get my 80 bucks back. I pretty sure that is  what I paid for this game way back in the day.
Negative,"Uninteresting combat, bland game mechanics and an over priced MTX store.Update: Developer has asked for a feed-back ticket; however I don't see the point, as I was a Beta player and the combat was no different then than it is now.There is no weight to melee weapons. No impact against the creatures/enemies you are fighting. The animations are awkward and ranged combat (archery in particular) is visually uninteresting, slow and does not feel impactful. If these haven't been addressed since beta they never will be.  TESO was always a good idea; but poorly executed."
Negative,Runs crap on Steam. Expected update by now to fix this...
Negative,no. clunky af
Negative,"I love the Elder Scrolls games but just couldn't get into ESO. The combat, graphics and world design just weren't the same."
Negative,"Well, unfortuantely I have to give this game a firm thumbs down. I was so looking forward to playing it after loving the adventures in Skyrim, and so I finally bit the bullet and bought the game, got set for some adventures. Well, there the fun began, but not for me. First I had to download it, okay we have to do that with every game, then I had to unlock the game with a code, then I had to download the actual game...took hours because the first download isn't actually the game, and then downlad the updates. Then I had to create an account by handing over my precious email address, then I had to actually verify my address, and why was that then Bethesda Softworks & ZeniMax Online Studios? SO YOU CAN ENSURE THAT YOU ARE SPAMMING THE CORRECT INBOX EVERY DAY WITH THIRD PARTY JUNK!!!!!!!Ever since signing up to their online subs, and having to provide them with my email address, I am getting spammed every day by a multitude of usless offers which I never agreed to, So thanks for charging me £50 for the privilage of spamming my email, and no doubt you also go paid to pass on my details to other third parties?So, basically, if you DON'T want your email to be exploited and your inbox rammed with junk, I urge you not to buy this game.As for the game itself, I really don't care anymore. I've racked up so many hours by starting the game, then have to wait so long for the updates every time, I just walk away. Of the 72hrs game play so far, I have actually only played the game for 30mins."
Negative,"Its not Skyrim. Thats all I heard. Bad review after bad review. Now a year in and this game is awesome. This is an MMO. But unlike the other MMOs it feels like a single player game. The combat is far better then anyother MMO. The voice acting is great and rare in an MMO. Simply put this is the most high end MMO out there. The production values out shine Guild Wars 2 by a mile,(though thats apples to oranges and I love both games) and there seems to be a lot to do.  There are many flaws. Like optimization is lacking. I really don't know how bad this is going to look on the Xbox 1 but it will be lacking. The frame rate will jump around in certain areas for no reason,(I go from 60 to 38/40 as an all time low, and I decided to cap it at 48 for a more constant frame rate) and the UI is lacking as well. Add ons help but no turning off the cross hairs? Really? Get an Addon that changes it  and or disables it. The ambiant occlusion is cut rate and is best turned off.(As it is not true to reality. Shadow haze on everything. It just makes the world darker for no reason with and takes some FPS with it. Its what you would find in a ENB for Fallout) Still it looks great overall and the lighting is bar none the best in any MMO. The gameplay is the best of any MMO. The story is fully voice acted and stronge. On top of that it has good music and the game has a sense of humor. I do get annoyed that the draw distances is so short no matter what and the atmospheric perspective is so forced. Still most games do that to make the world seem bigger.     There should be no negitive reviews. Its an MMO and will take time to hit its stride. Look at LOTRO! MMOs evolve and try to get better. ESO did that and is doing that. They are trying something different and getting it right. in a market of WOW clones. If you like MMOs check it out, if you like Elder Scroll check it out, and I recomend you spend more and get the Imperial Edition. Update: There are way to many updates. Really this is rediculous. If you don't log in for a week get ready for updates that take forever. I have never had an update take as long as this. I have a great connection and end up waiting for updates for hours!!! There is serious issues on their end, because sometimes it will stop 75-80% in and guess what. You have to start all over again. Until they fix this horrible server I can not recommend a game I can't play. On top of this rather than expanding the game world they are going for greed again. Paid DLC to get into the Imperial City. This is awful and we are back to the money grubbing that nearly wrecked them day one. And here we are. Nothing learned. Guild Wars 2 expanded the world free to a point and so did LOTRO. Not ESO... They gave up on a full and open Cyrodil. Now it will be pay as you go. For an $80 game this is rediculous. Terrible end game does not help it at all. At this point this is a lost cause. All the strides they hit in production values are lost by a cheap paid DLC. This is no expansion, this is what you paid for when you give them 60-80 dollars. A complete game that gets finished in some way. Save your money for Fallout 4/Witcher 3 or spend your money on WOW/LOTRO/Guild Wars2. You will spend less and have a better time"
Negative,Fuck Bethesda and all the trash they produce.
Negative,"Where to begin on this one...Let's start with the leveling system.The Leveling System in ESO is a bit like Guild Wars 2 and World of Warcraft in that the enemies scale to your level, and certain enemies are simply not balanced properly by Zenimax and they tend to be overtuned for their level and place--basically meaning if you fight them by yourself you are going to die even though the quest should be doable by yourself. This is a concurrent problem with much of the single-player content.The leveling system I rate at a 6 out of 10, it's slight above average because it's convenient and presents a challenge in most instances but those unbalanced and forgotten mobs leave a foul taste in my mouth.Now let's move on to the next topic! Dungeons! Dungeons and other group content.First off, let's start with dungeons--dungeons are, for the most part, the absolute worst aspect of this entire game. 90% of the dungeons in the game are cakewalks, where you have one person in the party of max level with almost max champion levels just zerging through the whole instance--either aggroing the entire mobs along the way or ignoring them and letting them annihilate his party, whom doesn't care if you live or die, who doesn't care about you as a person and is only interested in his own progression into the game, and only wants to end the dungeon as quickly as possible and doesn't even care if you need or want to do the quests or listen to the NPCs or explore the lore. THey simply. Do. Not. CARE.This, combined with the fact that dungeons either have two difficulties: Very easy or impossibly hard, makes them very hard for me to find them enjoyable in any way whatsoever. Either bosses are so pathetically easy they're almost laughable, or they--or their minions--have hidden 'GOTCHA!' mechanics where if you don't block, dodge or interrupt them specifically they will literally one-shot you. In fact, almost ALL of the bosses in this game whom are dubbed quote/unquote 'hard' use instant kills as an excuse for 'challenge'. Which is not something I find challenging or enjoyable, I want to die because I took high damage--not because I messed up one mechanic and then just take my entire health in damage flat with no mitigation. Such mechanics in MMOs are becoming commonplace and in most cases are a result of developer laziness or lack of creativity.For this reason alone, and the fact that the dungeons seem to be the worst aspect of this game overall, I am rating the Dungeons of ESO as a 1 out of 10, it is a missed opportunity and a blatant example of how inexperienced and/or incompetent Zenimax is at balancing dungeon mechanics into an enjoyable experience.Other group content includes doing things known as Dolmens, Trials, PvP, Public Dungeons and World Bosses. Dolmens are mini-events where you fight a bunch of daedra before a boss spawns and then you kill that and win; they're rather trivial in difficulty and you only really do them to gain reputation with the Fighter's Guild or for map completion, very rarely for gear. I have not yet done Trials or PvP. Public Dungeons can be solo'd by certain builds/classes and if you have one or two other people with you. And World Bosses tend to have boss enemies whom use 'GOTCHA!' mechanics to quite literally just kill you instantly as a cheap way to force player deaths as a way to try and mask their otherwise unimpressive design or mechanics.Other group content in this game I'm rating as a 5 out of 10, it's unimpressive in most aspects honestly.And now we'll move onto the Questing Systems and the Storylines of the game.Every NPC in this game is voice-acted, every NPC has a voice actor with every line having it being voiced over by another person. THe storylines in each zone is different, varied and actually pretty interesting--for the first time through you will thoroughly enjoy the lore. And speaking of lore, the books and other lores written in the game are extensive and if you love reading stories in TES games then you will absolutely ADORE the amount of books and lore texts present in the game. THough whilst the questline stories are pretty damn unique and interesting, the quests in of themselves tend to be rather dull--they're just the same types of quests over and over; fetch this and bring it to that person, kill one badguy leading others, free this person or that person, escort this NPC to this place, etc... Which is to be expected given the nature of the game--you can't make 10,000 uniquely different quests for every situation.In terms of Questing and Storyline Presention, as well as with the quests themselves and the lore involved; I'm giving this game a 9.5 out of 10, simply superb in all aspects.Now on to the Crafting Aspect of the game.The crafting in this game is a bit similar to Skyrim but also different--you need the materials needed to make each and every type of item, and in order to have enough bag space needed to make the items you want you are looking at either shilling out tens of thousands of gold to vendors to increase your bag space OR you're going to need to shell out 15 bucks in order to get ESO PLus to gain the crafting bag otherwise you're simply NOT going to have enough space to make the items you want. On top of that, in order to craft the higher tier items you'll need both the skill levels IN your chosen field of crafting AND the skill points available to purchase the skills needed in order to make them--just complication on top of complication makes crafting in this game more of a chore than something that inspires me to use it extensively.I give the crafting system of ESO a 3.5 out of 10, mainly because of the bag space issue and the FORCED need to have ESO Plus in order to be good at it.And finally, we're moving on to that dreaded thing known as ESO Plus.Zenimax pretty much tries to force you to become a member at every opportunity, putting in an almost excessive amounts of walls in your way blocking the things you want to do unless you intend to throw money at them first. You CANNOT unlock the Crafting Bag UNLESS you are an ESO Plus member, you CANNOT dye your outfits (which there are many) UNLESS you are an ESO Plus member, you receive less gold and experience if you are NOT an ESO Plus member, and given the absurdly large amount of DLC that is all locked behind anywhere between 5 to 20 dollars worth of crowns (shop currency) in order to unlock unless you want to spend 15 dollars and UNLOCK IT ALL AT ONCE with an ESO Plus membership (and note that 5-20 dollars worth of crowns to unlock the DLC is PER DLC not for ALL of them), the game just feels like you're so badly penalized just because you can't or won't pay for their membership it's almost as bad as the SWTOR's penalty for free players.The forced nature of the ESO Plus system otherwise you're permanently locked out of certain content in this game earns it a 2 out of 10.Overall, this game has it's shining moments but it's often overshadowed by the glaring defects that otherwise ruin this rather impressively amazing game--the rather selfish toxic players in group content, the lazy unbalanced mobs, the fact you NEED a guild and to pre-build your own parties just to do DUNGEON QUESTS, an obsession over instant kills from bosses amongst other issues has left me feeling as if this game could have been better... but it fell SHARPLY off of the mark.Unfortunately, my overall score for this game is a 4.5 out of 10. The group content and lack of proper challenge kills it for me, and no I don't consider insta-kills to be 'challenging content' at all. I cannot and will not recommend this game until the gameplay changes are made to make dungeons a much more enjoyable and social experience. I would not get this game unless it's on sale, and even then, I wouldn't buy the ESO Plus membership unless you really enjoy the game."
Negative,"I haven't seen a game crashing this often in a long, long time. This beats just about everything, including fallout 76. Randomly crashing 2-3 times an hour. Updated all drivers, do not have any add-ons installed, tried different suggestions - still crashes. Makes it almost unplayable.Also, the game servers are ridiculously busy, wait time is often measured in minutes. With the game crashing every 30 minutes or so, makes it really intolerable. I would have never bought this game if I knew the quality is so bad.Very, very disappointed."
Negative,incredibly hard to play without out purchasing the membership for a crafting bag.
Negative,Game about Loading...
Negative,Monetisation so bad it puts Korean f2p mmos to shame
Negative,"I am playing this game without steam so ignore 2 hours official play time. Ok, before I start I am a huge TES fan. I've been that since Morrowind. It is hard as fuck for me to hit that not recommended button, but for now it must be so. I will gladly change it if more improvements happen.  Yes yes, it is b2p now but it is still not that good. So I will focus on what I dislike about this game: - character generation sucks big time:What year is this? Last time I checked it was 2015. not 2010. Characters are ugly, whatever you do you will simply make another twin to your previous character of same race, not enough variety of anything regarding to the facial/body features and no character physics! ESO team should really look up towards the Eastern MMO games and their character creation and their physics. And no, I am not talking about bouncing boobs, I don't care about that. - classes:I get the idea that you wanted to allow players a larger variety of gameplay styles - but don't do it in this way. Basically, whatever class you pick won't matter because you can play all other classes through it. Not to mention that you have only 4 to pick, where 2 are quite the same. So to be perfectly honest, ESO team created for us a SINGLE class to play, with 4 subclasses. WHY?! WHY?! WHY?!- leveling up:If I understand it correctly, the only way to level up in this game is to do quests. Everything else takes forever. No comments how fucked up this is. -.-- crime system:GREAT IDEA went horribly wrong! I adore it that I can sneak, still, pickpocket and kill... BUT, when those fucking guards catch me and I start to run - I've been killed through WALLS, I've been killed from HUGE distances with arrows, I've been killed through fucking MOUNTAIN!!! How pathetic is that guys that you created your terminator guards with their godlike abilities that define all logic? What's the point in running away if you can't run away?!- swimming, flying, climbing - what happened?ES Lore has a class that lives in swamps, in water and near water. Why was swimming not completed?! Why can't you climb? Why can't you glide or fly or whatever? Again - what year is this? We are surely not in the 2015. with this game. - still buggy:I've red that ESO until Tamriel Unlimited was buggy as hell and that they've fixed it. Well, I can state that in my 20-30 hours of gameplay I've encountered broken quest bugs, unable to click/use something/someone bugs, I had 1 game freezing where I had to hard reset my computer...All in all, this game is not yet ready to be truly enjoyed. It simply feels borring. It feels unfinished. I heard that you had 200 million dollars budget. That's a shame. You could've rather used 77 million to create a missle launch and launch this as far away from previous Elder Scrolls gems as possible."
Negative,"Not worth it, I think"
Negative,"""Let's make players download shitload of patch after downloading the game instead of pushing updates steam itself, so people will get pass 2 hours cap and can't refund anymore."""
Negative,I purchased this game through steam and it wouldn't link my steam account to the game so i couldnt even login to play it.
Negative,"My god the actual combat in this game is terrible. I dont understand how they could have downgraded it this badly from skyrims combat. Sprinting in 1st person makes your sensitivity 1/3 the amount with no option to change it, but sprinting in 3rd person doesn't do that. Really feels rushed and unpolished like some 3rd party indie game."
Negative,just got done spending lots of money on the game for them 2 just put me in a waiting room for 2 hours 2 play the game and when it gets about the time i can play it restarts lol i work a full time job on dont got time for this smh im getting a more trusted game
Negative,"WARNING: the inital download is 70Gb, but the process can't be finished unless you have 160Gb free space on the disk. Depending on SSD size and what else is on there, that could be a real problem.EDIT: 25 hours later, the incessant nudging toward microtransactions is getting exhausting...EDIT #2: 54 hours in, I have to conclude that there's just no point in a new player picking up this game."
Negative,"maybe i would ,but i cannot play the game due to ERROR-210I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET IT RUNNING SINCE JUNE 26,2022.NOT A HAPPY CAMPER"
Negative,I do NOT recommend this game as it is subscription based!
Negative,"NO ASIA SERVER thumbs down, game is getting more lag and pvp is unplayable ATM (IF U ARE IN ASIA)"
Negative,The Launcher that comes with this game uninstalls itself and the game each time you boot up the game.
Negative,"Personally didn't like the way they handled weapon switching and I found the combat meh. If I am going to play a game like this, I'd play Wow. If I am going to play a game that it seems like it was going for, I'd play BDO (If I could go back into time however, I would play the private server: GameZBD.)P.S. I am usually the type of person who sticks it through to the end of an MMO before I can say if I like the MMO or not. This didn't feel worth it to me at a very early stage (lvl 18)."
Negative,"I got this game through a Humble Bundle free release, and even with that I can't say I would recommend getting it through Steam. In my case, when I first tried to install it, it installed the 70 GB from steam, then the launcher said it would have to update every file, so I would have to redownload another 70 GB - so I uninstalled on the spot and forgot about it. When I went back later to try to install it again, it wouldn't let me log in through steam as it said I never bought it, so I can whole heartedly say buy this from the website, if you do at all."
Negative,Cant transfer over my Xbox progress. My toon is has played all the original content owns a house etc. sooo many mounts so much DLC...... but nothing at all transfers over....... Fortnight can do it from console to console to PC....... why not ESO.I am losing out so much money that I will definitely not be re-spending like whats the point....Revising here after many more hours played...... game has been out since 2014.... so that time until 2022 8 years of my life gone because they cant keep up with COD or Forknife and allow my progress and DLC to be cross console...... get with the times man or make a new one.
Negative,"Let's get the good stuff out of the way first. This game has a very solid combat system.  I loved smacking things in the face with my shield. The character creation and customization was very flexible and quick to master despite being overwhelming at first. However, if  you love Skyrim this game will enrage you. First it will take hours to download and install. Then, when I finally did get it up and running the server was down most of the day. Although the combat was solid it was vastly inferior to Skyrim.  In fact, the character customization was the only improvement over Skyrim. This game raised many questions in me like... What is the hell this?  Where is Paarthanax? Where are the  Grey Breads? Why are there Jack o Lanterns in Solitude? Where are the classic characters voiced by Max von Sido and Micheal Dorn.  Or that cool but weird voice actor from Spawn and Gargoyles? Where are the annoying children NPCs. Where are the characters we love? Where are the characters we hate?  Where are the characters that we love to hate? Where are any characters?  I went to Labyrinthine (sp?) and was very disappointed.  Labyrinthine in Skyrim is huge imposing and scary.  This was none of those things.  I saw something labeled a ""frost troll"".  That was no frost troll.  It chucked rocks at me like Donkey Kong, and died way too quickly. The mud-crabs looked like logos from a Sea Food Chain. NO! The mud crabs looked like logos on frozen sea food.  NO! The mud crabs looked like logos on Walmart Brand discount frozen sea food! I had to go to a different province to find a character with an actual quest.  By that time I was so PO-ed I did not care.  I just wanted to get a drink and snack and go to bed.  In Skyrim I was immersed and absorbed, in ESO I was very aware I was playing a video game.  Furthermore the trailer is a damn lie! Where are the epic stakes? The massive battles?  The hot elf chicks?  I saw one elf girl besides the tutorial.  The voice actress was so annoying I turned off the game.  In Skyrim I was a Dark Elf with a tragic past and epic destiny.  In ESO I was a freelance digital illustrator in his home office yelling at his TV covered by a blanket cause his housemate won't him turn up the heat!  This may be online, but it is no Elder Scrolls."
Negative,If you are looking for a true Elder scrolls experience then this is not it. Sure it has a lot of stuff to do but none of it really feels worth your time. You'll often find yourself asking: was that it? Quests are pretty much meaningless and none of them make you feel that you are actually a part of a  real storyline. Basically it's like a  infinite meaningless sidequest that is mediocre at best.
Negative,"The absence of any auction house/commerce system is a major deal breaker. You are restricted to trading within your own guild, or trade guilds that charge excessive monthly fees. This game just never drew me in and I am sure it never will."
Negative,"I feel like it was a waste of money, game is dry as hell. No charm left from the other Elder Scrolls games and I got bored fast."
Negative,I dunno how I played this game for 92 hours because every time I pick this game up I get bored rather quicklym I'm guessing they're afk hours somehow. Wouldn't personally recommend the game. 3/10
Negative,"did not work got an error code, good job zenimax"
Negative,Old Review: Burn thingsnew review: i dont like it
Negative,"PVP is not balanced, and servers are trash. Could be really fun with some work, but this game is so old now."
Negative,"Whilst the game looks cool, it is unplayable where I live with ping upwards of 300 on the NA servers.Spent a few hours troubleshooting to get the ping down and thats pushed me over steams 2 hour refund limit rip. Despite saying steam review refunds on a case by case, prepare to have it auto denied everytime."
Negative,"Do not buy through steamThere are an ungodly number of issues with running the game through steam.Usually I would give some kind of list but im tired and my head is still spinning from trying all the little fixes suggested and having them fail for me.*The rest is just a rant about my experience and some insight into an issue you might be having*I have no real opinion about the game itself since my experience is tryign to figure out where to go after starting on summerset isle as a complete noob. This area is not a starter area and no indication is given about how to get to the starter area. The following might help you get to your starter area.Starter area is determined by the alience faction you choose there are 3:Aldmeri DominionDaggerfall CovenantEbonheart PactWhen you start the game, if some mysterious stranger doesnt approch you (teleport in) within about 1 min and tell you to go meet someone and then things happen and the game gets interesting, theres a badass bond chick, it means you are not in a starter area.If you dont know which faction you chose then open your character sheet and hover your mouse over the top left of whatever pops up or somthing like that. Then you find a waypoint shrine somwhere. There is an icon for them on the map itself and it shouldnt matter which one you chose. You might have to explore a bit to find one like a town/city.Interact with the shrine shoudl get a long list of locations.If you are part of the Aldmeri Dominion: Click on Auridon then move the map south and you shoudl be able to click on Vulkhel Guard Wayshrine. Go there and  you SHOULD be approached by a hooded figure almost immediatly and then follow the quest from there. If you are waiting for more then a min then check your alience faction again or curse me whatever.If you are part of either of the other 2 factions the logic is the same but you will ahve to figure out the starter city for that faction"
Negative,"Doesn't have any of the feel of the elder scrolls. It's just a grindy mmo with a popular name and vague lore attached that lures fans into playing it with the promise of exploring vast territories. The combat is all wrong, the quests have no life, and its simply difficult to get into let alone grasp how to do anything in. Would not recommend for an Elder Scrolls fan."
Negative,this game has no regional servers for oceanic do not get if you live in NZ or AUS they only have Europe and American and they even have ping problems because of all the outsiders having to use one of the two mega servers because zenimax wants to trick you into thinking the game is alive but is actuality not teaming with players and is slowly dying because players are getting sick of having bad ping and no servers for their regions or other countries. No like just google all the videos showing what players who have put countless of 100 hours into the game have to put up with because zenimax/bethesda is too stingy to make more servers and rather just lie admit they're cheap.in short fuck this mmo play ffxiv instead its 10x better.
Negative,Don't waste your time. Got a brand new Gaming PC and this game wont run properly. Its hitting 100 CPU all the time. I can play any other game with no issue in ultra settings and it runs smoothly. It is only this game with the issue
Negative,Cant even launch anymore. Game is broken.
Negative,Bought the game but can't even install it.
Negative,"Load o' boswollocks.Whatever you do, don't buy it on Steam, there's way to much issues."
Negative,"This game sucks. I paid for it and there are still paywalls! It's not fun, it's not inspired, it's not well-made, and it certainly hasn't been worth my money. And it's not worth yours either. It doesn't feel like an Elder Scrolls game. Not even close. It's just the most bland, boring, uninteresting, and convoluted high-fantasy MMORPG ever produced."
Negative,"Boring, nothing but grind. The entire world offers zero challenge, enemies are not level based/nerfed.Regular maintenance work that causes day long outages - is there SW deployment process really that bad?..seems so."
Negative,"I enjoyed the game and dont want to go any deeper in that topic because I have around 12 hours in it which is not much.The resaon why I dont recomment it is the horrid ""support"" if we can call it that way.After a windows reinstall I tried to log in but forgot my password so I tried to reset. I couldnt so I made contact with the """"""""""""""""""""support"""""""""""""""""""" team.... oh boy.We did some exchange of letters. Maybe 20 times? And all the way they responded me pre-written answers Im sure of it because most of them did not even addressed my complains just told me to reset my password. Which was my main problem.I dont consider myself as a person who is lost on the internet but lets say I screwed up something obvious. But I dont think so. And I think it says something when you google ""elder scrolls online reset password"" keywords and on the first page you dont find answers but see complains about the same situation you have.My experience is that ZeniMax provides the bottom of what is called costumer support so I say keep away from this title."
Negative,"TL;DR- if you have shit internet, you probably wont be able to refund this game, NOT an ELDER SCROLLS game but rather an MMO which uses the elder scrolls universe as a backgroundonce you finished downloading the game, there's an in game launcher which downloads even more and may take a lot of time to finish installing (which is considered in hours played) so if youre not sure whether you'll enjoy this game, be careful cause the installing may take up to 2 hours and even more so you cant refund.i really like the elder scrolls genre, but this game is too much of an mmo for me.IF YOU'RE INTO ELDER SCROLLS BUT NOT INTO MMOS, DONT BUY THIS GAME."
Negative,"EDIT 19 Jun 2018First and second days great.Since Sunday have barely been able to log in.Today, cannot log in at all.Seems it is a continuing problem with STEAM only accounts.DO NOT BUY STEAM VERSION.Create account outside of Steam and buy through other online providers.Once you choose Steam, you cannot swap to ESO account only.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Loaded this 2 days ago and enjoying it.Only 15 hours played so far, so very early.If you have played World of Warcraft, then you pretty much know what to expect.Lots of quest, skills, places to go, type of beasts, things to learn.It will be sometime before I become proficient at even one class.Going to keep playing and see where it leads.Been having issues during typical busy periods of the day.Launcher fails with error -101.When finally get launcher to load, then the game will not connect.Works fine during quiet parts of the day.Oh well, was £7.49 I think, so cheap for an MMO.Might update this as I progress."
Negative,what did they do ? the difference between elder scroll online compared to elder scrolls SKYRIMEldersrolls online it feels like your playing with stick figures where SKYRIM Feels like your part of the game.graphics advertising the game is the best part of the whole game but the game graphics is a real disapointment.
Negative,"I have no problem recommending the game, but I can't recommend buying it through steam. The game is great but all the  login problems I have had (and it's been a few) have been down to steam. Get it through the Bethesda site - it seems to be far more stable. Can someone from Steam or Bethesda answer how on earth are we supposed to do time limited daily challenges when you can't even log in, I am honestly getting to the point where I am going to cancel my subscription."
Negative,"MY GRIPES:1. BUG FEST: Every now and then, you will be kicked from the server due to some faulty bug and none of it is your fault.2. INCONSISTENT SERVERS: Fix your servers please!!! PvP is a laggy mess.3. TERRIBLE SUPPORT: The devs don't care about you. Any ticket will be met with an auto-generated response and ends it at that. They will ignore bugs, say random responses and ignore you completely.There is no game world that is worth all the frustrations coming from a tone deaf developer. This is all a scummy scam.4. PAY WALLS: The world has enough variety to hold your interest. However, if you want  a free or relatively cheap mmorpg, this is not for you. This game is nowhere near a one-stop buy. A ton of content lies behind massive pay walls even after you buy the game.Overall, this mmorpg doesn't give much of a hoot about you. It's a greed driven world out there and you have to pay the price."
Negative,"Server errors, cant be bothered. Uninstalled."
Negative,"Looks like a great game. However mine is bugged, i can get to the first npc, but nothing happens. I usually have to the game off."
Negative,"do not buy if you are trying to connect your eso account to your steam account.if you have a current email address on a different platform, just buy eso on their official site, it saves a lot of hastle."
Negative,"Garbage after update, ghame wont stay open! crashes every 5 mins. dead game now dont wast your time, go play OSRS or something better"
Negative,"I'm not exactly sure how this game has a positive steam rating honestlyCons:       1. Game is not free to play or buy to play if you plan to do more than just    the starter quests your gonna need to sub for the crafting bag. The game    in my opinion is unplayable with out the crafting bag.    2. Quality of life. ZoS has put forth almost 0 effort to make ESO an enjoyable    experience. If it wasn't for community maintained addons ESO imo would be    unplayable.       3. The lag, the janky hooky combat. Everything in the game feels unweighted and    floaty none of your actions really feel like your doing much of anything.    4. No auction house.... ZoS tried to reinvent the wheel with guild traders, centralized    auction houses are good for everyone on the server.    5. No meaningful builds. basically you farm the gear treadmill until you get your     magika / stam zomg op face melt set. Other than that enjoy the rng grind. And    generally when your going for best in slot it is a really really shit rng grind.    6. Locking new players out of crafting until 6 traits are researched per each piece    of gear. It should be 3 or 4 so new players can get into the game and get making     gear for themselves asap.    7. Over powered classes and abilities. There are tons of them at least so everyone    can be op unless you run into someone more op then you then you cry to have them    nerfed. Evidently this trend is easier for Zos to follow than you know just working on    actual game balance.    8. There is soooo much more terrible in this game that I'm leaving out bag space salvaging    poor combat system poor combo system. Really the list just goes on and on for bad with eso.Pros:       1. It looks not too bad really not great not terrible        2. Voice acted quests if this were an offline single player game super cool its not though    its a really crappily slapped together mmo."
Negative,"Not to get into the horrible dev team or direction of the game, but it constantly crashes then it puts you in queue times to log back in even though it's not even busy at the time and then when you get back into the game and try logging in again it logs you out and puts you back in the queue. Completetly unplayable in it's current state"
Negative,"if your not gonna play daily pay a monthly subscription, drop hundreds of dollars and countless hours into it or sell your sell to bethesda then its not worth it. dont waste your money on this"
Negative,this is just bad it makes me just want to play age of conan which is a lot better than this shit like honestly fools and faggots can enjoy this game such a garbage nothing like the elder scrolls morrowind oblivion bhah fucking retards buy and put memberships on have some faith fucking loosers haha
Negative,I forgot the game running to get the update last night and now I can't get my refundhelp:(
Negative,Boring game. Repetitive gameplay.
Negative,A bug filled mess. Not worth picking up over other games for the price.
Negative,They deleted my review
Negative,"combat is a chore, classes are with little or no consequence.give it a try but watch your timer so you can get the refund.Quests are meh. But fully voice acted though."
Negative,too many issues with login and dungeon queues for me to recommend this game.
Negative,Do not buy it on Steam. Very frequent login issues.
Negative,"I cant even play the game it keeps giving me errors when i try to download then halfway through the download it restarts, ive spent 10 plus hours trying to install, i wasted 20 bucks on this thing."
Negative,"Hello,thanks to a mistake I never obtained any code for an expansion of this game although I own it. Ridiculously to write a review for that expansion I need to use it, so now Im commenting from the base game. Through multiple weeks of contacting the support, the final answer was we cant do anything. The support for this game is the worst Ive seen, through them not stating that they cant help me from the beginning. Dont buy this game/expansion if you want a gurantee that you will obtain it. I would not recommend buying any thing from this greedy company."
Negative,"Okay, game has some potential. But from technical point of view it's total disaster. 1) Srsly, you can't play without modes, because game doesn't have minimal quality of UX for player. 2) From 24 october I litteraly can't play because of droping and errors on login. 3) This prices is just stupid and they create content in way that you pushed to buy it. Elsweyr chapter not really Elsweyr, it's just a part of this location. Next addon will continue plot, but you should pay 2000 crones, nice one. But, I think it's better to spent those money on Gears 5 with such price, standalone game and not stupid dlc.4) In general quality of game is bad. Game doesn't know what is multithreading is. Lags and slow loading. A lot of bugs. 5) Zenimax Online Studios don't really understand how to create mmo games, they don't understand how balance working and etc, they just drop huge changes every patch, and looking how it's working, with 0 analysis(CDProject RED style GWENT style). Game litteraly saying, FU AND GIVE ME MONEY FOR PIECE OF BAD STORY TELLING.Thanks, but i'm done."
Negative,"I have seen many reviews across the internet proclaiming this game as a solid MMO that spins the genre on it's head. I have to disagree and find that it doesn't bring anything new and worthwhile to the MMO genre. I personally usually dislike MMOs because I find the grindy gameplay and combat to both be shallow most of the time. I hoped that after reading reviews and watching videos that I could finally find an MMO I could enjoy. Unforutunately, this is not the one for me. If you're like me generally dislike MMOs and want to try this because this might ""be the one"", don't get your hopes up. If you like MMOS, maybe you will like this one. Personally, I cannot recommend it."
Negative,"everything oke, its just.. the graphic doesnt like what i expected .."
Negative,It didn't really feel like Elder Scrolls.
Negative,i do not recommend this game
Negative,It's so bad. I'd rather play skyrim again than this shit.
Negative,"this game is buggy, can't play for more then 10 min before i crashes to log on screen."
Negative,"I've tried to get into ESO several times with different characters.  Including a few in the beta.  I have yet to get more than a few levels into it.  Maybe things suddenly change a dozen levels in but I don't see it.  The early game in ESO is boring, soul-less and bland.  Every time I try to give it another shot I feel like I'm wasting my evening.  For a game that doesn't end, I'm not going to waste more time playing boring content on the off-chance that I might like it better later."
Negative,"I wouldn't recommend this game TO elder scrolls fans. It just doesn't have the same feel. It's just not the same vein as other elder scrolls games and there's a lot of elements of it being online I don't like. Now, compared to other MMOs, I can't rate it, as the only MMO's Ive played in the last two decades are UO (old and irreleveant) Star Wars the old republic and the star wars MMO that got cancelled. One thing SWTOR had this doesn't is instanced quests. This game you goto a dungeon to do a quest and half the time every enemy between you and the boss is dead because 4 people just ran thru it ahead of you. It's nice in a sense that you get help from others, but it also makes leveling harder when you can't battle shit your meant to. Overall, I'd give this game 3/5 rating, but I prefer EVERY elder scrolls game back to Morrowind over this, including Oblivion (while some love that game, I wasn't big on it)It's missing so many elder scrolls aspects. No classes of magic, no illusion magic, no conjuration. Spellcasting is totally revamped to resemlbe Star Wars the old republic, you get a quickbar with 5 skills, I can't stand it. There's no player housing, supposedly it's coming, but I'm sure it'll require  monthly sub or $40 worth of crown points to get.All in all, I don't have a good sense of MMOs, but I prefer SWTOR to this as far as gameplay goes, but I play this BECAUSE it's elder scrolls and ONLY because of that. I don't recommend this game to fans of the elder scrolls series. If you were really into that series, this game would be worth it if you manage to snag a cheap copy on sale and don't pay subscription, but only to check it out."
Negative,"MMO not my thing. Seems to be grind for sake of grind, and daily rewards nonsense"
Negative,no just no
Negative,Meh.It's a boring version of Skyrim basically.
Negative,pure boring game
Negative,"Expected it to have good graphics, thought they would be based on the ads, I have a really expensive computer so i know that its not the problem, disappointed."
Negative,Garbo play Dark Souls instead
Negative,Unable to create account. Tried password reset just in case i have created account long ago. DID NOT WORK. Requested refund.
Negative,Unplayable. Screen just spins constantly
Negative,Wallet destroyer and pay 2 win well made to not let you see it is actually one. Payable content is unbanlanced as feck! it's a minor and major bonuses system and payable content provide you major bonuses and advantages you can't get anywhere else in the game but by real money. Same for ultimates completly broken for $$$ classes.Full of bugs and cheaters. very easy to cheat as there is no protection.Waste of time and money. Only efforts devs are doing is on the shop. this thing have a bug it is corrected in less than 24h but some other bugs in the game are here since lunch.... means nearly 10 years90% of new content is rework textures and models from past not even original work. Lore seems great on the big lines but actually exeption of one or two stories are lame and boring and most of quest sounds the same.New features are mostly  bad copy from other MMORPG ideas to try to attract your wallet. Let's be honest: Deleted this game from my library for ever is one of the best thing i did in my life
Negative,"I love this game. Seriously. Maybe because it's the first MMORPG I've ever played.. No idea.But the open world is great, endless quests are also great and all those possibilities...What really does p*** me off though is that at least 40% of my in-game time is wasted time. Like I get kicked out literally all the flipping time. It does not matter if I use Wifi or lan... (It's not my connection, every other online game just works fine) This issue has been out there for years. I found 'help threads' from like 3 years ago... Needless to say they weren't really helpful.I'd love to recommend this game, but it's so time consuming and annoying - not playable due to these server issues...And I have not even started talking about the recent changes..."
Negative,good game but extremely game-breakingly buggyupdate: I've reinstalled the game after about a month after uninstalling it and it seems to be working okay.
Negative,"The skill pathways are too linear, it makes this game boring..."
Negative,"Bought this game with the greymoore pack, it included Elsywyr and Morrowind DLC. They don't list it in the shop, but after you download the game thats 90 GB big, theres another 30gb update afterwards, expect this game to take up 130GB with the DLC I have listed. Than, as you can see there is a ""Buy crowns"" option, ontop of an ESO plus membership that you can get as little as $140 dollars a year, thats, ontop of a $60 dollar base game, that eventually was dropepd down to $20, I picked it up plus greymoore DLC for $8 (Base game) plus greymoor for ($13) Now, what I was saying about the crowns shop. To buy the rest of the DLC to date, it's going to cost you ANOTHER $248 Dollars, If you were to buy this game at full price - which by the time you read this. the sale will likely be over... It's going to cost you $20 (Base game) + Greymoor for $40, we're now at $60, Plus $248 dollars. which leaves you with 4k crowns, enough to buy a small house with no furnishings for yourself, or maybe a pet to follow you around in order to have full access to the map and its chapters. If your planning on buying this game for $20, be forewarned theres a casual $308 IN DLC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not including your local tax. Mines at 9%, I'm far too pissed off at feeling like I got a partial game to do that math for you... Really bethesda? After putting fallout 4 to shame and making people pay money for community mods, mods you didn't even create? your going to again take something people love and try to milk every bit you can out of us? This was supposed to be a game I could play for years, and return to... but instead a ESO plus membership would cost me $180 a year, if I wanted to buy the DLC and a membership I'd be throwing $480 dollars ontop of a game I already paid $60 dollars for? YOU REALLY DID IT!!!! YOU ACTUALLY TOPPED THE PRICE OF SIMS 4 AND ALL THE DLC!!!  Is this game worth $540 dollars to you?Zenimax Studios, is the parent company of Bethesda, Zenimax studios was recently aquired by Microsoft. So you can inadvertently thank Microsoft for this game being the equivelent of $540 dollars, with 15 million copies sold... These companies have pulled in at least $900,000,000 not including any DLC purchased from anybody. Did you know the videogame industry makes more money than the music industry and the movie industry, COMBINED? Love spending my money for 10% of the game. *slow claps* I think I'm done with anything that comes from Bethesda aka Zenimax aka Microsoft."
Negative,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO ANYTHING! ITS CLUNKY, IT GIVES YOU SHIT GEAR, AND IT PLAYS AND LOOKS LIKE ASS! WOULD NOT SUGGEST BUYING."
Negative,Crap game. I get stuck at Naryu the moment I land in the game. Wow is far more easy to play.
Negative,I bought this game a few years ago and a few days ago I purchased the new DLC then when I tried to play the game I had to install the original game AGAIN then the update which didn't work and caused many problems to my pc and I still can't install it it keeps pausing. I wouldn't recommend this game to my worst enemy.
Negative,"ESO is a great, long-term MMORPG when it decides to work. Otherwise, you will be FIGHTING the latency. I can hop on any other game and not experience latency issues, but the moment I step into ESO, that smooth 90< ping turns into a tug of war from the mids of 250, to well over 999+. Casting skills or fast attacks is a drag and I'm losing more battles to NPC's because I wasn't able to dodge an attack while rubberbanding."
Negative,"this game has a glitch where after I completed a quest on divine restoration. It glitches out where I cannot talk to clavicous vile. Because of this I have to start part of the quest all over again. The combat system in this game makes it really boring to play. Some people said that this game's combat system is more flexible than dark soul's combat system, but I prefer dark soul's combat system better than this."
Negative,"I cant recommend the game, since I have played for maybe an hour. Shows 24 hours play time, but thats from the game installing. Got 12 hours of install time (play time) last night installing a 40 plus gig patch or maybe it was the whole game again... So if you bug me to review then this is what you get since I have not really been able to play. I wanted to try the game last night but that did not happen. Why does the game count time as played when the launcher is sitting opened or updating?"
Negative,just straight up bad too unfun to even play an hour
Negative,It's an abusive ex that you think is worth the time and every time you regret going back to it.
Negative,"Well i had so much hope for this game, But to be hoenst, the only thing i want now is a refund.WORST GAME ever made."
Negative,"just loads and loads. can rarely get to launvh properly. when it does, the game is just dull and grindy. lacks immersion"
Negative,If you like to play game that cost money up front and the every week then have at it.
Negative,"Just bought eso on steam (have on bethesda store, but wanted in steam - keeps things tidier) however, after linking accounts, my Nord templar is now a  wood elf. this happened to anyone before? I've got all the same skills and stats. just my skin is wrongI gave it the thumbs down, not because i don't like the game - i love it:) just having a bad experience with the steam version. Please help... anyone..."
Negative,"This game combat is really bad, there is too many skills for the bar you have and every attack feel week and empty, This is more a Social MMO then a story MMO or a gameplay MMO. I don't think this is a Good MMO, this is Bethesda and they are in the same category of EA, Cash Grab with a sh*t tons of Microtransaction AND EVERYTHING is locked behind a paywall. They manage to pull it off with an MMO where the modders make their game playable as always, you will rely on Mods/Addons to help you farming and other stuff like fixing their UI or see the damage you do, all that is suppose to be in-game from the beginning. Bethesda = Lazy Devs. Every 2 or 3 years you have to do a Quality of life improvement on your MMO but Zenimax didn't do a single one since the launch so you are playing that same old crap since day one and it will never get better, so no point coming back to this game even after 2 or 3 years. The Writing of ESO is poor and you will not feel the need to pursue the story or going forward with it. It's like all the Elder Scrolls game they all feel dead inside and they are forcing story that you don't are appealed to it on you. EVERYTHING you need to know about this game and devs are right there in front of you they re released Skyrim 5 or 6 times to be able to squeeze the maximum money they can from people, and let's be honest, Skyrim is a pretty bad game at that so...PLEASE if you want to play an MMO go on Guild Wars 2 where everything is better. With GW2 you pay once and you get all the content, you don't have to pay a premium monthly fee to have access to stuff and you don't have to buy EVERY single thing you need to advance. AND GW2 main story is free. With the release of GW2 on Steam the devs have made a HUGE Quality of life update and the game is EVEN better then before."
Negative,"This is not a good game. I don't want to be overly dismissive - there's a lot of good content here: it's beutiful, the characters (not the quests, the characters) are well written, and the combat is engaging (even if, in the end, it doesn't affect much to go from ""tab-targeting"" to ""location-based"" in PvE). That's about all the good though: the quests invariably consist of ""follow map icon to key point/person/item, press E, follow map icon..."" there's absolutely no thinking, no way to mess anything up (seriously: major heists that could use cool stealth/jump mechanics just turn into talk to servant, get drug, drug guard, get item). It becomes a bit insulting after 30 minutes or so. And then the MMO part? Not well managed becuase nothing is instanced. Turning off world-threatening devices is less awe-inspiring when 5 strangers are doing it with you. It just makes no sense and turns the game into a ""lets press E here and get to the next point even more"". Then add in 20-30 people doing the same thing at the same time for a super-low enemy saturation: so you rarely have to/get to fight becuase everything is killed by others.  Nothing seems epic or even notable. Quests should not feel like grinding, but ESO somehow pulled that off (though the characters are, as I said good).Also, everyone seems super-exited about theft. Every time you go to a town you see 3-4 people stealing. Can you report them? No. Can you do anything? No. It's a fine SP mechanic transplanted to an MMO. In short, this feels like a Diablo 2 (for really simple quests) mixed with Elder Scrolls view/combat - and the servers are overcrowded.  It would be an okay Single Player game, but the game crams too many players into zones without making anyone feel like its a joint effort."
Negative,I can seem to buy my ESO PLUS membership...... WTF? And i have been trying for an hour to get it... even though i have a membership on my PS4. i was hoping to play on PC and steam but i see it easier and cheaper playing on PS4
Negative,"Garbage. how is this exactly an Elder Scrolls game? In the way it's zero effort like the 10,000 skyrim remakes. 11 hours and I've been asleep for most of that because this is boring as fuck. Super immersive being forced to run dungeons with xxxDick0Tits12 or some shit.And whats this new garbage fucking intro? Cool, give me 10,000 bull shit side quests before I have any starting gear. DONT FUCKING CARE YETLiterally stick any DND setting or high fantasy setting name on here and this is indistinguishable from any other shitty $2 chinese mmo.Oh feel free to tell me about your stealth archer build. No ones done that before. Poison? WHAT?! CRAZY!This is like playing elder scrolls with your friends the same way putting your head in a blender is putting on rouge."
Negative,"I wish I could give this a middle of the road review. The game isn't for me, but it isn't necessarily bad either.The good: Elder Scrolls theming. Play as your favourite races from the single player games. Play in lands that you recognize from those games. The bad:The damned compass. It's distracting and turns an open world of exploration into a game of follow the arrow. The combat. Use an attack and have your attack animation be nowhere near your target. And you still hit it. Or vice versa. Thought I  dodged an enemy attack. Nope. Even though I was 15 meters away when the attack animation swung through where I used to be, I still took the damage.The meh:Buy to play. But if you want more inventory for crafting you'll really want to pay the subscription fee anyway.Bottomline: The theme wasn't enough to save it for me. I just wasn't having fun."
Negative,"It's laggy, full of horrible bugs and now they're running weird tests that completely take the fun out of the game. Not worth it any longer!"
Negative,Zero hours of actual play.  76 hours of downloading......
Negative,It just can't hold my attention....
Negative,"wished i'd saved my money as I already had the good mmos (bdo, ff14, vindictus etc)If you like generic play eso"
Negative,"It freezes, crashes, disconnects and logs me out. Sometimes it can be laggy from the high ping. Kinda boring too"
Negative,Feels extremely outdated. Gameplay is kinda boring and animations are rough.
Negative,"A better choice would be WOW, if you can pay for the sub or if you can grind enough.Or if you want a one time purchase then BDO.Or a free one is Albion Online.This game tries to do what all of those game do very well, and it fails."
Negative,"This game is not going to be for everyone, I tried it and I dint like it. I just couldn't get sucked into the world because...well it's just so damn boring after a while. The story is good don't get me wrong but the gameplay is jut bland. You're pretty much just adventuring doing mini quest if your not on the main quest and it's hella boring. If you're thinking stealth and exploration like the non mmo elder scrolls games or facry or something then your wrong. It's insanely boring and you really need other people/friends to play with to make it enjoyable. The class system is decent but it still sucks imo but what can you do. You have your mage (dont remember), warrior/dps (dragonknight), tank/healer (paladin), and hunter/rogue (nightblade). The thing is though you can turn any of them into other classes you just won't be as baddass as say a mage would be if you did go mage. Like for example, if you chose to go staves with a rogue, use light armor and use his skill tree of magic, well, you can do it but I don't know if it's viable to play like that. I'm not sure about the higher levels since I got to about lvl 10 so maybe other experienced players might see it different late game but from what I saw everyone was the same when it came to gear and skills despite the many options of playing the character. I'll break it down better if you cant understand. You can pick any of the classes I mentioned above, wear any armor and weild any weapon. You have 3 skill trees for your specific class, you have weapon skills and armor skills that are the same no matter what class you pick and your skills increase as you use your equipped weapons/armor or if you have weapon skills or class skills equipped on your hot key bar...which is only about 5 keys. You have to put points into crafting if you want to lvl them up so if you have to make that decision of putting points in your armor style or weapon style vs. crafting/gathering you'd most likely pick skills that keep you alive and give you damage early game...There are plenty of MMO's out there and for this being a pay to play it's just not that impressive to me but maybe it is for you, who knows, T&P (taste and preference) right. Straight to the point, I wouldn't recoment this game to any of my friends and if I had to give it a score it would be a 6/10 for me."
Negative,"It's a good MMO... if you live in the right place I guess.I get ping 210 to over 2000(!!) in game, without any consistancy, changing constantly. Battlenet didnt help despite giving 162 ping to Texas. Checking online, it seems this is both a common problem and a long term one, so is very unlikely to ever be addressed. (I download from Steam at a steady 7.4mb/s btw and can play any other mmo without issue)."
Negative,Very low dps people
Negative,FUCKIN DOESNT WORK SAYS UNABLE TO LAUNCH MISSING EXECUATABLE AND I DELETED THE FOLDERS STeAM SUUpPORT TOLD Me TO RESTARTED MY PC LIKE IT TOLD ME TO AND StILL DOESNT WORK PIECE OF SHIT GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!
Negative,Buy this game from the site not here on steam. It's a pain to play since the launcher doesn't want to load time to time. Not worth it.
Negative,Im sorry but i love skyrim and the games before that and the mmo is great but the class are the werst the mage class is to over powered this is shit do not buy if you want to be the biggest jerk and and go mage.
Negative,i baught salamender pack last week and started playing 2 days ago for the adventure any way i recived in my game mail the pet salamander and gold parchement only  and no 1500 crowns i need help to get them bcz the pack dont support refund
Negative,"I tried liking the game, I really did. The game is a glitch, it never was a game. The UI is bad, it glitches a lot, etc. The pvp? Not fun when you can't cast spells because the servers cant take it. You fall out of the world constantly, players instakill you with abilities, isn't balanced at all and so on. I haven't done much PVE. I guess PVE part could be alright, if your UI doesn't glitch and you are unable to use a potion/cast a spell/move/interact with NPCS/fast travel/etc... I played in the beta, quit. Came back recently for two months, still as bad as in beta. 3/10 Needs many fixes."
Negative,Bought this game a while back.  Saw the free weekend so I decided to download it and sync to my old account.  It was fun.  I actually thought I could get back into it.  Then the free weekend ended.  And even though I synced the account for a game I already purchased and payed a monthly fee for... Yep! They want me to buy it again.  NOPE NOPE NOPE!
Negative,"I had originally reviewed this game with a TON of praise, but I do believe I spoke far too quickly. I think I played obsessively for a month, and then as soon as I bought the ESO membership, there was SO much boring, repetitive content that playing began to feel like a chore. Like, I had to play simply because I had spent the money. I don't mind the grind, I'm an OSRS qween, but... this grind didn't feel satisfying at all. I wanted a Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim experience, something I could come back to over and over again to find something new and interesting... this just wasn't it for me. Every quest began to feel the same. Go here, fetch item, return to NPC. There weren't very many interesting world encounters, combat was laughably easy, and while this game is multiplayer, I would definitely not call it ""massively"" multiplayer; it was very difficult to find others playing the game to engage with. I feel like Crowns are shoved in my face constantly. I get there is going to be purchasable in-game currency in modern gaming, and since fashion is my end-game always, I don't mind spending a few bucks here and there. [Please don't look at how many times ""Love Nikki"" appears on my bank statement.] But jeez, just to get any cool equipment, to have any worthwhile storage space, you need crowns and membership. The Crowns I got with my monthly membership were very rarely ever enough to buy even one thing! Most things were priced just above the monthly allotment, meaning you would need to spend even more to get the item you really want. Or, save up 'til next month's allowance and hope the item is still there. And with the crafting material storage restriction for F2P? Something feels icky about purchasing a game and then having to pay more for features that realistically should be included in the base game I purchased. In what other game, besides a *free* MMORPG, would I have to pay more to have access to reasonable amounts of storage space for my CRAFTING MATERIALS? I'm sorry, that's insane and greedy. I read reviews noting the storage issue and thought it was harsh and whiny, but after playing with a membership, I think this game would be literally unplayable without it. I feel awful leaving everything so negative though, especially for a beloved franchise. So, as an Elder Scrolls historian, I do love all the lore that ESO has given us. <3 To sum it up, I would say: this game looks pretty and polished, and I'm glad it exists for lore purposes, but spending any significant amount of time playing really cracks open how much of a grind the game is. There is so little fresh content to consume UNLESS you are willing to pay irrational amounts of money. The experience you get with this game seems to be directly correlated to how much money you spend on it."
Negative,"Very poor combat. Watch a 1v1 duel on Youtube of ESO and compare it to other games like WoW, GW2, TERA or newer games like New World and it's night in day. In ESO with the animation cancelling and constant weapon swapping for 'maintenence buffs and dots' it looks absolutely silly. Poor animations with little impact or connection is already bad enough without the cancelling. Basically looks like 2 characters flapping their hands around while a bunch of glowing artifacts shoot everywhere. Those other games range from mediocre to great, but one thing they all have in common is it actually looks like weapons are making contact with the opponent.Also extremely poor class fantasy. I can't be a greatsword archetype because the 'class' abilities do not go through your equipped weapon. Instead you will have to summon a magical sword, spear, or every ability shoots lava and fire everywhere for a single attack, then your greatsword magically appears again. Probably the only RPG I've ever played where I can't just be a greatsword or sword and board class and thats it. I don't want to play a sword and board character that lights itself on fire, or summons a magical spear. Class abilities should go through your equipped weapons.Weapon swapping system is very bad it just leads to carrying a second weapon for maintenance abilities like dots or buffs. You should share cooldowns with the other weapon like Souls, or have access to both hotbars all the time, or pick and chose x number of abilities from 2 different weapons for more customization.Daily login rewards are also stupid. My friend started playing with me excited to cook food for us, then on day 7 we got a bunch of purple food for doing nothing but logging in. This purple food was better than anything she could cook for a LONG time. So it basically invalidaded all the food she could craft. I suppose crafting in this game is just a bunch of pointless trash until you get to 'max level' then it's just a means to some min/max checklist item you need.Party size also very small, means there can never be any interesting classes like buffers or controllers.Really bad RPG elements, very disappointing from both an Elder Scrolls and MMORPG perspective."
Negative,massive money grab. u would assume its ea who made this
Negative,Need 167GB of free space...I need space for porns
Negative,you have to pay subscrition!!!!!!!
Negative,dlc should not be worth a small new game's worth every year
Negative,"Tried playing during free ""weekend"".Too much trouble. Game installer runs, then launcher won't work. I have to browse the game files to find ESO.exe. I run that, and the game runs, but then there's no integrated account-creator? No thanks.Probably for the best. I really didn't want to get involved with this money sink."
Negative,"As I played Elder Scrolls Online, I couldn't help but notice its resemblance to another MMORPG that is free to play - Guild Wars 2. As I played ESO, I continually found similarities between the two. However, in most every way ESO just made me want to play Guild Wars 2. So I did. And I'm no GW2 fanboy.I have my gripes about GW2, but here's a rundown of the most common MMORPG elements and how they stack up. Story? GW2 - their personal story is unique, meaningful, has the ability to be influenced by player decisions, and fills in the gaps of the world. Gathering? I might give a slight edge to ESO simply due to the reagents required to harvest in GW2. Professions & Crafting? GW2 has tons more potential with its Legendary crafting materials. Combat? GW2 is far superior due to it feeling more fluid and responsive. Questing? Both are a bit dull, but due to the improved UI and POI of GW2, I'm giving this one to GW2. PvP? Both are just okay, but GW2 has more time under its belt and has had time for more tweaking and improvements. Large-scale PvP? GW2 due to it's world vs. world battles. User Interface? GW2 in a landslide. I'm shocked at how ESO's UI is so terrible even years after initial release and a community of UI mods. Economy and market? Very strongly GW2. Dungeons and Raids? GW2 by a slight margin on dungeons. Raids more so. Real-money store? GW2 in another landslide. The list goes on...If you play ESO and are hoping for something a bit more polished, definitely give Guild Wars 2 a try. If you've  played both and prefer ESO, I'm curious to know what keeps you in ESO."
Negative,"I can't recommend this game for the following reasons:1. Poor performance on all platforms. Performance gets worse with every update. ZOS acknowledges there are issues with performance and claims "" it can't be fixed over night"". Why not? You broke it in a single patch. Unbreak it. 2. Persistent bugs that take years to fix if  they even bother. 3. They continue to pump out new content regularly focusing on selling us the next thing, while not fixing any of the performance issues or bugs. 4. They actually introduce things into the game that makes gameplay worse and the player base hates, but they ignore the players . A recent example of this is the introduction of transmute crystals as dungeon daily rewards which led to a more toxic dungeon environment. 5. The crown( premium currency) store is like  dealing with a used car salesman. They are constantly doing limited time only  and exclusives on everything. Everything is overpriced and i can't ever buy what i want when i want because its never available for sale when i want it. 6. Their official forums  are the most restrictive of any forum in any gaming community i have ever been part of. They constantly edit peoples posts and ban people for comments that are not even small infractions in other game communities. This leads to a very narrowminded view  on the forums that makes it hard to have intelligent debates on issues with the game. Not that the devs care about anything said to improve their game anyway. They just pump out content to claim more cash from your wallet. 7. The game has no sense of progression or classes. IF you take a TES game and a MMORPG and mash them together but only keep the bad parts of each that is what you got in ESO.  Classes are bland and every class can do every role at least very good is not exceptionally well. Any class can use any weapons or armor and be part of any NPC guilds. I can slot a  taunt and a couple of heals on my backbar and suddenly i can play all 3 roles well. 8. We were promised some changes to the level system about 2 years ago when they stopped adding CP. The CP system is absolutely terrible but we have been stuck in limbo with this fake ""veteran style""  level system.  9. I have a lot of hours over many years in this game, despite promises of it getting better and improving core gameplay( rather than just give us more shinies to chase) it has only got worse in core areas which are woefully neglected. 10. The combat system is pretty terrible. No cooldowns on abilities  and many abilities have short buffs tied to them mean constant button mashing with no ability queuing makes for some annoying fights especially with the random lag spikes. 11. PVP is also terrible. PVP was just tossed in the game  so they could check that box to draw customers. Cyro( open world PVP) is plagued by performance issues and severe desyncs. The zone is huge so you spend a lot of time traveling. We call it Horse Simulator Online. None of the gear or abilities are balanced for PVP, which results in one class or combination of gear and class to be drastically overpowered. The poor matching system for battlegrounds  PVP results in very unbalanced fights that result in one group farming other groups. The battlegrounds themselves are very unimaginative and basically reskins( they like to reskin everything and pass it off as new/different) of each other with few differences. 12. Rather than create a happy player experience, they try to frustrate you into making purchases like a P2W game. For example if you want to do any type of serious crafting you are going to either need the sub for the craft bag or spend time playing inventory management online. Bank space is also very limited, many currencies have  pointless limits on them and best off all they sell you these $100 plus huge homes but the furnishing limit is so low  you can only decorate a portion of the home. They refuse to address the issue even though there are multiple ways it could be addressed but they still bring out more and more $100 plus homes. I could keep going  but lets face it your probably going to  buy the game anyway, so you can see for yourself."
Negative,"Remember dial up? Probably not. Remember AOL CD's in the mail, so many you used them as coasters? Probably not. But that's OK youngling's, you too can experience blazing fast multiplayer content just as good or maybe even worse!! as a 56k modem. Now just do this, Buy your fastest internet package in your area. Remember to hardwire! Log into the ""End game"" pvp zone, lower every setting you have to potato, and enjoy countless hours of unplayable lag, disconnects that happen so often you can predict them, and skills that wont trigger until you patiently wait 5 to 10 seconds!Now don't despair.After visiting ZOS HQ in the back of my local Arby's they assured me the duct tape and bailing wire on the ""mega"" server were just hotfixes and the next patch would roll out the juicy fruit bubblegum.Now if you know bubblegum, Juicy fruit is the one you want for server upkeep.So dont can your Greymoor pre-order just yet, give them under 2 hours of play time then hit them with a refund.Cause kido's when you refund Uncle Todd and his ZOS goons they lose their lunch money while Lord Gaben keeps his."
Negative,"Its pretty pay to win..inventory management is a pain in the ass if you dont have the crafting bag, which you NEED eso plus to have. 14.00 a month when I already paid about $20 to buy the game. No thanks, Id rather play Guild wars."
Negative,"Required a hefty overnight install, and another 90gb worth of update download before I was able to play.Manged to eventually crash a reasonably modern specced computer, after crashing itself over five times within an hour.Nothing about this game is particularly intuitive in regards to its GUI.The microtransactions are wildly egregious.And to top it all off, it belongs to Bethesda, with their long history of consumer abuse and internal workplace abuse.I bought this game ten years+ ago and have barely managed to play 3+ hours of it."
Negative,"Really Bethesda, predatory marketing? People have to buy dlcs that they should have gotten in their planand you sell consumers data.You guys suck."
Negative,holy shit this is just like Fallout 76
Negative,it just gets really boring...even thou i put in 320 hours on skyrim.
Negative,I guess I have just grown too old to like mmos
Negative,"I used to play Elder Scroll V Skyrim, and I enjoyed it. For this game, however, it is not that enjoyable. I played till level 35 and quitted. There is a very limited choice of skills, because every time you can equip 5+1(ultra) skills only. I saw that there are a lot of skills for players to learn, but the 5+1 skill limit makes this somewhat meaningless. Also the team PVP games are not very good...... I felt I couldn't control my character smoothly. I did play another MMORPG World of Warcraft and the PVP feeling was much better. And the PVE dungeons so far I played were not impressive. I think the screenshots shown in STEAM are more impressive than the actual game."
Negative,"Change the safebox lead of oakensoul ring, one of the most stupid design in mmo history and whoever's idea behind this needs to be fired."
Negative,For more than a year I m struggling with support with a Character loading issue. No help what so ever. No Login .. no play.
Negative,"Never felt like the classes matter much since every one winds up using the same skill lines. Everything scales so you will never feel powerful while leveling. I wanted to like this, sunk 88 hours into it before I formed an opinion. This game just made me reinstall Skyrim SE and mod the hell out of it. Medicore single player and multi drag out what could be so much more."
Negative,"dont buy this game, ive got CP630 in 3 weeks by doing skyreach catacomb."
Negative,i love hoarding
Negative,IM done with Triple A games These Companys can all go fck themselves Greedy fcking cnts
Negative,"Good game. However price is too high for that content. If you like to run single player quests then its definitely worth it. Game graphics is very old and you have to deal with loading screen even if you just entering a house. After purchasing game you still have to donate and use subscription for comfortable game. Need to add multiple addons to have comfortable gameplay, game often crashing during Alt+tab. Before ESO i have played BDO and all time comparing those games. Graphics, game controls, gathering, open pvp is not at the same level. ESO is a great product to be as F2P but definitelly not 50$ worth."
Negative,"RIP ESOCurrently the ""Elder Scrolls Online Standard Edition"" does not work for Steam and the ESO Support is not able to fix this (Fails to download and link launcher to steam). It appears this issue was introduced in 2020 and still persists. This tells me the the ESO team is not supporting the application and just riding this out with minimal to no support until it dies. Much to my disappointment it looks like ESO 2 will not come to fruition either per the game’s Creative Director, Rich Lambert."
Negative,"After multiple downloads the launcher keeps giving me the same error to extract the launcher/installer on a different drive, but doesn't even give me the option to select one of my other drives. This means I cannot install the other updates, which are needed outside of Steam, to launch the actual game.Unless I find a fix, I'm keeping this as a negative, as the game doesn't seem to work for me."
Negative,"This company plagiarized a tabletop adventure by Ben Heisler and steals fan made artwork and uses it for promotional purposes or even sells them on their Crown store for real money.Triple AAA gaming right herehttps://www.pcgamesn.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-elsweyr-the-black-roadhttps://www.tumblr.com/relan-daevath/714132763526217728/hm-well-i-am-a-bit-shocked-19-jule-2020-iEdit: asking for permission or giving credit AFTER THE FACT, doesn't make it any better"
Negative,"I used the small amount of free premium currency that comes with the game to buy an item in the premium shop called a ""storage chest."" When I installed it in my house, I was pretty surprised to learn that it... didn't store items. It was just a decoration, because monetization means that we can't build goodwill with players by including QOL features. We have to get them addicted to hoarding stuff by showering them with a dozen currencies and thousands of crafting items, and THEN we charge them for QOL features, like storage.Edit after a few more hours. First, it took me a long time to realize that ESO/Zenimax Online responded to my complaint. Class act, can't blame them. After going back into the game, it seemed like I did purchase something that was meant to be a cosmetic-only storage chest, but I guess I missed the marking that clearly showed it as cosmetic. That's on me, I guess, though it does seem to be marked more clearly now. I remember feeling indignant as all hell, like what they sold me was borderline false advertising. Anyway, this lets me talk about the thing that really bugs me about this game- the cash shop. My god, is it enormous. There's just so much content locked behing that cash shop, and a huge amount of it is not cosmetic. There are expansions, crafting materials, XP boosters, outifts  of course, combat mounts, NPCs who make your game easier by adding stuff. It's honestly staggering, and it really turns me off. A game that charges you to play it, then charges for additional content drops or asks for a monthly subscription that also has additional thousands upon thousands you can spend on game items? I don't get it, but then again maybe I just don't get MMOs, because it seems like most of the active playerbase in ESO is just ok with this. Maybe there's a hidden way to get some of the cash shop items and the game is just too dense for me to realize that? Definite possibility. So beyond the cash shop, look: there's a lot of game here, and I mean a LOT. I don't know if I'll ever complete the main quest, though. Mainly because picking items up becomes increasingly arduous as you progress. The storage space is just really limited, and increasing that storage space is both tedious and expensive. There are all these tricks for jumping into ESO+ on a free weekend, dumping your crafting mats into the free crafting bag, then leaving them there for eternity. But you can only withdraw items once the free ESO+ weekend is up, you can't add items. Like... what the heck is that? That's crazy. It's just a shame that you can't enjoy this thing for the always evolving ESO game it is, that everywhere you look you're funneled into the cash shop or a subscription. I played Fallout 76 for a few hours and now I know where it got its monetization model: ESO. If you like Skyrim or the other TES titles and you want to give it a try... I guess grab it when it's basically free and poke around, accepting that despite the fact you bought this game, it's mostly still inaccessible. Or just... ya know don't, just reinstall one of the older games and go nuts with mods. I just can't recommend this."
Negative,"gonna be honest, its the elder scrolls, with lots of micropayments... you wanna have new perks and ksills for assasin? Get our dlc for 15Bucks, to get certain dungeons/quests/perks you need to buy different ""DLC's"" where you ofc have 2 in-game DLC's sommerset and elsweyr (coming june-ish). Big nono, they want me to pay 100$ for base game with DLC's plus 300$ for side quests, and class perks? What the fuck NO"
Negative,"There isn't much wrong with the game play, but its sad to say that it is now out of date.The game needs a graphical update. The art style has not aged well and so the visual fidelity does not compare to other games on the market, I would play this game if it was more aesthetically pleasing."
Negative,quest match up sucks sometimes waiting 40+ min
Negative,I got permabanned for making an LGBT joke
Negative,Good Luck finding a server or just being able to play.
Negative,Like the other negative reviews say. Don't buy this from Steam. It won't work.
Negative,It just made me want to go play Skyrim or Fallout 4.
Negative,Waste of money
Negative,I honestly don't know how you managed to make a Elder Scrolls title this boring. I feel as though a text based game would have been far more entertaining. Balthezda plez just do Elden scrollz segs!
Negative,"Was hooked in based on experience from other Elder Scrolls games and some pretty reviews, but after less than 24 hours playtime, my wife and I very quickly discovered that you could succeed in this game suffering from Catatonia.It's just, staggeringly, unbearably, painfully EASY to do everything.MMOs just make me sad now."
Negative,"Classic Bethesda right here. Dont even know their own lore. Molag Ball Invades Tamriel? The Imperial City a free for all zone? A Redguard can be part of the Aldmeri Dominion?? What... where was this in all the lore books. For christ sake the dragons returning to Tamriel was the whole big plot of Skyrim! This game is just a cash grab with no respect for the lore that they themselves created. If you want a good MMO play WoW classic or even SWTOR. If you want a good Elder Scrolls, play any other ES game. Any fan of this series will be dissapointed."
Negative,"Game launcher has no Font adjustment, have to sit 10 inches from screen to read it. Once game launches, I get instant server time outs when logging into account. Screen ui is incredibly small and there is no ui scaling in settings. Forum solutions date back to 2017 and point to a settings option that no longer exists. I play on a 4k 42 inch monitor."
Negative,"Game is pay to win oriented and if you pay more, your character can be more powerful and so. And there are some glitched in game, i wait 20 minutes for cyrodiil quest queue and when i was in it, it bugged to login screen and did not reconnect. Not very good game for me, main quest stuck at some point and tell you to do something with a spesific name which has no meaning unless you look it up on google how to do that quest is just stupid in the end. It was not a good experience for me, nor a happy one."
Negative,"Don't pay anything more than the 20$ buy-in price. ESO Plus and the expansions are simply not worth it. The dialogue is sleep inducing. The crafting is incredibly tedious by design in order to get you to buy ESO Plus to get the crafting bag. Almost half (2/6) of the classes are locked off until you can buy them individually with crowns and most of the game is spent travelling back and forth between town and the quest areas because your inventory will be full after 1 dungeon. Also it takes 3 months to train your mount to be fast. If your looking for a compelling MMO you should invest your money Elswyr and if your looking for more Elder Scrolls you're much better off just modding Morrowind, Oblivion or Skyrim. For god's sake play ES Legends instead of this game."
Negative,"I'm disappointed in the developers. I first played ESO when it was available as Beta Access, and had a terrible experience playing the game. Now, three years later, I obtained the game with a humble bundle offer. Skeptical at first, I decided to give it another try. So I downloaded the game for 16 hours, waited through another 8 hour patch to finish, and finally... I couldn't even start the game. The patch data was corrupt. I tried repairing it, and it declared the patch data to still be corrupt. I deleted associated patch files and then repaired it. Patch files were still corrupted when it finished downloading. It has been two weeks, and ESO still hasn't fixed the issue that is stopping thousands of players from even accessing the game.I'm just so disappointed."
Negative,"It's really stupid that new players automatically get the morrowind chapter FOR FREE when they buy the base game. But older players who have already spent money on the game and bought the game, have to once again spent MORE money to buy an expansion.. even though it's free for new players.. am gonna keep enjoying it, but not gonna spend a single penny anymore and not buy any dlc's until this is resolved... it's not normal that i have to pay 20EUR in crowns to get a DLC new players get for FREE with the base game for just 10EUR.Will change my review if this is resolvedPS: Everyone saying this is the case with other mmo's and using wow as an example, no, that is not the same, with wow, once the older expansions become free and get included in the base game, if you didnt already have the expansion, YOU AUTOMATICALLY GET IT FOR FREE TOO, just like anyone else, it becomes free for everyone, not just free for new players"
Negative,"Marathoned Skyrim for quite a while then I decided, why not, I'll get ESO. Nope. Played for a little bit and decided to stick with Skyrim. The questing is boring, the ability points make no sense (""You've gained points for heavy armor!"" I'm...not...wearing heavy armor.) and I had no idea what I was doing half the time. It played more like an ""off-brand"" MMO than something you'd expect from a big name company like Bethesda.I wanted to like ESO, but it's just not a good game.If someone were to ask me if they should get this game after playing Skyrim, I would tell them to stick to Skyrim."
Negative,"I have experienced numerous connection issues since the day I installed this:1. The launcher would not load. A combination of adding exceptions to my anti virus and running Steam in administrator mode solved this2. The game will either fail to connect when loading a character, or I will load into the game, and then disconnect on the next load screen. These issues are still ongoing.If you are willing to brave the connection issues I recommend not getting the steam version, as the launcher has issues working with steam."
Negative,"Shit game that I didn't even get into the main menu. Downloaded SIXTY GIGS of it, launched it, and it opened a launcher which then started the download for SIXTY GIGS. No thanks."
Negative,"The launcher does not work with Steam, I was unable to play."
Negative,"Tried to charge my steam account 12 times for a subscription.  Too many money grabs.  They push cosmetics too much, and not enough on content."
Negative,"Buy the game from the elder scrolls online store, don't even think about buying it here. Those servers completely ruined my experience."
Negative,"Despite the game being fun, Customer Service is literally trash who doesn't even read your tickets and just spam the same blurb over and over again resulting in nothing fixed."
Negative,"I regret buying this shit, i've purchased this game, downloaded it, install it, then when i click to play the game doesn't launch but somehow the ''gameplay time'' is still counting so when i got tired trying to find a fix on the internet, i came back to ask for refound, but on the steam clock shows that i've already played 5 hours so i can't ask for refound (2 hour policy). And now i have 21 hours of ''game time'' but don't have played a second.(sorry for my bad english)."
Negative,"I haven't played this game for a while, after several hours downloading updates, I connected today with a huge ""contract"" saying that they can share with 3rd parties my real name, billing address, my browsing history, etc basically to anyone.When I entered the game, all my spell slots were blank, and when I tried to place them back I got the message that  I HAVE TO PURCHASE THE HOTBAR ABILITY!!!! Something that it used to work for years... I need to pay now, really??? Uninstalled the game for good."
Negative,"The option to skip the ""tutorial"" was welcome at first, in order to pass the very beginning scenario, but the skip goes far past that and throws you into the open world with no direction and nothing to do. Quickly found the fun drained out of the game because I was stuck aimlessly wandering and wishing I could at least do the introductory faction story for my character. In terms of gameplay systems, very much dislike the fact that weapons come with their own skill lines. Takes away from each class having a unique feel due to the weapon skills taking up slots that I would otherwise want to be class-specific abilities."
Negative,"Little update on the gambling. ZOS has added in game earnable currency that can be used to buy the items previously exclusive to gambling. Worth noting however that, as the content of the loot boxes changes every so often and the items purchasable with in game earnable currency are the same as the ones available from current loot boxes, you will not be able to purchase the rarer rewards before their removal unless you already started collecting the necessary currency for what you want long before the item you want was actually released.Locks cosmetic content behind real money gambling mechanicsCraft bag (for your material storage needs) is locked behind subscription, making inventory management hell without a subscription."
Negative,ive no idea if this is a steam issue or a game issue but either way bought it via steam and now its unplayableive had this issue for days nowstarted out great then login issuenow unable to login in at all and no one seems to be able to help.
Negative,"hassle to get started at max is too big to actually tell u to play this game. the story is fine i guess, combat is okay but not good. Wouldn't really rate it any higher than new world."
Negative,"Crashes randomly while leaving areas.  Either going through a portal, entering/exiting dungeon or going through a door.  Keep submitting crash reports. Tried to get help to found none."
Negative,"I hate it so far! The damn thing takes forever to load, I can’t use my game controller and I am unsatisfied with buying it!"
Negative,"Game is ok, combat pretty weak. World is cool though. Don't subscribe to ESO sub. Finding the cancellation is a bear, no surprise there gg."
Negative,"This game was fun for the 18 levels I got to play, after that I couldn't even log in. it took a whole day to download it too. its too much of a struggle to play and its not really that great of gameplay either, standard mmorpg mechanics. just go play a different MMO, its not worth 70$"
Negative,"Tried to log in, but after one and a half hour I gave up. Login error again and again. (... and no, it is not the first time) No worries, after buying ESO and all the DLCs (not to mention the crowns) I am off to go playing Bioshock... guess what I will think about during my encounters with splicers... money well spent... Update (two weeks after my first comment)... this is the second time within three days that I could not log in... don't you feel that this is getting ridiculous?"
Negative,"If you are a Skyrim fan, looking for Skyrim fun with your friends, run. Run and never look back. I didn't give much time to game but I just couldn't. It is nothing like Skyrim. It is more Black Desert Online than it's Skyrim. Since it's an MMORPG I wasn't expecting an 'absolute' Skyrim experience but nevertheless I was way disappointed. On the other hand, it's an average MMORPG game, if you prefer MMORPG to the fascinating story of Elder Scrolls, you could buy it. I tried it on free trial, and I am happy that I didn't waste my money.-Dovahkiin, fah hin kogaan mu draal."
Negative,"I don't recommend buying the game on Steam, I basically need to reserve 160 GB of disk space for it. First downloading it from Steam takes 75.6 GB, then running the launcher it tells me it needs 80 GB to install, that's just horrible for a game that wont take up nearly as much space in the end."
Negative,"A verry generic mmo on par with those you can get for free or for very cheep trying to play of the hype from skyrim & that dose not have anything but the apsolute most basic things in common with the elderscrolls.if it was free id recomend it but for the price i cant, still fun but not worth the price, maybe on sale it migth be worth it?"
Negative,"Now you might be looking at the hours posted and think that it's a good price for the dollars to doughnuts ratio, but after some reflection I'd much rather be stuck with the hours and the dollars than the experience.In this review, I'll be going why I dislike ESO after my hours in this. I got into ESO to explore tamriel to get a sense of the world and explore while enveloping myself in the lore. It started with the Morrowind expansion and I returned when Greymoor was announced. From the perspective of exploring tamriel, where it can fail is the scale and accuracy of the setting. A lot of the environments that you get exposed to are underwhelming as the scale is microscopic even by skyrim standards of tiny cities. An example is Seyda Need to Vivec city in ESO is about a brisk less than 3 minute jog (or about what seems like 10 seconds on a max level horse). A lot of the major hub worlds don't feel that lived in either with the typical NPCs standing around compared to the dynamic lifestyles that NPCs would have in other elder scrolls games. They are on par with Morrowind's limited AI. None of the locales really blew me away in a way that seeing Alduin fly away after escaping Helgen and you get the scenic mountain range, or leaving the sewer in Oblivion to find a nice lakeside view and seeing the scale of the Imperial city, or your first arrival at Vivec city and seeing the massive cantons. Nothing like that, everything feels sterile. Lorewise, it's hit or miss with it mostly missing for me. There are some minor oversights like the Lusty Argonian Maid being in this game when it came out during the era of when Morrowind takes place. In fact, Vivec city is being built in this game. Seyda Neen looks identical to how it looked like Morrowind, which is about 900~ years apart. There's also Ebonarm being wiped from certain books in ESO. Then there's the big stuff. This includes the walking forests of trees of Valenwood not being a thing in this game or the Cyrodiilic jungles that were prior to Tiber Septim. This game does try in some aspects and does include creatures like the Sload and Moamer as well as give us enlightenment on the Psijic order in one of the expansions. All of this felt underwhelming for me as the Moamer acted no different from bandits, or skeletons, or any other other enemy really. All the mysticism of legendary groups like the Psijic order or the living Gods of the Tribunal was not impressive to me personally, especially when they make you do fetch quests. There were some quests that I found genuinely interesting but they got outnumbered in the hundreds by lackluster ones instead. The daedra are weak as hell for the impact they had on the story versus on me. If you're looking to be impressed by Elder Scrolls lore, you're honestly better off sticking to the books. Then there's the metagame. Due to this game being an mmo, how the game is presented to you is altered by that decision. You will be greeted with a storefront, premium currency, unsoloable areas as they require a group, maps freckled with points of interests that we saw in all other mmos, crafting, house decor, crafting writs/recipes, daily quests, fetch quests, and the daily grind of login bonuses and daily dungeons, arenas, quests, etc. Honestly, there is enough here in daily blue ticks to eat several hours out of your day with all the expansions alone and you need to form some sort of balance as it's not fair to leave them out entirely. Daily crafting writs are the easiest and fastest way to earn dosh in this game, and you need buy horse upgrades if you want to change the abysmal morrowind starting walking speedesque of the starting horse if you want to ease your navigation of the map. Logging in to do this just gets tedious and I wish it wasn't a mechanic because it's honestly braindead and not much of a challenge but a chore. You also need to wait in real time hours for these to reset so it's impossible to fully upgrade your horse before 90~ or so days (it resets every 20 hours but let's assume that people have jobs and sleep schedules so they login once a day to do this like I did)I also find that the mechanics that make an mmo by it's structure also interfere with how the game is presented. You don't become that stealth archer that can one shot people in dungeons or destruction mage that can clear the room with one spell (and mods that help add more spells like the apocalypse mod in skyrim) or the two handed barbarian that can get consistent kill camps headbutting foes or the shield bashing paladin. you're a role and meant to fit in a niche. you started templar? you don't crossmix skills with other classes. you can use different weapons that give different skills but since the game scales universally with you, you'll still kill certain groups of foes (which start to feel the same after a while since it's the same archetype of foe but with a different skin) at around the same time span. you can optimize so it's slightly faster but you wouldn't be able to one shot groups if you're playing templar healer like which is annoying when questing in delves or public dungeons and there's the same group of enemies copy and pasted 3 times down the same corridor so you can't avoid them. you spam the same combo and it becomes brain dead. Further on this topic, if you're questing alone, it can become tedious as it's just the skyrim quests of go here and kill this, report back.  Sometimes, you might have a puzzle which consists of pressing E on a thing. I'm tired of these quests. When you quests with others, you are at the mercy of other people. If you don't resonate with your groupmates, it's hell on earth. You can tell by the veterans that run dungeons that they don't care for the game as they just wanna finish everything as fast as possible to just end the experience. I've had experiences in 20-45 minutes that were worse in this game because of other people than I did spending 3 hours troubleshooting why i get CTD in Skyrim with over 250 mods. If you're looking to be a completionist in this game like in Oblivion or Skyrim, good luck. A lot of collectibles are locked behind the paywall market, so NOT every pet, mount, house, or other misc cosmetic is available to you if you don't spend money on this game. So are some dungeons, provinces, and guilds (like dark brotherhood and thief's guild).  Have fun playing up to the point of you have every race, class, and quest complete do each. It's a waste of time and a grind. Another pet peeve is how shite this game is when you are not ESO+. Good luck having daily crafting writs and crafting when you lack ESO+ and the crafting bag. Your inventory and bank is gimped in the pleb version and on top of that the crafting items take up inventory space. They really don't want you to craft when you don't have ESO+, it's possible, but I would not call it viable for pleb accounts. Another issue about ESO+ is that (I still have it at the time of this review and a few months left) that I feel pressured to play this game to get optimal monetary value out of it is I need to play daily even when I don't want to. It's a sunken cost fallacy. When you lack ESO+, it takes longer to do anything worthwhile. It takes longer to get exp and research for example. This means you have to play more to get to where the ESO+ are. It's a lose-lose for me. TL;DR don't buy this game for lore, soloing the game and expecting a full experience, or sights. You'll be disappointed"
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM!I bought the game 13 days ago. Now I'm finding out there is a reoccuring issue with Steam or ESO (who is to blame for any particular problem is immaterial) of login and connection issues. If you buy this game on steam you will get all the problems every other ESO player has, and then you will get the additional problems that only Steam users have. Dropping connection, login failures, all because Steam isn't just acting as a storefront, but is acting as a second layer for access. You - Steam - ESO instead of just You - ESOSteam as a store front is one thing, sell me the game and get out of the way. I don't need an added layer of login credentialling between me and the game.The game is fun, graphics are nice, lots of depth to character development. If you like diving into the details to figure out which race is optimal for whih class there is enough to keep you occupied for a very long time. I would just recommend you get the game in a way you don't have the same issues I've run into.EDIT: BONUS TIME - Someone at ESO/Bethesda has hit the wrong button and deleted my access to DLC content. Steam won't refund my money, ESO won't deliver the game I bought, and login issues are still going on."
Negative,"Okay it's fun right. BUT HEAR ME OUT. It is cursed. Day one nothing happened, my friends just had to download.Day two  My friends sister called having shit go downWe stopped playing, things get better, and waited for things to look good so we played again.Next time we played, my friend then going to lose her job. ( stopped playing she still has it )( Cursed. )Then the next time we played my mom showed up out of nowhere needing my computer for a work emergency.NOW TODAY playing it for like 10 mins or something.I am trying to buy a home and everything is good going smoothly. SO I decided to play AGAIN.My friend's internet goes out while playing a total black out in her area and my mom goes Karen on my mortgage broker for no reason. Then my employee tries calling out of their shift.In conclusion , this game is cursed. I enjoy playing but damn is it cursed."
Negative,system crashes too oftenGlindab
Negative,"Graphics is horrible (yes older game, but can be updated). Game is clunky combat lacks depth. All around horrible game."
Negative,Don't buy from steam
Negative,boring as shit bro.
Negative,"I can't believe I paid money for this.The combat is soul crushingly awful and depressingly easy, the dialogue feels unnatural for an Elder Scrolls game, and the writing feels rushed.If you want an Elder Scrolls game with a similar premise, just get yourself a copy of Oblivion."
Negative,"1. The game is very off in comparison to the story and art style of every other elder scrolls game.2. The classes all have clunky mechanics.3. PvP is dominated by spammable, one ability characters. No real strategy is involved.4. Most quests are essentially time-wasters that are not fun to play and just add play time.5. Dont play this game even if you are an elder scrolls fan, buy another one. You will get sucked into the game by paying for things that add no real value to the experience."
Negative,"Unfortunately I gotta not recommend this game, Tried everything they recommended all beside from making a ticket for support. I was having login errors and apparently all of my emails have already been registered even though I've never played this game before. I never even got to play the game. Gladly it was on sale for $7"
Negative,"I buy this game recently and i didn't recommanded to buy this game with steam. Everytime i want to play we have *Login issues Failed*. Steam don't want to Find a solution. SAME thing Every Week !! :(    Please steam Solve the problem, this is NOT normal....."
Negative,"It really is a good game in it's core , but it's too chuck full of microtrasaction , it's purposely built to be uncomfortable to force you to subscribe or buy something with real money.."
Negative,bruh wont login
Negative,"I loved this game -- originally.  The irony is, the first mod I grabbed for Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim was to get rid of the leveling lists (hit a wolf at 1st level?  Come back at 20th level and the same wolf will have magically become roughly equal to you).  So what do they do?  They do a big  game-change and go from not having auto-scaling/level-lists to doing so.  I was about to buy the expansions, but the big ""let's auto-scale the game"" trashed it for me.  If they'd open classic servers, I'd be back in a heartbeat... but I won't play this (or any other Elder Scrolls game) as long as the auto-scaling can't be modded out (and this is an MMO, so it can't be).  Otherwise, the skill-use is great, the world is colorful and vibrant, the crafting is smart.  Loved the game so much originally, hate it so much now.  Not recommended (especially as they nickle-dime you on expansions,dlc,etc)."
Negative,"i bought the steam version, because I could attach my non steam ESO account and play it without having to enter a password every time. then I aparently made the mistake of wanting the damn thing on a different hard drive, and moving it has apparently completely made it impossible to start. neither reinstalling nor verifying helps at all: verify says nothing is wrong, and reinstall just reinstalls the files and still the launcher wont launch. its a launchless launcher. waste of 10$should have known that zenimax has enough problems getting the fking thing to run without steam to be able to run it within the house of cards that is steam."
Negative,"This game had so much potential, but ended up a cashgrab old-fashioned MMO, which is only ""fun""-like when you spend your money on microtransactions, which is a shame compared to the Elder Scrolls legacy. I am disappointed, although I can visit whole Tamriel, but again this whole world is lifeless, without characters, story, and loot.***Update a 1 year later:I thought I will give it another chance, hence, I wanted to ""upgrade"" my base game to the most recent version of ESO, BUT their disgusting marketing policy did not let me, UNLESS I buy the base game again (!), only then will I get to play all the chapters, etc., because the ""chapter'''''upgrades'''''"", apparently, give you only the sole DLC at the time -- which would still be logical, IF they would not remove the other DLCs/chapters from the store, which is abysmal. I am sad that  since the last entry in the series, over 10 years, we/the players/TES-fans did not get a TES game, just a hollow brazen outrageous TES-like-skeleton cash-grab."
Negative,too much fun
Negative,you cant put skyrim and warcraft together.it doesnt work like that.now its own seperate game where you can play with friends like borderlands would have been better.traveling to different maps as well all the same sizebut with all the regions in conflict and walls to each area/loadscreens would have been way better.i understand this is a good way to keep a money flow.but i am not impressed whatsoever.sorry bethesda.you definitely dropped the ball on this one.again not impressed with the direction you went
Negative,"If you never played any of the Elder Scrolls games before this one, you can probably skip this. I never did and all the lore meant pretty much nothing to me.Also, it's majorly pay to win. If you aren't on ESO Online, it's not worth the time. There are so many bonuses to it that I don't have space to list here. This is also one of the most grind intensive games I've ever played, and I came from Rust before this!"
Negative,downloaded the game ahead of a gaming night between me and mates only to discover once the client loaded up that the game required about an hour of downloads.How are besthesda this anti gamer that even before I play the game im already irritated?
Negative,"after 8 years of playing ive been perma banned cause someone reported my name countless times! for being offensive. when people have account with the name niqer and so forth. all these people care about is filling there pockets, good game but the people running it are clowns."
Negative,"EDIT 2020-12-04: THESE FUCKING DEVS BASICALLY MADE A BOSS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE EVERY1 DISCONNECTS IN THE ENCOUNTER IN FANG LAIR VETERAN -- CALLURION OR W.E -- IT IS ACTUALLY BEN BROKEN FOR OVER A FUCKING MONTH AND NO1 CAN FINISH THE DUNGEON AND THESE FUCKING DEVS PUT IT AS A DAILY VETERAN DUNGEONUpdate: I played an additional 108 hours since previous review, The game is still complete dog shit and quit playing it.it's a bad mmo period with devs/publishers that have the most predatory microtransaction I have seen in any MMO and perhaps any game-- This game rivals mobile games by basically including everything as an in game purchasable.The devs will say that the microtransactions 'offer no competitive advantage', however, they offer a time investment advantage aka pay now to get it now as opposed to later. EVERYTHING HAS A FUCKING PRICE TAG TO EVEN BUYING RIDING TRAINING FOR SPEED, STAM, AND BAG SPACES FOR MOUNTS (unless you want to log in for 180 consecutive days to get training to max).The entire design of alot of systems of the game makes you question the intelligence of the design team (i.e., guild traders -- aka lets put specific npcs who sell only gear that that specific in game guild puts up so you have to travel to one of the dozens of cities to find the guild trader with the gear you want and ensure it is the right guild selling it  --(there isnt even a central auction horse to search for items, which means u have to use a third party website to search and it doesnt even tell you if the item sold)  WTF, who made this? who approved this? clearly someone with 80 IQ). No ELO ranking pvp system because the devs don't know what they are doing. The battlegrounds is 3 vs 3 teams which means zerg rush (why wouldn't you put in 2 teams vs eachother with varying sizes of teams?) There isnt even rewards to PVP (you get shitty basic pvp gear that is not good for pvp or pve).I've spent some money on crown crates (their gambling system) to test the waters and something seems seriously wrong with the odds ratio. After 30 opened crates, I got one duplicate of a legendary motif (a really shitty skin) and multiple 'legendary' xp scrolls (that dont matter if you get past CP 160). This means that after 30 crates (~$100), I got the same legendary skin twice  (which there is more than 10 other legendary items you can get -- I ALSO DIDNT GET FUCKING CREDIT FOR THEIR 'DUPLICATE' PROOF SO I GOT TWO OF THE SAME BECAUSE I HAD ONE IN MY BANK AND ONE NOW IN MY BAGS MEANING THERE ISNT FUCKING DUPLICATE PROOFING THAT THESE FUCKS STATE) as well as 4 'legendary' xp scrolls which you usually get 1 in 15. These fucking xp scrolls just give a bonus of like 150% xp for 2 MEASLY FUCKING HOURS (that's NOT EVEN DOUBLE XP -- WHAT SAD INCOMPETENT IDIOTS) Huge fucking scam that I hope gets shut down._This game is absolute ass, and I am an original beta tester. The game has no end-game, imagine the devs spending over 5 years of development and all they could come up with was veteran dungeons LUL WHAT. That's literally the entire end game. The entire PvP system is just zerg rushing with no skill, the worst servers that you can have in 2020 with the worst dev.Honestly, this is one of the worst game's ive played in my life, the pvp system is entirely based on getting to CP (Champion Points) 160 and if you aren't that, then you basically can't pvp and will do no damage and take full damage. Not only do you need to get this point level, you need the cheese meta gear and if you don't got it, don't expect to kill anyone. This is the only MMO on the market where the better skilled player will lose all the time without having that.The final final, anyone who is reviewing this game with less than 100 hours in, DO NOT LISTEN TO THEIR REVIEWS -- THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE GAME IS -- I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD AT THE START UNTIL YOU UNDERSTAND THE FOUNDATIONS AND CORE.Finally, getting to cp 160 is one of the most unrewarding and boringest experiences you can do in gaming, you basically do zone quests or dungeons that get repetitive and boring after you clear ~3 zones and do about half the dungeons. This is honestly a pile of trash.3/10 AT BEST (you know its bad when the devs have to put a bunch of useless garbage in the cash shop and make everything premium/pay to use; especially the craft bag where they plague the game with useless craftables and garbage that fills up your inventory so you are compelled to pay monthly (btw, this is one of the most expensive MMOs you can play with THE LEAST CONTENT AVAILABLE). You know the devs are bad when they do these gimmicks (it's a display of their talent which is non existent).Game is garbage, the PvP system is one of the worst in any MMO, it takes no skill. Avoid this pile of trash."
Negative,"i finally got out of Vvardenfell and found out how awesome this game was, i even bought all dlc's, and i also played the New world game and i gotta say ESO FOREVER🙌but no for region restrictions"
Negative,"The game will download itself EVERY SINGLE F***ING TIME that you TRY to play it. Two years ago it was irritating, now it is downright frustrating because of the file size. Steam will NOT reimburse your money because more than 2 hours have been played. (That time shown INCLUDES downloading time)! Since retrying to download it my 'playtime' has increased!It is not my internet before you ask. Yesterday spent six hours downloading to 9%, had to go to work, so when i came back i switched back on to continue and it restarts downloading!Lets say it takes three days constantly to download, but that  will be every time you want to play!So it is impossible to download because you have to do this every time. But the game shows as installed in my library! Save your money, there are other MMOS out there.This is my first review, shame it had to be negative. I loved Oblivion, shame that ESO has problems."
Negative,Edit 2-19-2022: The link supplied by the dev wasn't very helpful in my issue.The issue I believe is holding this game back is the pvp in Cyrodiil.Not everyone wants to participate in pvp but want to be included in Cyrodiil to acquire optimal gear.Forcing a game mode or event only strangles the player base to a number of people willing to participate. While alienating others who don't when they hit that wall.I believe that if pvp was optional in this area the games playerbase would increase.As I would know I would come back and play this as a more serious contender to other big names such as FFXIV.(Original Post) 2-11-2022Grind the good gear in Cyrodill. No thank you.If you want my money then let me play my way.If not. Plenty of games to enjoy offline.
Negative,I can't recomed this game becouse is just another fucking mony grab
Negative,"So this is a paid MMO that is FILLED with paywalls and microtransactions.The numbers make no sense, a starting weapon does 143 damage, everyone has thousands of HP, everything seems arbitrarily inflated"
Negative,Garbage money grab from a garbage dev/publisher.  Gross.
Negative,"Attempted to play it today, for the free weekend. Been wanting to play it for a while but was unsure on buying. Launched and wouldnt load anything, closed and reopened got to sign up for it. Then attempted to log in, didnt work until i reopened again. Then had to close and reopen 3 times as i attempted to start the game. Finally got to character customisation, the only part with no problems. Then on trying to change the graphics had a loading screen that never stopped. TL:DR? unplayable."
Negative,Persistent and unremitting launcher freezes and crashes have effectively rendered this game unplayable. Even from a clean install. I cannot recommend it.*Update: Got the game launcher working by using a mobile device as a hotspot instead of my ISP. Apparently there was some issue between Cox and this game. Since then the launcher has worked adequately.
Negative,the game installer does not work despite downloading for multiple times. admin pls fix this problem
Negative,The game is insanely easy - zero challenge. If there was any challenge at all this game would be fantastic.
Negative,make more like an ES game and less like generic mmo
Negative,An error has occured and you're unable to get a good review. Try again in a few patches
Negative,Graphics are mediocre and the over experience is boring
Negative,Its a pretty eh game. Probably the mmo I liked the least from what I've played. Never have I'd imagined a MMO being more grindy than World of Warcraft but thats ESO.
Negative,"actually this is a good game, for the game itself, it can really compete with WoW, but in terms of fanbase? Absolute zero. Unfortunately many players are very toxic, the level of toxicity is very comparable to the fanbase of genshin impact or League of Legend."
Negative,"Extremely predatory microtransactions.  Glorified realworld problems in excessive detail like slavery, without any quest options to go against it.  Worse and worse writing every year below par of baby's first fanfic.  Devs plan to not focus on story this year 2024, despite this being an rpg game.  No transparency with devs/company.  Self-congratulatory lies constantly.  Gameplay repetitive, clunky, boring.  Lack of creativity in world/quests/activities."
Negative,Game no longer works would launch a background version of the game that wouldn't ever open or close even when using task manager. I would have to restart my pc to close the game and now I finally managed to get the game to open but it only shows as a black screen and nothing happens. I have had this issue multiple times now for years thanks for never fixing a game breaking issue really appreciate that.   HUGE UPDATE: THE GAME NO LONGER DOWNLOADS NOW I GET A DISK WRITE ERROR EVEN THOUGH I HAVE 500gb OF FREE STORAGE YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Negative,"> goes to dungeon> defeats boss> tries to read the lore> gets killed because the boss respawns after 120 seconds or when another player enters the dungeon> goes to an assassination mission> finds the target standing on top of its own corpse because there was just another player there> kills the ""doppleghanger""> respawns again immediatly because another player entered the house> have to kill the target again and now there is a funny but uncanny pile of corpses of the same target in front of me> Other player comes, looks confused, shrugs it off4/10 you have to speedrun everything because FUCK immersion in a RPG, even when it has good story and locationsAlso> needs other characters to progress gear, hold itens, specialize, etc. While obviously made to stimulate teamwork and guilds, its easier (and more boring) to create other characters to support you and use the allowed pluggins to search XP crystals to level up crafters.5/10 would rather implement genshin impact mechanics.>Combat is good, but everything is level scaled so no real challenge + can XP rush with high level friends doing ANY quest. Also, if your fight gets too far away from the enemy arena (ANY ENEMY, NOT ONLY BOSSES) they gain immunity, walk back and restore their health. 6/10, buy Elden Ring instead. Its just as grindy and enemies just respawn when you use the bonfire."
Negative,"Steam version doesn't let you log in, don't bother."
Negative,"Story and game play are decent.  Lots of very young players, despite being rated M. Community really makes this game unplayable. Customer Support is unhelpful."
Negative,"A game where you play as a homeless man for 8 hours, Nah"
Negative,"It is like low IQ Skyrim and your character build doesn't matter outside of class which sucks, but yeah this game is meh, I wish the combat was less forgiving."
Negative,"The most boring combat in any rpg I've played. Upgrading a skill shouldn't make it WORSE, this horizontal progression is a failure.If this game were a sex position, it would be missionary. Except you slowly get less hard and your ""finish"" is less eventful than a line at the DMV."
Negative,"Do not purchase if you hope to run on Mac.After installing, it crashed more than anything. I couldn't even get through the startup cinematic. Now it won't open at all. Tried running the beta launcher but it's so unoptimized the download was fluctuating between 7 and 0m/s. After sitting and waiting for two hours it was only at 9%...Tried reinstalling the game and it won't even boot into the game at all just like before...."

Negative,"Haven't played this game for long, but I'll share my thaughts.First, this game is the buggiest piece I have ever played. I can't even name a single game that has more bugs in it ( and I know how Fallout 76 looked at release ).Some bugs and bad features I experienced:- Invisible NPCs, a lot. That can be very infuriating in combat especially because you not only can't see the enemies, they can't be damaged either ( but they do damage you ). You also can't interact with invisible NPCs.- Sometimes NPCs refuse to interact with you. You can press ""F"" as many times you want, but nothing will happen ( except when they decide dissapear ).- Invisible weapons and abilities. These can be ignored easily, but still feels like I am playing some cheap crap when my character shoots arrows from it's hand.- Textures not loading. A better PC would probably fix this, but the fact that I can play Witcher 3 on max graphics with better fps and without any loading issues is sad.- Character freezes when the map doesn't load. The biggest problem with that is that enemies can still hurt you and kill you while you are frozen.- The audio usually has some latency ( up to 5 sec ) and sometimes the audio refuses to work at all ( complete silence ).- Lot of locked content for those who only have the base game. The 20€ Standard Edition feels like a demo.- Enemy lvl literally doesn't exist. No matter where you go you'll find the same easy-to-defeat enemies everywhere. Without any challenge the only fun you can have in questing is the lore.What is good about the game:- Every NPC is voiced.- It takes place in the Elder Scrolls universe.My final thaughts: This game is like shit in golden foil."
Negative,As of right now the Game sucks.  the graphics are missing some. when i get to the first room the woman says go get weapons and i do and fall into the floor over and over in a loop. cant get out. even unstuck dont work. i have tried 2 different toons. same results. i cant even get out of the first room to even play it... What a waist of money.
Negative,"Just awful. But only bc I can’t log in. All they want to do is continually confirm it’s me and never, not once accept my password. I have been trying for almost an hour and I reset my passwords 3 times. Just a fucking disaster. All I want to do is game with my friends.UPDATE:After only getting 8 hours of game play that booted me out every 20 minutes to 1 hour (on a good session). I gave up. Just not worth the 4.99 I spent on it."
Negative,it ruined my life
Negative,this game fucks
Negative,"Honestly, the most boring Elder Scrolls I have ever played in my life."
Negative,"stupid login system logged in with an ""explicit"" name and now i can't use that email my opinion Bethesda doesn't make good games any more."
Negative,GAME WILL NOT WORK AFTER UPDATE
Negative,Could not even get the game to run (launcher kept loading). For 2022 thats simply unnacceptable.
Negative,"Costs too much money, in my opinion."
Negative,"No servers for India, The game does not run without VPN either. This made it very laggy to the point where it was unplayable."
Negative,"You buy the game, and then in order to do anything fun you have to spend an absurd amount of money to get DLCs. It's a rip off, Bethesda is having you repay for the same game every so often by making another DLC for ESO instead of actually working on the next Elder scrolls game. It's criminal to spend 60-80$ in order to get the game with all the areas (which you think is ESO plus but its not guys). Then you're going to have to spend 25$ per a guild that you actually want to join (at the dark-brotherhood, thieves guild, or any other profitable organization). They made it pay to play, but you're already buying the game. I shouldn't be having to worry about crowns so often because without them i can't touch or go to half the chests or lands i find. Leveling up you're sneaking/pick-pocketing is near also going to be near impossible. Bethesda changed the mechanics so that now you can't make any easy money with acceptable forms of play unless you pay to use those abilities by getting the guilds, or spend 75 hrs in real game time to get anywhere with those skills. Leveling up anything else seems pretty easy compared to the skills we all want to use because early game its profitable. You're better off sticking to Skyrim or Oblivion and forcing them to come out with the next game already because we refuse to buy one more island they make for a game most of us already hate.**********************************************************************************************************EDIT:Update, I've played 244 hours basically only pick pocketing and thieving in game while completely fulling out the skill tree as far as i can and i still haven't reached past level 6 in that skill tree (""ledgerman"" or something). Every other skill i constantly use seems to level up really quickly compared. It takes forever to make money still and i have a lot of DLCs. Horses also cost 42,500 dollars versus the 5,000 in Skyrim which is way criminal. You don't have a lot of space to place things in a house and the only way to get more space is to use real money not in game. So its not that you don't have space to place your quest trophies or cute animals, they just saw an opening to force you to pay more money if you want to decorate the over priced small house you bought. The MMO is fine and fun to play, don't buy it unless you want to spend a shit ton of money to  go anywhere in game. They wanted me to change my review because i played more XD guys i already bought the game, not wasting it by not playing even though i want to warn others not to get it :P"
Negative,"If you want the textures of 2011 with the bugs of 1998, this is your game.If you don't want to waste your money, this isn't your game."
Negative,This game is damn boring
Negative,game constantly gives error code 334
Negative,Constantly disconnects every 5 to 10 minutes.
Negative,"PvE is easy, boring, and the level scaling only makes it worse. And its too crowded, even in dungeons. It breaks inmersion. Its a shame but i cant enjoy it one bit. I want a difficult but fun journey to endgame, not a babysitting and boring list of quests that can be made with closed eyes."
Negative,"Horrible. Do not buy. I cancelled my subscription. It is completely optional. Once my sub was done, they removed the ENTIRE game from my library. The sub is not needed for most game-play, especially a new user. Had a huge notification pop up in yellow/red like it was the worst thing happening. It is unacceptable. Game itself, not anything special. You try to do quests, get no guidance, and get confused. I think this game is tailored to only people who have played this  game before. Lots of pay to play."
Negative,"Can't even play it. There's a free event going on right now but even after creating/linking an account I can't sign in due to ""internal"" errors. Not sitting through 100GB of downloads again just to see if I want to give these shills money"
Negative,"This is a typical skinnerbox MMO with predatory FOMO tactics and a bloated cash shop.The base game is available cheap because to access all map content you must spend ~$240CAD, to access all classes and races is an additional ~$37CAD, and to have enough bag/bank space to not spend 50% of your play time in inventory hell you must pay $17CAD/month subscription.It superficially resembles and Elder Scrolls game but is designed to be played in 3rd person, with a rotation of cooldown based skills on your hotbar like most MMOs. Attempting to play in first person view is miserable for two main reasons:1) Enemies and spell effects have been scaled way larger to accommodate a swarm of players. You will be staring into the legs of most bosses, when you aren't blinded by cones of fire or bursts of lighting from other players. Even human bosses like the Pellingare Bretons are scaled 10ft tall compared to players.2) The mechanics of the game also punish first person players by displaying AOE warnings as red circles or lines on the ground at your feet. Dodge rolling, positioning yourself, or looking behind you without backpedalling is trivial in 3rd person while nearly impossible in first.As far as MMOs go, it is decent. If an MMO is what you're looking for, ESO has better environments and flavour than Black Desert Online (played in 2018) or Genshin Impact, at the expense of worse hit detection and combat in general. If you're looking for an Elder Scrolls game, you'll be insulted by this one."
Negative,"(note: i originally got this game when it was first coming out but didn't mess with it till recent. didn't like it at the time and figured to give it another shot. after a decent amount of time, i found there were flaws in this game that i could get around, i would get back on later though and be fine. what i experienced today though was complete bullshit, so i'm trying to find a place in riften to sell my stolen items (half of my inventory). I also had a 3,000 gold bounty on my head, i spent hours getting the best selling items, evading guards. after all that i end up in the bank building in riften, figured place some alchemy stuff in there. yeah, i got attacked by a guard who never knew i was in riften to begin with, it wouldn't let me leave the building cause i was being attacked. after i died i lost half of my inventory which would've been bad enough if the game didn't rub salt in the wound by leaving the 3,000 gold bounty on my head. fix your shit, i won't be playing it till you do. also tip, when in a dungeon or area that is cut off from the bigger open world areas, have it set up so if there's only one person the game can program the area to suit that situation (if it's meant to be hard put a warning of sorts that suggested amount of players is whatever you want the minimum amount to be)"
Negative,"The paywalls take away every form of reward in this game.i had to grind for a week to get to level 50 assuming something interesting happened.i love the ES series. i put 600 hours into oblivion, so i figured it was an endgame thing and the world would open up at max level. but no. just a different set of paywalls and a skill tree that level your skills in fractions of a percentage. whats the point?if you enjoyed playing the darker questlines in oblivion or skyrim forget it. they charge for those too, and who knows what you'll be getting out of it after the fact. i was lucky enough to get most of the DLC continent with my original purchase, atleast mostly.(i still ended up buying a few things to unlock more crafting options).PvP is a mess of getting stomped on by ESO plus users. *you literally dont stand a chance*. i just dont see how thats even enjoyable for most people who buy this, for more than maybe a couple days.so all in: dont. unless you're into bad games."

Negative,"Wanted to try this game but it wouldn't load past the char creation screen. My internet connection is fine, get your shit together bethesda. oh wait, you're bethesda."
Negative,Remember a poop where you had to lean over because it hurt so bad. That's this game.
Negative,"Love the game. Hate the 69,000 hr Download time. Had to let it install from the time i went to bed, to the time i was getting ready for bed the next night."
Negative,"I want to like it... I do. I've installed, played, and then uninstalled the game three different times because I typically love Elder Scrolls related content. If you're looking for a fun MMO to dive into, this one is one of the best subscription-free MMOs on the market. Unfortunately, it's laden with time-gated content and micro-transactions. Those aren't even the bad parts of the game, honestly. The crafting systems and the class designs are the worst.As far as crafting goes, learning a new recipe takes an increasing long amount of time regardless of your character's skill level. You farmed NPCs for 16hrs to get the rare recipe/pattern required to craft this wicked dagger? Sorry. You have to wait another 26hrs for this research process to complete before you can learn it -- unless you pay to learn it instantly via a power-up from the in-game shop! 😡As far as the class system is concerned, I'd rather have something more on-the-rails like a traditional skill-tree that made each class and subclass more distinct. This design is a bit more à la carte where you have class/subclass choices but you get to pick/choose/and mix from all of them. While this allows you to better customize your character it conflicts with the core design of each subclass, with some exceptions, as the attacks are often designed to compliment one another.Rather than being a game with a clear vision of the gameplay and player experience that also has a digital marketplace, it's a game developed around a digital marketplace that has good gameplay and an abysmal player experience. This is just my opinion, though."
Negative,Most boring game ive ever played
Negative,do not play this game. waste of time and money
Negative,"If you want to be a SPELLCASTER, this is the right game for you. If your ideal play style is about not using magic, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.Also, most NPC's are really boring, and so is most of quests. Combat is really boring as well, even as a spellcaster, which this game is clearly designed for. I bought it with a 60% discount and still felt like a waste of money. Worst MMO I've ever played, honestly."
Negative,The game cannot choose the location for installation.
Negative,still trying to download the patches to start the game after about 8 hours of downloading the patches would love some inside about this?????????
Negative,Pointless least fun cash grab. Everything revolves around giving bethesda more money which at this point they don't deserve.
Negative,Not that good a game hard to really solo and use all the potions they offer during a fight.
Negative,I almost fall asleep in the intro.
Negative,"Honestly? A disgrace to the Elder Scrolls series. It's uninspired and boring. There's absolutely nothing interesting about any of the quests nor the NPCs. The only thing my friends and I had even an ounce of fun with was blasting those poor lizards and other little animals with magic because there is so little else worth doing. I uninstalled the game after maybe a week of having it, if that. The space it takes up isn't worth it.I wouldn't recommend wasting your time with this game; just go play Oblivion or Skyrim."
Negative,"They do only add more cosmetics and they do never improve the server performance...Server Performance is REAAALLY BAD!!!your ping/latency can be everything from 150ms to 999+ ms. PVP is unplayable. you can press a skill and 5-10sec later, you character will use the skill you pressed.else the game has a good concept, it got tons of contain and thousand hours of gameplay.but the latency/ping kills the pvp"
Negative,"Worst game ever: 25 minutes staying in the login queue to come back: logged out because of inactivity - YES, I DID NOTHING for 25 minutes....so next 25 minutes in the queue and next logout due to inactivity. And when I reached 1 second in the queue and I stayed there... I stopped after 10 further minutes. This game is not playable"
Negative,"we do not need your Gaymoor untill u wont fix Cyrodiil... all we hear from developers is empty promises and only. PVP in game is disgusting: can't change my weapon in combat, skills are not possible to use, glitches, freezes, laggs. the scrollrunners in cyro use game bugs to deliver the scroll to the fortress. and our dear developers wants us to pay for Gaymoor and ESO+!  I'm willing to pay only for a quality product, and what the money-hungry developers are offering us  is not good"
Negative,i want a refund this game is terrible
Negative,Fun is nerf and server is trash datsit
Negative,even Neverwinter is better than this shit.
Negative,the launcher for this game sucks donkey doo doo
Negative,Have played this for roughly 30 hours and it was so-so. Similar to other games like this that I've played for years. What I despise about this game is that it's a blatant cash grab after you've spent the money to purchase it. You can literally drop $100's of dollars on it once you start playing and it doesn't stop. I continually get spammed about their crap being on sale and I need to jump on it now before the sale goes away. Would not recommend this unless you have significant funds after the initial purchase because that will only be the tip of the iceberg as you spend a fortune to actually enjoy the game.
Negative,"After downloading the game in Steam, the launcher began installing 80 gigs again which took about two hours. And when i did play the game I was given errors ""An unexpected internal error has occurred"" ""Incorrect user ID or password"". After resolving the errors and creating accounts, I was greeted with really long loading screens. And then steam support refused to give me a refund because I had over two hours of playtime. I Do not recommend this game."
Negative,"Game is not good, Controls are weird, graphics are just decent, and the gameplay just isn't interesting. Download for the game itself took 8 hours and don't even know if I'm eligible for a refund please consider watching others play the game before spending money on this."
Negative,"This is a great game if you enjoy grinding your arse off for simple gear. Can't say I enjoy farming for 10 plus materials just to make lackluster leather armor. The stories and map varieties, and classes are great, but it takes too darn long just to get decent equipment. If this aspect was fixed, maybe I'll try again."
Negative,"The game lost me on the character creation screen. Can't make cat girl waifu, 0/10"
Negative,"Tried to love this game really. But in reality this game is like any other MMORPG out there. Too much mainstream MMORPG, not enough Elder Scrolls."
Negative,i have no friends to play this
Negative,Primitive game mechanics and the scaling system ruins the experience for me.
Negative,i had much more fun with dead hooker in my basement
Negative,too many random disconnects from the game unfortunately
Negative,This game is bad.  There's something wrong with it that's hard to put into words but it's definitely there even though it's hard to describe.  The temptation to play just isn't there.  It has parts and pieces that are fun to experience but overall the game is more annoying than fun.  They should have made it more like skyrim and less like whatever the hell this is supposed to be.
Negative,"(TL;DR:) If you like any Elder Scrolls games (Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind, Daggerfall, etc.) and MMOs or just MMOs in general, give it a shot.  It's said to be one of the better MMOs out there, believe it or not.  If you don't like MMOs, probably don't.  If you like Fallout... it might be a little similar if you can get into the optional first person perspective.     A big draw for this game is that there is no forced subscription.You buy access to the game and that's it, though buying DLC and subscribing to ESO Plus can be helpful.     Big note here:     I am not a good person to be reading a review from unless you're trying not to like MMOs. lol The latest edit of this review was right after removing ESO from my Steam account because I was trying too hard to like the game -- being a TES fan and envious of people who enjoy MMOs -- and feel like I had gotten my money's worth... and I had almost 1,000 hours of gameplay even.(End of TL;DR:)     Personally, I found ESO to be very manipulative and terribly designed.The very useful Crafting Bag you get from subscribing to ESO Plus, which eliminates most storage concerns with infinite capacity for crafting materials and automatic transfers from the inventory, is only available through ESO Plus or its more or less annual free trials that can be activated on your account any number of times, so the free trials feel to me like more of a bone they throw to PO2Pers (Pay Once to Play-ers).  Otherwise, storage can be very annoying and requires quite a bit of dedication to upgrade very much, hence the manipulation... though it also kind of feels like the fact that ESO Plus opens to you most DLC zones and extra features provided by DLC is just part of that... and the price?  Completely ridiculous.  $14.99 USD a month!  They really don't seem to want you to fully enjoy the game without paying way more than most games out there.  I feel sorry for anyone going into debt or wasting money at all on this stuff, and I've heard that DLCs are generally very samey.  Even I got roped into buying discounted DLC once and then found out that it only applies to one megaserver at a time, meaning you have to buy it twice to use it on both megaservers... and then I stopped using the megaserver that I bought the DLC on for the most part and was VERY disappointed!     Don't get me started on cosmetics or the gambling aspects of MMOs though, which ESO is not exempt from.  I find that stuff to just be despicable, and cosmetics should never cost anything imo.     Oftentimes I regretted my daily choices about this game.     ESO, like probably most MMOs, is too grindy, and I don't like feeling obligated to at least log into games daily or I'll miss out on ""rewards"".  I was also quite stressed out by in-game events (I didn't want to miss out on rewards either once again.) as they are much more grindy than regular gameplay.     Not to say that I never had fun with ESO.  I did have a bit of fun once in a while.  It's just got quite dissatisfying and often unbalanced combat, and despite the developers listening to fans who comment about how they want the game to be, I don't see it becoming much of a TES game at all... as much as a TES themed MMO like I know I've heard a few people say.  I'm also just not as socially functional or comfortable of a person as I hoped I would be when I got the game.     Quite a few features of the game such as a few locations and some quests really push player interaction on you despite the devs claiming that they support whatever play style you may have, even if it's just solo as well as with friends, PVE, or PVP.  Nope.  Not exactly.     It's also quite unsettling and unpleasant to know that the developers encourage UI-based mod use in the form of ""add-ons"", which give players actually sort of significant advantages over other players who may not want to use add-ons or don't know about them by giving the add-on users minimaps and showing them where important items are for example.Maybe I'm too weird, whiny, and opinionated with ""wrong"", obscure opinions, but I thought I'd give a review a go.Hope it was helpful for you."
Negative,"got this game gifted from a friend. Downloaded and uninstalled 4 times, tried the solutions on steam and official forums, never got past the launcher, constant patch errors. would not recommend."
Negative,"Can't recommend ESO. Been a fan of Bethesda games since Daggerfall, know the mechanics, like the gameplay. However, the game kicks me offline regularly (high volume low online volume _ doesn't matter). LOTRO, World of tanks, NEVER a problem, go figure...Also bought crowns through Steam a week ago which haven't showed up in game as of yet. Problem is, Steam sends responsibility to ESO, and ESO has no answers. No answers about game crashes no answers about game purchases. Just preset Q&A buttons on the ""support"" page that don't cover the specific problem(s). I want to like the game, graphics are great Voice acting Blows LOTRO away! Easy to get into the story lines, but nOT when one gets kicked off Constantly"
Negative,boring gameplay and fighting
Negative,it never worked :')
Negative,"Every time I try to play, 8 hours of maintenance seems to kick me off and I end up finding something else to play. Guess I'll try again next year to play the game."
Negative,999+ ping simulator
Negative,It's really really bad
Negative,"I have a feeling this game would be great had I been given a chance to play it. Launcher still needs 20GB after steam install. Launcher wants to install in different drive then steam download, and freezes every time I run it."
Negative,"This is not a game, its's a platform for microtransactions. Don't see anything worth paying for compared to poe, which is free to play. Played it on free week and most likely the game will become free to play soon, at least the base game.It suffers from consolitis, an example of which is the intolerable loading screens. Probably the annoying bugs and quirks that annoy me are because of it too, like quest and map glitches. The game has problems indicating what is where exactly, specially if there are multiple levels.The quests are the same old from decades ago, all feel the same, travel fetch, kill some, etc. Everything waits for you eternally, and you can join and rule everything at the same time. Has the stench of everything being at your level, every zone, every enemy. Sensation of meaningless, filler.You will end up following a series of icons on screen, progressing from one place/quest to the other, more like a job than an adventure. The main plot is like the gates of oblivion, the worst part of the game, you know how it is, travel multiple times to another boring plane/dimension/planet.Eternal respawns add to the feeling of console game for kids. Accomplishes the feat of being fake multiplayer (instances) and also fake singleplayer (always connected to internet).The most obvious way to make you want to pay outside of cosmetics is of course the bag/coffer space.Meh. Reminds me of those mobile games that consist of build queues and wait times and microtransactions. Seems to be working until an ultimate crash. The only thing missing is a battle royale mode lol."
Negative,"Love the game, but the constant f**king need to reinstall the game `cause the omnipotent PLAY button DOESN´T START THE F**KING GAME makes me furious. Reinstalling it for the last time, if it won´t work i'm NEVER buying anything ever again from Bethesda. Such kind of an intercourse needs to go both ways. BWARGH! (Throws keyboard at a cat.. asdgnlsaADSGQC§ $F**KING MEOW."
Negative,"i want to play this game but every couple of seconds the game disconnects without any notice and the game is litiraly unplayable.my wifi works just fine and it works on every single multiplayer game exept for this game so dont say its on my end, the devs should just stop adding content and star fixing the servers to give us access to the content that is already out"
Negative,"TLDR; Replay Skyrim. Or Oblivion. Specifically, the Shivering Isles expansionI only played briefly over a free weekend, but there wasn't enough to make me come back. It's poorly tutorialized and I'm not sure the MMO elements make it better. It's clear that other players see NPC's in different places when they act out quests, but they share boss mobs?It's way too easy to accidentally attack a town guard. They're marked as hostile if they're fighting with other players so I jumped in thinking I was helping (it was the first guard I'd encountered) and got hit with the bounty.I also didn't particularly like how skills are tied to equipment given how clunky it is to change sets and the classes system goes entirely against the 'play it your way' feel of Elder Scrolls games. I'd have rather replayed the Shivering Isles, but few things are better than Sheogorath."
Negative,"SUMMERSET ->Alle wissen das ESO nix mit 'open world' zu tun hat, alles mehr oder weniger große Dungeon. In dem es in der Regel auch nichts neues zu entdecken gibt. Was beim Summerset aber, trotz liebe zum Detail und schöner Grafik, auffällt. Die schönen und imposanten Fassaden in den Städten haben keine Türen. Anderes als im erstlichen Spiel kann man in den Städten lang nicht alle ""Häuser"" auch betreten, nichts weiter als Fassade um die herrum manövriert werden muss und Schmuckherstellung ist nicht wirklich eine neue Spielmechanik, nur eine Option mehr das ohne zu kleine Inventar 'zu zu müllen'.Wer das Geld über hat und optisch mal etwas Sonne im Spiel brauch ist hier richtig, update oder upgrade sind aber falsche begriffe es ist nur eine etwas müde Erweiterung."
Negative,"I own all the previous games. I played this in beta and didn’t care for it. I tried again during this free trial and decided I will give it another shot for a month. However, I tried to purchase the plus membership, but it tells me I need to purchase the base game first. The PLAY GAME window says ""Play for free! Ends in 14 hours"" as of right now. I have been trying to purchase Elder Scrolls Online all day at the sale price of $20. It kept locking up and I was unable to make the purchase. Now after restarting my Steam client the price is back up to $30. I didn’t try purchasing it now because I don’t want it at $30."
Negative,"80 hours on the launcher, 17 hours on the game. In total that equals 97 hours of my life wasted"
Negative,"Good game, but don't buy it on Steam. You won't be able to log-in for several days a week."
Negative,The game wont play when i click playDont buy this until they fix it on steam.Amazing game but it doesn't work
Negative,it took you how long to put dragons in this game you want how much for DLCs what ever let me know when I can delete this from my steam games list.
Negative,servers dont work cant login tots gona try n get a refund 0/10
Negative,looked cool but quickly got old
Negative,"This is an Elder Scrolls-skinned MMO, with a large amount of bland writing, uninteresting quests, and gameplay that doesn't feel anything like SkyRim or Oblivion.  If you like MMOs, maybe you'll like this, but if you're looking for an Elder Scrolls game online, this isn't it."
Negative,RIP . there are tons of skills you can learn and upgrade but just can use 10 of them !!!?! HOW you learn a thing and can not use it ?! how WOW could do that ?! Items and lvling up is so cheap ! it is not entertaining and the game point is not obvious I mean you do not know what you have to do about game !? is it JUST farming Dolmen ?! what is the point of farming Dolmen all day long ?! such a beautiful game with nice quests but lack of gameplay and enjoy .
Negative,"I really wanted to like this. The quests were interesting and all voiced dialogue. However this was overshadowed by horrible, clunky combat and the gameplay loop just isn't fun."
Negative,This was literally the worst $80.00 i spent on a elder scrolls game. I bought it to play with my friends. However if someone completes a quest before the others they can no longer see that person because of phasing.
Negative,do not play this game
Negative,"Immediately felt unlike Morrowind, Oblivion, or Skyrim. I tried playing it to play with friends but found it very uninteresting and stopped playing pretty quickly. Wish I could have gotten my money back, but more than half of the 9 hours Steam shows me as having played was NOT playing, but waiting for the multiple huge install files and updates to download, so that already put me past the refund time limit.EDIT:Thought I'd give it a try again. So I waited an entire day (literally about 24 hours) for allllllllllllllll the update files to download (must have been a hundred gigs).Started it up, then got distracted and had it running on the menu screen in the background while I did other things.Finally started playing it last night. Took about five minutes making my character. Started the tutorial... and five minutes into the tutorial, the game crashed. So screw that, I was done for the night.Got a notice from steam today. ""Hey, you've played 32 more hours of this game. Would you like to update your review?""Yeah. Took an entire day to _update_, and then crashed as soon as I started playing.If anyone was wondering ""How do we get Bethesda to program their games better?"", the answer was not ""let them make an MMORPG""."
Negative,"Fucking expensive monthly fees... cant afford it, thanks""."
Negative,Better than most MMORPGs like KOTOR. Plays like your average elderscrolls game but with level limited acess to armor.butits almost unplayable at times. the servers are not up to the task. frame rate problems and lag that you litterally cannot play with. cant even try. just have to leave the game and try again when not in peak hours.the shame is this isnt a new problem. the fourms will show this has been going on since start up.i regret the time spent on this game.
Negative,"First off dont let the hours throw you off i was simply forced to redownload the game on steam as requested by the Bethesada support team as they apperently cant even manage to run a proper download for the game on thier on web page. Which is one of the primary reason for the negative review, over all the game it itself it pretty solid if you can ignore that many of the skills and spells in the game need serious patch work and will often be noticably flawed or have no graphic at all.                                                                                                                                                       The 2 major issues in the game are that server is insanly over populated and you will contantly be bogged down with random lag in all areas of the game most of all in any of the captial towns which will stall you completly and often force log you out after a pre set lag grace, making the game more of a log in simulator than a MMO. The 2nd major issuse is the customer support is absolutly horrible, they are almost impossible to get in contact with and the call center has an average of 3-6 hour hold times if they dont just drop the call on you forceing you to call again and be requed. And when you finally get in contact with them they simply will not offer any solutions to the connectivity issue and refuse to refund any amount at all for any services already payed for after wasting as much of your time as possible trying to stall you from the real issues with mind nummingly stupid and pointless Q/A's,Forums, and basic Trouble Shooting while trying to blame you for the problem with the most rediculous accusations from your Internet service provider to the rotation of the earth lol. Trust me dont waste your money on this Log In Simulator, sadly it makes no diffrence what potential the game may have if you cant stay logged in more than a hour or two at most with constant lag."
Negative,"Due to recent pay 2 win options the score has gone down.CBD score 4/10So with recent updates the game has turned into a pay 2 win platform. The last bunch of updates included powerful mythic armor items which were locked behind the DLC pay wall, now in June 2024 the gold road DLC will bring powerful spell crafting locked behind this pay wall. Due to this I can no longer recommend the game even after all my years & 8k+ hours playedThe company:Zenimax and bethezda are absolute garbage! Help is kept to a minimum to slide by & they refuse to keep to the EULA if it means loosing custom so is now full of underage players & trolls.The game - cons:The servers are the worst of any game I have ever played.The amount of exploiting that happens in game is beyond what you would expect form a company so proud of removing exploits.The game support is as bad if not worse than EA or ubisoft.Every update brings more bug's and after my time playing I have seen the same bug's rolled over year after year!The game is always full of bug's and has no in game support from dev's or mod's.It is not a megaserver! the game splits all your account and is not spread so xbox & psn are seperate, they also seperate NA and EU servers so anything you buy on one will not carry over to any other at all which is beyond a total rip off!The game - Pro'sAddictiveGreat idea even if badly implemented by useless morons.Awesome amount of things to be able to do and the best selection of open mid and small scale pvp, dungeons, trials, massive amount of pve and daily content to play through.Overall:The game is huge with so much to explore & do but over time has become a pay 2 win model & can no longer be recommended."
Negative,"I've been playing this game for two years now. I've been deeply immersed in the community, spent countless hours grinding away, logging in every single day... and after all of that I can say with confidence that this is NOT a game you should invest in. The developers DO NOT CARE what kind of experience you have, they only care about squeezing every last penny out of you that they can. The updates they DO give tend to break the game for end players, rather than make it better.They ignore and neglect the PVP side of the game (which yes, some of us enjoy) completely.They offer few or piddling rewards for hard work. A full body tattoo that is hidden by my armor? Yeah, no thanks. That's not much of a reward.The cool stuff is only available if you buy crown crates but crown crates are a bad deal. I've bought them once and would NEVER buy them again. What a disappointing and unsatisfying experience. At this point I ignore the news feed if/when I login because anything on there that I want is going to cost $20-$100 and who has that kind of cash just sitting around to waste on a frigging video game?I'm just so tired of it. Cancelling my eso plus sub and moving on to better games like Baldur's Gate III. Give me games that don't nickel and dime the crap out of players, please. That's where I'm headed.The ONLY way I would suggest coming back is if they majorly overall their reward system and actually make us players (who were playing every freaking day with an eso plus sub) some kind of REWARD so it feels like our work is actually WORTH something.Please heed my advice. Don't waste your time with this game. Because it WILL be a waste of time. You'll hit end game and realize there's no real reward for having done so."
Negative,"I do NOT RECOMMEND this game. If you are one of those people who got bored of your previous MMO and are looking for something that you can easily get into and not have to put in a ton of time. This game is not for you, contrary to what ESO players seem to recommend on reddit. The game is fun for 2 weeks before you get bored of questing. Aside from that there is so much broken systems its not worth your time and by the time you realize its to late to get your money refunded.PVP is completely broken even with their ""Scaling"". Not only is the scaling broken, it actually goes against the player. Every time you level your gear gets weaker and weaker till its useless..... Then you think hey it will be OK once I get to level 50 (160 CP (CP are levels after you max lvl 50)) because gear will stop weakening. Well that's when you realize that everyone who's been playing for years just gives their ALT characters the best gear and you are even worse then when you were lvl 1-50 in battle.On top of that if you want to get gear to compete with anyone else. You sadly are time locked into waiting on research. On top of that you need to get resources to be able to even make/upgrade armor.Basically the game is crap. You spend so much effort for nothing and if you don't have a friend to help you on quests you are out of luck. Everyone is already maxed and are not willing to help because they are to busy doing endgame content, which you wont be doing unless you are already maxed."
Negative,I had high hopes for this game as a huge bethesda fan but it did not feel like an elder scrolls game at all. It was a standard MMO with elder scroll elements to it. I truly hope bethesda doesn't make another MMO.
Negative,"I never even got to actually play it because there was some kind of issue with the access code, so I returned it."
Negative,"Boring, repetitive, and heavily grindy. Would not recommend this game, clearly just a paycheck for bethesda."
Negative,"BS! Bought the game years ago and bought one as a gift for my friend recently... THEY GOT THE MORROWIND DLC INCLUDED AND I DON'T?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? IF IT'S IN THE BASE GAME, I SHOULD GET IS AS WELL, LIKE... WTF?? EXCUSE ME?"
Negative,The game just likes to install itself.  Can't play it at all.  Apparently this has been a problem for years and it still isn't fixed.  Why would anyone spend more money on a product that simply does not work?
Negative,Horribly optimized game. Do not download. It will just give you a headache. Tried to install on PC and the launcher will get stuck. You can't update the launcher because it's in a limbo where it's neither Zenimax online's launcher or Bethesda's launcher.
Negative,"I love the Elder Scrolls series and was excited to play this game. The graphics, presentation, story, sound, atmosphere are all good. However the two things that spoilt it for me was the combat and disconnections. The combat compared to Sykrim, Witcher 3 and Vermintide 2 is very boring and lazy. I cut down this dark elf on the end of a pier and the body floated in mid air because the mechanics don't alow it to fall into the water. Not to mention the times I swiped at an enemy from 5 meters away and still got a hit! Oh and you also have homing arrows that can go through walls!The constant disconnections also affected the gameplay so I have not asked Steam for a full refund. If you can accept the combat (and the random disconnections stop) then you'll have fun.  Sadly I'll have to wait for Elder Scrolls 6 :o("
Negative,"Am a long time fan of MMOs and the Elder Scrolls series since the beginning with the likes of Everquest and Daggerfall/Arena. This game epitomizes instant gratification and everything wrong with MMOs, from the daily reward in your face every login to the very visual two button mashing Michael Bay-esque combat. Character customization feels lackluster. Questlines lack depth and move along hurriedly, probably to give a less grindy feel. No open world PvP. Level scaling is garbage, what's the fucking point of leveling then? I had to force myself to play after a certain point. Good thing I got it on sale for $10, otherwise I would recommend waiting for ES6 or Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen. Move along folks, this is an MMO for casuals."
Negative,"For an mmo this is pretty lame game, too casual and too few rewards, not to mention that Auri-El forgive me uttering the word ""clown store""  all cool stuff locked behind gambling, oh you want that cool mount? you better spend thousand dollars you might get it or not.Ever since u35 update late game content is prety much dead it's over.I cant believe i wasted 4000+ hours for this piece of buggy shit."
Negative,"terrible game, don't buy. doesn't feel like a elder scrolls game and the artstyle just looks like shit, the combat doesn't feel fluid and just overall the game shouldn't be marketed as a elder scrolls game. also there is no way to share quests with friends so there is no point bringing friends with you."
Negative,"I played WoW long ago, everything looked different there,different people,locations,places. In this game however,all high-level people,  gamma,nature etc looks so similar, that it's a more story-quest game,rather than online MMO, it feels like it's more for couple friends playing at a time, rather than many people on one server. The optimization is not that good too, graphics don't look so great, but fps drops below 50 in big city with high-end PC. Even Skyrim looked more different in all those cases.Don't get how people can be satisfied with this when there are other online games around,probably because there aren't any new worthy alternatives, but to me after old World of Warcraft(even though I didn't play for bunch of years), this is trashy"
Negative,"Got it on free week, and that how it's welcome new players:this trash keeps crashing every 10-60 seconds, even though I downloaded a massive 130GB game + launcher.Even after attempting multiple fixes, including checking files, downgrading and upgrading the launcher again, and reinstalling, the same ""corrupted files"" error continues to occur.Can't even register in game. Additionally, having to download its own launcher through Steam is a shame in 2024. I don't want to deal with 9000 launchers just to play one game. CEO go try investment in hiring a 3.5 programmers to update the code to integrate support for Steam servers... shame.scrap."
Negative,You'll die if you don't have friends to play with.....
Negative,The game is very old in terms of graphics and gameplay and needs a major update
Negative,A game of fetch quest with other players......Not to mention you pay a subscription to play the game you bought.....
Negative,My experience with this game so far has been as follows:1. Buy the game2. Refuse to pay additional money for ease of living in this game world3. Stumble around in mediocre quests with underpowered insufficient gear because I can't craft anything worthwhile4. Run out of inventory spacefun. :\
Negative,"This company completely screwed up the capability of having anything in any playable characters inventory or storage spot. It is totally ruined when it costs to have any items and expand inventory space, bank storage space. Fast travel is supposed to be free but its not so now its inconvenience fast travel! Many quests you'll even attempt you wont be able to progress alone. Your character stops doing any damage to certain bosses. More frustration than an enjoyable adventure. Don't even try to upgrade your items they will disappear. The crafting duration is a nightmare to even try to do. Another big let down."
Negative,"I did the beta for this game and it didn't work than. I $59.99 for the base game, now its $29.99, so I got cheated by The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel whatever. I do not get to see anything cool because I not spending tons of real money on this game. If you do not want to spend a lot of real money on this, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Its a true waste of time. Although Skyrim I have spent over 1300 hours played, the difference is Skyrim is a epic level game and this is showing Elder Scrolls is just plain greedy, and greedy does not sell!"
Negative,"Game is fun. however, is not intuitive and it is frustrating.  Just about everything is needlessly complicated. If you want to master this game, you will have to research the game as if writing a paper on game mechanics and lore."
Negative,"I have been playing this game for 2 years now, and I would like to say that I have met some lovely people here, and overall the game itself is good.HOWEVER...All the good things about this game are completely negated by the fact that  I have to stand in the mother tucking que in order to enter the game, for which may I add I pay. I have ESOplus, and now since they have decided to  give the game away for free and free membership for seven days, the game has been flooded by lots of CUNextTuesdayS, that ruin this game for all of us, that is if we get to enter the game ! To the developers, instead of  changing the design of already existing mounts and charging quiet a bit of money for them and doing some other weird staff , spend some time on the servers in order to improve the overall game experience. I have nothing against people joining this game for free for a little while  , I would love more people to come and play, but not at my expense, literally."
Negative,"I wouldn't recommend this game at all. I spent almost 2 days trying to fix a patching error that so many people have been having. I finally fixed it after hours of googling. However, once I finally got into the game after logging onto my account, I had to wait at the waiting screen for almost a half hour until I closed it and relaunched the game. After almost a hour and a half I was able to make a character and get throught the little tutorial. I got off for a little bit because I was going to go to sleep. I couldn't sleep so I had gotten back on to play more when I was sitting there waiting almost a half hour for the loading screen again. I googled this issue and it says that so many people, recetly too, are having problems getting into the game. Especially people with expensive and amazing gaming computers that also pay monthly to be set in a higher priority queue can't get on. I'd say save your money or buy a different game. I will only buy this game again once the issue is fixed and it would be on a PS console. Sad, I was so looking forward to this game honestly."
Negative,Cannot even install the game properly. ESO has always been poorly pathed for Steam but now it isn't even possible to install at all. Before you would have to install and then redo the file paths and now it cannot even install.
Negative,the we cant help u even though i pay 40$ for coin and nope it never happend
Negative,Soktumun oyunu 100 gb indirdik şimdide oyun kendi kendini silmiş bi kaç bişi yaptım bi sike yaramadı
Negative,a nice little game
Negative,can't refund unused eso+feels bad man.
Negative,"I'm sure this game would have been a lot of fun to play, however I couldn't play it. IDK whats going on at Bethesda but this was the dumbest experience I've had since my switch to PC gaming. So the game downloads, about 80gb, then as soon as it launches there's another 80ish gigs to download. Ok, whatever Bethesda, I'll play along. So over like 2 hours of downloading and installing just to run into the account issues. So I've never played ESO on PC, so naturally I attempt to create an account, tells me my email format is invalid. No idea what that means, so I look online and people are saying its because my username is taken. So I changed it, and it then tells me that my email already has an account tied to it.Kinda funny, since I've never played it before. So it requires me to have a username and password to login, which I obviously don't have, and there is no option to recover anything about my account. So I head over to the ESO webpage and try to access my account from there. I click the link that lets me change my password, It asks for my email, and it tells me there is no account matching my email... So I attempt to create an account using that same email, it says there is already an account using that email. I went back and forth with this several times, and I cannot figure out wtf is going on with it. So then I head over to the support page to submit a ticket, and before I can finish my ticket to submit, it links me to an account recovery page where I need the username that I still haven't been able to even prove exists, let alone is tied to my email. Refunded so fast, I hate Bethesda too much to even try anymore with this."
Negative,I just bought the game on steam and i cant make an account.It says tha this email already existed.I tried another mail and i still cant log in on this game.I try to find some help in the webpage for this game and i didnt  find anything for this particular problem that i have.I dont recommend this game for other playesrs. I spent money for nothing !!
Negative,"pretty casual game so if you suckass at every other game or have the mental capacity of a mola mola fish this game will appeal to youarmor looks cool, i play it for the dress upweird cash grab, not only is there micro transactions and a subscription-type paywall but also a LOT of DLC also needs to be bought if you are not a subscriberive never seen so many paywalls in 1 single game"
Negative,"People who are responsible for making me yet again to reinstall this game on steam should be kicked, punched, spit upon and called names, preferably both racist and sexist."
Negative,I hate it.
Negative,"Playing this game feels incredibly unrewarding due to the fact that practically all the cosmetics, mounts and so forth are in the store and sell for ridiculous prices. So in conclusion it feels pointless to play."
Negative,"Played Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivioin, Skyrim. Each of them for hundreds of hours and loved them.The problem with this game is it's not an elder scrolls game. It's really just an MMO with Skyrim style and features.This is an MMO first and an Elder scrolls game second, it's not interesting enough to keep me playing."
Negative,"First of all, my system requirements meet the RECOMMENDED specifications, yet I have to play at the lowest settings with low FPS. Second of all, I cannot play my god damn favorite race of the TES franchise (the imperials) because I'd have to pay additional 16$ to unlock it. My internet speed is decent, 15 mb/s with a ping of 70, however I lag so much at this game... I think it's simply badly optimized for PC."
Negative,"Total BlasphemyIts like an Elder Scrolls amusemnt park for kids.Some areas are quite pretty but only from certain angles, dont look too close at the floor textures or anything.You cant even swim underwater. So as an Argonian you can swim 50% faster, but you can only swim on the surface because the  zenicack studios was too lazy to create underwater spaces.You cant earn ""crowns"" which is used to get anything cool in the game such as mounts or pets or houses, you have to pay these Zeni-sh@t charlatans.The dialogue acting and writing is utter 5hite.The questing is headspinning and youll be in daggerfall one minute and some southern island of Vvardenfell the next.You dont feel the need to help any of these plastic characters.Every quest giving npc you make the mistake of talking to gives you the same generic quest with 3 map markers.The quests are easy , you dont even need to read or sit through the awful mind numbing voice acting.Just go to the map marker and kill the thing or interact with the thing.No brains needed.Thanks for the free weekend, but no thanks. You wont see one cent from me.This is really just a cheap WoW wannabe painted with Eldercrolls exploitation. Lacks the heart, the depth, and soul of Elder Scrolls.I do not recommend you waste your time here."
Negative,"My problem with the The Elder Scrolls Online is that it's just a generic MMO that reminds you constantly of the ways that the single player games are better. You start off by selecting a class instead of the wide open, improve-it-by-doing-it skill system of the Elder Scrolls games. Areas of the game are locked off by advancement, instead of being able to go explore anywhere that you can see that looks interesting. You're tugged around the setting by a linear storyline with side quests popping up rather than feeling like you're making your own decisions about how to proceed with the game. Maybe if it weren't called Elder Scrolls which makes it so that I can't help compare it to all the other Elder Scrolls games, I'd be excited that it's an MMO with a stealth system and first person, strike/block action melee combat, but it just feels like the best parts of The Elder Scrolls were stripped out and replaced with microtransactions."
Negative,"Horrible lag!  Its not file size or my internet connection.  Destiny plays just fine this game is unplayable.  I was denied a Refund saying I played for 6 hours, 5 of which were spent ""repairing""  I downloaded the game then tried to play and it said something was wrong and gave the option to repair but all that time counted as play time and they wont refund anything over 2 hours.  It was 100% a waste of money."
Negative,"Coming from FFXIV the dungeons and combat in this game just does not do it for me.I love that I finally get to explore all the places I dreamed about playing skyrim years ago, and seeing the world anc cities was really fun, but the repetetive combat and the way you just cannot die while fighting normal enemies just really breaks the mood for me. I personally don't reccomend it, but it never hurts to try."
Negative,"This game takes 5 hours to download with a decent internet connection. Or does it? as it has its own launcher so after you download whatever you downloaded for 5 hours you have to now download the game for 4 more hours except this is counted as playtime so due to steams pretty dumb refund polices you wont be able to refund the game without playing it first; I have a theory that we download nothing and we just have to wait 4 hours so we cant refund. Now for the gameplay. This game basically punishes exploration as fast as travel costs are exorbitantly high and will cost more than you will ever make by exploring. The best way to make money and get exp is to do dungeons which are grindy, slow, unrewarding and absolutely boring as you will likely get terrible loot and 1 item that you might use and it is a slight upgrade to the item you had and you repeat this forever until you get a set of gear that has outlived its usefulness as you have leveled up. Speaking of leveling you get a few classes and a few races but it does not matter as this game was meant to be easy. The skills you gain on level up are stat upgrades and sometimes a point you can spend on your active skills which are standard mmo skills, nothing special. The crime system can be summarized as bad loot and immortal, omnipotent guards. This game is not an elder scrolls game and a scam. Can only be fun with friends but, they will quit as it is an awful game -1/10"
Negative,60GB FOR THIS SHIT FUCK YOU ZeniMax Online Studios
Negative,in their tos it states that they sell your info to 3rd parties for advertisement and marketing purposes
Negative,Simplistic AF. Combat gets boring after an hour.
Negative,I don't even have an account made and its placed me at 5 hours of playtime very cool.
Negative,Yawn. Kept hoping it would get better but it never did. Boring and stale game play with limited class options. Definitely not worth the cost of all the of other pieces that would be needed to really invest.
Negative,after playin 242 hours and wasting my time on a cash grabbing game wich everything in it required real money to obtain and most of it via gambling ur (real money) currency realized that if u dont have any active friend or ur a solo player u can't accses most of in game content no trials no hardmode dungoens no world boss or any high lvl area activity unless u play it for 10k hour and reach 5000 champion points maybe then u can do shi** in this game . game is desined to make u gamble on ur money to obtain power wich make it pay to win . just dont buy it it's wors than ea games
Negative,"Have not been able to log in for a week.Everything would work, if I had not used Steam for making my purchase.Thanks Steam. Thanks Zenimax for not being able to design a proper API for login. :)Was a returning player. But uninstall helps reduce the load to HDD."
Negative,"The combat is pretty meh, I managed to find a rotation I liked but its still only one rotation.Rather than calling this an mmo, its more of a single player story game. Unless you're invested in the story/lore of TES races, I wouldn't bother. Personally I recommend Khajiit/High Elf and the Argonians in terms of quest quality."
Negative,"The latest iteration of the Elder Scrolls franchise, with a slapped-on multiplayer function... the basic game is still the same.  the poorly added multi-player functions seem out of place in the game. I have been enjoying it hiwever, the ES games fit that perfect niche between a beautiful ""Myst"" puzzle game and World of Warcraft. However... the online nature of the game and the fact that there have been alot of issues connecting to the server, the client crashing due to the server, server disconnects, server issues, unable to login due to not being able to  contact the server.... etc etc..Add that to the Crown store and the monitizing features that the Skyrim mod community really were better at creating..  and you have a lack luster game that is taking up space on my gaming pc.I was a paying ESO Plus member up until writing this review... Due to the latest server outage that prevented me from playing the game, I am better off sticking with an established game and wait for bethesda to release a proper non-online sequel to Skyrim and bypass this hack job of an MMO."
Negative,"Just not fun. The writing is as terrible as ever, but this time they've thrown in awful combat, where it doesn't matter if a blow visually hits or not. You also can't swap between weapons on the fly, bizarrely, until you're level 15. The concessions to being an MMO make everything irritating, with monsters respawning right in front of you, and people running around in the middle of the quest that supposedly you were given alone.I spent more time messing around with my inventory than having any fun."
Negative,I couldn't get the launcher to launch the game. Had to return.
Negative,This shit is so boring I spent 2 hours in the tutorial and couldn’t get my money back
Negative,"if I had a much, much higher carrying capacity without having to grind for months or pay for it, this would be a great game. but since I don't, this game is getting uninstalled and probably never played again."
Negative,Do you like not playing a game?Do you like the fact that when you wait x amount of hours you have to wait a further y amount of hours?I sure don't.
Negative,"Idk what to say, MMO's suck and I don't know why most people play them still."
Negative,fix the facking game launcher already ive spent to much time and money to get f*cked over like that on a game i want to playn i cant recommend this game tell you fix it so its playable one pissed off customer
Negative,"I have played this game for 1.5 years on xbox and 6 months on pc do not pick this game up how it's currently going. It has been getting worse over the years, the lag is getting worse they say they will fix the lag and that was 3 years ago. tonight i had nice ping spikes of over 7000 and i was playing the NA server and btw i live in NA so no reason i should get that. these super laggy servers are only from this game over games im fine with"
Negative,"So, I bought the game awhile ago and was going to get into it again and buy the new dlc just to spend time with more of the ES universe, but they went woke and added a blue haired mental illness character. It's even voiced by someone who does drag.I'm sick of these weirdos shoving in their fetishes into every type of entertainment I like."
Negative,"I have tried to get this scrap code to work, with no luck. The play time log is a mess , I have spent an hour trying to get this to play, but it says I have 10 hours played, So no refund from Steam. Avoid this garbage at any and all costs."
Negative,doesn't worth it
Negative,"Piece of shit. Tried once and now can't even login. Says I've played  for 2 hours, so even refund isn't possible anymore."
Negative,I dont know... I didnt fell in love with it. I wanted to but I did just not happen.
Negative,It is a subscription based game so unless you want to pay about $15 a month to play then don't buy this game.
Negative,"good in the beginning, but gets infuriatingly tedious and nickel-and-diming later on"
Negative,this game is so boring
Negative,"could not login, whatsoever, not sure what the issue is, tried looking it up to see if anybody else is having the same issue, and could find a solution, tried playing this game over, and over, would get my money back if i could, this kinda really let me down."
Negative,If someone can can relate. Te game looks cool and everything but every time i log in and play for like 1hr or so i get bored because the game is not engaging and the missions are repetative. maybe Im not playing the game right? If someone knows the point to this game please let me know.
Negative,"Everything exept The elder scrolls...Microtransactions, it just looks like that ''free to play'' game Neverwinter but worse. No story, Just plain boring.I played The elderscrolls III VI and V. And this is just a disaster..."
Negative,well.. i got duped for another 50 bucks.. another shit mmo to add to the already huge pile of shit.. immeditly went back to guild wars 2 bye lvl 8.. story is so bland and dry.. from the story itself to the delivery.. if your a fan of the series.. dont let this steamer drag it down for you
Negative,"This is a fantastic ""waiting for an update to load"" simulator. 78 minutes of ""game"" time, and probably 70 of those are watching a progress bar slowly fill for the gigantic patches, getting bored, and quitting."
Negative,If you will play on the EU server - you should be ready for awful lags and errors.
Negative,Fucking money sink. Like skyrim but for shit birds.
Negative,I cant buy the base game after my free trial expired. Says my license has expired an gives no option to renew.
Negative,Guild Wars 2 is better.
Negative,"Ridiculous. Charges recurring for premium after specifically stating that it is a once-off purchase.If the game wasn't as boring as it is I'd gladly pay for the service - alas, i'd rather pull my fingernails out as that is likely going to be more entertaining.Insane."
Negative,"I do not reccomend this game due to the fact that this feels like a single player title with the hardest most restricted multiplayer elements in quest sharing i've ever seen....You must be elegible to do your friend's quest. 1. You cannot have already done the quest. Guild Wars 2 had no issues with this because playing with your friends and having fun was the goal. 2. The quest cannot be a main story or alliance based quest. Really? Why not? what's the point of having an MMO that is restricted in all the ways a Massive Multiplayer Online should never be! I regret buying this game because of that one fact...I was able to live with the lack of good voice acting and the terrible server connections, but not when the game totally shits on the only reason I bought this was to play with my fellow gamers on a great franchise. I personally give ESO a 4/10 in the PVE MMO aspect. The PVP, I hear, is grand and if that's all you care for, go ahead and drop 60 bucks. 10/10 would refund again..."
Negative,"Это не тот скайрим(карта скайрим покупается отдельно) который хотелось бы видеть. Выглядит эта игра как старые игры чтобы убить время. Но стоит эта игра 800 рублей! Что можно сделать/купить на эти бабки, которые тебе в будущем помогут: патроны .308 17шт.швейцарские франки 11штпойти в мак и купить двойной биг тейсти мак комбо за 385 руб и еще останется(ну или купить два).Игра заслуживает внимания, если хотите поспать (музыка красивая, спору нет) квесты настолько серые/неинтересные что я буквально проходя их - я засыпал. Физика стрел - они на минуту буквально летят за  тобой но сука что дальше 20 метров они просто не долетают, хоть на луну направь(ладно снаряды из посоха ок). С большой вероятностью я неполучу обратно денег, хотябы на стим, ибо было наиграно 5 часов с другом. А точно графика на уровне 2000-2007 года ужасно смотреть как твоя броня это полигоны. Ставлю за ПЛАТНУЮ игру 2\10 где 1 бал это музыка а 2 это...Спазибо за внимание."
Negative,"This game combines all the worst aspects that MMO can have, which destroys the whole sense of immersion, pure disgrace for the Elder Scrolls universe. I really tried to just focus on the story - but after two hours, I realized that just reading a wiki would be much more enjoyable. Better wait for TES 6."
Negative,fucking game paid 80$ to get the stupid game by the time i did try it was already past the refund time and got deny for refund now am like 10h ingame to realise that u cant fucking do jewelery and there more dlc that u cant find on steam u gota buy shit call crown to buy them THAT A TOTAL RIP OFF !!! totaly not worth !!!
Negative,"While I only played for, oh, 30 minutes (the play time is wrong - it's a ridiculously huge game and I had to walk away from the launcher), I refuse to put more time in. ""Do this, do that, do this, do this again, do that."" I've pondered playing this before, but didn't feel like it was something I wanted to put my time into. Now that I've played it, I know I don't want to put my time into it. I was drawn in by the homesteading addition and, when I saw it on sale, had to give it a shot. It was a waste of my time.So, I don't recommend this. It looks like it will suck your soul and for no benefit. I didn't feel compelled in anyway whatsoever to continue to click on things - I already have a job.EDIT-------For those that doubt the legitimacy of this review, I stand by the fact that, no, I would not recommend this game. If a friend were to say, ""Have you played Tamriel Unlimited? Would you recommend it,"" my reply would be, ""Yes I have, and no I don't."" That cannot be disputed. If you have a problem with the framework of my review, I understand that it's not very thorough, but trust me; I don't recommend it. There are a bevy of other reasons: graphics, physics, battle mechanics, but, alas, I don't feel like giving this much more of my time. You will have to settle with a half-assed review, but, please, don't doubt my ability to determine whether or not I recommend something."
Negative,"this game when theres a new dlc its just a small new part of map u have to pay like 40$ for the renew suscribtion is broken on steam . thiis is a big pay to win game. These guys are very good at taking money from gamers. There also very bad when it comes to custermor service as well, been waiting on simple things for months. they never resolved my gifting or even replied, when its time to renew eso plus they make you run circles. ps, i made a eso accout like 8 years ago i forgot the password right im trying to get on my account via internet. And they email my old email right witch isnt enough they want the security quistion they asked me when i was a lil kid, i dont remember my password but ill remember my fav author ? give me a break, and your emailing my old email thats not enough? they are so bad. no ways of contacting for certain issues. Everyone has a problem with steam purchases through this game when it comes to eso plus. Dont waste your time."
Negative,"This game has potential, but it falls short.If you want to play a MMO solo, it's pretty good, but the party mechanics are terrible, the worst MMO in that category. But by far the worst thing about this game is that nothing is ever instanced, you hardly get a feel of the action because there's a swarm of players at every boss. Collectibles like mining, chopping trees and chests are one time only, if a player collects, no one else can, and there is not enough to go around as in Tera for example. You can't play this game at your own pace, you gotta rush through and jump at every oportunity to get an item. And looting is terribly dull in this game, a serious issue for a Elder Scrolls game."
Negative,This game was less fun to play than Morrowind is today.  The the questing is so bland.  I think this game is a slap in the face to the entire series.
Negative,"Do not buy this game on Steam. I sadly wasted $60 buying this thinking it would work. After uninstalling twice now and trying to use the ""repair"" option multiple times, I'm giving up. I'm uninstalling steam and going to try and get a hard copy like I should have done in the first place. Fuck Steam."
Negative,"Buy to play game at its best....Beautiful World and nicely done Gear-,Stealth-,Fight- and ""Dungeon- (not Instance) system.The Active Playerbase makes this game somewhat playable at low levels.Big NOGO though:90% DLC´s only buyable with ingame crowns with no sight on discount (so ud need to spend like 120 more € for the ""full game"" with all its contents).As a NON ESO-Plus member ur SLOWED/held-back so hard it hurts...Some Classes and Craftings only for DLCS buyers.. WTF why?!Typical MMO ""features"" would be the dissapointing Hit-mechanic: You hit an Enemy he doesnt move an inch ..but dmg numbers apply and then it eventually dies in a bad animation..ok nvmlots of delivery run-around-missions or back n forth travel Quests.Beeing same as other MMOS or treating us the same way (non-Subscribers that pay 15€/Month) makes this game WORSE then others!! cuz u rely on ppl paying because its the way others do...ok dont be innovative or creative... do the same old shied then... it pays off anyway...right? enough idiots run around paying and saying thats standart.. not realizing they are the reason this will never change.. because of them its standart.. I understand u gotta pay ur Bills too and make off Money from new Content u invested in and im willing to pay for those but not on the same price level of the Full-gameprice i paid already.Those Contents dont change the game itself to something new it just ADDS to the game so there is no new wheel invented.If the Devs woudnt punish non Premiumers they would have a MUCH larger playerbase thus more ppl buying ur content thus allowing cheaper prices.. but hey im just a single voice right...Conclusion:if ur not willing to pay.. this game still can be fun.. u just have to ignore the stuff u could have with a Plus membership and run trough the hurdes thrown at you at PURPOSE until u reach the buy to play wall.If u want the full ESO Experience you gotta pay!! the Premium membership is nice though because you get the crowns to actually buy the DLCs you want (and tested) so you can quitt the Premium again..dont get used to Crafting,Horsing and Inventory Space too much though.Since im not a fan of Buy-a-Game-to-buy-more-later-on-for-fullprices i will NOT recommed this game!! save your Bucks to save more later on.Dont get Baited by STEAM discounts there are WAY more DLCs to this game then steam shows.."
Negative,A failure as a TES gameA failure as a roleplaying gameCommits lore rape on levels Todd Howard couldnt even dream ofThe only remotely interesting quest are locked behind freenium currentcy(which cost 3 times as much as it has any gods damned business costing) only paywalls.Wasnt worth the $5 i wasted on it.2/10.
Negative,this game feels like it been cheaply done and half finishedfishing no skill and a pole apears in your handsyou can pay real money for just about any thing you can dream ofcombat is very basiclevel progression from 1-50 is just bad still killing mobs with same hit  points nothing scales in this gameyou can have 5 skills plus one ultimate very badly done sad to say this has some of the lore from elder scrolls but none of the game playto join thieves guild cost real moneydark brotherhood cost real moneythis game is a cash hog
Negative,"It's like one of those ""pay once, play forever"" games, except it's more of a ""pay once, play like a fourth of the game, and THEN, PAY US MORE""And, it's not even in a good way. like, I dunno, I guess WoW expansions, where it starts to be free to play the older expansions, after the newest one comes out.It's just, ""Hey, you guys wanna pay 30 bucks for our game? yeah, nice, nice, now pay 20 more for this expansion."" Then twenty seconds later, they pop their head into the window, just like, ""Oh, also, if you want to have any chance of crafting anything without constantly running outta bag space or having to make fast friends with the bank man, pay us 15 bucks a month.""Like, jesus christ, man. If you wanna run it like WoW, and just charge 15 bucks, just do it, and stop beating around the bush."
Negative,absoluteleyboringoh and the combat system sucks
Negative,"Compatibility with Mac is horrible. Anytime I submit a bug request, It auto-closes it as resolved."
Negative,"I was on the beta for this game. I would lie in bed, restless, just worrying about this game. I wanted to like this game so much but at the end of the day all they care about is your money. It was 60 dollars i spent on this game upon release just to find out they wanted MORE MONEY. So after a bunch of backlash they decided to keep the subscription and make the game free, i played the game a decent bit and then found that i hit a wall and stopped after only 100 or so hours. I have revisited the game now at the beginning of 2023 and now not only does it cost money BUT THERE ARE DLCs THAT COST MORE. This game has become nothing but a cash cow for Bethesda, they do not care the slightest bit how we feel about the game and I recommend you just forget about it. This game continues to crush my dreams even years later."
Negative,"I payed $24 for this game back in december and have never once gotten to play it.. at first it said i was missing d3dcompiler_43.dll, then i read on some forums to install 5 or 6 other .dll files, reinstall the game, reinstall my entire system. nothing has worked and now i'm told by steam that because they recorded i've played the game more than 2 hours (which was the time i spent with the launcher open and the game wouldnt even start) that now i'm not even able to get a refund. i dont recommend this game or the use of steam powered. its all garbage designed to screw you out of your money. save time and aggravation and just go purchase the game in a retail store and dont use this garbage app."
Negative,questing is iffish at best game is ok
Negative,Got this on the free weekend. Feels like every other MMO I've ever played with only the flavor of Elder Scrolls.
Negative,THis game sucks really. hitboxes are fake news.
Negative,"bruh moment. It's like skyrim, but not fun."
Negative,"About a 3rd of my time is taken up by crashes.  There are times when the game doesn't crash, but those are rare.  I put up with it for a while, but I am tired of fighting this game.  I have reinstalled a few times, no luck.Also, most of the time I crash is when I am encountering a NPC, hostile or not, usually hostile.  When I am able to log back in, I am dead and have to spend a soul gem to resurrect.  If I am in a cave or dungeon, I am hooped.Unless you want to spend a good deal of time getting killed off after you have been punted from the game, don't bother.  And good luck getting logged back on."
Negative,"Good game but garbage dev company, ZOS will randomly pick up a reason and banned good players forever, ""you have trade with multiple stolen account"" oh wait I suppose know those are stolen?what a jokeI'm done for this game. Suggest for others: never buy plus for more than one month, they not gonna return the rest whatever reason you provide."
Negative,"is anybody else having trouble starting there game online. i havnt been able to play for 2 days. i restarted my computer and i downloaded the game again but no good,,im getting pissed"
Negative,all of my playtime was being stuck in loading screens. wow
Negative,If you are planning to get this i say don't. Automatic renewal of membership without refund is what they do with your bank account. zenimax nevermore
Negative,"I liked this game, but now, when I want to update the game, it doesn't work!! I want my money back!!!A sad gamer..."
Negative,Does not work!
Negative,"It's a MMO, Guild Wars 2 or Age of Conan are f2p and exactly as good as ESO. They are different and focus on different elements but they are both ""another perfectly acceptable MMO"".This game isn't bad but at the same time there isn't a single feature that pops out."
Negative,"Bought this game on steam for cheap and found out all the DLC was either in the gold edition or bought through in game currency. Game is fun but the equipment is very generic for itemization and based entirely around sets. Really upset about all these stuff in the game having a big YOU DONT OWN THIS DLC LOL over it. Will keep playing but not going to drop $30 bucks on all the old DLC in game or $40 for the new morrowind one, yuck! If you are going to get this, get the Gold edition when its on sale so you don't miss out on the stuff from it."
Negative,"I have been playing ESO on Steam for only 503 hours, but have played every day for 2 years on PC before purchasing ESO on Steam earlier this year. It was probably the MMO I enjoyed the most. It is similar in many ways to the single player Elder Scrolls game I enjoy, Skyrim. It is also better than other MMOs I have played in combat difficulty (more challenging), variety of quests (lots to do), and amazing variety of options for player housing, mounts, and cosmetics.  Huge money and time sink so stay away if you value either.The Pros:Beautiful environment and graphics.Versatile gear and builds.Gear capped at a certain level - you don't have to keep grinding higher level gear.Variety of mounts, pets, player housing, crafting styles, furnishings, etc. allows for a lot of creativity.Housing system allows you to craft furnishings and place furnishings you have bought or crafted wherever in the house you please.Lots of PVE quests, dungeons, trials, and PVP activities.You can sink 6,000 hours into this game easily and still not have every achievement completed on your main character - lots of playability.Cons:Crown store has a lot of the coolest housing, mounts, and outfits.Loot boxes called crown crates have an rng gambling mechanic to them.No way to trade gold for crowns directly like you can trade items meaning someone has to give gold or send from crown store first, opening players to scams.Combat can be kind of clunky and in areas with a lot of players like the PVP zones, you can randomly hit a load screen or disconnect.A lot of content can be soloed, including the personal story and even group bosses once your level is high enough, but since this is an MMO group play is necessary at some points unlike the single player Bethesda games.Leveling up mounts and crafting can take a lot of time - sometimes months - if you only use in game gold to learn mount skills and speed up crafting.Skills like mount speed, crafting, skill-points collected and achievements do not apply to every character on your account, only experience gained past max level does. Chests and harvesting nodes in the open world can only be harvested by one player before they de-spawn for a while, allowing people to steal nodes and chests and allowing for griefing."
Negative,Going into Concord territory eh. Lets see where it'll get ya. Spoiler: Into the bin! Almost dodged a bullet reinstalling this!
Negative,NOT ENOUGH ENDGAME
Negative,This game is dog shit dont buy
Negative,i remember playing all the beta's and having a decent time i then started playing recently and not one bit interesting
Negative,"Good game, But the developers are true cuckholds not offering OCE players something better because we get absolute dog shit PING"
Negative,"Probably I miss vanilla WOW, before all the ""community requested upgrades and modifications"", which were overall a shame and destroyed the game. Probably I'm disappointed that the awesome feal of the single player Elder Scrolls games is missing. And for sure, personally, in-game purchases are a total deal breaker. I much prefer subrcriptions than in game stores. Tried several times to play this game. I just can't get into it. Didn't dig enought to understand the class system, leveling etc... but I just don't get involved. If you also have problems with this ""new generation"" of MMOs, probably you will have a hard  time approaching the game. Otherwise, you will probably enjoy it. It looks great, everything seems polished and it is, after all, Tamriel. But something is missing. I prefer to keep the memories of the time spent in Morrowind, Cyrodill and Skyrim intact."
Negative,"I got talked into trying this out as I'm a fan of the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series (well, not FO 4)... and while I didn't expect this game to be a RPG, I have to say this game is just ... well ... really dumb. To put this 'dumb' comment in perspective, I'm the creative force who has raised and nurtured ""Johnny the Flatulent"" to a level 8 Dragon Knight - I take this stuff really seriously. I mean, I can get over the fact that Johnny can't really aim his bow - those infinite arrows make that irrelevant. Or that every time I try to work through a dungeon, some jag on a flaming panther flies past and causes 20 new bad guys to spawn making the fight extra hard for poor Johnny. Or that every time Johnny fights a boss-level opponent, they (not Johnny) seem to get confused when they reach 10% health, return to their spawn point, fully heal, and start the fight all over again. And then the knob on the flaming panther reappears ...But explain to me why, when dear Johnny levels up, he feels the insatiable need to bust a ridiculous move? For the love of Pete, act like you've been there before Johnny, I didn't raise you like this. I mean, you are in a cave with dozens of skeletons trying to tear you to pieces, these aren't the audience tryouts for the Arsenio Hall show circa 1991. Take this stuff seriously. Rant over. ...and I don't recommend buying this game."
Negative,Fps drops too mutch.. and dialog is just skip skip who cares
Negative,Devs absent? Game has notorious issues with launching and no amount of support for zenimax can helop. Continuously tried every recommended fix and nothing works. Havent been able to play the game in 1 year + while everything else works flawlessly on my machine
Negative,"* Pay to win skill lines.* Crown scammers.* Overpriced DLCs/Expansions.* DLCs getting removed from steam and added to ingame store (which shouldn't have be an issue if  only they had regional pricing,which they don't)* No asian/oceanic server."
Negative,"This is one of those games that doesn't take your personal life into account, don't start it, you'll hate yourself"
Negative,"Pros: Good mmo fun to play. Some npcs. Best housing system.Cons: money, money, money. The prices of the crown store are insane. People used to trade gold for crowns to buy what they couldn't offer with real money in the crown store. Now they can't. I feel really bad for the people who relied on the crown gift. When you ''pause'' something important like that you need to tell your customers before doing it when you respect them... Someone wrote ''it's their game they do what they want!'', ok but without me my subscription is now canceled and i start searching for another mmo. Pax dei maybe?Good luck for the moderators of the next stream on Twitch, poor Gina Bruno..."
Negative,Doesn't know what it wasnts to be. Trying hard to be Elder Scrolls yet failing at being an mmo. 6/10
Negative,"If you are a fan of The Elder Scrolls Saga, do not buy this game, it will certainly disappoint you. It feels a lot more like a 2010 free MMORPG game than an Elder Scrolls one."
Negative,1/10. totally terrible game servers. You cannot do proper PvP because of the delays and PvE is shit anyways. I wish i could take back the time i have spent on this garbage. Go play wow instead.
Negative,"played a few times and all that it did for me was make me angry i will not support payed walls and this is that exactly every mount,gear,weapons,pets behind payed wall and if we support this they will keep doing it stay away from this game find another mmo"
Negative,"TESO does some things right, and some things abhorantly wrong, especially the steam version. Note that this viewpoint is from a player who dropped ~18 hours, so I saw a good chunk of how the game would play, but maybe not how it worked endgame.Combat mechanics: Alright, I guess. It's not a tab target MMO but I'm not the biggest fan of having a secondary weapon slot. It is a console setup hotbar/button setup, though. Dodging is nice but the CC breaking stuff feels tacked on. My magic melee templar build was fun.Questing: Very bland, there wasn't much to go on. Maybe someone who is super into the Elder Scrolls lore would like it much more, but I wasn't engaged. Lots of fetch-questy running around, and the main campaign was very... slow. Maybe it was since I was started in Summerset, but still.The PVP: Actually, really fun. It is however, brought down by the gear scaling making you get devestated by full yellow eq/enchant twinks. It's sorta oneshot or be oneshot. Alliance war stuff is nice, though.Dungeons: Purely meh so far, probably more interesting at the end. I did enjoy some of the bosses mechanically but the ""tutorial"" feeling of dungeons sorta sucks.Trials: Didn't get to touch, apparantly cool though. Can't say much about them.The Steam client issue: Hilariously enough, just the Steam version breaks very frequently. When you say you bought the steam version and bring up the issues, everyone tells you DONT BUY THE STEAM EDITION! Of course, you aren't going to look around at first for it due to the fact that picking up an MMO on sale means you probably aren't going to delve into third party/hidden forums about it. Also, the Launcher booting on its own and unpacking (and of course, this is going to sound very conspiracy-esque) means that people who aren't on an SSD may not be able to refund if they didn't like the game, due to having to run the game client to install. This also likes to stick open after you close the game.Overall, you may like it, but I didn't find the sum of the parts to make a good whole. I wouldn't raise pitchforks and sneer at you for buying it, even if I don't think it's a good game,  just dear god avoid the steam edition."
Negative,"Ok I played this game about 100 hours by now. But not through Steam. See below.The Good+) Well if you are a fan of Elder Scroll Series is great to continue. +) Quest system is unique and generally they dont feel like grinding+) Quite free to build the character how you want, like you want. That is if you dont have FPS issues (see below).The So-So!) Very slow to get through to level 50 cap. The xp system is unbalanced. The best way to get xps is to kill mobs in dungeons whitout completing it. Site quests give miserable xp.!) Inventory management is just awful. If you want to make money to buy a horse you need to sell through guild you join - NPCs merchants buy from you at 1/10th of the real price. Provisioning and Enchanting give you to too many mats who clog your inventory. Places to sell are far and wide!) Immersion is not good. You are alone in a Dungeon, progressing slow, stealthing, repositioning, doing your quest, then suddenly a group of three guys coming for the skyshard with over level characters zip through and clean the place in seconds... Awful just awful.!) Add-ons are cool and helpful but not as great as in Skyrim. No content Add-on. Only Add-ons that makes your live easier.!) Crown shop (for money) is generally selling uninteresting stuff at inflated prices.The bad-) Low appearance customization of your character. Faces look the same. The dye option for cloths is clunky and gets to very weird end results.-) FPS crashing in towns and dungeons. I have a good PC play numerous recent Multiplayers online games on it without issues (including large scale battles in Guild Wars 2). ESO was the first big issue. FPS is 80-100 most of the time. But in cities it drops for short moments to 10. In group dungeons 30-40 most of the time! But you can still move around with jumps and positioning with fights is bad but workable if you spam certain skills and gear for survivability.-) FPS in PvP makes it unplayable. When I join a small skirmish of a few players. FPS crashes down to 1-5. Which is just unplayable. I tried 5 different techniques to increase FPS with mix results. The main culprit seems to be their game engine and how it uses sound cards and CPU. I had to stop playing through steam to gain a few frames.-) Interaction with others. Guild chat is not good. Group chat is not good. Zone chat is mostly about selling. You feel surrounded by ghosts in Tamriel. Not by players. Also in PvP, group search lags and is unresponsive. PvP map is huge and you will have a hard time finding where the action is. If you dont have a horse, forget it ... will take you an hour to get to the other side of the map.Generally, not happy about the purchase. Delete it? No, I ll quest solo a bit more."
Negative,"Don't play if you like to make jokes. After 3,500 hours I got a ban for making a joke, sure it was kinda raunchy, but apparently it broke the rules. They denied my appeal. Spent of much money in game, waste so much time. They said it was not their issue if it was my first offense, my joke was very inappropriate for chat.Ironically they said kids could see the comment. Then admitted kids shouldn't be playing the game. So my joke is wrong, because kids might be playing a game they shouldn't? That is my fault? Huh?"
Negative,Ruined by needless cash-grab techniques.
Negative,Sometimes I want to write a passionate review.Sometimes a game is just so utterly unsatisfying all you can do is sigh.Sigh.
Negative,"All jokes aside, this game actually sucks."
Negative,"3 hours already and I can't even istall the game, game doesn't download launcher, installer files, you can't reach to developer support because you don't have crash file from launcher, waste of time and money"
Negative,"some player from malaysia and Romania cant login sometime , server said that connection time is out ,but we bought the game for fun , if we cant play whatever time we want , how to having a fun ? we fail to login time is about 12am~5am please take this to be a serious problem ......."
Negative,Ill change my review after I get to play the game... I have 25 hours logged on this game of waiting for the launcher to do the initail patch. Downloaded all through the day and night and now its at 95% with 2000 mb left downloading at 20 kb a second...
Negative,"If you have too much money, buy the sh*t out of this money grab.Want to play a certain faction? Sorry you need to buy it.Want to play a certain chapter? Sorry, you need to buy it.Oh, you want ONLY that and not ALL of it? Sorry, no can do. You have to buy what's essentially The Game again for the price you paid for the game, again, and then some. They need to make money, you see.I'll just play it three times.For every faction once and then say goodbye.And the studios wonder why the people mod the sh*t out of old games."
Negative,"ZOS just ruined this game, making it literally unplayable. 1hr 30m+ Queue times just to LOG IN to the game. Nobody is going to wait for this. Removing my ESO+ sub. This needs fixing now. This is a queue simulator right now, not a game."
Negative,"Consegui jogar apenas 4 horas do game para um MMO isso é muito pouco agora não posso pedir reembolso.Já esta a dias assim "" an error has occurred. please wait a few minutes and log in again "" e ainda sim não consigo mais logar."
Negative,"I havent played the game since 2015 on ps4 & wanted to give it another chance. However, the game is not able to load after multiple/long installation processes. please fix it"
Negative,"I keep trying to play this game for some reason while it's free on steam, but it never stuck with me. This is my second attempt at this game and there are a few design decisions which I feel that need to be spoken out, as I can't stand playing this game because of them.Animations feel floaty, clunky, slow, and they're all over the place. It's like someone tried too hard to make them feel like something unrealistic. Taking a small step in every direction & animations not stopping properly, or being in sync with the speed that I'm running, and having me seeing it the majority of my play through is a show stopper for me.I don't remember having this problem with any game that I've played, sorry If seem a bit nitpicky, but how animations work, well at least the ones related to running & the feedback I'm getting from it, it's something that I can't stand & they need an overhaul in my opinion.Why must my character turn around and face me every time I open my inventory, or the main menu? Why is this even a thing?There are too many loading screens / unnecessary areas. Especially the tutorial area, you know, the part where the player first encounters the game and makes his first impressions on it?I find it very weird that Vivec City has so many loading screens while going into small rooms or corridors. It's claustrophobic at most.I've joined the mages guild in Vivec City and the guy told me about some books. I've kind of expected something more? Common guys, be realistic, you're not even trying."
Negative,Bethesda does it again. Time-consuming and not even a good RPG.
Negative,game is trash
Negative,"Not Worth it! Bought DLCs, cash, membership. Not worth it! Had characters in both servers. TOO LAG TO PLAY! and its not my internet or PC! Complain Ignored! TWICE! NVR going to play again. Very disappointing! FOR THOSE WHO ARE THINKING OF BUYING! DON'T! IT WILL ONLY BE PLAYABLE FOR THE FIRST MONTH! AFTER THAT IT WILL BE TOO LAG TO PLAY!"
Negative,"It's 125 gigs and every time I log in it treats me like a new player, making me set brightness and accept those massive Terms of Service agreements and whatnot.Other than that, it's just not very fun. The combat is just not fun or satisfying at all. It's like Morrowind but without any of the compelling RPG stuff, just shallow quests and a non-functional combat system.I definitely do not recommend."
Negative,"Should you play ESO in 2023? The answer is No, probably not.Let's have a look at the hype:- ""Explore vast landscapes!"". Vast landscapes made up of 128x128 textures of repeated wood, rock, wood. wood, rock, sand, wood. rock. brick. rock, sand wood.- ""You can spend all day just admiring everything!"". In the same way you'd admire granddad's underpants. The graphics are horrible; akin to Half Life 1: no bump mapping, no specular mapping, texture res is awful, the model resolution is like playing GoldenEye on the N64.- ""Entertaining story and exciting gameplay!"". Lies. It's effectively the RPG equivalent of Candy Crush Saga. Talk to guy with mission. Go up to bad guys and randomly smack them over the head. Find lost treasure/person/random shit. Press E. Go back. Repeat with other mission guy.- ""Immersive Experience!"" Any degree of immersion is completely destroyed when you have to find left Alt on your keyboard to close a pop-up because you're not allowed to use your mouse. It was plainly made for console and ported. By one-armed, blind chimps. - ""...incredible talent of the voice actors!"" Seriously? The voice acting is painful. Is this girl Australian? No she's South African. Scottish? American? ...Canadian First Peoples? What's she even telling me to do? WHAT IS SHE EVEN SAYING IN HER NONSENSE PRETEND ACCENT??On the plus side in the interest of balance:- ""Join over 22 million players!"" This could well be true. There is genuinely a massive player base still. I was doing the tutes with 2 other people. There were people everywhere. Maybe I've yet to appreciate the degree of the social aspect. Maybe this is worth the ocular sodomisation which is the graphics?- ""No game subscription required!"". This is completely honest. No subscription, not hounded by in game purchases to buy gold bars or megacoins or smegma-dollars or some crap. Looks like you can actually play without only being allowed to use the blancmange sword because you've not bought the ""Advanced Weapon Pack"". In this day and age, respect.Overall if you want to play this rather boring, horrible-looking, basically retro-gaming number: it's playable, it still works, and there are still users. Steam do 70% sales on it nowadays. If you've got an RTX4090, you might however not _fully_ be using it to its full potential on this number. I personally would literally rather go outside and interact with humans than play this. It has clearly not been updated or maintained to keep up modern specs."
Negative,"After a lot of delibaration I decided to give this game a negative. I won't go into details of what's good and bad about gameplay, there is a lot of both, and probably many others wrote detailed reviews about it.My decision to grade it negatively comes from one thing that happened this year, and it was the last straw for me, even though I'll probably continue to play this game on and off, because there is still a lot of content I want to finish. Anyway, the game has really boring events (you pretty much just do dailies for better prizes, that's all), and during these events you get special tickets, that you can exchange for unique stuff. This year, they started giving you parts, that you could combine and get a mount. Which would be pretty cool, because there's almost no mounts to obtain through normally playing the game, 99% of mounts you can only get by engaging in loot crates -GAMBLING- (in a full priced game). So I got 2 parts out of three, and then came a new event, which was the first and only chance of obtaining the last part. And they fucking connected it with their newest DLC, so if you didn't buy it, you couldn't take part in the event! So basically I could get the 2 parts without the DLC and now I'm forced to either buy the DLC or say goodbye to the work I put into getting those 2 parts. This game would make EA blush, with the ways it monetizes everything, like if it was a free to play game (you can really feel it when you play), except the game and every DLC costs as much as a normal full priced game. Practices like this are a spit in the face. So underhanded. I no longer have any respect for the devs and publishers of this game. The crackdown on loot boxes and monetization systems in video games cannot come too soon.EDITI see I received a very generic, copy-paste response from the ""developers"". Thanks, this really proves my point about you not giving a shit, when your response doesn't actually respond to anything I wrote. Allow me to actually respond to you.I would really ""enjoy"" this game a lot more, if it didn't put hands in my pockets all the time or make me feel like a F2P beggar, because I didn't pony up for subscription. Everything in the game should be obtainable through gameplay, this is the only ethical solution for full priced games.The artists that made the assets and music for this game really wasted their talent working for leeches.EDIT2Sooo, it turns someone may have actually heard people complain about those event awards being locked to newest DLC, and it being a bad thing, because they let players get the rewards again, during the holiday event. Plus, you could get the missing parts for the 2 other event rewards that were available this year. Good steps on their part. I hope someday this game will deserve to get a thumbs up."
Negative,"Everything is great except the combat mode. It just feels cheap,very very cheap. The thing is if you really care about combat, like me, don't buy it. The game has lots of content , which is good , and the characters are all voiced (Come on who the hell listens to all those slow conversations). And if you are also living in Southeast Asia , like me , you might have connectivity problems , since there are only NA and EU servers and no Asia server. In General, everything seems polished , except the same looking npcs and the freaking lame combat."
Negative,"This is almost a perfect MMO. It has an amazing story, each interaction with NPCs is voice acted and story driven, and probably the best MMO combat system I've seen to really top it off. HOWEVER (there's always a however), the INPUT LAG in this game at this time leave me unable to recommend this game to others. It is infuriateing to the point that I do not blame people for straight up uninstalling the game due to it, as i have almost done that myself. It should NOT take 900ms-1200ms (with 100ms server ping) for a spell to cast, and this input lag has led to my death numerous times. If the dev fix this input lag, this is the PERFECT MMO, but this issue truly makes this game an avoid for now."
Negative,"Wasted my money subscribing to this game. They were better sticking to single player games. This game sucks! You get 3 attributes and a mess load of skills to choose from that leaves you wondering ""am i doing this right??"" Horrible game! The quest tracking is down right misleading. Stupid compass at the top of the screen sucks!"
Negative,bad video game
Negative,"Extremely boring. If you can't get me to WANT to play in four hours, I don't want to invest any more time."
Negative,"This bundle includes:Exclusive Pet: Flame Skin Salamander1,500 Crowns150% Experience Scroll My ass all i got was the crowns. wheres my fucking salamander and scrolls. lying sack of shit devs."
Negative,Login problems big time. Just bought this few days ago and when I try to log in it says account info is not correct. Yet when I go to check account and enter the exact same info it opens the account. WTF
Negative,"don't buy as of now, crappy support."
Negative,So this game didnt even load for me. I had to download 6 times. I gave it all the permissions I could. Still would not work. Repaired it 6 times nothing. It made my computer slow and now Im having problems. Ive had nothing but bad luck with steam so far. What happened when Dawn of war came out I had no problems but now nothing but. Looks like Im going to have to stick with blizzard.
Negative,The game fails when opening from steam launcher.Infinite loading.It works from eso64 but it states that the game is outdated and then quits.The forums are full of complaints regarding this and it seems no current viable workaround exists.Can you please work this shit out ? Paid a whole lot of money for the game and I expect it to work properly even with Steam.
Negative,"It was fun at first but you finish the first questline you choose to do and just sit there feeling empty and unfulfilled.Fans of this game will tell you its superior to other MMO's because the side quests have plots behind why you are going to a place and killing 10 skeletons, looting 5 chests, and returning to the quest giver. To the game's credit, it does hide the fact that that is all you're doing very well. But the reality of it is all the same.There is nothing special about ESO, it is just another boring grindfest MMO that does not hold up as a genuine game outside of the MMO community like ESO fans try to tell you."
Negative,"Took a few hours to download this while it was free for a couple days.  The game is so riddled with technical issues that it's not even worth the time to take to download it.  The launcher sat at ""loading"" for 20 minutes doing nothing.  I looked up the issue and apparently this has been a problem since 2014 (!) that was never addressed.  There are several workarounds, but you know what?  I shouldn't have to do that.  Especially not when said workarounds involve sketchy proxies.The game also installs more crap when you run it from Steam.  The point of Steam is that games should be updated, installed, and ready to play when they're displayed in my library as fully updated.  It was not.0/10 not even going to bother trying it for free.  Not worth my time and not worth the space on my computer.No wonder the game loses players.  Not going to get any new players if they have to jump through hoops to get the crappy launcher to work."
Negative,"I have played this game around 50 hours and it is a very fun game at first, character customizing, a huge map is amaizing, playing online with friends is awesome but after a while it just started getting repetitive and not fun to play for me, not sure why but it just got boring. I have explored most of the map and the basics are the same, go kill, get loot, finish missions and it just continues. After finishing the story mission it just got not as fun, I didn't know what I wanted to do next since there wasn't a goal that I truly wanted to reach. Anyways If you buy it, buy it on a sale, personally I think its a great game but I bought it for a full price and it just lacked something for me, which made me waste 40 $."
Negative,"UPDATE 2020*Game has descended into absolute garbage. Unless you're a bored noob looking for something fresh to play, this game is bottom of the barrel. Random nerfs and changes without any clear reasoning. HORRIBLE performance in dungeons and often even in Overland content. PvP performance is a meme at this point. ZOS constantly makes changes to push people to the crown shop. Gear sets are constantly changed so that they are totally different from their original state. It's as if the game is developed by a group of unfocused adolescents on ritalin. Have played many mmos over the past several decades. This one had great potential, but its simply a huge cash shop now. Its only a TES game by name. It doesnt actually resemble or play like a TES game at all.I played this game for years at the highest level with every class, and dealt with absurd change after change. With over 5k hours, there is zero bias in my review. Its factual and actual=) If you want to create a character and wander around throwing some simple attacks or gathering materials(you wont be able to hold many unless you pay for a subscription), then you may find limited enjoyment with this game. Beyond that you will quickly find ESO is poorly developed and has descended into nothing more than a business to exhort as much cash as possible from its player base. Zero honest regards given to actual performance or playability.WARNING** DO NOT BUY THIS ON STEAM! During the past 3 months alone, there have been at least* 7 times Steam users were unable to log in. Even as I type this, the game is down for Steam users. Each time they say, ""we are currently investigating"". Then there are no updates for those having problems. Every time this lasts from 7-14 hours. They give no compensation at all besides some silly game crate with useless poisons and other garbage.ZOS is the absolute greediest when it comes to MMOs. Disgusting prices for everything in their crown store."
Negative,will not elaborate
Negative,"I don't understand how they can make a life long legend, and then go make something as dogshit as this"
Negative,First I have to download 130+ GB on Steam itself. And then when I start the game I have to download another 95 GB update?Absolutely not. My Skyrim Modlist isn't even that big!
Negative,Very clunky and rough controls. wish they would fix it instead of making more dlc tbh
Negative,"Don't get this via steam, they are inept and don't keep it updated, so the launcher redownloads the whole game again."
Negative,"it's just a terrible version of skyrim with multiplayer. the addition of multiplayer removes any sense of challenge, since every area already has a couple people at least doing the quests, so you can follow them around and get credit for killing bosses."
Negative,"Gave this a go over the free weekend in April 2020 and felt invested enough to give it a bit of a longer shot than that.  Would say my initial impression is underwhelming, though.  I tried a sorcerer and combat feels very simplistic, especially compared to games like The Secret World, FFXIV, Tera or WoW.  Graphics are subpar for a 2014 game.  Load times can be pretty bad.  Story so far is pretty bland.  Overall, 4 or 5/10 so far."
Negative,says I have 5.7 hrs that was the downloadI played it for less then 30 minsthis reminds me of wowlove elder scrolls games etcbut last I played remembered a bunch of pay walls for cool item etc.It's lame that you pay 20 buck for it for what you get.that's my opinion.its also been years and not gonna spend a month downloading this game lol
Negative,"I really really want to like this game, but it is too... easy? I want to quest and be engaged with the story and gameplay, but there is no gameplay. All that is required of you is to be awake and somewhat functional to have no issue defeating every enemy that comes your way. It is BORING. I love the world, I love the style, I love the IDEA, but I just cannot play a game as brain dead as this. ""Just play the dungeons then""... yeah, no. The dungeons are speed runs, they are not a challenge. They also just don't feel like an elder scrolls dungeon. There is no looting or lore in these dungeons, just press left click then 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1. I have heard that the game ""gets good when you're this level"". Skyrim was good 10 minutes in. ""You should not compare it to skyrim"" then why is it an Elder Scroll game? Please comment and tell me if I am wrong but this game just is not it. I LOVE the idea of it, but the execution is just poor. I like to boot it up and explore the amazing zones and speak to the NPCs and get immersed in the world, but as soon as combat starts, I get sad. I know there is hard content, but I just wish the questing posed more challenge. I want to play with my friends and have to really communicate with each other when we are completing story quests. Please go and watch the gameplay for Avowed and look at the combat. I am not saying it is amazing or anything, but just imagine that was the combat in this game. There is challenge, punchiness and the feeling of being a badass. The thing is I would probably recommend this game if they added in an optional Veteran mode for the open world just so there is more challenge, but as the game is now I cannot recommend to a fan of the Elder Scroll games. I really wish I could."
Negative,The drops are off of a random number generator and your never going to get the drop you want. The PvP system is awful unless your an elitist or a dev. They have tons of lag and bugs that never get fixed.
Negative,bland unsatisfying combat with bad graphics
Negative,idk its just kinda lame and stuff
Negative,"Just play normal Elder Scrolls, please."
Negative,I like the elder scrolls games and universe a lot but sadly the game crashes onto loading up the game for me :(
Negative,this did NOT feel like an elder scrolls game
Negative,Bethesda games aren't worth playing anymore. Why do I need a subscription to enjoy the game to its fullest? Fallout 76 has the same problem and I can't get over it.
Negative,"For being an online service, this game has some of the absolute worst customer service you can ever imagine. The game itself is okay and repetitive at best, however having been unable to access my account in 3 weeks and waiting around 5+ days for individual replies from their email only support, don't ever expect to get your account back if you end up with any recovery issues."
Negative,"I havent played this game for a very long time but when i log on im perma banned lol. Edit: The fact that im permanently banned after only ever playing 3 hours says a lot... Plus, what I played of the game wasnt very fun either. 1/10"
Negative,Sad but this game is still unplayable even on a 4090 you still wont see half of the attacks coming at you in PVP and PVE is boring and redundant. Basically PVP unplayable and PVE is boring its been that way for 7 years. Sad part is its still one of the only decent MMORPG'SSTILL TRASH
Negative,game crash right after start
Negative,"Took hundreds of hours to learn how to play the game, learned how to play the game, fell in love, got my heart broken, still didn't get the drop I wanted."
Negative,Doesn't feel like Elderscrolls. Feels like just another MMORPG. Quests are boring1/10 would play if no other game existed
Negative,Nothing of value
Negative,"It's decent but nothing to write home about, gets boring after a while and fuck the micro-transactions, fuken greedy publisher. 🖕"
Negative,The game keeps crashing. I've been trying to log in for almost 1 week because I never received an access code on my Mac. It didn't work. I do not recommend.
Negative,"friends refer to me as like the Rick friend because like I'm smart and all I do is talk shit about everything cuz it's fun, being a hater is fun. being badass comes at a cost though like it's not just fun being a cold person makes the world seem colder but like that's just something I picked up from being cold like myself my other effing nickname is beyond because of my attitude, like my friends literally call me Sub zero cuz if I had to choose between people and living in the forest forever then like I choose the forest."
Negative,"I have not played in years and have tried to gain access to my account, but their ""forgot userid"" and ""forgot password"" buttons do nothing when you input your email. I've requested it 20 times, searched all parts of my email, and received nothing. Don't make an mmo if you can't even set up a website"
Negative,"Not worth the investment of money or time. Very toxic player base. Every piece of new content is bugged for months after release. They'll ask for money from pre-release games, knowing they're not finished making the content. They're devs are faster to silence someone in a chat argument, than assist with an account bug or error. They're asking for micro transactions at every corner. I'm truly disappointed. I had waited years to play this, after OG Skyrim. This never can or will be better than original Skyrim."
Negative,Need more bag space? Pay real money. That is all you need to know. Every aggravation that should be included through crafting like a real MMO requires real money. So you pay once a year for the updates but also get charged for every little thing. Can't unlock anything in game without real money. So there is literally no reason to complete the flavorless quests except to gain levels. More expensive than Destiny 2 and painfully boring.
Negative,"i cant play the game. Why? Or, does it take a long time to load up> The game is running right now, but it""s not playing."
Negative,One of the worst MMORPG! Every few months a DLC and they forget the old one! Like let the people enjoy the game and do not be such a Gold digger!
Negative,"Boring, slow, and really broken"
Negative,Bland Combat plus the decades old fetch quests. I bought this game when I wasn't working yet and I so regret wasting my precious money on this extremely good game.
Negative,It's ESO... Enough said.
Negative,you would thing at such a big game that is playable on every sestom that when u buy things u would be able to use it on your acount on ever sestom. i spent over 300 on this game on my xbox and yet even though i am suing my same acount on my pc u cant use anything that u buy on xbox this is not ok as not only do u have to have an count on pc and xbox to play this u also have an eso acount and it should be able to transfer everything over.
Negative,"New player here. I previously played City of Heroes, Eve Online, Lord of the Rings Online, and Final Fantasy XIV. So, I've played a few MMOs. And when I say ""play,"" I've largely focused upon a single character and immersed myself in the given game, stood alongside comrades, and not rushed through the given game for the ""end content.""That said, Elder Scrolls Online has a dumb new player experience, with what I suppose could be describe as a bare bones, minimal effort tutorial, no meaningful explanations about the game mechanics, and they seem to expect you to research ""how to play"" through wikis and youtube videos.This is *ss backwards to my expectation, which is to be provided with a framework for learning the game mechanics and the user interface. And after the game has engaged my interest, that is when I'll be interested in learning more with a little research.As it is, the user interface is also bare bones ""could not be bothered.""- Want to transfer a collection of items from inventory into storage? Double-click each f*ucking single one.- Want to have a visual sense of what your attacks are doing to the enemies? Hell if I know. They simply keep after you, until they suddenly drop dead.- Want visual cues for your attack chain? Pfft. I can't even tell when the attacks are firing.I paid for three months of subscription up front, but my sense is that I won't be renewing."
Negative,"I wanted to come back and play, bought the dlc through steam. come to find out the game doesn't work, there is no solution, i've repaired multiple time and uninstalled and reinstalled. I even contacted ESO support and tried what they told me and nothing. 96 hours of playtime down the drain. If this game doesn't work the first time just forget it UNINSTALL"
Negative,"unable to connect to server or login, doesn't seem to be functioning anymore."
Negative,"Pedro , pedro , pedro"
Negative,Clunky combat. Bad voice acting. Corny. Meh.
Negative,"40% False/Misleading advertisement. 50% Micro transactions/endless paid content. 10% Good game.10 Years. 2 Billion in profit and minimal effort. The game looked 10 years old on release and now looks 20 years old!ZOS Staff are also toxic, they forum ban for simply making any negative and factual comments about the game and it's development, they also allowed other users to bully and harass me, then temp banned me for being a victim of other peoples actions. PvP cheating is rife and ZOS don't do anything to stop booster or any meaningful measures to balance out the super inflated economy. Game is all about gambling and paying full price of each new area that's pretty much just a reskin of old assets. Over 2000 hours between PC and Xbox therefore uniquely qualified to make this review."
Negative,its a joke of a game
Negative,worse launcher then 1999 MMO's
Negative,I've sunk 40 hours in this game. Mostly playing with friends tbf but I still have no idea what the fuck is going on and feel like it was the most mindless and boring 40h of my life. If it wasn't for the fact that I was having a fun time talking with my friends I don't think I would have ever stuck it out for so long. Would recommend if you like grinding but just not my thing.
Negative,just play Guild Wars 2 instead
Negative,"Trash game, wish I didn't buy.  LCD only need apply."
Negative,keeps kicking me off due to an internal error
Negative,"have played all the elder scrolls and was dissapointed the ""other lands"" are all paid for dlc... beautiful game... horrible that you cant play the entire thing without micropaying every island, land, and continent"
Negative,Not compatible with Apple silicon so would not run on my mini mac M2 pro
Negative,"pve good, pvp bad. I hope the dev that created soul tether falls asleep on a wet pillow you absolute bridge goblin!"
Negative,I'm gonna be honest here peopleThis mmo has to be the trashiest mainstream mmo game out there.I wish I could get my money back.
Negative,once again steam fks up with a cross login platform
Negative,"The game is mid at best. Not much like skyrim or oblivion at all. You know how bad skyrim's guards are? Times by that by 10 and you get a ESO guard. So basically I killed a npc, to see what would happen and what happened was guards trying killing me with no prison or anything. Then I realized, I am in the Daggerfall Convenant, can I just go to the ebonheart pact and their people wont kill me. I tried that, nothing. Then to the Aldmeri Dominion? Nothing! Then add the fact that you cant load to a past save in this game, which made my character unplayable. First Person: 2/10 basically use third personThird Person 5/10 Its fine I guessGuards: 1/10 Already explained read up there. Mechanics 310 lacked features.Online Interaction: 5/10 Can't really say that much I didnt go into that aspect that much. Main story: 5/10 Same as Online interaction, but id assume it sucks. Also its difficult because you have to pay 40 dollars for the collection and now its 60. That is more expensive then some AAA quality games."
Negative,way too easy its boring sabre cats dont catch you your first gargoyle and daedric boss was absolutely nothing to me at level 3 just run side ways and shoot your bow at stuff thats it everytime
Negative,Imagine playing more stale ass games with stale ass people in 2023
Negative,"I tried to come back to this game to give it another shot after falling out of it a while ago and the game doesn't launch- even after all my tries to fix it. Sucks to suck, good riddance I guess."
Negative,It'll be a cold day in Hades before I buy anything else from Bethesda. Maybe treat the women in your company with some respect instead of enabling horrible men.
Negative,"Boring as hell, and the gameplay sucks!!! why they didn't just make it like skyrim but online doesn't make any sense"
Negative,"Absolute disgrace to the ES name. Subscription locked DLC unless you buy each and every add-on individually through their silly in-game currency system.There is absolutely NO Elder Scrolls feel to this game other than the soundtracks.Take it from a DIEHARD ES fan - this is not Elder Scrolls, this is Wet Paper towel Scrolls with ES written on it in feces."
Negative,"This was advertised as being able to run on a Mac. It does NOT. I have tried re-downloading, restarting, nothing works. Once you log in, you're stuck on attempting to choose your country without being able to click on , enter, or select anything. Total waste of money."
Negative,"Launcher loading slow compare with previous months.Never happened before but recently once login, it lagging/ delaying then disconnected.Troubleshoot from my end with all the suggestions from ESO page and send email to ESO's support team no reply."
Negative,"Game constantly crashes, whether I am in the middle of playing, or just logging in. My graphics, chipset, firmware, and all other drivers are up to date. I also have plenty of memory. I even repaired the game and uninstalled and reinstalled, Don't waste your money on a sub. All you get is more bag space that fills up quickly and a crashing game that you can't play. There are better mmorpgs, such as LOTRO (free), WOW, and FF14."
Negative,"Like watered down version of FFXIV, never got to the endgame, but it felt very similar all the way till higher levels."
Negative,I'M  DONE WITH BETHESDA.THE ABSOLUTE FILTH WON'T STOP CHARGING ME  FOR ESO PLUS. I'M NEVER PAYING FOR THIS THIEVING COMPANIES GAMES AGO.
Negative,"After numerous attempts I still can't get the sound to work. Good job Bethesda, it just doesn't work."
Negative,Love Skyrim/Elder Scrolls but the fact that you have to pay for all the DLC quickly turned me off from wanting to even do the base game stuff knowing I couldn't do a lot of other things.. Its really to bad.
Negative,"Extremely boring game with shit graphics and overpriced bullshit that you need in order to progress. It's pay to win at any stage of the game. Also, bullshit 40 dollar cosmetics that can suck a fat cock. Fuck you Bethesda and rot in hell."
Negative,decent skyrim like game with ok quests but... the fact that a the best stuff is locked behind either excessive grind or pay options dams it for me
Negative,BUY NOW ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS BUY NOW ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS BUY NOW ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS ITS SKYRIM WITH FRIENDS
Negative,"The mods do not review before placing bans and even after you fill an appeal ticket they still dont review your account or anything. I got permanently banned for something i didnt do and my appeal was denied the next day. Dont bother playing its not worth the risk of getting wrongfully banned. Worst waste of money ive ever spent.Update: After sending in 3 tickets, they have come up with a new reason to keep me banned, claiming my account info is fraudulent. I know this is untrue because i use this information for business inquiries and other games that have never flagged it at fraudulent, and ive had this info for 4 years. They clearly dont respect their players at all and I maintain whole heartedly that this game is risky to play if you have to play in fear of being banned, and that even at $6 this game was a depressing waste of money for me. do better Zenimax."
Negative,"They should immediately fire Graphics from their development studio, animals, trees, houses, everything looks better than the characters in a RPG game , the character's appearance is quite important! All characters have broken LOD, even if you give the game more than the maximum settings, it's terrifying. You run to the character and 4 seconds of each separately load textures, it looks really terrible in the first person"
Negative,"Questing is boring. Map is overly big. Combat system is bad. PVE is too easy, got to lvl 14 and its almost unreal to die."
Negative,my pc is being hacked by ai when I turn it on they are trying to get me in my games by corrupting everythingit happens because of some unkind people that took my stuff and it said from Ohio was told to by old friends
Negative,This one is bad too
Negative,"Horrible. Took me 2 days to get to the account login screen. With all this bureaucracy, I don't know if this is the game or if after reading 5 freaking insane psychotic degenerated ToS pages and agreed to them, I would get to experience a virtual world or something. Why would developers, publishers, programmers, video game devs shoot themselves in the knee like this? Isn't it easier to simply not release a game or would that dissuade investors? It's like anyone higher up here is making this game just for their portfolio so they can later be hired in a real game dev company. Insane how corporate bureaucracy can ruin everything it touches"
Negative,"This game changed my life, it is the most beautiful creation mankind has ever made. I was in a dark place for about 2 months, I was very depressed because i had lost my job and my girlfriend but then i played ""eso"" and everything changed. I love this game so much and i play it at least once a week every week. I dont think ill ever play any game better than ""eso"", it has had the biggest impact on my life. I gained confidence and got back with my girlfriend, we're now happily married with two kids, one is 2 years old and the other is 4 months old. I got my dream job as a taxidermist and bought a really nice Prius but the most important thing to me by far are my guinea pigs. I have 32 guinea pigs and 4 moles, they have the biggest room in the house because without them i would be nothing. I have 167 copies of ""eso"", I have it on blu-ray, dvd, cassette, and i have a eso premium subscription as well. I'm glad to share my story but make sure to play ""eso"" the greatest game ever made."
Negative,It does not working for steam and nothing can fix it.
Negative,"Sat through four hours of the game downloading, five minutes of the game ""loading"", changed my graphics settings, waited ANOTHER five minutes to load, then got told I couldn't log in and that I was booted from the server. All for wanting my graphics on the High setting. What the fuck Bethesda?"
Negative,"I registered an account and played for 27 minutes.  Since then, for multiple consecutive days, when I hit 'login' I receive the error ""an unknown error has occurred"", then on every further attempt ""booted from the server"".  I've not been able to play since that first 27 minutes.  Refund requested; not even worth the sale price of 5.99€"
Negative,"negative sides:very frequent disconnects when using doors.not very high-quality combat animations and, as a result, reduced enjoyment of the combat system.positive:in general, the game is addictive, it's not wow, but there is something in itit’s hard to pick out what exactly, but it was more interesting for me to play it than the same Skyrim.I do not recommend it only for technical reasons, so the constant ""unknown errors"", ""error 307"", are very annoying"
Negative,"It's boring, that's it"
Negative,I know this is probably only one of of about 2000 issues this game has but seriously why the hell can I not see quest markers on the large Tamriel map that shows everything?
Negative,got banned. told to access customer support. cant login to customer support because account is suspended. nice
Negative,game is bad
Negative,God awful quest marker. I cant tell what my active quest is. Every icon is black or white so I can't tell what the active quest is. Kills any fun.
Negative,Dont buy it looks good at first glance. pve is stale dps rotations. pvp is worse gear means way to much you have 1 person who can tank 20+ people and not die. more and more in pvp no one dies because every one is running tank. ive seen so many times two groups come together and fight and no one will die. they sit there for 30+ minutes spamming skills. i walk away from alot of fights because i cant kill them and they cant kill me. game is super lame now and i gave it a good run i got 500+ hours had hours on console as well not sure how much. save your money trust me.
Negative,"This game is great for about 30 hours.  The community is great.  For about 30 hours.  The PvE content is great and fulfilling.  For about 30 hours.  Then you can move over to the PVP.  Which is extremely basic but still fun.  For about 30 hours.Once you hit the 30 hours mark in PVE content and the 30 hour mark in the PVP content, all you have left is doing the same stupid 30 minute trial over and over and over again.  You will keep doing it after you get what you need from the trial because no one else is doing any other trial.The crafting is also, on the surface, great.  And then it becomes clear that its incredibly basic.  This game has so much to do but its all just surface level nonsense.  Nothing is really that difficult.  Nothing is really that time consuming.  Nothing is really that fun.  However, all that being said, the storyline content in ESO is probably the best storyline content of any elder scrolls game, id even go so far as to say better than any other fantasy RPGs or MMOs released in the last decade."
Negative,"This company can kick rocks. bought the game and one of the starter packs (both purchased at the same time) to get nothing from my starter pack. looked up how to claim my stuff to find out its common that you dont get your crowns and stuff you bought if you didn't play the game before you purchased any extra content. put in a ticket for support months ago still don't have my stuff. Bethesda you make enough money, how about you not screw up the most basic crap in a video game like micro transactions? like whatever sell extra stuff that's fine but bro if i buy it gimme what i payed for. YOUR screw up costs me 20$ to get nothing. GG Bethesda. wish my opinion on your garbage system mattered. This games been out how long and you cant fix this? i wanted to get into this game but the fact that you have no idea how to compensate or give me what i payed for i will never play a Bethesda game again. Thanks and thats the end of my TED talk."
Negative,"I wish i could give this a good review, as the graphics are beautiful and the questlines are better than any other MMO on the market, but this game has some of the worst micro transactions i've ever seen in a game you can spend $80 on just a house that is purely cosmetic, you can spend money to have more carry weight, or to have crafting materials weigh 0, and dont even get me started on crown crates, you mostly get potions despite the steep price of crates, i dont think games should ever sell gameplay altering items. its just scummy."
Negative,"The worst combat mechanics, the enemy doesn't react to hits, no impact when you hit, no satisfaction for it, the projectiles follow you wherever they're directed and go through any objects, this is pathetic, I have never seen something so worst in my life... nothing improved in the game, only expansions to get money."
Negative,game never wants to let you out of combat when your not anywhere around combat fix your shit ass game
Negative,Game takes way too long to uninstall.
Negative,"Horrid sword play, would not recommend"
Negative,this game fucking sucks simple as that.
Negative,this is a garbage scumy game thats pay to win and if you would like a refund you cant get it because they make you spend three hours downloading extra stuff in the game so if you wanted a refund after trying the game you cant because you would have spent at least two and a half hours to play it. Just don`t buy if you want to play skyrim with others just use a mod.
Negative,"TLDR: Looks pretty. Monetised like crazy, and mid combat and questing/loot doesn't justify it imo. Maybe get if you love MMO's and Elder Scrolls but personally not a fan. Not the worst game ever but def not best.Good:I love the elder scrolls. Honestly only part of this i really liked was being able to visit different locations in the universe. Also the game is visually quite nice which made revisiting and exploring new locations nice.Bad:The monetisation is aggressive. You can pretty much pay to win, subscription is essentially required or else inventory management is a nightmare. Constantly wants you to buy loot boxes and different types of currency. I really hate seeing all of Bethesda's great IP's go down this route of soulless cash grabbing.Monetisation is bad enough but I didn't really find the game play loop engaging either. Combat is pretty boring, loot didn't really feel too engaging, and wasn't overly wowed by the quest content i experienced."
Negative,"My thoughts after 5 hours in the game: what the f is this?!! And when this ""endless running from marker to marker tutorial of how you should run from marker to marker"" switches to something else?I guess there will be something interesting, later, perhaps much more later but I pass. This was the most frustrating and boring 5 hours of ""not even close to The Elder's Scrolls gameplay"". The interface also sucks. Skills' branch is just awful (but the general idea is very good). Everything is overwhelmingly overcomplicated (see this? instead of ""hard to understand"" I do the same, as they did in the game).But the most disappointing thing is archery - my favorite thing in TESV:Skyrim. Here you don't need even to point directly to an enemy! Just press and hold the left mouse button and that's it: arrows will hit the enemy. Oh, one more thing - endless arrows) One-hand weapon and shield? Who cares! Just be a click-o-maniac...I played a lot of games, I love TESIV and TESV. But this is a piece of organic fertilizer."
Negative,"If you aren't willing to pay for the monthly subscription, this probably isn't worth the headache. Inventory management alone is enough to annoy people into signing up. It isn't impossible, but yeah, you know.The game is gorgeous and lore is insanely deep - but that's Elder Scrolls for you.The combat systems seems really promising at first in the tutorial, but once you graduate to the real world you realize that everything is so insanely easy you begin to wonder why you are even heeding the mechanics. Since every mob is scaled down to the player level, I expected this would taper off as I leveled, but if you master the incredibly basic rotations and combat mechanics you can apparently expect to get all the way to max level hard mode before you start to fight anything challenging. I didn't get that far, because it's *eye-wateringly* dull. The low dungeons are complete faceroll as well. Even on the 'world bosses' that take several minutes to down at low levels, you will likely have enough sustain to never be in danger of dying as you slowly whittle down the mob with the basic ""animation canceling"" rotation and, you know, not standing in fire. Even without really looking into builds, most seasoned MMO veterans will find it intuitive enough to be essentially invincible.It's a shame really, because the game really is pretty. They just really want you to spend the money on it, and I wasn't able to maintain interest long enough to take them up on it."
Negative,"I played back in 2020, upon attempting to return to the game in 2023. The non-Steam launcher blocks me by not sending the email access codes (have worked with support to try everything, to no avail), I am forced to play via Steam.Right now i cannot recommend it, this happened last time I played and I lost all my subscription time, no refund, no apology, nothing. Support wasn't helpful at all.Update for 2023: Use the Steam Version, don't use the websites one or you will possibly face issues with no getting any authentication codes sent to your email."
Negative,"the bad:   PAYWALLS ARE AGGRESSIVE. predatory micro-transactions HALF THE GAMEPLAY THEY SHOVE DOWN YOUR THROAT IS LOCKED BEHIND PAYWALLSALL PREVIOUS CHAPTERS MEANS 5 DLS'S-NOT ALLLARGE AMOUNT OF DUNGEONS UN-COMPLETABLE DUE TO IN GAME BUGS.tried a month of eso+,currently the dlcs not included in the ALL PREVIOUS CHAPTERS have alot of bugs,and couldnt even finish one of the 20$ dungeons due to my ability to attack,use items,roll,or use items was spontaniously disabled..had to quit and haven been back since. two currencies,one of which they give you 500 which is good for about 5% of the total in game purchases.the other is only obtainable by buying thousands of loot crates and getting enough repeat items to convert into ""gems""the only other way is TO GRIND WEEKLY AND DAILY CHALLENGES WHICH IS AT LEAST MAKES IT AS GOOD AS APEX AND FORTNITE.2. charging the same rates as world of warcraft without providing the graphics,in game live events,diversity of classes,races,etc is stupid. lower your monthly subscription rates.need to be more classes,races,items, for the time this game was running and the agressive micro transactions theyre pulling in.the good: game has alot of expansions.(unfortunately, all cost as much or more than the game) so enless world to hop around inVery busy server.players are still alive in this game and even in dungeons,theres a good amount of players running around.so at least for the time this game was running,theres no dead areas.THIS GAME IS WORLD OF WARCRAFT ON A BUDGET."
Negative,After major updates The game is no longer stable. Id rather play City of Heroes Anyway.
Negative,This game is the total piece of crap. I can't even get into it to play. it won't allow me to select a server. basically it stinks
Negative,"Some how it says I played for 12 hours yet I cant even get the game to launch. Can't find a way online to correct the issue, and cant get a refund."
Negative,Good for consoles. Not very good for the PC
Negative,EXPLORATION AND LORE IS GREAT BUT THE COMBAT IS BORING AF I CAN'T TOLERATE IT
Negative,so. you cant create an account. cant sign in on your steam id the way they tell you to on the fourms. i literally wasted 5$ on this to fail at actually playing. awesome....
Negative,FUCK THIS GAME AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Negative,My only problem is your mom never comes online.
Negative,"Overwhelming lack of support for MacOS - Game will NOT launch on M1 / M2 devices (unless attached to an external display or using an app like ""Display Menu"" to resize around your device's 'notch')- Game does not work with XBOX wireless controllers! Game does not recognise A/B/X/Y action buttons, and mis-maps some others (hypothesis is that it is recognised by the game - but critically not your mac - as a PS controller... - No meaningful support provided by Zenimax Online Studios for MacOS"
Negative,Ads are getting annoying
Negative,Bad game.  Fallout 76 is almost as bad as this.
Negative,It is VERY repetitive.  Not much difference in the missions.  Just a way to kill a couple of hours occasionally.
Negative,keeps crashing during load up and is unplayable and steam refused to refund me as it was over 2 hours of play time to be refunded. I have contacted the ESO and steam with no help. Still will not launch game and crashes after 3 months do not buy!!!!
Negative,There is not much to do in this game most of the time you spend killing monsters boring routine and there is not much pvp content in this game but I still respect it but they could have done a lot in the game because the basis of the game is impressive
Negative,"Only 4 Hours of game play... And I got bored really fast. (Just me ranting, sorry about that)Now I'm not someone to rely on for if you should get the game or not (find someone who had played for more then 100-300+ hours for that information), this is just my honest review and perspective of the game, and how someone who loves Skyrim to bits, had their expectations to high.At first when I got this game, I thought this was Skyrim Multi-player (I know dumb of me not to realizing that sooner), but when I realized that it wasn't Skyrim Online, I decided to give it a shot anyway (I mean it looked fun on the Store Page, and the reviews were in the positives)... Yeah... Got bored quickly.I know I was an idiot for getting this game, but that's on me and I fully accept that 'me was stupid'. But honestly, when I started playing the game I was somewhat excited, especially with how strong the introduction was to the game. Like how you get to pick you're weapons, get a chance to explore without a time limit, hell I was super excited that you get to give you're character a headpiece... a dang headpiece! but the more I played the game... the more it felt like a grind and... kind of meaningless in a way.I mean the Story, Main and Side quests are interesting and not at all difficult to understand, however... the gameplay itself is what got me to drop this game 4 hours in. You don't get a lot of loot, the game gives you items that's craftable (I think) and no information on how to use em, and... I don't know what to do with everything. I guess that's because I'm so use to Skyrim's way of, collect everything as you go by, that I just collect materials automatically without a thought thinking it'll be useful later... never did find out what everything was for, and I guess I won't since I ain't playing anymore. And the combat system is weird... The enemy doesn't approach you like in normal Elder Scroll games (Which makes sense for an MMO so no problem with that) unless you get to close to them, and the fighting doesn't feel as lively... it just feels... boring. It doesn't feel life treating, or exciting it's just... button mashing till I win. So yeah...But when I started doing some reading in the comments to pass some time... I'm starting to realize I made a huge mistake buying this game. It's more pay-to-win then anything, and you need to dedicate a lot of time (To which I have no patience for), just to get half decent items normally, and I do not like games that eggs people on to Buy stuff (with real money) just to maybe, just maybe, get an OP item that'll get nerfed later on for another item to look OP.Who knows, maybe I read into this too much and I could be very wrong about everything, but the main point is...The game got too boring too quickly, and I honestly do not care for it. The Gameplay feels emotionless, and I was comparing this game to another (Which is dumb to do, I know) and I do not have the patience to dedicate all my time to this game, nor will I spend any kinds of money on a Premium game thingy (ESO+) or any DLC's or items. So yeah, sorry if I hurt any dedicated players feelings on this, but this is just an honest review from a lowly player that didn't spend a whole day playing this game long enough to get the full picture.I'm just someone who bought the game thinking it was something else entirely and was disappointed when I got too bored from it too quickly.If my Review bothers you, tough, I'm just 1 negative of....uh 100k Positive? comments that just don't like the game.You might like it, I don't know. Go try for yourself."
Negative,"It's a great game but don't sink your time into any one platform since even though the entire game is played online and you can link your accounts, you will have to completely start all over again, and repurchase everything, if you move from Xbox to PC for example for no apparent reason and it doesn't seem like that would be the case since everything is linked to your ESO login."
Negative,"The ESO game developers were afraid of getting their toes into the water. The crafting, combat, and trade (i.e. banks, guild trading, etc.) are broken. This game uses up cpu resources and gives little excitement or drama in return. It comes off as a product of Diablo and WoW but missing a few chromosomes when it could have been an engaging TES world."
Negative,"Cash grab, repetitive, boring"
Negative,no - do NOT get this game - it will not work - ive earned THREE trading cards just trying to get this thing to work - most of that was listening to the music while troubleshooting how to get the damn thing to work!
Negative,gameplay is kinda boring and it its way to easy. deff a kids game.
Negative,"meh id rather play oblivion, its ok i guess though"
Negative,Not my type of game. Run around following quests and killing monsters while trying to figure out how to access the items you need to use. Can't be bothered with this type of monotonous mind numbing game.
Negative,"clunky, boring and ugly. im talking ""stand perfectly still and dont die"" boring"
Negative,"thousends of quests 4 weapon moves.??? !!!fix.more and combo able moves ,please.(normol presses normal swing speed, (new)faster presses faster speed swings)fasterrrrr(new spinning) heavy attack.1-2 sec kill moves.dodge not roll stupid dangerous, stay on je ff feetkhajit and  and argonians?? F. . . way to dangerous beasts ,need their own onderground location, foolsMore than hate the amount of F - spirits - ghost, in the game worst game everrrr made("
Negative,"Decided to give this game another try but got stuck at the launcher. The PLAY button would go gray but the game wouldnt launch. I tried everything, checking my firewall/anti virus, updating my drivers, running as administrator, uninstalling and re-installing. You name it, I tried it. I shouldn't have to jump through so many hoops just to get the game to run.I can't in good conscious recommend this game when you cant even play it right after downloading it."
Negative,nothing wrong with the game i just dont like the online part :)
Negative,"If you're looking for a game that you can't even load into or play, this is a perfect game for you! You'll spend your entire time looking at the loading screen forever, you have to be ""active""! constantly throughout the entire loading or else you will get disconnected for not doing so! Apparently, every single time there is a new PATCH, players are required to spend at least 10 minutes loading into the game for the first time after new PATCHES! I honestly do not recommend this game unless you have too much time to spare like me, it's honestly better to put all those time at other things. For your information, my game time spent on this game is the total amount of time I actually waited to load this entire crap."
Negative,"I love the Elder Scrolls series, but this game just feels like an Elder Scrolls game without the soul that makes the series entertaining.  Worst of all, it's a total cash grab-you need to pay extra for expansions that hold access to any types of new game mechanics, and you have to get a monthly subscription to be able to get the most out of the game.  There are also microtransactions galore.  The combat is (somehow) more janky than any Elder Scrolls game I've played, the dungeons are a slog, and the game simply wouldn't log me in in my last few attempts to play it.  It's like it was trying to tell me it wasn't worth playing."
Negative,"I have top quality Internet(Fios gigabit), an Asus Rog rapture GT-AX11000 router, and a computer capable of running all games I play(cyberpunk, fallout, ancestors H.K.O., Destiny 2 etc.) on max graphics settings with zero lag.  This game I can't even play on medium graphics without(no exaggeration) non stop(and i mean non stop) lag and crashes several times within a short period of playing.  The game seemed interesting to me as I am a big fan of fallout and Elderscrolls style games but this is horrible.  The have only 2 mega servers from what I have heard  and trying to run from one side of a city to the other is damn near impossible when you're lagging around the screen.  I would of loved to play this game if it ran smoothly, but due to the horrible performance it completely destroyed my interest in the game."
Negative,"Horribly easy. All the parts that do not require a group are so easy you are trying to pull as much enemies to feel even something. Group content, that you cant quite solo is laughably easy with group of other noobies. Then if you use group finder some high level wizard is just going to run through the dungeon with you trying to keep up. I think this might be fun when you are barely able to do dungeons alone, but after that it is also going to get too easy as seen when using the dungeon finder. This game's difficulty is scaling really badly even comparing to other elder scrolls, where they scale just the damage and hp."
Negative,"I have been playing with a monthly subscription to get the full game experience. After 148 hours, my conclusion is skip it. Let me break it down for you:PROSBeautiful environment. Every area I have been too has had an amazing look to it.Unique quest lines. Aside from daily quests, the quests in ESO are unique and fun to do. Character creation is fantastic. There are a huge number of variations for every part of your character from head to toe. Tutorial/help pop ups. The tutorial is very quick, but will get you learning the basics of movement and fighting in no time and is a fun little quest by itself. Also, the first time that you open any in game menu, you will also get a pop up explaining the different items on that particular menu.Can be free to play or subscription. Daily log in rewards. It's a nice gesture, but don't expect anything fabulous.CONSVery limited character response to NPCs. The vast majority of the time you are only given 1 response option. As this is supposed to be a RPG, it makes it difficult to actually role play your character, as a lot of times you are forced into situations that you may not want to be in.NPC dialogue. Most quest NPCs have a few dialogue options, but they tend to repeat the same info in every option. Very annoying.Sub players are still expected to buy from the cash store. This is nothing but simple greed. You have to purchase the game and the DLCs, then your expected to pay a monthly fee, and they also want you to spend MORE money in the cash shop. Disgusting.Weekly maintenance. I understand that all MMOs do this and it is necessary to keep things running smoothly. However, where most MMOs (by most I mean all other MMOs on the planet) are down for 15 to 30 minutes (maybe 1 hour on a REALLY bad day), ESO is down for 6+ HOURS every week! Are they rebuilding their entire system from the ground up every week? Ridiculous.Trading in ESO is terrible. You can only sell items to a NPC vendor. The only player vendors are guild vendors, from which you can only buy, not sell, unless you're a member of that guild. These same guild vendors typically only sell level 50 items and are of absolutely no use to characters who aren't at max level. You can try to trade through chat, but again, it's mostly going to be level 50 stuff. Crafting is completely pointless unless you just want to make things for yourself as again, you can only sell your items to NPC vendors.There are 3 in game guilds (different from player guilds) in ESO. Mages, Fighters, and Thieves Guilds. Again, although you can get some passive abilities from them, they are completely pointless as anyone can join all three at the same time, regardless of character class. In a RPG, this really makes absolutely no sense. Although a RPG, there is zero focus on role playing from the developers. As a hardcore role player, this makes me very sad.The Three Banners War. There is currently an ongoing war between the three factions in ESO. Although this should have strong effects on game play, it serves no purpose to the overall game, except for a small amount of game play you can do in PvP.  Your character is able to travel to any of your enemies territories, and do any quests in those territories, just the same as if you were in your own territories, even being able to become a hero of your enemies. For a RPG, ESO really dropped the ball here.CONCLUSIONAlthough a beautiful game with unique quest lines, a lot of the dialogue seems to have been written by elementary school children. The ability to actually role play your character is almost nonexistent unless you're playing something like ""lawful good"". I understand the need to make money to keep operating the game, but to charge a monthly fee AND expect users to spend more money in a cash shop is just pure greed. Either charge a monthly sub fee OR be ""free to play"" with a cash shop. For a RPG, ESO falls way short of the goal. If you enjoying role playing, I highly recommend you skip this game, you will only be disappointed. If you do choose to play ESO, don't get a subscription. Although it gives you full access to the DLCs, you're actually going to spend a lot less money buying them separately as you're still going to probably buy things from the cash shop too. Overall, this game seems to be run by a bunch of amateurs who just started high school. Very disappointing."
Negative,"Could not even create an account, took 30 minutes to receive the email for confirmation/activation and when i clicked the link, it was expired, could never got another email to try it again, if you can't even create a damn account, which is the simplest part of anything, who's to say about the game, dudes suck badly, straight garbage."
Negative,I used to like this game when i came out. After a long break i can't get back into it. Character models are ugly to look at and spells and attack animations are pretty bad. The music and the environment look good but the game play is subpar. I would rather go back to Everquest and that one is even older!
Negative,38 hours and i still don't have full download of the game. U should consult PiedPiper about compression
Negative,i like the teso games but this one doesnt hook me at all
Negative,"just trash, i feel so trapped because of the mmo gameplay, this is not a single player game no matter how much i want it to be. i only hope the next real elder scrolls release soon."
Negative,way too grindy of a game. one of the least fun mmo's out there. new world and wow are both miles ahead of this horribly thought out game.
Negative,The elder scrolls offline series is great. The elder scrolls online series sucks.Why is it bethesda can pump these online games out but cant make another offline series?
Negative,So sadSpendt the entire time running around the wailling Prison and not being able to come out due to a bug where the npc does not show upReported it twice and no responceAs to what I could read up on the problem is that you need the GM to port you out of the area in order to advanceand that it is a old problem that have not been fixed
Negative,"Another MMO that looks like the others basically.Boring story, action super slow( but if you enjoy skyrim you might like the action).Edit after developer response:sorry but giving me a link to a ton of things to read doesn't give me any motivation to play the game."
Negative,"ESO is down with BUGS so much its very ugly trying to play it. they do a Patch to ""fix it"" and its so much worst than it was. also there are areas moths old that even an ESO+ member can't get. with new and better games out there, why settle for this!"
Negative,"There is a ton of potential, but the reality is that this does _not_ feel like a MMO.  Sure, it's massive, it's multi-player, and it's online; but the interactivity between players feels bolted on to a typical Elder Scrolls single-player game.  Fights against dragons that would destroy a player as world bosses are dumbed down to an easy mob fight - just so that you can still solo your quest line.  Quests are largely 'Go here do this' with little-to-no challenge other than investing the time required to travel from quest-point to quest-point.  There's no sense of challenge or achievement and because the game levels with you - you never feel like your character gains any power.  You run dungeons with level 12s and 49s - and they both contribute about the same to the group despite their vast difference in level."
Negative,"2023 ReviewAs much as I absolutely hated High Isle, I'm loving Necrom. Beautiful tentacles everywhere.Just be aware this game does contain Woke, but it's mostly ignorable.2024The High Isle ""creative team"" strikes again. Absolutely more woke than Necrom and smells like Sweet Baby Inc. was involved. It's a shame ESO keeps telling players to stop playing what would be a solid game without all the DEI garbage. Games companies need understand you can provide paying customers escapism or you can be an activist propaganda platform, but not both."
Negative,"Pros: Huge worldSkyrim looks greatCons:Seriously nerfed Skyrim. Very little player interaction. Guild stores useless, soul gems all the same level."
Negative,The worst PvP out of any RPG I have ever played. Make sure you play one of the three viable classes if you don't want to die in 2 hits from button mashing controller handicaps.
Negative,not worth the time tbh
Negative,Many minutes of inactivy and instant disconnects from the main server. They could do a better server.Is my PC eligeble to run it? Yes it has all the requirements.
Negative,UNABLE TO LAUNCH... STUCK AT LAUNCHER!!!
Negative,game not woring
Negative,"tried all of the fixes every time i load into a new area i get kicked and gets a error, that if i can get on, game is impossible for a new mmo, buggy and laggy, connection issues and just generally horrid. only gets hype cause of the elder scrolls fan base, massive let down."
Negative,"holy shit,the game client monitors EVERYTHING, including your facebook profile(s), your search history etc.And they are allowed to sell your personal information, including, geographical, address and billing information (and lots of other collected data) to 3th parties!"
Negative,"Bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, and more bugs.If you like being irritated and losing fights because of broken mechanics, then this is the game for you!Seriously, the developers are just another developer that pumps out endless cosmetics while ignoring the real issues that plague the game. Don't waste your time, it's a Walmart Elder Scrolls game where you can be harassed by World of Warcraft fanboys who have egos, because they played World of Warcraft... like, how do you think that's a brag?"
Negative,"It's an okay mmo, The problems i had... The stats your character gets at lvl (1) 23629 Starting hp, So items didnt feel rewarding as they would give me 600-2k hp. Progression was terrible, But my biggest gripe is the combat, its probably the worst ive ever dealt with, Very Clunky! But hey the story is good."
Negative,takes everything good about the elder scrolls and throws it out the window
Negative,"Missing game content Greymoor, Elsweyr, Summerset, and Morrowind and no easily accessible game support to fix problem.Don't waste your money on this one."
Negative,Please update the graphics. Other old MMOs looks better
Negative,not recommended!doesn't even load just kicks me for inactivity
Negative,"é ruim, e o server ta hostado num celeron"
Negative,"I like the multiplayer idea, but there are too many restrictions on the player that just ruin the game for me. If you are choosing between this and Skyrim - go for skyrim."
Negative,"The game RPS part is stuped and useless. What a reason to reach levels and unlock new skill if it doesn't change enything. Level up gain you +0.5% to a stat. It's hard to see any diffrence between level 10 and level 15 characters. All monsters can be killed with 5 spell cast not depending on your level, spells and monster type. And rare one can hurt you. Quests is OK, but if you wanna play RPG, this game isn't it."
Negative,"While reading this review, I know that I'm basing everything on a game that was made perfect with no exploits, flaws, or bugs, ""Skyrim."" No, but its got issues to but, I am basing this off of it.If you were expecting Skyrim, it's NOT! From what I've seen, sneaking is a complete waste, MORE so in ESO than in Skyrim. If you love the sniping with bows, gone. Attack range is the same for every weapon (as in engagement range).Crafting in this game appears to be below avg, Skyrim (IMO) had a great crafting system that should have been built off of and ESO should have taken a good system and made it better, they reinvented the wheel and it kinda looks a lil bit square.Skills and stats, this system so far has some good and bad. I like how you get direct feedback on how a skill can be increased. Dislike that it all just seems completely underwhelming. Looking at this skill tree lacks any wow factor at all. \b/There are Classes and races... (IMO) complete aesthetic and don't matter, you get a ity-bitty race buf, whatever.Class does specialize in certain skills, but they too seem underwhelming.Combat, UGH, don't waste your energy jumping and running around trying to avoid being hit; just stand there and fight and use your other hand to hold your coffee or tea. far more use out of that had for a beverage holder than game play.(For this part, ""safe zone"" refers to a place around the player character where enemy units cannot respond in or around.)safe zones do not exist. If you are out and about in the wilderness, your safe zone does not exist; they will pop up on top of you, under you, above you, and in you. Make sure to bring your rape whistle with you in this game.Looting... OMG, I hate it. Kill some guy or a group of bandits that have a bunch of armor and weapons. You go to loot them, and you get 23 gold coins. Oh, and sometimes, not often, like ever, you can get level-appropriate items; it will be trash but level-appropriate.Armor and weapons that you find and sell for ""0"", or if you are lucky, pennies, and armor and weapons that you want to buy are about the cost of a house.I'm done ranting. You get the point.I give this game 5 out of 10 arrows to the knee."
Negative,Error because the loading to long and connection lost WTF is that even my fault the server sucks and buggy
Negative,terrible game i wouldn't recommend anyone to spend their money on
Negative,Just another bad MMORPG. Surprise surprise.
Negative,"I bought this seeing it was 85 GB, I unistalled to play another game, now trying to reinstall it takes 105GB + 80GB for Zenimax. Hmm something not quite right there eh!!!! Game itself is fairly good if a bit repetative."
Negative,Wow what a scam. I would have to buy the base game again with Blackwood if I want to get all the chapters?
Negative,"15 hours into the game, 2 characters created. I find this game to be an absurd. I feel like the mechanics of this game is for kids who just spam one button. Lvls 1 - 16 I just kept using 1 spell over and over cause well - it was most effective. Everything is super easy, you can spam spells every one second (no cooldowns but on ult, wtf?) The only good thing about this game are the quest stories. While I loved Skyrim, this is just poor."
Negative,"Not recommended because of two major reasons that kill the gameplay:1) The world is EXTREMELY generic, all locations look the same, indoor or outdoor. If you could not see names of stuff in-game, you could not even tell if this Elder Scrolls universe or some orc-elf-human generic world. Locations are a wavy 3D surface with randomly placed assets every 20 meters. Monsters are placed in a chess pattern with the same spacing as one or two monsters that do not even move. There are no challenging encounters, you kill them one-by-one by repeating rotation of skills.2) Skills and classes HAVE no identity. EVER. Just few percent numerical difference. THERE ARE NO MECHANICS of ANY!!!!! sort. Skills are - damage, damage over time, heal, heal over time, AOE or point, and minor buffs like 5% more damage.  The major difference between skills is the picture on an icon. The only exception is necromancer that uses a couple of skills off corpses, but its boring as hell. Basically all your rpg mechanics are - health and resource, damage plus crit, and resistance. Oh, and if you go medium armor, you have stealth strength and radius. There is literally no OTHER stat in the game!!!!!! The difference between pieces of gear is several percent difference and that full 5-pieces set will give 10% buff if you crit, or attack, whatever. Have not seen this level of boredom in any game for VERY long time."
Negative,the trading system of this game sucks assits more realistic than other mmo's such as wow or bdo (imo)you have to join guilds to sell stuff its all good but if you want to get rid of your items fast you have to join good trading guilds and you have to pay tax to stay in the guild or sell bla bla worth item. you have to do it for pretty much every guild i havent found any free trading guilds.dlcs are expensive asf eso plus players or players that own dlcs have a big advantagemost of the dlc open world sets go for expensive (there may be just a few expensive ones but the items that i wanted for my build was so fucking expensive)combat is pretty good tho
Negative,"I didn't like the game, the world map its huge, there's a lot to do and a lot to learn, real progress will take some time, so if you play more casually, maybe you'll get bored, i really like all the elders scrolls lore and equipment and abilities, i know its and old game, its ok for today's standards, combat is clunky like good old skyrim, if you are looking for a mmorpg that cover the basics and gives you an enormous map, this is it, but if you want something with a faster progression, better combat, look somewhere else."
Negative,"Movement and controls suck. I had to jump through hoops to get it to run in Linux. Most games just work. Not this one. An hour later I get in, only to find I'm stuck in freakin mouselook, with no way to change it. That might be alright in an FPS, but it isn't in an MMO. As a matter of fact it's a deal breaker for me.So they respond, thinking I'm having technical issues with a link to their FAQ page. Here's my advise for this issue: Write the few lines of code that would let us assign keys for turning right and left, and disable mouselook. It should be an option, not a requirement.Glad I only paid 7 dollars to try it out. A big fat zero for me."
Negative,"""you have been placed in the queue to log in"" Infinite login queue 1 secs......."
Negative,New update = more ping
Negative,"Buy the game, then realise that it is not possible to play it from you location. 10/10, Bethesda."
Negative,"cant load it, with my small pc"
Negative,"Fairly average rpg with an elder scrolls skin and an absolutely horrific store for purchasing premium content and expansions. Subscription is the only way to access the content in a way that isn't stupendously expensive.  One of the large expansions costs 35 dollars in ingame currency, as a point of scale, compared to the 15.99 a month for subscription- it's all a bit despicable, really."
Negative,"After spending hundreds of dollars on the game, hundreds of hours over the course of some months, they changed my account name out of the blue calling it sexual... a ""muffpillow"" is quite literally a russian hand warming pillow and also what my friends all call me, congrats on losing yet another subscriber Zmax"
Negative,"It will never uninstall.Seriously, google ""uninstall Elder Scrolls Online"".It will *always* stay in your programs, taking up about 30 GB of space. It doesn't change when you uninstall via steam, via launcher, or even manually. Nobody seems to know if it's a registry key or what.If you are not absolutely certain you will enjoy this, DO NOT INSTALL IT."
