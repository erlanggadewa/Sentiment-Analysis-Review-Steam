Positive,"It's online but I have no friends, so to me it's Elder Scrolls Offline."
Positive,"I am in my seventies.  My son wanted me to play an open game instead of the single games I was playing before.  I am inspired by the graphics of each country that I travel in , each one is different.  The puzzles are complex but doable.  Each cave is distinctive and some are so enclosed while others you have to walk through slimy water to get to the other side of the trail.  It seems so realistic at times.  The story line continues when you least expect it and you meet characters where you least expect them.  Great Game.  Glad I found and play it."
Positive,"I'm a 70 yr old lady, and I've played for some time now and I love this game. I will never be hardcore or even a good player. But there are so many things to do in this game it is almost overwhelming. Quests are very good, the story-line is very good and last but not least, the graphics are fabulous. On the downside; it is expensive being a Plus member, especially on a retirement pay (shoe-string budget). I recommend a much cheaper monthly fee. There is ofc the DLC content you get with the Plus membership but the ideal is to have a cheaper option only for that magical bag space just for crafters. Well, it's just a thought.Happy New Year 2020!Just a review of 2019 gameplay (many hours as you can see).And I'm still playing (since my birthday 7 Dec 2017). I have just scratched the surface...If you are looking for an adventure out of this world (pun intended) Elder Scrolls Online is the very very best.I do pay for Eso plus, I need that magic bag since I farm and horde like a squirrel and craft like a boss. I have soon maxed out my main crafter.I am in a guild with absolutely fabulous and helpful people. I have started to have a bit of confidence doing trials and dungeons with this guild, they know I am old and slow and they are patient with me. Hopefully, I will be a better team player this year. I am working on it.In the meantime, I quest, explore, collect whatever, do delves, public dungeons, world bosses, farm and craft. And I enjoy it all!All the best to all gamers in 2020.I have edited this review, the starting-date was wrong, I got the game on 6 Dec 2017, and started to play on my B-day, 7 Dec 2017. Otherwise, counting the hours of gameplay, I must have been glued to the screen, LOL. I do have a life outside Tamriel, I promise... To All gamers Stay Safe in these crazy times. / Onna_BugeishaUPDATE 2022; This coming 7 Dec I'll turn 73 yrs which means that I now played this game for 5 yrs and I still love it.Thank You! To all wonderful people for your heart-warming comments and awards. I like the titel ""Gaming Grandma""  I have a confession to make - I fell in love with Horizon Zero Dawn, and spent some time there, i.e. I did 6 re-runs of that game (lol), it's a fabulous game. Now I am back in ESO again with the new High Isle chapter and two new companions, there are just so many things to do in ESO you never run out of options. Things like crafting, just exploring and farming, decorating your homes and create gardens... even fishing is very relaxing when you need a rest from bandits and monsters. Have I mentioned I lured my husband from Guild Wars 2, to come and join me in ESO last year? Now we play together, so much fun. A very important advice to all couples out there... this game is captivating and time-consuming - so please, see to it that you both play together or you might end up wondering what in the world happened to your significant other, seriously. I hope to see you in game or mail me (I am @Wing-Zun - on PC, EU server), I am in three trading guilds (BTW an excellent way to get some gold).  Arenthian Trade Guild - Tamriel Marketeers - The Twelwe Knights. Very nice guilds.Wish you all Good Gaming and take care. / Onna_Bugeisha"
Positive,"I have been paying this game for years, building my opinions of the game. The easiest way to describe it would be Pros v.s. Cons. Pros:Easy to learn, hard to master.The Questing only gets better with each expansion.You don't NEED to interact with anyone. Treat it like a single player game if you want and call it hard mode.Fun dungeons that don't get boring with just a couple of runs.Tons of ""End Game"" content to keep one busy far after they reach max gear level.Super Fun PvP system with Cyrodil Tri-Banner WarIf you want to specialize in something like crafting, it is diverse and fun enough to keep you entertained, then become extremely profitable in the future.Cons:To be a crafter in the most efficient way, you NEED to subscribe to ESO Plus (but as a little sneaky pro, ESO Plus gives all the DLC bundled with it plus ""crowns"" equaling the price paid for subscription""VETERAN MAELSTROM ARENA IS UNFAIRLY DIFFICULT favoring Magika DPS players with very good sustainability and constant shield action. A bit of tough love that pushes away newer or less experienced players.PvP, though really fun, has a very steep learning curve that leaves many unsure where to start, luckily PvP isn't the main focus of the game.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~So where does this leave us? Is the game worth putting in time and money? Simple answer is, yeah. Despite a rough launch in 2014, ESO has improved and worked out MOST of it's flaws and kinks, making it the great and enjoyable sandbox MMO it is today. -If you are playing and feel you need some direction you can send me a message via mail in game @Cactusking158 and I will do my best to answer any questions that come my way.Happy adventuring, and may you meet many fine people along your journey."
Positive,"An amazing game .. incredible variety of different activities, meet great people. Highly recommend ESO for more seniors to play .. at 70 i find it keeps my mind active, however it gets addictive.I would like to see more consideration of Seniors regarding cost though. ESO Plus is an absolute must but the monthly cost is getting difficult to handle."
Positive,"This is a review from a new player aimed at new players.I played ESO back in 2014 during the beta and didn't like it. I was expecting Skyrim online and it didn't qualify so I lost interest very quick.Fast forward to april 2018, after years spent on Dark Souls, Dragon's Dogma, Rocket League and others ... Me and my buddies are looking for a game to play together like in the good old days. We're all dads with families now and there's no way we can get back to grinding like we used to (no pun intended).I remember ESO and wonder how it's doing. People are talking about the One Tamriel update. I start a thread on Reddit asking if it's casual friendly, and everyone assures me that it very much is. Might be worth a shot so me and my buddies decide to give it a try.ESO still isn't Skyrim Online, and won't ever be. The logistics of a MMO don't really allow the atmospheric beauty and complexity of a game like Skyrim. It is however way deeper in lore and atmosphere than any MMO I ever played, and you can tell great care is taken into making the world of Tamriel feel alive and breathing as much as can be. Every NPCs are voiced and side quests are literally everywhere. Many of them feel generic after a while, but some are actually really clever and well written. The world is absolutely humongous and very varied, with there again great care paid to respecting the Elder Scrolls lore. Long time ES players will appreciate the numerous references to stories and characters they already know well.Graphics are pretty great for a MMO as well. I run it maxed out and lighting effects are downright gorgeous in some places. Art direction is consistent and while some places feel a little rushed, others surprise you with high levels of details. Riding from city to city through woods and moors, across deserts and sea shores, you always feel immersed in the world as should be. They also keep improving as the latest chapter, Summerset, is more beautiful and detailed than ever before.Gameplay is one of the things that surprised me the most as I wasn't expecting it to be so fast paced. Fighting takes skills and strategy and you do need to learn to get better to earn victory, as opposed to simply leveling and spamming skills like it's sometimes the case in similar games. Me and my buddies have progressed steadily and we find ourselves beating dungeons we never thought we could beat before, and not just because we leveled up but because we learned to work better as a team. It's a very satisfactory feeling that the game encourages.Classes are varied and skill lines designed to make you enjoy a high level of freedom in gameplay. I run a Magicka Templar, and designed my character so I can switch from DPS to Tank or Healer or a mix of both when I play with my friends without much of a hassle. I'll never be as performing as someone who would 100% specialize in either of these roles, but I would say that for once hybrid builds are absolutely do-able in this game, which is very rarely true in MMOs.One thing responsible for us enjoying the game so much is the famed One Tamriel update. It basically removed level walls from the world and introduced a scaling system on the world map. It basically means that from level 1 to 50, you will adjust to monsters on the world map and normal delves to a beatable level. It does remove true challenge from these areas, but also allows you to roam the world freely to explore as you wish, which is a worthy trade in my opinion as it allows new players to be free to discover this enormous world like they were on an actual adventure. There are also no limits for partying with friends, so you don't need to worry about overleveling when you play on your own. While it could take from the satisfying experience of leveling up in early levels, the very flexible skill system feels like enough of a reward to keep it interesting.World Bosses, Dungeons and Trials aren't scaled, and that's where the challenge begins. Each dungeon has several levels of difficulty and we have been steadily progressing through them in our 2 months of playing. Boss battles require strategy and analyzing the mechanics and can be quite epic. Sometimes you just don't have the required level or gears, but sometimes you just have to keep trying to get better. We have beaten many bosses we thought we would never beat on our first couple tries.Past level 50, you start getting Champion Points, to a maximum of 750. They allow you to keep enhancing your character slowly and end up making quite a difference in the long run. As you get stronger, you'll be able to complete more difficult dungeons, which grant better gears. This is really clever design, as the game never feels like a grind in the traditional MMO sense, but instead more of renewed challenges. So far it has kept it's freshness to us.The lack of ""grindy"" feeling is really something I want to emphasize on, as it's what's been preventing me from playing MMOs for so long. In my 2 months of playing I never felt myself even having the desire of grinding for levels or gears. I had fun doing quests on my own and playing with my friends, and my character naturally improved by doing so. We are still a long, long way from reaching end game content, and are in no hurry. From my experience, this is quite a feat to accomplish this feeling in a genre that is most often grindy by definition.On the negative side, I would say that the game can sometimes feel a little bland, but then again it's a MMO and Skyrim, Dark Souls, Witcher III and the likes have spoiled us in recent years. Quests can feel generic and repetitive but you also don't need to do 80% of them.The monthly subscription is by no mean necessary but access to all DLCs and their dungeons is quite pricey (and free if you subscribe). The bottomless crafting bag you get with the subscription is also pretty mandatory if you want to craft efficiently, and then again it isn't a necessity as you can resell materials instead of holding on to them and ask players to craft for you.Crown store is mostly cosmetics or a shortcut to things you can buy with ingame currencies like skill respecs and the likes.All in all, the game we were looking for at the right time for us. I highly recommend it if you are also looking for a similar chill, friendly experience in the Elder Scrolls universe.ps: my hours logged have been greatly augmented by leaving the launcher opened all day on numerous occasions.edit 1: removed ""do not buy from steam"" cause issue seems fixed. would still recomend getting it from official website though just in case.edit 2:  my friends and i have less time to play together. reached semi endgame (CP400, all geared, vet dungeons). kinda lost motivation to play atm tho but it has a lot to do with my friends not being around as much."
Positive,"TLTR: ESO is the best MMO I've played so far.The Good.It has retained many of the best elements from the Elder Scrolls series.-Fantastic sound-score.-Fine graphics.-A world that feels alive.-Great exploration gameplay.The leveling and combat system is far better than any Elder Scrolls game, by miles. For PvE combat is great, tho I haven't played for long enough to get into PvP yet. You can choose to grind up to cap in a single session, if that strikes your fancy. Or you could care less about leveling and still participate fully in all non-endgame PvE.ESO does not waste my time with long travel times, I can get to anywhere I've already been in between 30 sec to a minute. For me this is a very important point. I detest games that fakes longviety my wasting my time.ESO is not in any way pay-to-win, and it doesen't unnaturally inconvenience the player to make me pay extra. The only inconvenience in the game comes with spontaniously harvesting crafting ingrediants while questing at the same time. This was an inconvenience in the Bethesdas Elder Scrolls games aswell because of inventory. You can pay to unnaturally compensate for this inconvenience through an ingredient-bag.ESO has pay for vanity.The world is immensly open. I can go anywhere I want and be successful straight from the start. There are many questlines with their own story tying into the main story. I can choose freely what storyline to follow, or I can ignore the story entirely if I just want to grind my way to the endgame content or just want to explore. This also means the game is extremely accessible for anyone.Crafting is plesant and feels meaningful so far. There are crafting-quests in addition to crafting for trade, if I want to pursue it as a career. There are few games where I enjoy crafting, but in this one it seems ok.Stealth gameplay is fun, although not innovative by any means.Playing together ad hoc is fun even without groupinng up. Just running together with random people for an area or a difficult fight is quite fun. Probably because combat is fast-paced, players are considered allies for the purpose of abilities, and game mechanics generally supports doing so. It works very well for any open area I've been to, and is faster than grouping up.Some of the dialouge is good.Some of the quests are ok.The Bad.With the game being extremely accessible, people looking for a challenge will have to do a bit of searching or research where to go and who to hook up with.Because the enemies and treasure scales with level, ESO doesen't have the mother-haul aspect of treasure-hunting that some older Elder Scrolls titles had. For instance, in the original Morrowind I could sneak into an ancient abandoned fortress, find a coven of vampires there so powerful they could one-hit kill me, sneak past them, discover an endgame weapon, steal it and leave. It was a very unique feeling when just stumbling into it while exploring.The community tools for ESO are the porest of any MMO I've played. I haven't found an accessible way of reaching ppl even for PUGs. There is no tutorial on how to effectively get a group going, and frankly zero incentive to do so anyway in any area I've been so far. Further, getting a guild seems to be a matter of blindly accepting guild-invites from ppl spamming general chat. For instance I've found no credible channel on how to get info on guilds that may be suitable for me, seek them out and ask for an invite. As a noob I find getting involved in the community in ESO a frustrating chore.There is a tool for queing to participate in dungeons (instances) with PUGs. The tool is never explained however, you just have to find it yourself. Also the queing I've done takes 30-90 minutes. Some times of the day I'm unable to find PUGs for dungeons at all through this tool.The community also doesen't seem very inviting towards new players in my experience. I've not seen anyone being very helpful towards each other yet. It's not that it's hostile, just not very friendly either. It may of course be because the Morrowind expansion was just released and all the established players are over there, for all I know.I cannot fly, levitate or do Khajiit-level jumps in ESO.Some of the story isn't good. They all pivot around the main story in a very overt way. Like in the old arcade games, where there is a scheming badguy and everything except the end-fight is about thwarting his minions. ""His"" minions are everywhere in ESO: Tamriel, and it's just to much of the same. This is very different from the other Elder Scrolls titles, where the monsters of the land seemed to make up a whole ecosystem on their own, with their own lives and events. It makes the stories that follow the quests boring after 25 hours, and deteriorating rapidly at 50 hours.Most of the quests are very boring. Fetch me those items or kill me those enemies. For me this may well become a reason for abandoning ESO, they were the reason I never played WoW for more than 20 minutes. In ESO they aren't as bad as the ones I experienced in the other title. It's normally 3-5 targets instead of 20-30. At first it seemed that this type of quests would be few, but it proved to be very frequent. A real pity.Many of the quests are really stupid. And I mean really really bone 'ead stupid. Like the world-class schemer who's locked himself inside a tomb and left the 3 keys outside the door at different but easy-to-find locations. Makes sense.. It's back to the old arcades, only back then the format required some abstractions. In ESO it's not an abstraction anymore, but a literally really dumb story-element. While there are some straight-forward story elements of the type ""some soldiers have been captured, go rescue them"", nonsense solutions are more common. Fully expect an NPC to suggest solving a problem by shooting her magic rainbow-ray at the moon while farting some magic sunshine. But first you must go find her some rare shrooms at one location, kill 4 zombies at another location, get 3 seashells, then kill an evil monster turtle-boss. Then she can find the spy who's been taken prisoner by the enemy and learn what he knows. And on to the next one.After a quest is done I get a pat on the back, where the NPC tells me this was all my doing. I'm a hero. It's not that it's wrong, it's just that after a while all quest-givers start to seem like a benevolent school-teacher praising a 7-year old.The Ugly.Customer Support are flat-out ignoring support-tickets. There are 3-year old bugs that prevent installing or starting up the game for enough players that the forums have several threads each day regarding them. New players enter the forum frustrated, not being able to play. Some are able to get it working through forum advice, and others can't and refund the game as a result. The ugly part is that the developers don't communicate with the players and doesen't even acknowledge the problem. It's been 3 years now, so it seems they just don't find the bugs worth the cost of resolving vs the number of resulting refunds and bad reviews.Final Words.I don't know how long ESO will keep me engaged. I'm currently doing the story and exploration, but unless the story starts diversifying in the next area I fear I'll seek other content. Maybe that content can keep my attention, maybe not. Regardless, this is the best MMO I've played despite its shortcomings. The combat is quite good, and the absence of time-sinks count for alot. That said, I've yet to find an MMO that could hold my attention for more than a couple of months."
Positive,"60/100Game Pros• Giant fully explorable beautifully designed world• Night/Day Cycle (3 hours each)• Weather• 1st and 3rd person is easily accessible• Designated PvP area• Customer support is very helpful• Various lines and skills for crafting • Ton of possible character builds• Mass amount of quests. (You'll have a hard time running out of things to do)• Frequent updates• A lot dungeons ranging in difficulty for you and your friends (or random players) to complete.• Microtransactions are mainly all cosmetics (Other than mounts and crafting styles) Game Cons• If you have poor internet, prepare for the longest download. (80Gb)• You can only group up with players from the same faction. So if your friends join a different one, you're out of luck• Minor bugs (Rooms can take a little to fully load, possible freezing/crashing)• Pricing of mounts is a little high (It takes awhile for the normal player to earn even 10,000 Gold. While most horses are 42,000 gold. Other than that, there is one that is 10,000 Gold. Only other option is buying it through the micro-transaction store)• Only guild stores and AI markets. There is no public tradepost (like you would find in Guild Wars)Controversial Features• Leveling system can be EXTREMLY slow, and may take a lot of time and effort to level upRelateable Games• Guild Wars • WoW • Skyrim Elder Scrolls Online is a very fun and potentially an addicting Massive multiplayer online game. 900+ quests, giant open world map with a ton of caves, and dungeons, to explore. Sure there is some cons here and there, but overall I would reccomend this game to any person who enjoys MMOs. In the first 2-3 days of having it, I hit 30+ hours of gameplay. If you got the money and time, i'd pick this one up for sure. And no, you can not do shouts, and there is no dragons. This isn't skyrim. (If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!)"
Positive,"Tamriel.  A continent at war. The Dominion, Pact and Covenant fight for supremacy in the Imperial province of Cyrodiil. Meanwhile, Molag Bal has stolen your fucking soul.  Graphics Tamriel Unlimited is pretty. It has a variety of different environments - from the sandy, sunbaked land of Elsweyr, to the frigid, unforgiving land that is Eastmarch. Whilst no, the graphics aren't particularly revolutionary, and definitely not the same quality as Skryim, this is to be expected. For an MMORPG, the Elder Scrolls Online is up there with one of the best looking. Occasionally the world looks a bit 'the same', but usually as you advance to other provinces, the environment and ambience is noticeably different. EDIT: After a discussion with someone who commented on this review (which you can read below) I'd like to add this: Skyrim was a very graphically capable game. The base game, on ultra, compared to ESO, on ultra, is more graphically detailed than ESO in my opinion. However, this may depend on different viewpoints and whatnot. The graphics design and feel each game wishes to portray is different, and this may lead to differences in opinion - which is to be expected.8/10 PvE Player vs Environment is the part of this game that gets particularly monotonous. It's the easiest way to level up, as you gain a considerable amount of experience for each quest you complete, but  it does indeed become a chore. The characters are forgettable, the quests the same. Kill this, gather 'x' amount of this, talk to her/him. In my 145 hours of playtime, only a few quests have got me genuinely interested. You skip dialogue as it does not mean anything or add to the plot. It does, however, reveal some beautiful locations and there are a FEW interesting quests. For the most part, however, PvE in ESO:TU is pretty 'meh'.4.5/10 PvP If you're not sure about buying ESO for the PvE aspect, definitely consider buying it for the PvP aspect. It is likely the most fun I've ever had in an MMORPG. Nothing quite compares to standing aside a host of 50+ players as trebuchets pound castle walls, the walls crumble, and hundreds of players clash on the field of battle. If you're an Elder Scrolls fan and have always fantasized about some sort of war in Tamriel - buy this game. You're allowed to enter Tamriel at Lvl 10 (3-4 hours of playtime?). Once you enter, your stats are boosted to Veteran Rank 1(?). This means a Level 10 can still be (relatively) effective fighting higher levels, so it's pretty balanced. The PvP itself takes place in the Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, which has been invaded by three seperate factions-The Aldmeri Dominion (High Elf, Wood Elf, Khajit)The Daggerfall Covenant (Breton, Orc, Redguard)The Ebonheart Pact (Argonian, Nord, Dunmer)(With Imperial package you can play as an Imperial in any alliance)There are 15/16 castles around the province, 6 of which surround the Imperial City. There are also various outposts. Around the castles are resources, which, if captured, give benefits to the faction who owns them.The PvP is what makes this game, and what convinced me to stay for 100+ hours.9.5/10 UI/Levelling The UI is well-designed, not too obtrusive. Levelling up is also pretty simple - each time you level up, you get to choose which stat to invest in - stamina, health or magicka.You can then choose a skill which you can plonk in your hotbar and use. Nothing broken or overpowered, though it does take testing to find the most effective skill sets.8.5/10 Crafting I'm not going to lie, I've not experimented in crafting at all, so this section is from friends' experiences.It's good. Dying your items can make your armor very unique, the materials are varied and it does take up time. It's not simple. Which is good.8/10 Framerate I play this game on a GTX 770 and i7 4770. In the midst of a battle, with dozens of spells and effects going on as well as 100+ players on screen performing their own actions, it did not drop below 50fps. Well optimized, large scale PvP is the only time I've ever dropped below 60fps.9/10  Grouping The group questing/dungeons in this game are good, again, but not particularly revolutionary or exciting. Standard group quests and dungeon, pretty simple. Not a huge variety right now, I think there are about 7/8 without the Orsinium/Imperial City DLC. I've had loads of fun playing dungeons with friends, but it does become a bit stagnant once you've repeated them several times.7/10 Conclusion This game is good. The PvP is excellent, and while the PvE isn't particularly impressive, it still functions. Bugs have almost all been ironed out. Worth your money if you enjoy the Elder Scrolls universe, and are willing to accept certain sacrifices made by Zenimax to make the game a better MMO. OVERALL: 8.5/10 New Witcher 3 review: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079374616/recommended/292030/-my first proper review, feel free to comment constructive criticism/positive feedback-"
Positive,"So, I hated this game at first... I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of ""FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO"" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. It is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.So I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.Now I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.Add-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.For those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.If any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our website[www.godsofsalt.com] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.But all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance."
Positive,"I've thought a lot about whether to give this game a bad review or not. I almost did, but it would be unfair to the game. The largest and most painful issue I have with this game is the in-game shop and the way that this game has been monetized. It is so terribly monetized, that I almost gave this game a negative review. ZOS claim to only sell cosmetics and conveniences, however both of these things clash with the core gameplay of ESO. There are a number of rewards which are only obtainable through purchasing crowns with money, and with extremely expensive costs too. The game is objectively worse off by the existence of these things. I can count on one hand the number of mounts you can collect in game, but the number of mounts you can buy or obtain through ZOS's loot boxes is closer to 100. This gives players less things to actually play for, less things to collect and fewer targets to set for themselves.In addition, you can buy time-savers which grant you ability points (if you've collected them on other characters), experience scrolls, mount training and the research scrolls for professions. The issue I take with the existence of these items is indicative of the fact that ZOS are aware that these grinds are a slug. They are literally time-gated; you can learn one mount training skill every 24 hours, of which there are 180 skills to spend. That is half a year of spending points to max out your mount training. This grind must be done on each character. The research scrolls speed up the rate at which you research a trait in a weapon. When researching a trait, you must wait an increasing amount of actual time before unlocking it and researching another. My main character has gotten to the point that she must wait 20+ days to learn a new trait in some professions. Or I can throw my wallet at ZOS and get it done instantly. ZOS, I want to play your game, but you're making it so hard.The largest houses you can buy typically sell for around 14,000 crowns (€85) and are unobtainable otherwise. On the other hand the housing system in the game is phenomenal. It suffers a lot though when considering how expensive furnishings actually are, especially when compared to how little gold you actually get for just playing the game. While players can obtain some furniture pieces through playing the game, these are extremely few and far between when considering just how many furniture pieces there actually are in the game. The nicer furniture pieces are often priced at 10,000 gold, up to 100,000 for the fanciest pieces. When you only get 300 gold for completing a quest, as a player, you must look to get money through other systems if you want to engage fully with housing and furnishing. ZOS, PLEASE increase the amount of gold you get from quests. This leads me to the auction house in game, and ESO plus. The best way to obtain money in this game, is by engaging in the auction house. I love the auction house system in the game, and the way it forces players to be a part of a guild(s). One thing to help you make gold is the use of the extra bank storage and (literally infinite) crafting bag you get when subscribing to ESO plus. If you plan to sell any crafting materials and you don't have the crafting bag, be prepared to have a full inventory every 10 minutes. It's like ZOS are aware that not playing with the crafting bag is a handicap, and so they move it to a pay-wall. There are other ways to make money in the game, such as farming for rare item drops for hours on end, hoping that one will eventually drop which you can sell for a lottery cash outZOS are masters at creating problems and selling you the solution. The in-game store and the monetization is in direct conflict with the soul of this game, and I never feel satisfied playing this game. I want to engage in the housing, but the rate at which I can actually buy furniture, if I just do quests is extraordinarily slow. The crowns I get with the ESO plus subscription make it a bit better, as they allow me to buy furniture and housing with crowns instead of gold, but I can't help but feel like this doesn't have to be a problem at all.ZOS, fix your monetization. I paid for this game, let me play it without locking features behind time-gates and pay-walls. If you want this game to be subscription based, make it subscription based, put everything from the store into the game, and remove the store. You can't have it both ways. I want to love this game, but with the way this game is monetized, I can't. If you enjoy questing and story-telling, you will probably enjoy the game if you don't engage with any of the things above. But you might get frustrated at always having a full backpack and having to walk past all of the mining and herb nodes because you don't have the space to pick them up. And then not having any money because you can't trade the materials you don't have."
Positive,i have this many hours and I've only ever done solo content
Positive,"It's online but I have no friends, so to me it's Elder Scrolls Offline."
Positive,"I'm pushing 1500 hours and decided it was time for a review. Here you go.As a long time Morrowind addict I was hesitant to jump on the ESO bandwagon.  I'd heard a lot of bad stuff about it when it was first released and solidly decided I was in the camp of 'that's not a real Elder Scrolls game, it's a cashgrabbing, PVPing, mainstream-appealing mess'.  Which. to be fair, was kind of accurate back around initial release (from what I've heard). Jump forward give years though, and it's come a looooooooong way.Lore: If I'd started playing and found the lore side of things to be poorly addressed I would have stopped playing. I haven't stopped playing. Established lore is maintained and adhered to well, and the game adds its own bits and pieces - some new stuff, some expanding on previous knowledge.  And there's plenty of books lying around for the lore enthusiasts to pore over. You could quite easily play the game and completely ignore the lore aspect, if that''s your thing, but you'd be missing out on a huge part of the charm of the ES world.Gameplay: Top notch questing, both the main questlines (of which there are many) and also standalone side quests. Keeping in line with previous titles in the series, there's been an effort made to minimise 'Go and kill X bandits' or 'Fetch me X golden watercress seeds' type quests. While ultimately all quests will be basically 'Go there, do this, come back' they are well presented, relevant to the storyline and generally cohesive.There are less world-changing decisions that can be made than in other games of the series, but that's part and parcel of the MMO genre. Occasionally you will meet a new character who obviously thinks they know you - as far as I can tell this is an overhand from early days when different areas of the world were levelled, and progress was more linear. Modern ESO has level-scaling across the board, meaning you can access previously 'end-game' zones from the get go. It's not gamebreaking, and very minor - took me ages to even realise it was happening. Combat:My first impression was that regardless of class/playstyle you end up being forced to do magick-y stuff. Coming from earlier games where playing as a warrior (or whatever non-magic class) means you can basically light attack, heavy attack or block I was....somewhat irked. Combat is basically a combination of buffing yourself/debuffing enemies with 'abilities' and then using normal attacks interspersed with other 'abilities'. All these abilities are accompanied by much pomp and circumstance - flames, sparkles, sound effects and such. I was kind of miffed that I couldn't just hit things with a sword/arrow/morningstar and occasionally swig a health potion. Once again, it's an MMO - not a single player adventure game. Took a while to get used to, but you adjust. There's also wiggle room if you want to be more of a purist, but you'll be cutting yourself off from most of the group/endgame activities by doing so.Classes/Races:Well handled. Nightblade is the quintessential 'Thief' class, Sorceror is the 'Mage' and Templars, Dragonknights and Wardens are a bit of a mixed bag. There's less of a Warrior/Mage/Thief theme and more of a Damage/Healer/Tank vibe to the whole affair, due to the traditional 4 man party setup for group activities. Too much reading online will convince you that to be any good at all you need to shoehorn yourself into the current 'meta' build for whatever role you want to fill. Reading these guides and builds is a great way to understand how to use skills more effectively or learn how different armour sets can help in combat, but at the end of the day they're best ignored. Play the character you want to play - if you were good enough to benefit from squeezing an extra 1.6% DPS out of your toon you wouldn't need to read a guide to find out how to do it.Races are pretty faithful to tradition, with 'passives' that are vaguely in line with with the old 'Altmer have extra magicka', 'Khajiit be sneaky' stuff. Nothing to prevent you from making an Orc healer or an Altmer brawler if you wish, though.Community:Generally good, always feel free to ask questions in zone chat if you need a hand with something. Lot's of helpful sorts out there. PUGs can be a bit toxic sometimes, but it's easy to just leave the group if you can't be bothered dealing with someone excessively unpleasant. Hundreds of guilds to join, everything from trading to roleplaying to hardcore score pushers. On that note, if you're trying to do an endgame trial and suck, the other people are NOT being toxic. There's an expectation that you will contribute effectively, and if you're not, well tough potatoes.Crafting:Only mentioning because it's a big part of the in-game economy and a main reason for lots of people to play. In the course of your adventures you'll collect oodles of furnishing designs, armor and weapon style diagrams, foodstuffs, raw resources and other shiny bits and bobs. Level up your crafting skills and you can make your own gear, make furniture, potions/poisons to use or sell. You can also just go out foraging for stuff and sell your spoils through a guild for a tidy profit. Nice low-key way to spend an hour or two if you don't feel like combat or questing and just want to romp around outside enjoying the landscape.Real money:Yes, there's a 'Crown Store' where you can buy stuff with your IRL fundage. I don't think many people use it. Lot's of flashy stuff (and lots of cosmetics) that after a few weeks of playing you can mostly find or make yourself in-game. Subscribing to ESO Plus gets you an unlimited inventory for crafting resources (very handy) and access to all the DLC content (which can also be purchased one-off if you prefer). It also gives you 1500 crowns per month, so you can fritter it away on the more useful/appealing items if you so wish. The game is fully playable without subscribing, it's really just a QOL improvement and means you don't have to pay upfront for the many DLC zones.Overall:I love this game. It's huge, both geographically and in terms of content. New areas are being released regularly and despite the whining on forums, the dev team does a good job of addressing issues and making the game enjoyable, accessible and true to the lore of the Elder Scrolls universe.  You can play this as an MMO, a single-player game or anything in between. You can RP your way through the overland regions, or min-max your way onto some very competitive leaderboards.  For me, it's a great continuation of he Elder Scrolls series and also a very enjoyable (and affordable) MMO without that horrible WoW feel to it. You're not forced into any particular playstyle based on your class or race, and there's enough content to keep anyone busy for many thousands of hours. If you enjoy the Elder Scrolls universe, or MMOs, or RPGs in general, I suggest you give it a try. It's a bit of a mixed bag, but such a large bag that you'll never get bored. Enjoy!"
Positive,"After spending over 4000 hours i feel its time to voice my personal opinion about the game.  My Own Experience I first started The Elder Scrolls online when the Vvardenfell DLC released roughly Mid June 2017, after years of playing other different types of games i decided i needed my MMORPG fix again. I was not sure what to expect but i knew i was a fan of The Elder Scrolls Universe, playing most the previous games in the series and being a big fan of the lore so i decided to give the online version a chance. I purchased the normal game standard edition which is the base game. To buy the DLC for the game there are a few options such as straight up buy the DLC which will cost you crowns (they do sometimes have offers for these) or you can buy into their ESO+ subscription. From a fresh point of view, i was thinking ""do i really want to pay more money after just buying the game"". After asking a few of my friends who had played the game before i did more digging and found out it was HIGHLY BENEFICIAL, you get a lot of perks such as:    Access to all current and future DLC's     Unlimited crafting bag (Go nuts and pick up everything!)    Double Bank Space    10% more gold/xp HINT I would recommend you buy the base game first, see if you enjoy the game and if you think you will play the game longer buy ESO+ honestly that crafting bag is life, a lot of people from my experience say ""i cant live without this anymore"". and the fact that you get access to all the DLC content is just fantastic.Factions in the game Before playing the game i did some research to find out the best race and class to choose for each role. Like other games i played i wanted to see what each class had to offer e.g. which class did the most dps, who was the best healer or the most beefy tank. When picking a race you are also choosing a certain faction depending where that race comes from in the world, which is one of 3:    Daggerfall Covenant (Blue)    Ebonheart Pact (Red)    Aldmeri Dominion ( Yellow)  HINT Now a days there is an option to buy ""any race any faction bundle"" which some people might see as annoying and an excuse for the devs to take more of your money. However this is mainly aimed at open world pvp, so unless you are going to pvp a lot or want to be in the same faction as your friends, pick any race which you find appealing. There is always the option to make another character of the same faction to play with friends. Classes currently in the game I remember the first Character i ever made was a Warden, As the DLC had just released and not many people had played it i thought it would be good fun. Later down the line however i learnt the hard way the bear can be annoying. There is a way to control your bear so it doesn't randomly pull mobs in trials or the boss at the end. I remember doing this many times :D  but i was never told and it was never obvious there was a button to press for your bear companion to be non hostile. Many of the classes tool-kits have been changed which has lead to them getting buffed and nerfed either many times or a few times. Honestly sometimes it feels like the devs are unsure how to balance some of the skills in the class. They either go from one extreme to making it powerful or not very useful and weak. Saying that now a days if you wanted to play, there are so many different sets to wear in the game to help you out, if you want more damage or need better sustain. Please see the list below of the current classes in the game so far.    Templar     Sorcerer    Dragonknight    Nightblade    Warden (Crown Store)    Necromancer (Crown Store)  Races currently in the game I enjoyed the customisation different races, you get given lots of choices to make your characters look unique and different. E.g a fat male Wood Elf dressed as a belly dancer, or a fancy Orc with a moustache. Please see the list below for current races in the game    Breton    Redguard    Orc    Nord    Argonian    Dark Elf    Khajiit    Wood Elf    High Elf    Imperial (Crown Store)  HINT Honestly unless you want to min/max your character, you don't really have to worry about choosing which race and class to play. Now a days there isn't too much different between all the races. Other then that just have fun! Try out many classes and see which suits your play style. What is there to do in the game? When first playing I was not sure what to expect but i knew that i wanted to have fun and see all the different things the game offered such as:    Map zones (Questing, Fishing, Skyshards, Dolmens)    PVP (Battlegrounds, Imperial city, Cyrodiil)    Trials (12 player content)    Guilds (Trials, progression, trading, Roleplaying, causal)     Dueling (Tournaments)    Housing (Competitons)    Achievement hunting     Arena's ( 4 player content and single player content)     In-Game Events      Dungeons (4 player content, normal and vet) Positives Lots of helpful and friendly guilds, there are so many guilds in the game you could almost go as far to call them small communities, usually in a guild if you need help or are unsure they will answer any questions you have about the game.Progression guilds, are great if you want to get into the end game content, unlike other guilds that require x amount of dps, progression guilds normally don't have such a high benchmark and love to help train new people, give advise and explain the mechanics of tougher content.You never know when you will make friends, the amount of times i have been doing something random and then i just become good friends with a person is crazy, A lot of people are nice and are willing to help if you have any questions.So much lore in the game to explore, as the game takes place in the past you can see what the world used to be like. Negatives FPS seems to be an issue when pvping in open world e.g. you run into so many loading screens, or come against so many players that your PC cant keep up and your skill bar doesn't work. When trying to get into a dungeon, that can be quite the experience, sometimes even with a full group the finder doesn't seem to work, people can leave randomly halfway through a dungeon, they can just be rude and run most the dungeon and skip bosses. PUG AT YOUR OWN RISK! that's right your heard me, when trying to randomly enter a vet dlc dungeon yikes. It is honestly like gambling with your time, you will either get a really good group, or a terrible group of people who get mad, blame others and leave. Dry End game content, sadly this isn't the most challenging game of all time. When you get later into the game with more experience and understand the mechanics from the dungeons, you lose that sense of its a challenge. The same can go for trials, with all the top end raiding guilds out there, they go and smash so many of these trials in record times each patch. Steam Login issues, sometimes after a long maintenance you find that some people are able to login fine but people who brought the game on Steam have to wait hours more to play the game. Overall I have really enjoyed my time playing this game, from the social aspect i have met so many people in different guilds, who have become good real life friends. Sometimes in guilds they run so many events like, make the ugliest outfit, dungeon races, fishing together in a group of 20+ or just dress the same as a guild and bombard a town by dancing everywhere. I WOULD RECOMMEND this game if you want to be part of a good community, who loves the ESO lore and wants to have fun, there are honestly so many guilds out there which offer a lot!Happy Adventuring! Hope to see you in the game :)"
Positive,"After reading all the negative comments about paywalls, subscriptions, and overpriced items; I was hesitant to buy this game.I bought the Standard Edition on sale for like 13 bucks, and have logged on every day for the past 2 months. There is so much stuff to do, and so many quests, my quest log is constantly filled to max capacity.I really like this game. It's the only one I play.I haven't hit a paywall yet, and I haven't felt the need to get a subscription.You want a mount? You get a mount. You want more storage? Buy more storage. You want a house with furniture? Buy a house with furniture. You want to fast travel? Fast travel via waypoints for free.You want to create numerous characters? You can create up to 8.You want to delete one and make a different one? No problem.I have yet to find something I require, for which I need to pay real money.You get free daily items. Some of these are crates containing items only available in store.Dont like the items you got? Trade them for gems, save up gems and get what you want.If you have the money to spend on subscription gaming, perhaps there are better options out there.For a gamer on a budget, like me, this is by far the best value I have ever got from any game."
Positive,"I lost my life to this game.Would recommend. Combat is hard but rewarding to master and quests (while not skyrim worthy) are fun and engaging. This MMO stands on its own two feet, and soon it'll be easier to grind out equipment with the curated drops system so you won't have to spend almost 167 hours trying to get the equipment like I did. The only thing that I'd discourage you from doing is buying crown crates especially if you have a gambling problem because it'll feed into that. Plus they don't feel rewarding to open."
Positive,"First and foremost I am a solo player. I am just going to compare this to WoW and my personal preferences as a solo player. This game seems to be a better fit for me than WoW.I enjoy the leveling process in WoW, but lose interest fast once I hit max level. I am simply not interested in raiding, playing in groups, or PvP. I like being able to walk away from the game or take a break at any time. In WoW the quests are pretty boring, they're primarily text, etc. Your character just really cannot become more powerful playing solo past a certain point. However, I have a pattern of re-subbing WoW every time an expansion comes out and quitting shortly after hitting max level.Now I am giving ESO a go and I've been enjoying it a lot. Why? The quests are amazing. It's fully voiced over which means I am actually engaged and paying attention to what's going on (all I did was skip the dialog in WoW). The quests are far more detailed when it comes to the story behind them, the tasks, the environments, etc. It's so much more than the zillion fetch quests or kill X monsters quests in WoW. The main story quests in WoW were good, but that's it. The rest of them are not. In ESO there is just no end to high quality engaging quests. I opted for ESO plus as well which opens up a million more. I'm only level 19 after 71 hours and having a great time.I prefer the combat in ESO. It's simpler. I'm OK but was never really good at WoW. Just OK. ESO lets me keep it as simple as possible. I run 1 bar of 5 skills; that's it. The combat is less twitchy, but still very reactive in nature. You have to block, roll, interrupt caster, and use your 5 abilities, but it's just way simpler. Those basic functions of rolling, blocking, and interrupting are way more intuitive in ESO in my opinion because you're using your movement keys and attack keys to do it; not a special ability. The monsters in ESO are easier to ""read"" compared to WoW. In WoW you really need to sort of memorize different types of attacks, abilities, etc. to know how to avoid or counter them. In ESO there is a target on the ground to avoid, it's always the same interrupt, always the same roll, etc. It's been easy to manage for me as an OK player and, honestly, more fun for me. I don't feel like I suck. I also feel like ""meta"" probably matters less in ESO and small mistakes don't really ruin anything. I might be wrong because I am still new, but that is the feeling I am getting.Anyway, that's me! Solo player, just OK or decent at playing MMOs in general, needs voiced over content to keep me engaged, etc. I am really liking it and definitely recommend it. Hopefully this helps someone with a similar preference or background make a decision."
Positive,"At the time of writing this I am roughly around 180 hours in the game.When I first got into Elder Scrolls it was with Skyrim. Playing only that and none of the other previous games I was blown away with how detailed that game was. When I heard that a MMORPG was made with the same title I was very enthusastic. When I got Elder Scrolls Online, I was told it would not be ""Skyrim Online"", and to an extent, those whom mentioned it were correct. However my thoughts and feelings on that statement have changed quite a bit.After playing for as long as I have, which in comparison to many others, I have found this to be right at home with my previous experience with Skyrim. I absolutley love this game. I feel that it is totally worth the $60 price tag and I invite other open minded players to give this game a shot. There are many differences from the Single Player version of Elder Scrolls but all of the reasons I loved Skyrim are placed in this game.The ability to customize my character in any way I see fit, the endless caves, areas and places of interest to see. Fully voiced NPC's and endless hours of lore and other content for players to experience. Not to mention that NPC's reconize your heroic feats as you walk by them, often singing your praises and sometimes even questioning some of your actions that you have made in the game. In fact, there are many circumstances where I have had to make a tough decision and have spent much time dwelling after the fact if I made the right call. Should I have helped fight at the docks or was defending the fort the better call? The result might be the same but the fact that I even had to contemplate the lives of fictional NPC's that I would never meet again shows how enriching the plot can be.The  PvP in my opinion is very hard, but very fun. I die often, but its not frustrating. Being able to team togeather with random strangers, plan an attack and take a fort seems like it would be difficult to do but everyone is on board and ready to play the game. They want to succeed as much as you and I found the community helpful and enriching, not to mention being able to use seige weapons is so much fun and adds a level of excitment I didn't realize was part of the game.In the non PvP side, I found most players to be felpful, friendly and very outgoing. I found a guild almost right away and in that guild was open minded Veteren players who wanted to help grow and encourage newer players. Often investing a lot of time and energy explaining various parts of the game such as Armor, Weapons, Skill's, ect. Even non guild members and complete strangers are often pretty nice. I can recall looking for a Werewolf Bite and after a few bad players asking me for a ton of gold and crafting materials in order to give me a bite, one player simple messaged me and say ""don't pay them anything, I will give it to you for free."" Not only that but he also gave me tips on how to complete the Werewolf single player quest.I plan on sticking with this MMORPG for a very long time. Its fun, its first person, its 3rd person and its live action. It has its faults, all games do, but if you can take things with an open mind and a grain of salt you will find much love for this awesome game. It wont ever be ""Skyrim Online"" but in many ways I really feel it is. A great story, great community of players, a big wide open world to explore with choices that are unique to your character. Seems pretty close in my opinion."
Positive,"I originally pre-ordered this game back in 2014. I found it to some-what fun but other titles at the time were far more interesting to me and ended up side-tracking me from playing ESO.I had stopped playing the game all together, and did not return.I recently read that the game had been revamped for 2020 offering many more features, and changes.I have now played a character from the start in 2020 and leveled that character to max level, here is my honest review:PROS: -Great scenery, graphics are great, character models look awesome.-Excellent exploration, seriously, you will find yourself just running around looking at interesting things from time to time.-Fun combat, controls flow nicely. Also cool to see an MMO that can be played on controller.-Character building is very unique in this and allows the creator of the character to really build a very unique feeling class. This allows for quite a diversity in game-play.-PVP Game mode is very fun. Definitely has a learning curve, but once you figure it out, the PVP is very unique and offers a lot of replay-ability.-In game purchases are available but none of them are a pay to win option. (The in-game purchases are mostly stuff like costumes or cosmetic changes.)-There are some nostalgic elements in this game that remind me of previous single player Elder Scrolls titles.CONS:-The questing is interesting, but can become repetitive and chore-like. (As is per normal of an MMO)-Alot of the quests share some overly similar story-lines. However, I do also understand this is an MMO with tons of quests in it.-The dungeons do get better towards the higher character levels, but at first they offer zero challenge and are fairly boring. I found myself just kind of running around, using random abilities with no serious sense of direction.-First person game-play is neat to offer, but is never used. There is seriously no point in using it.-There can be a few moments when playing where you can get stuck on terrain or find it hard to jump up on top of something, which can be minorly annoying. -Group queuing for PVP is currently removed, which in my opinion takes away from the PVP experience.Overall I would recommend this game if you're a fan of MMOs and of course a fan of the Elder Scrolls games.This game does have an Elder Scrolls feel to it, the environment and game-play does feel like Tamriel.If you're going to compare this game to World of Warcraft, you won't like it. It has a very different play style, however I do believe that ESO has a refreshing feel to it.The developers appear to still care about the game as well, being that content is regularly added to keep the game interesting.TLDR: Game is good, give it a go."
Positive,"I have spent 10k of my life into this game. With all of its joys and disappointments, I can assuredly say, money (and time) well spent. I made it to the end and there's still a lot to go through."
Positive,eso needs cross play. it can be done don't listen to people who say it can't.eso cross play 2024
Positive,"***ALL NEGATIVE REVIEWS WERE BEFORE TAMRIEL UNLIMITED***Yes, this game was pretty bad before the free update. They knew that no one would like the paid subscription and so they finally made it free (after initial purchase).This game is a MUST HAVE for Elder Scrolls fans, and players who want a ""new"" type of MMO.PROS:+ Good Combat System, No turn taking, and no point and spam keys.+ No ""Grab this, kill ten of these"" Quests are INTERESTING AND FUN.+ Lore is great, I really get immersed in this game.+ NOT PAY TO WIN.+ GOOD ECONOMY. I can buy iron ore 12g in one area and sell it to another player 15g in a different area.Also no Crowns for Gold, So rich people cant mess up the economy.+ Decisions affect gameplay.+ Feels like a single player game, plays like an MMO.+ First person, third person, and birds eye veiw for all players and preferences.+ Amazing soundtrack.+ No paid subscription.+ No lowkey *BUY OUR STUFF PLZ* (ex. Guild wars 2 chest drops and keys.)+ Quick and fast customer support.+ PvP is very fun. Destroying forts with siege equipment is a blast.Cons:- Character creator is absolute trash. needs WAY more hairstyles and body mods.- Must do quests to level up. Grinding takes forever.- Needs more classes besides 4 basic ones.- Needs more spells.- Wish it had more of a ""I am me"" feel. - Shopkeepers will give you 1 gold for items that took your FOREVER to get.The good outweighs the bad TREMENDOUSLY. Buy this game, have fun and recommend it! Lets get this to overwhelmingly positive like it deserves.***EDIT***After playing for some time, I started to play with a friend. We started two new characters and were going to complete quests together.The group questing needs some major improvements.Suggestions to the Developers:+Add need/greed system+If I complete an objective, my partner should NOT have to complete that same objective.+Players should have a ""Waiting for buddy"" before going to next area/ talking to an NPC.+Players should be able to teleport to buddy, their exact location if they become to far apart.+Players should be able to ""duel"" friends or other players."
Positive,boring after 10k hours
Positive,"Fun game, decent MMO, nice community :)Remove the crown store and add more earnable content and it'll be perfect."
Positive,"A few things for new players:1. Stealing is the right (only) way to make decent gold if you're anti social and don't want to sell stuff on guild stores. There's multiple sets that can be used at once to reduce your detection radius when sneaking and going cat will reduce it even further. To the point you can sneak into npcs and they won't see you (cat not required, but makes it easier). From there it's just how much laundering you can do each day holding you back. Destroy white drops if you want to fast track your gold making.2. If you ever plan on getting something via crowns, DO NOT buy crown packs. Buy ESO plus instead. ESO plus gets you just as many crowns as the pack, but with the added bonus of the crafting bag for a while. That crafting bag will be your best friend. Yes, it sucks it's a paid service instead of just being baseline, because it really should be baseline.While you have ESO plus as well, go get companions. NPC allies who will help you fight, heal or tank. They are super helpful when going solo! You may have to look up how to get them.3. Nothing matters until max level (CP 160) look up a good set for your build and where to get it and *avoid* that area until you're max level. The way equipment drops works is once you get a set piece and bind it you're unable to get that piece again until you have the full set. You do not want to get a super awesome for your build item at level 10. Once you do reach max level and start equipment hunting, do not bind something until it has the perfect stats you want. You can always upgrade quality, but re-rolling stats is much more expensive and requires dlc or a guild. And once you get the full set, anything can drop again. Good luck getting what you're looking for.4. Guild stores are your friend! Often for cheap, you can get a full set of max level gear that's decent enough to get you started. There's an official website to list everything on sale and it's price and where it is. https://tamrieltradecentre.com/ will help a lot for finding what you need, use it often!5. NEVER EVER PAY FOR VAMPIRISM OR LYCANTHROPY. EVER. People give these out free so often and you will likely just be scammed. AFK near whichever shrine you choose and you'll be bit eventually. Asking in map chat will often get answers, don't listen to the jerks who try to put you down for asking, it's the best way to get bit. Look up where shrines are if you don't want to do the next thing. You can be cured anytime at any mages guild in major towns, like Riften, for a small cost in gold. This will not reset your XP gain on the skill line, but it will refund the skill points.6. Addons are a must! For example a Minimap that shows where spirit shards are (skill points), chests, bosses, ect. They are extremely helpful and you're better off learning how to use them before you get started. Is it less immersive? Yeah, a little. Does it make the game playable? Yeah, a lot.7. On the store there is a free object called the armory. Place this in your first house and every character from then on, fast travel to that house and save a level 6 zero points distributed, no armor set. This will let you reset your character anytime so you can reset skills and stats, and reset any vampirism or lycanthropy you may have for free. This thing is really, really helpful and for some reason not talked about at all! You can get an inn home in most major towns for very cheap or even free, place it there!The game does have it's problems but it's fun to hang out in, gather gold or bs with friends (or strangers in map chat). You can make a name for yourself in pvp/alliance wars or you can just become a massive collector owning every house in the game and be a guilds pride and joy.Whatever you choose to do, good luck!"
Positive,meh spent a couple hours enjoyed it so far.. wait what its 2021 already?update: wow its 2024 already
Positive,it gets better after the first 4000 hours
Positive,I picked this gem up for $5 after refusing to play it because I experienced the Alpha and Beta and never gave it a chance. I've been a long time MMO player and loved Skyrim so I was like okay I want to try this and try hard even though there is a learning curve.I was SHOCKED how well they have streamlined the game and how welcoming the community was. I was able to level up without it feeling like a terrible grind and get my first set to start doing trials and vet dungeons. I never felt like the game punished me (other than sometimes awful jump mechanics sometimes lol). I joined a guild and have had random people help me for hours just because they want to. I've almost played for a month straight and am having a great time.
Positive,"Is this game, like, multiplayer Skyrim? No. Is this game Skyrim 2? No.Can I heal mid-battle by shoving 50 cheese wheels in my mouth and then unpausing? No. So what is this game?This game is an MMORPG. It has the story elements that are familiar to Elder Scrolls fans, but the format is similar to that of any MMORPG. There is a lot of content you can play solo, but there is also content that can or must be done in groups. Story: Depends on the zone, can range from 4/10 to 11/10. Quest Design: Depends on the quest and on play style. Can be a 9/10 if you're interested in the lore, but if you're more interested in skipping any and all relevant dialogue and just doing tasks, it can get dull. Content: 11/10, I am far-too-many hours in and I have about 30%-40% more content left in the game in terms of quests and areas alone, not including dungeons and trials. Graphics: 9/10, the fantasy style means that the game ages well despite being 2014. Difficulty: 3/10 to 9/10. (Easy to learn, difficult to master.) Combat: 6/10. It's average, nothing too insane but not horrible either. UI: 5/10 in its base form, but can be raised much higher with addons on PC. Price: Low. It goes on sale often, and if you get the non-upgrade edition of the newest expansion (Greymoor at the time of this writing), you get all of the past major DLCs as well, so you don't need to play catch-up. Unlike what others may claim, subscription is not required. You can get the subscription if you want to try out the DLC or if you are a hard-core player or interested in doing major crafting. However, if you are just a casual once-in-a-while player, there is no need to buy the subscription. This also means that if you are about to have a busy time irl, you can pause your subscription without being locked out of the game if you still want to plat occasionally but not enough to warrant it.Yes, there are crown crates and a crown store and stuff that does cost real money in most cases. No, you can't collect everything in the game, even if you toss a Jeff Bezos salary at it. And that's part of the beauty of it -- no two people have the exact same stuff. Besides, all of the things that people cry are super expensive or in the crown crates? It's all cosmetic!!! I really don't see why people are losing their ***es over it when they're the ones willingly paying stupid amounts of money for minor cosmetic changes. You can play the game 100% without ever needing to get anything from the crown store or paying any more for it. This ain't World of Warcraft, people,At $10 on sale for base game, it's worth at least a try."
Positive,Great for casual gamers. good mmorpg for a dad with kids'
Positive,this is a fun game when u dont have somebody in ur ear telling u how much it sucks
Positive,"I'll start by saying this. I have played many MMOs in my days. Some more than others such as Ultima, Runescape, World of Warcraft, FF14...but Elder Scrolls Online, mind you this is in this gamer's opinion, has been the richest, immersing, and positive community driven MMO I have ever played.-:::The community:::-The player community of ESO has always been thoughtful, encouraging, and kind. There have only been probably two occurrences of a player being toxic in my 1200+ hours of playing. Even if you're not in a guild and you want to ""Sword Online '' it a bit, players you meet in the game are in one word, Awesome! Want to hear something even more dope? Players will sometimes help you get the gear you need by being on the lookout in rando dungeon runs. I do this myself and just trade the gear without asking for anything in return. Why? Because others did it for me when I started to play. Don't know when it started, but this mindset really is helpful for new players or vet players working up an alt. The forums and redit and great places to go for information and if you want to mention something.-:::Money Stuffs:::-First, the base game is $20 (USD) with NO subscription cost required. The base game is loaded with content on it's own. There are free-to-play events that last for about a week or two. During the event, usually the base game is even cheaper. Micro transactions exist and expansions will cost extra, but you don't need to spend an extra dime when you start to play. If you want to get a ESO plus membership...you'll mainly do it for the Crafting Bag! You can pay for one month, farm your behind off, toss it in the bag, and you will still have access to the materials even as a non member. Personally, I don't let my membership drop. I have enjoyed Bethesda games for many, many years and I believe in their mission statement as a company. This is my way of supporting them. In truth, I have spent roughly hundreds in a combination of micros/Xpacs/ESO Prime memberships. If you have a tattoo that says ""No Regrets"", give your tat a double pat, because it is how I feel about the money I have spent.-:::The gameplay:::-Ughhh...where to start...There is so much to do in the game. 1200+ hours and I still have things to do and explore. It's mind blowing! Each zone has unique story lines and quests/daily quests with awesome rewards. There is the main quest, which I recommend before doing anything else. It will get you attuned to the game mechanics, your race/class/weapon types/armor, and learn some awesome lore along the way. The character creation and race/class/weapon/armor combinations are endless. Pick the Race and Class you find that most speaks to you, but let's face it, you'll eventually want to build alts to see what else is awesome!-Character-The max level is 50, and more growth with Champion Points after capping. Character creation is just as in depth as any Elder Scrolls game. While questing, sometimes your race or class can trigger a line in NPCs to make it more immersive. Each race and class has their own special abilities and passives. There are the ""End-Game"" builds for grrrr dps, beefy tanking, and poofy Healing, but you can customize your play style for questing and solo-work in your way. Example? Hmmm? Dragon Knight...usually seen as a tanking class using one/two handed weapons with shields while breathing fire, throwing rocks, battle screaming, and jumping into battle like a Barbarian Berserker in DND, but...go ahead...equip a bow or a staff and do those same things and go Ham if you want to. Possibilities are endless for each combination of race, class, weapon and armor types.-Content-Bethesda is continuously adding new content and revisiting the game to keep it fresh and fun. They just revamped Champion Points...I haven't delved into the new system enough to make a bias comment, but I can say this; ""HOLY CANNOLI BATMAN"", there is great potential and growth for your character in the new system for PVE and PVP. There is usually a new expansion every year and it is treated like a year-long event with a prologue quest, updates, and things to do that get you ready for what is coming. As with most MMOs, there are also seasonal events like the New Life Festival (my favorite), Jester Festival, Witches Festival, Midyear Mayhem...just to name a few. All have great rewards, quests, and things to do. They add to those rewards each year!-PVP-You into PVP? Good, cause I'm not (lol). I can't accurately comment on PVP, because I am mainly a questing player trying to build his own home. That said, I can say this; It's a typical MMO PVP experience with dailies and stuff, but it has quite a few modes to choose from with unique objectives! Wish I could comment more, but maybe once I join a guild, I'll team up with those who can teach me the ways of ESO PVP. I'll edit this when that happens.-Guilds-Another area I can't accurately comment on, but what do guilds have in them? People! The Players! Look online about people in their guilds, no matter the game. No matter the size of the guild (and they can get big) they have long lasting friendships built with others they have met. Example I can give is my WoW days. I still talk to my old Guild Master and friend. She is like my Big Sister in a way and we live states apart! The people you meet in your guild could bring you joy. Meet with them and become family! Learn with them! Fight with them! FOR THE HOR...sorry, wrong game...the family aspect still applies though. No matter your race or banner you join, your guild could be that family you were looking for.-Homes-Yes, you can buy homes in ESO, just like in previous games. Buying homes makes them account wide, so your alts will be able to go into those same homes. Some players have built their own home. I am currently doing this and it is a massive undertaking, but I am enjoying it! You can even invite other players and guild mates into your home! ""Say What!?"". If that's not cool, then how about this. Your non-combat pets and mounts...you can set paths for them to walk or fly while you are in your house...Awesome! There are so many furniture items to collect and showcase. Get enough of them and you’ll eventually need more than one home to place them in!-:::Conclusion:::-I have had so much fun doing it solo, but this solo player is looking for a guild now. Like I said above, Richest, Immersing, and Positive community driven. You have all to gain and only a few hours to lose to download and give it a proper go. There is way too much to say about the game and so much more I want to say about individual aspects. You can download it on PS, Xbox, and PC. Just to be clear, cross-play is not a thing, but PC is where I am at. Come play and have some fun! Go! Go do it! Download! Yeeeesssss!!! Download it!! Jump into Tamriel with us and have fun!!!"
Positive,"Pros+ Huge expansive open world+ Fully voice acted+ Builds on the Elder Scrolls universe+ Active player baseCons- Some dislike the combat (varies per person)- Issues with server performance, especially with PVP- Hefty file sizeSkip to the bottom for my final thoughtsWith the latest expansion Greymoor on the horizon, I thought I'd write my review for The Elder Scrolls Online a few months in advance for new players who may be interested in the game currently. It's best to get a head start before the content drops!The Elder Scrolls Online, which I shall refer to as ESO, is a popular open-world MMORPG developed by ZeniMax Online Studios, and allows its players to explore a vast amount of Nirn during an unfamiliar time period in the Elder Scrolls universe.Play as you see fitOne of the best features of ESO which I highly commend is its easy accessibility to all players. That isn't to say that the game is easy - rather, it doesn't punish new players for mistakes they may make in the early stages of the game. Trust me, I myself made countless mistakes across a few characters before really getting a foothold. The learning curve may be a bit steep, but the early stages aren't absolutely brutal on new players. Feel free to put your character points into whatever you deem fit - you can always respec your points cheaply later on when it really matters.I'm not the best person to go to in terms of advice for beginners; there are plenty of in-depth beginner guides that can help you off your feet. But if you like going in blind as I did, know that it's never too late to follow a build. Furthermore, ESO is available to play in two main ways, PVE (player vs environment) and PVP (player vs player). I personally stick to the PVE aspects of the game, notably dungeons, delves and questing. I haven't quite gotten to the raids yet.Choose your role (Damage Dealer, Tank or Healer), set up your skill bar and prepare for battle. I've heard mixed reviews of ESO's combat system, but I personally have no problems with it and enjoy combat. Furthermore, there are currently six playable classes (four of which are available for free with the base game), ten races (nine of which are available for free with the base game), and thousands of unique viable builds to choose from for your gaming pleasure.Puts the Massive in Massively MultiplayerOne of my biggest gripes with ESO, that is also simultaneously one of my favourite features of the game, is its ridiculously massive world that is incredibly easy to get lost in. But with great power (huge 3D world with nice models, fully voice-acted characters, etcetera) comes great responsibility - in the form of 100-odd gigabytes on my hard drive. You read that right: over 100 glorious gigabytes of disk usage. On the other hand, ESO is also massively multiplayer in the sense that it is still very much alive. Unfortunately, the game isn't cross-platform, but on NA PC you still see other adventurers *mostly* wherever you go. The community is also *mostly* friendly, with many guilds waiting to welcome you in with open arms. By the way, you can be a member of up to FIVE different guilds, so there's really no excuse not to make some friends.If you're the type of player who likes playing through content by yourself, don't worry. You're not alone. You can play through the majority of ESO's content, sans high-tier PVE challenges.In my humble opinion, ESO is one of the best MMORPG story content-wise. I used to be the type of player who would skip through dialogue and cutscenes to get straight to the combat. Eventually, though, I started taking the time to listen to the fully voice-acted dialogue. Some quests are certainly better than others, but overall the quests are of good quality. I highly recommend you level your main character through questing rather than grinding. Not only do you get to experience the quest, but you can also get unique rewards and lots of XP.ESO is a great looking game and is again one of the best MMORPGs visual-wise in my opinion. I'll admit, there are definitely some meshes that look better than others (outlier examples), but for the most part, the game looks great. I really enjoy riding on my mount from point-to-point rather than just teleporting. The better rig you have, the better the game looks. The soundtrack is also superb, and as I've mentioned, the dialogue is fully voice acted.In terms of the base game, which frequently goes on sale, there are hundreds of hours of content available with no other purchases, microtransactions or otherwise. The Business ModelOn the other hand, there is also a plethora of paid DLCs, expansions, and microtransactions available in ESO's Crown store. The game's premium currency, Crowns, can be traded among players in the form of gifting items in exchange for gold. This is often done through middlemen and can be risky. ZeniMax offers no other form of currency exchange. There also exists a paid membership, ESO Plus, which is not required for the base game, that grants subscribers unlimited access to all DLC (excluding new expansions), a number of crowns and other benefits.Again, the aforementioned microtransactions are not at all necessary for hundreds of hours of enjoyment, but I myself have made purchases on the Crown store and am currently an active ESO+ subscriber.In the actual game itself, you don't run into issues all too often. I experience the occasional crash, but this may not necessarily be due to ESO. Regarding server performance, however, much of the community have raised complaints about the poor performance of the games servers and matchmaking capabilities specifically. This problem mostly applies to those interested in PVP, however, problems do exist with the Dungeon Finder (hit-or-miss queue times).In general PVE play, especially if you're sticking with the overworld content, you shouldn't experience many problems. If necessary, restart your game every few hours to keep the memory usage low.My computer (see below) has no problems running ESO at high settings, however, I acknowledge that for lower-end rigs you may encounter difficulty in running the game. Make sure to check the minimum specifications, and if your PC has equivalent or better parts. The in-game settings menu allows you to customize the graphics settings to suit your needs.CPU: i7-8750GPU: GTX 1060RAM: 16GB DDR4Greymoor is coming.The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited is one of the best MMORPGs currently available on Steam. Play how you want in the game's expansive world, against other players or enemies, and prepare yourself for the Dark Heart of Skyrim.Click here to view my complete rating chart, and what this rating means.Like the review?

Positive,"first, please pardon me for the grammar errorsecond, i played this game about 40+ hours now, and just only get lvl 20, so i don't really have any experience with the  end-game content yet, but i'll talk about negative and positive side of this game that i experience through out my journeypositive side :1. storyline and storytelling systemfor an MMORPG, this game got really good storyline, zenimax not only concentrate on the main-quest storyline, but also on the side quest, about 90% of the side quest i've done got really great dialogue and very interesting story, most of them always revolve around TES series lore, which is really interesting by itselfand so far 100% of all quest i done are voice acted, it adding the immersive-ness of the game, and help the player with ""tl;dr"" problem 2.Quest systemas i said, questing here really fun, not feels much like a chore because of the story they offerand also this game give you multiple choice in some side quest, which will effect you gameplay and the outcome of the quest, its quite rare to find this kind of feature in other MMO3.Job Systemyou practically can be whatever you want, wanna be a tank-mage? you can, or a warmage?, you can of course, every job can access all weapons and armor, so you can customize your character whatever you want what will suit your gameplay4.Skill Systemif you ever played GW2, skill system here rather similar BUT much more interesting and complex, because you got a lot of skill to upgrade, and you can choose whatever skill you want, theres your basic job skills, racial skills, world skills, weapon skills etc, and when 1 skill already achieve max level, some of them you can transform it into much more powerfull version of it, create your own skill combo5.World Designindeed probably the world design not as detail/as beautifull like other MMORPG especially P2P MMORPG like FF14, but it fit the theme really well, theres variations in each area and faction which fit the lore and add make the game much more immersive, i find my self waste hourse just for exploring the world :))6.Gameplaywell imagine skyrim/TES series with classic MMORPG skill, thats practically what you get, it's fun, at first probably need a little bit adaptation, but when you get hang of it, its fun even though probably not as fast paced as you imagine, but TES series never been a fast paced action RPG genre7. Economy systemnow, this part that i really like, there is no public auction whatsoever, you can trade/get some kind of auction, but only through a guild, thus in this game you could join up to 5 guildswith this system, you can cross trading between guilds, looking for best price to buy and sell on each region, really reminds me of XIAN online type of economy, dynamic controlled by playernow, let switch to the negative side of the game :1. the soundtrackIMHO, theres no single memorable soundtrack in this game, in FF14 i always remember which soundtrack belong to which area, but here....every music feels the same, theres like no identity at all for each music.2. the character creationthe character creation too shallow imho, theres no clear different between each slide bar for every part of the character body, thus i can't made the character i really want even though i waste 30-50 minutes creating ittl;dr -> The Elder Scrolls Online : It sucks no more, highly reccomended for everyone :)"
Positive,"I don't know where to start with this review but I want to say that this has been a game I keep coming back to and now currently play as my main MMO. I picked it up between the Legion and BFA expansions of WoW as a game to kinda dip my toes into. Now it's my main MMO and I'm in love with this game and all aspects of it. Well...most aspects, not allThe combat feels deep and rewarding with a plethora of ways to handle building your character. You can try all types of creative and fun builds without the worry of being a parse monkey (unless you're going for the highest level of progression). The only bad part is the fact abilities sometimes fail to fire off which can be frustrating. Pls fix the bugs, ZoS.The open world is the best of any MMORPG with how the game utilizes its world. All quests are voice acting, all NPC's are voiced. The questlines in the game are amazing.I love the PvP even if it can be frustrating in its performance lately. But there's no game that feels quite like this one. Most people write off PvP because the skill gap and don't know why they are dying. But I promise if you take the time to learn the fundamentals and mechanics of it, you might fall in love as well.Dungeons: Best dungeons of any MMO hands down. Maybe not the base game stuff, but the DLC dungeons on veteran and vet hard mode are incredible.Trials/Raids: The only part of the game I can't speak to the quality of because I don't have the patience to be on a raid team. I enjoy the dungeons and the pvp and that's enough for me.Arenas: Amazing solo and group arenas exist with tons of awesome rewards and weaponsCharacter building: This game is a true RPG in how you kit out your character and play specific builds. You'll find out when you playThe bad: Crown store. Stay so far from it, it is predatory to new players and half the stuff on it shouldn't be on it. Even worse, the crown crates rely on FOMO to get you to buy them. Please do not buy them. I am a hypocrite for saying this because I've bought them, but I'm the exact player they're preying on it with. I know I shouldn't buy them yet I do.ESO Plus is also pushed on you pretty hard as a new player because you won't have a craft bag and won't have access to any of the DLC content. Fear not new players. When starting the game. DO NOT pick up crafting materials while on non-sub account. Instead, use the time to put items on research because you can't even really use those materials unless you have things researched. So research while exploring the game and playing at your own pace. Craft laterI've rambled on long enough. This review is unorganized"
Positive,"You see that nearly 600 hours up there? Well over 400 of them were spent fishing so that I could sell magic fish guts, and save up money to become a clockwork robot. Upon finally getting that robot I nearly had a stroke from the joy of finally not having to fish anymore... oh, and also being a robot.    Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to fishing."
Positive,"Your expectation of The Elder Scrolls® Online: Tamriel Unlimited™ should first and foremost be that of an MMO, not an Elder Scrolls game. While the game does have the lore and basic 'dumbed down' aesthetic of The Elder Scrolls it lacks the atmosphere. What I mean is it does not draw you into the lore and entice you as does it's single player cousins. Rather, you find yourself mindlessly fighting through zone to zone, quest to quest, dungeon to dungeon with no genuine interest in its lore or atmosphere. This is a hugely common trait to an MMO and not something the Elder Scrolls is known for bringing.That being said it's by no means a bad game or MMO. In fact, it's outstanding. The combat loosely resembles The Elder Scrolls and has a fairly decent spectrum of play styles between the classes. PVP in ESO is a breath of fresh air but can soon become stale and has a hugely disadvantages experience curve in the start.To summarize, you'll find yourself trying to delve in and love this game as you would the world of The Elder Scrolls. However, you should not add this to your library simple because it wears The Elders Scrolls 'cloak' as you may be disappointed. As an MMO, it's fantastic and fairly unboring but does leave much to be desired despite its large amount of content. If you are looking for a good MMO that wears The Elder Scrolls aesthetic and features a few new treats to the MMO scene then this may be the game for you. If you are looking for a multiplayer skyrim then you will be sorely disappointed.7.5/10"
Positive,"Review after a long long play timeAs you can see i am pretty busy trying to complete the Game with all its content. After 2k + hrs. i think i am able to do a Review.Yes i played other Es Games. I started with Skyrim as it came out, i loved it. i also tryed Oblivion after that and the last game before i  went to Eso was Morrowind. All games have 1 in common. the Absolut freedom from the very beginning. After you finished the Prologue you will be gently released into a huge open world Area. The ammount of quests you can find in eso is absurd. Its things like "" Bringe me this Staff or kill that Monster "" But there are also Mainquest lines in every Map you can explore ( yes the maps are connected to eachother and you can travel them even by foot. ) These quests can get very long. maby you need 1 or 2 days to complete them. 2 lvl systems are ingame. once you hit lvl 50 you start over with the so called cp system ( Campion Points ) its similar to the skyrim skilltrees from the look. the cp point system gets up to cp lvl 690 right now. every point is a powerfull passive you can connect to eachother to build your own char as you like. Want a Tank who can heal just with 1 weapon bar swap ? go for it. Ant there comes the point where all gets much more interesting. The endgame: I have never played a Game with so much Endgame content as eso. once you hit cp 160 ( which is max gear lvl ) you can start to build up your own Warrior. There are many sets. 5 pice sets, 3 pice stes 2 pices and even 1 pice sets. all of these Items can be combined as you wish, to experiment and build up. Some sets can be crafted, others need to be found. The grinding aspect isnt that bad in eso. There was a update , not long ago. now we all can transmute the Traits from all our weapons and Armor as we like. No more farming 1 dungeon 100 times because the dagger you want just dropps in training. Some dungeons can be extremly brutal, even with a good groupe. ( up to 12 man raids ) 80 % of the game can be beaten very easy, but if you wana min max and bring out the best in your char you have to face greate evil.The next thing i wana talk about is the pvp system. Everyone hwo played Oblivion will know the place very well. Huge battles are going on in Cyrodiil for the fight of the Emperor title. 3 Allianz Teams build a triangle in the map ( wich is abnormal huge for pvp. so train your horse in speed ) the main goal is to dominate arrount the Imperial city. capure as many castles as you can and hold them. This can be buggy to a point where you are not able to play the game . loading screens of death ( unending loading screen ) if a fight between 200 + players breakes out the fps dropps so low you cant even attack... well thats really a - Point in my opinion. But there are other fine Options where you can battle other players. the imperial city itselfe is a battleground and is very stable. the whole city has a huge dungeon system blow the ground where you can battle too. Battlegrounds ar a new form of 4v4v4 Battles. Normal modes like deathmatches, capture the flag and so on can be played here. A very interesting point is the fighting mecanics. rolldoge, block and weapon swaps in the fights allow you for offensive and deffensive manouver at the same time. even animation cnceling is possible, which allowes good players to nearly double the dps or hot you can dish out. Shure there is and will always be a meta, but it changes and after a while you will know that in eso skill matters. its not just the sets and weapons that makes a good fighter. it takes months to really handle a 2h sword the right way. the marked system is a whole dimension in itselfe. there are hundreds of traiding Guilds ingame. every guild can hold up to 500 players i think or 600.  you can have 5 guilds at the same time in evry guild you have 30 slots for selling your stuff. some people play the game just because of the marked. ( Master merchant addon is a must have for traiding )The community is very nice and friendly. no pay to win at all. the whole real money store stuff is just for the looks.eso + is another thing. i dont think you need it but it is very awesome. you have no storage problems at all and you can travel to dlcs you dont have in your game. there is a festival once every year where you can try out eso + for free. a whole week. try it first for free and if you cant be without it just do it then.All in all i wnat to say this game has a huge potential and it uses it the right way. shure the game has bugs, lots of them, but its nothing else like skyrim or oblivion. if you can handle the bugs from the older games you can handle the bugs from eso too. nothing that whould spoil your fun. Lots of content as i said before and much to come in the next time. ( my personal tipp: grab the gold edition when its on sale ) and try out a RPG you wont foget."
Positive,"If you like Elder Scrolls but don't know about playing with other people, this game is obscenely solo-friendly. While the combat is a bit different than you might be used to, you can just explore and play it like any other Elder Scrolls, and there's just an obscene amount of content here, most of it pretty great. Highly recommended."
Positive,"Please bring Turkish language support, thank you."
Positive,"Out of all the MMOs I've played, this one's community is the one that makes me want to kill myself the least."
Positive,I love this game now. Back when in beta it was pretty boring I wont lie. After a few updates I strongly recommend this game to those who are looking for a new mmo and happen to love The Elder Scrolls as well. I'v always stayed away from subscription based MMO's and this has become the first mmo iv paid a subscription for even though its not required.
Positive,"Reviewer: The game is a watered down skyrim, with quests that aren't worth your time, and a very boring storyline.Me: *Plays Game*Got my life saved by a pirate Khajiit, repayed him by helping him, ran into a ghost who had cursed daedric tomes that whispered to her, discovered the politics of Mistral, found out the Maormers stole a treaty, stopped a gigantic hurricane from within the eye of the storm, witnessed the murder of a good guy in the position of ""The Silvenar"", tracked down his assassin, let ""The Silvenar""'s soulmate murder the guy who hired the assassin, found out there was a plot to wipe out the entire population of mistral through blood sacrifice and the energies of storm and wind, destroyed a gigantic storm atronach therefore saving an entire province from catastrophe, helped the captain of the guard keep the queen safe, got knocked out, got kidnapped, found out I was betrayed by a traitor within the queens circle, escaped prison, killed the traitor in an epic confrontation.I can continue, or I can just hit ""Yes"" on this recommended button and strongly disagree with that reviewer. I choose the latter."
Positive,"I treat the game like a big singleplayer with the occasional social interaction. Lots of lore, stories, collectibles and a beautiful environment. Not much of an end game player. Got my main geared up as good as possible for a solo player and can tackle much of the game on my own at my own pace."
Positive,"I'm currently playing ESO like.. a single player game. Pvp in Cyrodiil sometimes.. or queue to a Dungeon/Battleground here and there. Right now i don't care about the end game, i'm just leveling my alts and following through the story and the most impotant..  i'm having fun :)"
Positive,"I have played this game quite some bit.  I recently decided to knock it down to one night a week. Getting burned out.  ALl in all, I feel this is the best MMO out.  First the pros:  Big world, fights are fast paced and veteran level content is unforgiving for those who like to not dodge mechanics.  The graphics are beautiful for it's age.   Community as a whole is great.  Most people are very very helpful and nice (although getting them to talk with a mic is like asking them to swallow glass!).  The population of the community feels great after 1 tam came out.Now the cons.  There are a ton of bugs in the game.  None that are game breaking, but they do get annoying.  Customer service is a joke.  Bad class balancing.  Used to be magic based characters were overpowered.  Now it is the stamina based versions of the same classes.  The downfall is all the stam based characters feel VERY generic and lack uniqueness (literally 80% of stam based skills are the same across classes).  The magic based characters feel much more unique in their abilities, but their performance took a big hit after Dark Brotherhood (you can play them, but there is a noticable difference).  When it comes to loot, it literally are running the same content over and over and over and over hoping your piece drops with the right configuration on it.  The content for me, got old quick after clearing vet material.  You are basically reduced to a chimp pulling a lever 500 times for a piece of candy.  Some people really like the PVP, but it wasnt for me.  Hopefully this helps you decide if it is right for you.  If you like MMOs, and dont expect Skyrim!, check it out.  I think you will pleasantly surprised until the you eventually get bored.  That will take awhile though!"
Positive,"What we have here is a bit of a mess. Which is a shame as underneath that mess there is a good game, not a great game but not a dud either. The problem is that its been updated and had DLC added without much (or perhaps any) care in making that mesh with what's there already.  Crashes occasionally too. So mess first. If this does not matter to you then this could be the game for you. It is fun, I like it, but…Where you start will depend on if you have purchased any of the DLC with the game as part of a pack. For example if you get Elsweyr and Morrowind then you will start in one of those areas, rather than where the main quest kicks off. This would not be so much of an issue if the DLC did not happen after the events of the main quest and there weren’t massive spoilers relating to main quest characters in the DLC. Morrowind is more or less self contained, but Elsweyr isn’t and several main quest characters turn up there, with one in particular having a colossal spoiler. Soo... Just avoid the DLC areas right? Except unless you do a ‘net search you have no idea where the main quest starts, or how to start it. Its a big game with a big map and you have to do one tiny specific thing to start the main quest – actually you have to do two. If you’ve played it; think of the trigger for those darn Oblivion gates in Oblivion as an example. Even when you are in the main quest you still hit Back-to-the-Future moments with NPCs who cannot possibly be wondering around - as for example they are nailed to a wall in a prison cell somewhere - coming up to you and offering you quests. Or the same NPC being in 3 different places at once in the same quest or NPCs just apparently warping around the place to talk to you and yet still being in other places and also being in the DLC while they are nailed to a wall in a prison cell so yeh its a bit of a mess. There are free prologue quests which lead into the DLC, but one will break the main quest completely if you start it.  You have to abandon the prologue quest to start the main one up again – if you are lucky. It didn’t work for me so I had to complete the 1st part of the prologue and then abandon subsequent one to get the main quest back. However unless you start wondering why a particular NPC hasn’t pestered you for ages and then ‘net searched (again) you’d never know there was a problem. Oh the quest you need to abandon is demon weapon  which is the prologue to Elsweyr.Then there are places where the devs just didn’t think things though. I had one quest where you had to rescue some folk and one of them also wanted me to find something. Having rescued them and found the thing I then discovered I could not talk to the NPC who wanted the thing as all the folk I rescued were in the way.The map is split into PVE (most of it but you can challenge players) and PVP (Cyrodiil). Now I don’t tend to PVP but had to visit Cyrodiil to find something. It was not fun. Whether it was my internet playing up at just that time or what I don’t know but I kept getting micro loading screens as I wondered around the map – not a problem in other areas. As a result when I did bump into another player I was instantly cheesed (like being creamed, but with a more piquant aftertaste) as I micro-loading screened. OK I would probably have died anyway but it didn’t help.Finally there is the game’s history. When launched you picked a faction and could only play in that faction's area and Cyrodiil. Then the PVE map was opened up so you can play anywhere – your main quest just starts in your faction’s area but you can quest anywhere on the map. Except… The quests were not updated, so as a result you now fight your own faction’s NPCs in some areas of the map. I’m not sure how this could have been fixed, but given so little else has been, I’m not surprised. A little note here added after I completed a rather long quest - don't read unless you want a spoiler.  This is explained once you have completed the main quest, why you can wander into the other factions areas and not get smashed to a pulp by the guards when you do. Except you can now do this anyway before you complete the main quest. So yeh...So can you ignore the above? Well mostly. Its annoying and immersion breaking so if that’s important to you look elsewhere. If it isn’t then don’t look  Elsweyr until you’ve done the main quest. As a game the graphics are good, not 2020 quality but fine for an MMO. Rain stays outside buildings, even if people don’t get wet and it doesn’t splash on water. Fog is suitably murky, spells flashy - perhaps too flashy if you play 1st person - and the animals (not so much the horses) look and move fairly realistically - as do the bipeds. well as realistically as giant winged demons might. The voice acting ranges from the usual bored person saying words to very good – particularly the majority of the Khajiit (cat people) NPCs. Some of the side quests made me smile and although the main quest is very linier, the other map quests can be completed in any order – just don’t expect the timeline to make a lot of sense if you do. NPCs generally do not know they have spoken to you before and will happily tell you their life story again. Equally sometimes the devs will assume that you have spoken to someone before and the NPC will leave out some info resulting in wtf moments.Just to round on the DLC again. The DLC chapters (Morrowind, Elsewyr etc) sort of follow on from each other. For example there’s Morrowind, the Clockwork city and then (no you have to buy the Clockwork city from the in game store you cannot get it as part of a Steam pack - no I don't know why either) Summerset. Quests tend to be hack-and-slash with puzzles in a few (not very many at all). If you like a puzzler and less action then this may not be the game for you. Also most crooked NPCs are obviously crooked - not much need for the Spidey sense here.For an mmo the NPC combat is not bad, its fairly fluid while not being a brawler, and you are not nailed to the ground while you do a special move. Can’t comment on PVP. Some mechanics feel a bit pay to win. Although you buy the game you don’t need a subscription. If you go for one then you get all the DLC unlocked, plus a crafting bag – which holds all the crafting materials and makes inventory management less of the PINTA it can be. If you decide to buy bits over time, say you don’t play enough to make a sub worth it then you can get DLC from the in-game store as well as other stuff. The game and DLC (from the in game store) is sometimes on sale as well.Aside from DLC most in-game store stuff is cosmetic, hats, pets, mounts (you get a free horse just by levelling) etc. But there are potions and food which might appear pay-to-win as they buff your char for longer and easier than crafting them or finding them. I don’t mind this, the devs have to eat after all, but you might. You also get a daily gift just by logging on which is generally a random store based buff.The DLC can be expensive - especially the DLC dungeons, which might put you off and while I don’t PVP, a lot of the PVP community doesn’t sound happy. So if PVP is important then this may not be your game. Read reviews from PVP players and then decide.There is grind, particularly if you want to progress in the mage’s guild and in crafting where you not only have to hunt for the materials, styles, recipes etc but also have to wait increasingly long times to research new buffs for amour etc. Jewellery is completely locked out without the Summerset DLC and the crown store has instant research scrolls (some of which drop in the daily gift and as part of levelling) that reduce this research by a day. That's a day real time – not game time. Yes sometimes you have to wait a loong time.Its not a bad game, bits are very good and I like it. However I can only recommended if consistent story telling is not that important to you."
Positive,"I'm an ESO noobie, jumped into the game in Apirl 2020. It's also my first MMORPG ever, although I've been playing single-player RPGs for 10 years.First the positives - as an MMORPG noob I was utterly astonished by the size of the world and the number of things you can do in this game. I did NOT expect anything close to that, and I have just the base game + Morrowind. No DLCs, no other expansions. I can now understand how people can spend years in this game and still have something to do. I also didn't expect how much the social aspect will appeal to me. Running through a dungeon with a group of people can be p. exhilarating. It's a very different experience from something like Skyrim or Witcher but just as great.And now for why I stopped playing just after a day. After a few hours of running around the world and having an absolute blast of my life, I started noticing something suspicious - no matter where I go and what I fight I'm always doing about the same amount of damage. It took me a few hours to realize this but when I was fighting just some random punks or small monsters it made sense.But then I stumbled into a group fight with some giant and again, I was doing a lot of damage, while taking barely any. And then I ran into a group of cultists in the forest who summoned a huge lich. And I just melted all of them, solo, just as easily as all the other monsters before.I thought ""wait a minute, how bad is the scaling in this game"". So I googled a bit and oh boy...I learned the entire game is scaled exactly to your level, everywhere and all the time. And not only that - most people seem to be loving it!But....why? The moment I learned there's not a single challenge anywhere in the world, that every single enemy everywhere will always be a ""trash mob"", my motivation to play this game dropped to zero. What's the point of levelling, of learning all that dizzying array of tools like crafting or alchemy if you never need any of it? With my magical templar, all I ever did was to repeatedly press the ""1"" key to poke monsters with my piercing spear ability, simply because you never need to do anything else. In my 7 hours in the game I've never died, I've never even dropped below 50% of my HP. And I've solved almost all the content too. Running around with a group was even more trivial.How are people ok with this? I don't mean to bash or criticize anyone for liking a certain style of a game, I'm just curious - what is your drive to play this game? In all the dozens of RPGs, I've ever played the point was to struggle and master all the skills and tools the game was offering to be able to take on harder and harder enemies. What's the main drive in ESO - just to travel around the world, sightseeing and absorb the lore? Don't get me wrong, the world is jaw-droppingly phenomenal and the lore is amazing but is that enough for you? You don't require any challenge in your RPG?Sorry for the wall of text but this game gave me such mixed feelings I had to get it off my chest."
Positive,"After nearly 4000 hrs, I can say I like the game just a little. Joking aside, this is an MMO that will give you what you put into it. I run one of the largest guilds on the server, I PvPed, PvEed and I even jumped off a few cliffs! Some of the content feels extremely grindy like becoming a mastercrafter and researching for a few months (no exaggeration) gear traits. All gear in ESO drops with a trait on it and you use your daily research slots (up to 3 with passives) to destroy that item and start a timer that increases over time (up to 9 different traits per an item, last one being about 27 days). Traits for example would be like well-fitted which reduces stamina cost on dodge rolling. This is needed to gain full access to armor/weapon set crafting. Crafted sets are unlocked by the number of traits you know for a weapon/armor category piece. After knowing all 9 you can make anything for that piece (i.e heavy chest). You will definitely get a rewarding sense of accomplishment when you finally finish researching, so start early!You will also want to visit a stables as early as possible to level your mount for speed, stamina and extra bag space. Unfortunately, without using crown store/daily reward items its 180 days per character (60 times per category, 20 hr waiting per time when you spend 250g at stables). Your mounts fortunately are account wide so you will have wonderful aesthetics from a reward mount on your level 10 alt, riding at the speed of four drunk turtles!Grindy start up parts aside, there is content and a variety of playstyles for everyone. You can build/decorate homes with items (inside existing ones that you buy with gold or crowns), make/buy furniture that you unlocked after leveling professions (crafting), just solo quest and enjoy amazing story arcs in any order. The world of ESO is rich in lore and quite honestly, there is still stuff that surprises me after all these hours. There is no one way to gear your character, you can do multiple anti-meta builds and still be viable. Do not worry about gear until you reach level 50 and hit CP 160 which is the gear cap (CP is the account wide progression that starts after reaching 50 on your first character). All that being said however, the small price you pay is worth all the content you can enjoy and quite honestly the grind is not in your face like other MMOs. After all my hours, I have only completed half the game so far!Finally, the subscription is completely worth it because that craft bag is worth its weight in gold, you also get access to all the DLCs (not including expansions) and double the space for your bank/home. Did I mention the crowns as well that you can use in the game cash shop? Sure a cash shop is not for everyone but its all cosmetics like with most MMOs, however if you are going to use those crowns get the two inventory pets so you get 10 extra bag spaces. Inventory management is extremely important in ESO which is why you want that craft bag!Thanks for reading, I genuinely hope you enjoy the game!"
Positive,A good MMORPG game. 8/10 because if you don't have friends it becomes The Elder Scrolls Offline.
Positive,Fun if you like to grind.Not fun if you don't like to grind.I like to grind.

Positive,"Decent game, I didn't play a lot of it myself though. Just know that once the steam download is done and you open it, it has its own launcher for the game. In the launcher there is another download you have to do that is a decent size. Also just sitting in the launcher increases game time for ESO. So if your download speed isn't crazy good, and you find you don't like the game after it, then you won't be able to refund it. So I would suggest to watch some videos on it first before buying it."
Positive,"Good game, fun game if you are casual gamer and don'y have much time to play. Just login. Do quest or two - maybe dungeon with friends or random ppl for loot. Explore some world. Craft weapon or armor.Repeat tommorow. I recommend."
Positive,"I tried this back when it first came out and left pretty underwhelmed. It wasn't bad, but it was fiddly to the point of irritating, the mechanics were unclear, and the combat seemed dull. I was also playing other games at the time and I wound up drifting away from it after hitting level 12 or so.Now, I'm a huuuuuuge Morrowind dork. When the expansion came out, I decided to take the plunge on it if for no other reason than to revisit a game I spent easily a thousand hours on, just to see how it holds up.First point to its credit: It does a truly a solid job of recreating the OG Morrowind experience. The map is nearly 1:1 as far as I can tell, though large portions of the middle mountain are inaccessible so the actual playable area is likely much smaller. It doesn't feel that way though; I'm easily 30+ hours in on my second attempt and I've yet to really do anything off the island of Vvardenfell except for some minor sight-seeing. I've not even touched the base game Main Quest, in true Elder Scrolls fashion, and the game totally allows for this. More impressively however is that the game fully modernizes Morrowind. Every voice line has full (and well acted!) VO, complete with the actors making admirable attempts to pronounce all of Morrowind's insane dungeon names and Ashlander terms. Everything is much more lush and animated without losing any of the inherent weirdness of Morrowind. Telvanni mushroom towers are now inhabited by active NPCs who adhere to a day/night cycle and will work their jobs. Pages and assistants to the Telvanni mages fritter about talking among themselves. There's a ton of little details that have far more activity going on than the original game was ever able to allow, and it all just works. While it's set 700 years prior to Morrowind 1, there's still plenty of returning NPCs from Morrowind like Vivec and a much younger Divayth Fyr (that Telvanni Mage with the godlike Tower that players would always kill him and inhabit, and which had a dungeon below it (which is now a full-on raid, amusingly enough)). Also impressively, the single player things you'd expect to be removed from an MMO, aren't. You can still pickpocket any NPC you like. Stealth works exactly the same as it does in Skyrim. Shoplifting items is a thing, as is selling stolen items to fences for cash. Bounties are enforced by guards, and just like Morrowind you can either pay them off on the spot or run (jail has been omitted but eh, whatever). But the thing that's kept me playing is that this game is almost the Anti-WoW. Everything is vastly more complicated, seemingly as an intentional design choice, but unlike the launch version of the game it's now much more *crunchy* instead of needlessly fiddly. You can simply hammer out a few swords in the Blacksmithing profession and call it a day, OR you can dig deep into the system and craft some seriously powerful custom kit if you feel like it. Doing so, however, requires you to drop skill points into the system that could be spent on combat skills instead. Just like the Elder Scrolls games have always done, there's a significant choice to be made about character progression and they'll get better at the things they do more often than not. The complexity is initially pretty staggering but after a while you begin to be able to See The Matrix and the system winds up making perfect sense. The approach to character level in general is a curious one as well in that there really isn't one. Everything in the game remains at the same base level, and gaining a level is reflected more in your skill points than any kind of base power creep. A wandering Alit becomes only marginally easier to kill at level 30 than it was at level 1, but the difference is that if you've acquired more skills, you simply have more kit at your disposal; you have to actually USE it, however. The numbers don't automatically get any higher.This translates to gear being less effective as you outlevel it, making new gear necessary not so much to jack up your power level but to prevent it from falling off. It's...Counterintuitive, but it actually makes a lot of sense and serves the excellent purpose of never gating you off from content because you're not a sufficient level for it. You're ALWAYS a sufficient level for it, and it's always floating at a difficulty point that will provide a challenge. It takes some getting used to and was jarring at first, but now I find myself preferring it to the Dragonball-Style power creep in other RPGs. Smart stuff, if a bit unconventional.Lastly, and impressively: This game is monstrously huge. There is an INSANE amount of stuff to do. It puts every other Elder Scrolls game, and honestly any other RPG I can even think of, to absolute shame in terms of sheer Crap To Do™. When you factor in that all of this is fully voiced and animated, the amount of content on display here is jaw-dropping. Wanna explore Elsweyr, the Khajit homeland? How about the Dragontail mountains, not seen since the original Daggerfall? The Gold Coast? Hammerfell? Daggerfall itself? It's all in here and it's super detailed and explorable. ~~And it's free.~~ EDIT: I'm an idiot, no it isn't, leaving this up because it's the only way I'll learnSeriously. You can opt to pay $15 a month for the ""Crown Plus"" subscription. This is worth it if you plan on delving into the crafting aspect because you get a bottomless crafting item bag (which, believe me, you're GOING to want if you do any crafting), but if you simply want to ignore that aspect in favor of playing through the plot and going on exploration adventures, you can absolutely just play the free base game and be none the worse for wear. If anything, the $15 sub should be considered a Crafting subscription as opposed to anything gating off the proper game. It's incredibly useful for that feature, but really ONLY that feature, and you don't need to do it in order to play the content at all. Scaled item drops will always keep you sufficiently geared and you'll easily have a couple hundred hours worth of content to explore freely without limitation even if you never drop a single cent into the game itself. So in short, yeah. This is absolutely worth checking out in 2018, and I strongly recommend anyone with a fondness for Morrowind to drop the cash on the Expansion that allows you to play through it and check it out. 100% worth it even if that's all you ever do in the game.If you do opt to check it out, hit me up in-game. I'm on the EU Megaserver (I have no idea why, it's where it put me for some reason) and can be found @DJMalloc. Let's go explore the ash wastes and pick fights with Cliff Racers.(There are still so, so many cliff racers. My god.)"
Positive,"Where to start hmm... Came back to ESO after 6 Years, a bunch of things changed, mainly I no longer have stupid fps issues and load screen issues. You will be able to run on max settings in PvE hitting around 100-140 fps (Tweaked the ini file to fix the mouse sensitivity issue) with an RTX 3080. Not sure how bad PvP is because I don't do PVP.Here are my opinions about the game.1. Music. A little biased because I am a fan of game OSTs. ESO's OST are epic and memorable, especially the one when you are doing dolmens. 2. Quest and lore. Quests are all fully voice acted, even the side quests. There are tonnes of quest in this game, even if its just the base game. There are 3 different factions but, you can only choose the races under each faction to play unless you have the DLC/addon to have the freedom to select a faction with any race.3. NPCs. One tip for people who love talking to NPCs, make sure to all the quest NPCs before and after submitting the quest. They will have different things to say which makes things lively. 4. Activities. Need a break from questing? Try fishing and get the fishing achievements. Heard there's a new card game, might be interesting for people who fancies card games. If not, read the lore books let the lore sink in or just do dungeons.5. PvP. I don't PvP. However, Alliance wars are very very laggy due to really bad server and also the number of players doing it. Imagine a large scale war with 3 factions in the same instance.6. PvE. Quest mobs are easy to kill, quest bosses are also fairly easy. For solo content / questing, I recommend the Two handed skill tree for the temporary shield as it scales based on how many mobs hit in a swing (perfect time to recast buff/heals while soaking dmg.) World bosses are solo-able with a decent build and some resource management. If you want more challenge, try doing Dungeons and Trials.7. Matchmaking. People say its bad and personally, I think its pretty bad. Queue times are long. Your best bet is to go to a highly populated zone like Craglorn, ask in chat to join trials.8. Trials, Dungeons and Arena. Probably the end game goal for PvE to farm for your set items. Normal dungeons are fairly easy with a slight exception of Veteran dungeons. You probably want to gear up and have proper builds and a proper team of 1 tank, 2 damage dealers and a good healer. Trials are larger dungeons that requires 12 players to complete. Each different trials have their own specific mechanics so best you google and study up before joining one. Everyone has their own role in a trial and there are one shot mechanics during their boss fights. People get salty fast when wipes happen and no one is willing to teach and guide newcomers. Arenas like the maelstrom arena is where you can challenge yourself to see how good you are in PvE in terms of Gear, Skill and Resource Management.9. Skill tree. There are 2 kind of trees in game. The actual character skill tree for your class, traits etc. The other one is your end game tree for buffs called the Champion tree. You unlock this tree when you hit level 50. 10. Leveling. I'd say the pace is fine for playing casually. If hardcore, you can go from level 1 - 50 in an hour with buffs and gear.11. Learning curve. Not that great for people who never played RPG games. Initial tutorial is fine but after throwing you into the world, it will be the classic way of playing an RPG game which is not that great for people now a days (i guess). I guess in my opinion, people now a days prefer the hand holding in learning the ropes rather than explore on your own kinda thing. This can be daunting for new players like the crafting skill tree in terms of what does it do, how to level them, researching traits, trait crafting etc. Personally I think RPG games are all about exploring what you can do in the world and experiment and theory crafting. Let your imagination run wild and see how far you can go. 12. Subscription. My take on the subscription is that if you think you are able to commit playing this MMO for awhile, go for it. If you are just playing casually, you can do without the subscription. The main attractive part about the subscription is the crafting bags. Resources/ materials for crafting will be stored in the premium bag that has unlimited slots. It helps out a lot if you love hording gathered materials during your adventures. If not, the good ol' pack mule characters work, which means you have to worry more about inventory management. 2nd attractive part is that it unlocks DLCs which you don't own. Personally, I think you can do without them if you are playing casually, having fun exploring and killing stuff around. Plus, tonnes of quests for other factions are available for you to complete!13. Server. Two servers are available for your choosing, NA and EU. Pick the one with the best ping and go with it. People in asia playing in NA or EU servers will get from 240 ping to 360 ping. Playable but frustrating if you are very very sensitive about lag. Personally, it didn't bother me much when I'm doing veteran trials and dungeons. It will be a different story in PvP because in PvE, you know what is going on, not in PvP where anything can happen. Zenimax says they are upgrading their EU servers at Q1 2023 but we will see how much of an improvement we get.14. Guilds. There are Role Playing guilds (RP Guilds), PvP guilds, Casual guilds and trader guilds. Join whichever you fancy. I find casual guilds to be the best as there are a mix of players who are knowledgeable, willing to teach and most important of all, friendly, respecting and knows how to have a good time.15. Premium currency. Only spend when you have disposable income. Closing notes ( I guess ?)Great fall back game to scratch the RPG itch for casual gamers. For more serious gamers out there where min maxing either makes you happy or go insane, do your due diligence and research about Elder Scrolls Online. Game is simple and very very complicated at the same time.Do I recommend this MMO?Yes, unless you are a toxic gamer who doesn't share and teach other players how to do the hard stuff like trials and veteran dungeons. Its an MMORPG. There are casual gamers who just want to have fun. If you want to play with the pros, be the pro and join the pros. Make sure you are their level or you will get treated like how you treat other 'casual' or 'noob' players."
Positive,- Exploration;     - Nice stories;     - Customization;     - Nice combat system;     - Housing;     - Nice community;     - Dungeons and trials;     - Nice PVP and PVE content;     - More exploration;     - Nice store system;     - Loreplay;     - Nice elfs.     - Nice animations;     - Good free contents;      - You.That was a clean review. Thanks and take care.
Positive,"The game may have been trash when it launched, but thanks to countless updates and complete combat reworking, ESO is one of the best MMOs on the market right now. Not to mention it is a ton of fun. The only drawback is doing quests in a group can be a bit tricky."
Positive,im a wow refugee and this filled that void perfectly
Positive,"If I hear ""can you believe it dragons in your own homeland"" one more time, I'm gonna microwave a pipebomb."
Positive,this game ruined my lifehad fun tho 👍🏿
Positive,"This game has improved leaps and bounds since the beta.   I played the beta originally, and was really not impressed...I've been playing Elder Scrolls games since the Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.  I've been a big fan of the series, but never got into MMO's...I saw that people seemed to think this had improved over the beta, so I decided to try it again.   LOVING IT!Although, I still don't really treat it like an MMO - I kind of just play it like it's a single player game, that just happens to have random other people running around all over the place."
Positive,"NPC in every other MMO: Go kill these 10 bandits and I'll give you some magical pants.Elder Scrolls Online: The NPC's children are distanced from their father. You walk a path through his memories, discovering how he lost his wife, and how he was pressured into servitude by a powerful man, unable to care for his traumatized kids. You feel tears welling up, and decide to abandon your own career of theft and murder in honor of this small drama-plagued family. To hell with loot and coins, if only you could empty all the soulshards in your bag to resurrect the dead.This game does not feel like an MMO, it's an Elder Scrolls game, one that happens to have some multiplayer aspects.You can sneak around a castle for an hour looking through crates, you can sit in a library reading books, you can run through swamps and temples just to enjoy the scenery. The whole game is overflowing with lore, with cats that randomly meow from bookshelves, with drunks sleeping in alleys, with old mages mixing herbs in darkened rooms.This damned game just has so much life to it."
Positive,"ESO is a fantastic MMO. The community is great, and the game is just stunning. I am an old WOW player from the vanilla days and I remember just going to hilltops or on top of buildings and being in aw of the graphics. I get that feeling again in ESO. Sometimes I just watch the sun set over the water while casting a line in the water. here are some bullet points of why i love ESO.- use any weapon you want. You want to be a greatsword wielding mage with light armor pants but a heavy helm? ok. sure. you want to craft EVERYTHING? ok. You can get all the crafting lines!-such a pretty game as I said above. A well put together world -quests are not boring like go and kill 20 murlocs. There is always a neat story of why you are doing things, and its never just go kill mobs of X monsters. I spent a while last night just pickpocketing people and running from the law to get into the thieves guild. then I killed some people for the assassins' guild. want to just read books? go to a bookshelf and open one up! -LORE. lots of lovely LORE- mostly free. People that complain about expansions costing money don't know how the world works. You can play this game (besides the actual game cost) for free. there is no real need for paying the month script fees unless you want to get cosmetic items for your or your house. BUT that being said, its a great deal if you want to get levels faster, and you get some crowns thrown in for that sweet sweet flaming dog mount. But, you get a free horse that goes just as fast, so again, you don't have to spend money. - you can solo. I am a solo player mostly. I am old and not good at video games, but that's ok. Its not a hard game to play, and most content is solo-able. I will eventually try to join a guild, but I am a filthy casual. dungeon finders work well and I never think I am missing something. - adding that I love going from Keyboard and mouse to controller any time I want. I find myself using both depending on what I am doing and how relaxed of a play I want it to be. This game really is the Burger King of Games. Have it your way. Play whatever way you want."
Positive,"(Review After 1000 Hours):I'm honestly in love with this game. I've been running end game vet trials and the experience has been out of this world so far! (Review After 550 Hours):This game is still amazing!(Review After 170 Hours):I’m going to keep this short and sweet. ESO is a huge game so not all the pros can be covered in this review but here’s my experience. Played this game back in 2014 on the Xbox and I can tell you the Dev’s have did a complete 360 on this game.  PROS: First let me start off this review by saying this eso has one of the best mmo community's out there. Players are very friendly and quick to help you out when you talk in zone chat. I’ve played a lot of mmos and none of them come close to eso’s community.  Eso has good graphics for a game that came out in 2014 & the gameplay is spot on. If your worried about jumping in this game and your worried about being stuck in the beginner zones no worries. In eso zones aren't level locked, because of this the monsters will always scale to your level so your free to explore the open world! Other than some annoying bugs, this is the only mmo I've played that didn’t have anything game breaking that turned me off. Coming from BDO that means a lot! Endless amount of content including, quests, dungeons, pvp, trails, exploration, and etc.  CONS: Dungeons can be very broken or buggy. Often, I find myself glitched in a rock or some sort of post since a boss threw me like a rag doll. I have experienced a Dungeon boss so glitched he didn’t spawn and we had to redo the whole Dungeon.  Quest can sometimes glitch, sometimes the person you turn in a quest to is ether not there or you can't interact with them. This has only happened to me twice though. Pvp can be so buggy at times its unplayable. This problem happens sometimes where you're in pvp then you get hit with a 1 second loading screen. 1 second isn't along time of course but in pvp you character will stop moving for a split second and then you get wrecked by other players. When this happens, your best option is to not play pvp for a while because the loading screen is persistent.  My thoughts on the crown store aka the micro transaction store:  Now I understand mmos have to make money since there always adding content and working on the game as a whole. Employees need to get paid and profit needs to be made! I have no problem with the in-game store and it's not pay to win. Mostly everything is cosmetic and you can buy some digital houses from there but you can also get houses with in game gold, it's just a grind. Another great thing is if you don’t have money for things in the crown store you can always buy it off a player with in-game gold. One thing I will say, they do make the crown store tempting but it’s a business at the end of the day.  Hope you enjoyed the review; I don’t usually review games but I had to for this gem. <3"
Positive,"What started out as a review turned into a life story.....Once upon a time...I was planning on buying The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) base game from an online digital marketplace, then maybe pick up the Morrowind chapter later on ""if"" I could get into it. To my surprise when I went to check it out on Steam it was £9.99 ""WITH"" the Morrowind chapter included in the overall price. A nice little surprise. If you do decide to purchase this game I recommend creating an account on:""account.elderscrollsonline.com"" first, which you will have to do anyway in order to play the game as it's run through a 3rd party but it's easy enough. Just be aware though the “userid” you choose on the 3rd party site will be the “userid” displayed while you’re in game. After I finished downloading the game through Steam I did have a slight issue with the installation... I noticed a few other people who have written a review for this game have also had the same hiccup but it is easily sorted out by ""repairing"" when prompted. Also, another thing to point out, you can play ESO with a controller (I am currently using a wired XBOX controller) if you fancy sitting back and relaxing, while you play on your big T.V then I’d strongly recommend not using KB/M. Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as the conventional “plug and play” you do have to enable it in settings-gameplay. Also, like Skyrim you can toggle from first to 3rd person with the touch of a button.Now on to the best part... The game is truly TRULY beautiful, the colours are vibrant, stand out and feel genuinely warm. The Elder Scrolls Online really does a fantastic job making sure you feel completely immersed in the environment. For me, this is a huge plus! Personally when I am playing a game like this I want to feel like I’m no longer sitting on my sofa, in front of the T.V, I want to feel like I’m actually running around Tamriel, taking in the sights and sounds. This is what I mean when I stipulated I feel “completely immersed” and ESO does a hell of a job creating that escape into that magical fantasy world. As crazy as this sounds, one of my favourite things about not only this but every game or movie I play or watch is its soundtrack and wow!! The Elder Scrolls Online is on the money again!! In my humble opinion a great soundtrack can make or break a game. Just look at “The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt” as an example, an amazing soundtrack = amazing game… “ELEX” shit soundtrack= shit game LOL (I know these are just my opinions but you get my point lol). ESO’s soundtrack is really something special... I looked into The Elder Scrolls Online soundtrack and they created it over a few YEARS and honestly it truly is a masterpiece. Amazon’s review has it 4.5/5 stars. It gives you this warm sense of nostalgia as it contains music from Skyrim.I was racking my brain thinking what game The Elder Scrolls Online reminded me of… I know I'm kinda showing my age a little here but it's a lot like ""Fable 3 crossed with Dragon Age: Inquisition"" with some of the grand designs of some of the buildings and the atmosphere but again this is subjective as it purely my opinion. The NPC's really blend in well with the environment and are able to create a truly unique atmosphere. Also, NPC's involved in the quests you partake in look amazing when you’re speaking to them. The body language feels genuine and the words are actually synced with the movement of NPC’s lips plus no crazy facial expressions like “Mass Effect Andromeda” LOL. DIFFERENT RACES, FACTIONS & CLASSESAnother aspect I absolutely LOVE about this game is the “freedom of choice” and the “character customisation”. It is head and shoulders above most MMORPG’s on the market today. As far as I’m aware you are able to choose between TEN different races with THREE different factions that looks like this:  “Ebonheart” Pact Faction RacesArgonian (Reptilian),  Dunmer (Dark Elves),  Nord (Human)“Aldmeri” Dominion Faction RacesAltmer (High Elves),  Bosmer (Wood Elves),  Khajiit (Feline)“Daggerfall” Covenant Faction RacesBreton (Human),  Orc (Also known as Corrupted Elves),  Redguard (Human)Imperials (Human)  I think you have to purchase the “Imperial Edition of the game” to get access to this class and I think Imperials are able to join “any” faction.CLASSESDragon KnightNightblade TemplarSorcererhttp://uk.ign.com/wikis/elder-scrolls-onlineIf any of you guys want more information on Elder Scrolls Online this site has “EVERYTHING” you would ever want to know LOL NOTE I was checking out benchmarks on YouTube so I would have a rough idea what kind of FPS I could expect when I ran into something I think 99.9% of novice, semi and pro gamers would be interested in. Check out on YouTube. The difference between choosing the minimum settings in comparison to the maximum is “Night and Day” TRULY! The textures, terrain, rendering ect are all obviously superior on the highest setting. I personally did the test myself using the R9 390X and can attest & confirm the evidence of the results. As most are aware it obviously depends heavily on what GPU you’re running ESO on but “if” you’re GPU allows you to run ESO on the highest settings I strongly recommend you do as you won’t be disappointed. Also, if you fancy pushing your hardware that little bit further and tweaking your graphical settings to improve your average FPS check this out on google, it’s pretty cool. This is, however, for advanced P.C enthusiasts not novices (No offence intended).https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/368986/mega-thread-eso-performance-tweaks-fps-improvements-stutter-free-graphics-tweakingAs I stipulated above I'm running ESO on my R9 390X and FX 8350 OC’ed @ 4.5GHz it truly looks AMAZING. It hardly puts any stress on my GPU at all which in my opinion is particularly impressive as my CPU is ancient (6+ years old) is more than likely bottlenecking my GPU. There is no stuttering, lag, tearing ect and my GPU temps are well within the respectable limits.Honestly, I am struggling to find anything negative about this game... Obviously I am aware that there was a fair amount of problems when the game was initially released back in 2014 but given the amount of time from then to now I think it’s fair to say the patches and updates have done their intended job. One thing I will mention is this game can get REALLY expensive if you let it... True, it’s not a ""Pay to Win"" kinda game in the conventional sense but you do get the feeling with how slowly you acquire gold that it would most definitely be easier to just buy crowns (in-game currency) but that's something you have to search your own soul in deciding if it's worth it.In my opinion the game is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing and what's more the customisation of your character is also another huge plus. Overall Score:9.6/10 – Amazing!!One final comment I wish to end with and for me was kind of a make or break, potential deal-breaker was the ESO community… This community, for me is without a doubt the best community I have played online with to date. If you need help and ask 9/10 you get it. An example, I went into a dwarven mine while I was lvl 2 or 3 and kept dying so I asked someone who I had never spoken to before, who was on his/her way out if they could help me. We went back through everywhere they had been before, with me.. So I was able to complete that quest. Proper top draw community!!...The End."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online isn't your typical Elder Scrolls game, if you're coming into this expecting another Skyrim then you're coming into this for the wrong reason. This game isn't a Single Player RPG, but it's not Quite an MMO either. Zenimax Online Studios and Bethesda have created a game that's it's own. This game's combined the much loved Bethesda RPG Formula and your standard MMO to create a hybid that accomplishes what it's set out to do.The Elder Scrolls Online or ""ESO"" takes place all over Tamriel, the large continant that the entire Elder Scrolls Series takes place. ESO will take you places in Tamriel that you've always wanted to go, including revisiting places you've already been. For the Morrowind fans you can revist your harsh ashlands, and for the Oblivion fans Cyrodill is yours to explore (granted you can survive the bloody PVP battles.) If you've just played Skyrim that's fine too, parts of Skyrim are explorable, this includes major holds Riften and Windhelm. Dispite being set two eras before Skyrim our races are still here. However they all stand divided into three factions. Depending on your choice of Faction differant races will be playable and by extension entirely differant parts of the world. For the fans of the world of The Elder Scrolls this game allows you to see it all, you can visit the Orcish tribes in Highrock, the magical island of Auridon, dry deserts by the border of Elsweyr, and so many more environments. For those who love the story and lore of the Series this game has HEAPS. Based before the rise of Tiber Septim there is so much story for you! Each Alliance has it's own seperate stories and questlines each one adding to the series lore. Dispite some claims, yes this game is Canon and it does make sense (trust me). There's so much to say about this game! I haven't talked about the amazing PVP and PVE, the abilties! Or even the fantastic DLCs that are done perfectly! Zenimax Online Studios has had this game developing alongside Skyrim back pre-2011, and so much love has been put into this game, and it just get's better and better every update. This immersive game has a great story, with every NPC in the game voice acted too! The world design is breathtaking and the amount of fun you can have is multiplied when playing with friends. That doesn't mean you can't play solo though, as this game understands that solo players are prominant especially in a series like this. A variety of Solo dungeons and a main story that's almost entirely Single Player exist too! ESO knows just what to do to help you have a fun and immersive experience that's got so much nostalia without alienating new fans.Bethesda better have their Soul Gems because if you come into ESO with an open mind you'll be pleasently surprised. This game is fun from the start and gets better and better as you level up. I recommend this game 100%"
Positive,"TLDR: Wonderful game if you like action combat. Not a tab target game.This is easily the best MMO I've played in a long time. I was surprised (though probably shouldn't have been) to see a lot of the best features of MMO's from the past incorporated into the game itself. Notably, every class can perform every role, though some may be better suited one direction or another. I also especially like the support for the gamepad, as playing an action combat game with mouse and keyboard is difficult with arthritic hands.This is also very clearly an Elder Scrolls game. You can loot just about everything (though sometimes it's stealing). There are crafting materials all over the landscape. There's a vampire and a werewolf path. You get a lot of skillpoints in things like weapons, guilds, armors, etc that have nothing to do with your base class and anyone can use them, so the mix-and-match options are very broad, and unless you're following a guide, your build might not look like anyone else's, but works for you.The subscription is -optional- despite what some of the negative reviews are saying, though they are correct about crafting materials and storage space. Here's the thing though. A single character (with some in-game gold [140] and about a month of real time [+60]) can end up with 200 inventory slots. The account-shared bank can go up to 260 (I might be off by 10 or so). I have exactly one character that holds all of my crafting materials except alchemy and provisioning, which have a ridiculous number of ingredients, however those sit in my bank just fine with room for transfers between characters. That character is also holding a pile of research items, and when those are gone, will be able to hold one, if not both of the two. Mules might be a tiny time sink relative to just having the crafting bag, but it's not nearly as bad as I'm seeing some people complain about IMO. I'm used to it from the old days though. One of the first things I did was create a main, a crafter, and 3 mules, got them started on their mount capacity (the +60 that takes realtime), and I'm only using one of them at all, for treasure and survey maps. I still have blank character spaces for alts.Anyone with a playtime under 50 hours, hasn't even dipped a toe in the game, and even 1000 hours is just the beginning (I'm just short of 1k at the moment). Before you buy any DLC or XPack the basic game is HUGE and there's stuff to do everywhere. Each zone has it's own story, plus plenty of side missions, and there are well over 10, might even be 20ish different zones depending on whether you get the absolute minimum, or the latest Xpack and backlog of Xpack content that comes with it (definitely the better deal instead of trying to buy them individually). Even getting to ""level 50"" which is the current cap for gaining new skillpoints and unlocking levelling rewards is just the beginning, because you start earning (account wide, usable by any character in their personal tree) Champion points that get put into constellations for even more character growth and customization. As long as you keep playing on a 50, you keep earning champ points. As long as you keep finding skyshards and doing quests, you'll keep gaining skillpoints. I imagine there's eventually a cap or you've found all of the skyshards and done all of the quests that reward skillpoints, but that's going to take a long, long, long time.In addition, they're actively releasing more content, with the Necrom Xpac being the latest at the time of this review. Again, I want to repeat, each zone is a complete, fully voiced experience with it's own story, skyshards, dungeons, gear, and possibly companions and/or a Tribute deck. The zone DLC's are worth the price they charge IMO. Whether the single dungeon DLCs are worthwhile is a little more iffy and will appeal to different people for different reasons. I imagine I'll probably just buy the one(s) with set items I want.As for the rest of the crown store, a -lot- of it is pure cosmetics and the few things they sell that would help a character aren't things that break the game. It's stuff like XP scrolls and research time reductions... things that will speed up a character's progress for sure, but it's still the same progress path, one just costs money, and the other costs time. Microtransactions are the standard for the genre at this point, and I think it's a reasonable way to earn from people with more money than time, while allowing others to play after buying once. Keep in mind that under the subscription model, you didn't get to play -at all- without paying monthly.There's also a bunch of stuff you can do that has nothing to do with zone stories at all. There's a pretty neat card game that comes with High Isle, with an exploration aspect to get new decks and upgrade cards. with Greymoor, you can treasure hunt (Scry/Excavate). Exploring is almost always rewarded. Every time I think ""there's no way they've put something out here"" I run into a chest, or a bunch of high level crafting nodes, a location discovery, or a skyshard (3 gives you a skillpoint), or any number of other interesting things. In the latest few Xpacs are companions to find and get to know. There are zone bosses, Dwemers (incursion events), Delves (micro-dungeons, possibly soloable), and of course the usual dungeons and trials and gear acquisition that every MMO has. For the people complaining about long queue times. This is a team game. Be a team player and run a tank or support/healer. Not everyone can DPS. You have a long queue time because you're standing in a long line of people that don't understand that.There are also both battleground, and long term tactical PVP (there's a zone active 24/7 with objectives to capture and hold in order to attempt to conquer the zone for one of the 3 primary alliances). I'm not much of a PVP person at all, but even I've had a bit of fun in a battleground or two."

Positive,"Played the cat race known as Khajiit, then proceeded to become a Werewolf. I am a cat that transforms into a dog. 10/10 Catdog was a good show -IGN"
Positive,It cures my depression for a little while and feeds my addiction to thieving. Then I see the crown store that a banking cat costs 38 bucks and my depression comes back.
Positive,Im an adult who still struggling with life living in a rented place. In this game im still renting a place in an inn. immersive 1000/100
Positive,I play too much.
Positive,"Stoped playing World of Warcraft to get away from mmos for a whille . . .Started ESO since i was bored and other releases are overpriced ea titles . . . Much better community than wow at least , much more solo friendly since most of my friends play fps mostly .If you are unsure about it just give it a try over free weekends and check it for yourself instead reading about it since we all have our own opinions and likes ."
Positive,"I mostly play this game solo, and in 352 hours of gameplay I haven't touched the PVP aspect. There's a ton of content in this game, if rather repetitive and samey, it's rewarding and a great way to turn your brain off after a day of work or study.While the writing is not top-notch, it is serviceable in the sense that you can feel immersed in the world by following the events and learning more about the lore. I'd say, though, it is weird that every other questgiver is like, ""you're the one I was looking for"" like you're the chosen one in a world where everyone else is also the chosen one.I return to this game every few months, there are usually new DLCs to check out, but mostly, I play it until I get bored or find something else to do, then months later something makes me want to play it again. I like the fact you don't need to keep a subscription to play, this helps because the barrier to return is low as I don't have to pay, but then when I really get into the groove again I re-subscribe because that way I don't have to buy the DLCs directly, and I get expanded inventory and bank storage, plus I save the crowns to eventually buy the DLCs and rely less on the subscription.I've played many MMOs, but this one has the right mix of content that I relate to (Elder Scrolls lore), a simple yet rewarding enough game loop, and the freedom to play without paying. It makes me feel like I don't need to be committed to it at all times, which has often made me burn out from MMOs.Update: I should say that this MMO has the best controller support of any I've tried, in fact I'm better at it with a controller at this point, combat is just much more comfortable that way. I recently tried going back to Guild Wars 2, a great MMO, but I'm so used to just laying on the couch after a day of work and having a huge lap keyboard is just not as comfortable as holding a controller over the top of my head while I contort into inhuman positions to unwind for the day."
Positive,"Still wondering if you should try out ESO? Well it's a bit tough to sum-up but here goes:COOL+ The world is friggin' BEAUTIFUL and the locations are diverse. Can seem a bit small, but it's a fantastic experience to just explore Tamriel (and beyond) in HD glory with all it's weird flora and fauna. Especailly the fauna, boy do I love cool creatures to fight! + Iconic music returns and the atmosphere is good overal. Exploring is encouraged.+ Fully customizable outfits, armor and weapons. Rare mounts, pets and personalities.  A plethora of homes with countless furnishings. This game is a dream for people who like to be creative, I wish the main TES games had this much freedom!+ Though gripes of the lore exist and it's a bit watered-down, I'd say the ""TES Theme"" still feels intact. It doesn't take itself too seriously, the tone fits an MMO well. It's not like the main series, but ESO does have quite a bit of heart and soul.+ Social aspect is good. People in general are friendly, save for PvP-oriented folk where YMMV. Finding friends, groups, guilds and joining together in battle is all very easy to do. A level 10-player can join level 50-players and still help out. Playerbase seems to be growing again. Active online community that can help you with any questions you might have.+ Aquiring loot and changing your build might be less frustrating then most MMO's but I'm not the best judge of that. If you get an item that's not exactly what you want, you can alter it's traits or rarity by using in-game items, and shrines to change your build. There's an active marketing community so selling unwanted gear and buying specific pieces you want is easy.+ The main quest and the DLC-stories are all neat and interesting storylines. I loved Vvardenfell and Clockwork City. Most side-quests are quite shallow... though some really stand out for being unique, funny or even quite morbid.+ The strange inclusion of Add-on support means you can download ""mods"" that alter things like UI, controls and can even help with things like combat and the buying, selling and organising of equipment.+ It's not subscription-based. Aside from crazy-long download and install times, there is no loss in trying it out.NOT-SO-COOL- There are a lot of gripes lore-related, and this game is NOT roleplayer-friendly with the hundreds of heroes running around. Do NOT expect it to be a similar experience to the main series of games, working together is encouraged and often enforced so you can't really be the lone hero you might be used to being. You CAN do it, but it's rather tedious.- The leveling system and other RPG-aspects leaves a lot of people in want. Either for more complex builds or simply being able to have more abilities on a bar during combat. The latter I agree with, it makes combat rather boring if you don't mix things up yourself. This can be a dealbreaker since you obviously fight quite a lot in a Fantasy-RPG.- This counts double for PvP. The meta still changes often because things get nerfed/buffed back and forth. I'd say other MMO's are better at handling PvP and making combat interesting, and ESO is more suited for PvE. Cyrodiil  is alright but can get repetitive, and with 3-factions it's almost always 2-on-1 fighting, making it unbalanced. Nightblades suck out the fun of PvP like most assassin builds in MMO's with endless stuns and going invisible, ruining the meta.- Though the music is good, like most MMO's there isn't enough of it so it gets repetitive. I suggest playing some of your own tunes (or TES-game playlists)  while playing.- Crafter's Bag is an ESO+ only feature where EVERY item that has to do with crafting will be put into this endless bag of holding. This makes inventory management super-easy but for non-ESO+ people quite a nightmare. Discouraging crafting is a bad move, and feels too tedious for new players to even begin with.- Similar to before, the things you have to pay real money for (Crown Store) are often a bit questionable. 20 euro's for just another outfit slot or a single mount? Ridiculous. But I'm sure it sells well since they haven't made any signs of changing prices.- For some reason the majority of of the voice acting is top-notch while others.... are really, really bad. I'm looking at you random Dunmer lady #5 and random Argonian man #3. And that's basically it. Some gripes could be easily fixed (give non-ESO+ people a crafting bag that's rather small and has to be upgraded) while other's are an intrinstic part of the game (disappointing combat and lack of immersion) so it depends on how you weigh these aspects whether it's worth a try or not. The game isn't subscription based so couldn't hurt to try it out for a while and see if it grows on you. It did for me!Thank you for reading and if you have any questions you can always leave a comment.Cheers!"
Positive,"ESO is a nice game that lets you play at your own pace and luxury. It is varied enough to let you do various activities even at endgame, unlike some other MMOs.  If you like the Elder Scrolls universe, or a medieval fantasy kind of world, you will enjoy ESO.There are many locations that were included in the older games like Oblivion and Morrowind even some locations that are Skyrim-like. These regions and locations are nicely detailed. The graphics are very good for an MMO. I can spend my time just riding around the different locations, taking screenshots and enjoying the scenery. The amount of detail is amazing.   Audio and music in the game are great, with a few soundtracks from older games that add to the nostalgia.Gameplay wise, it is fluid and not too complicated. There are a ton of quests to undertake. If you like to immerse yourself in the lore, then these quests are nice to do, as you get more exposed to the Elder Scrolls lore.   It is mostly a pve game, but there is a region that is pvp. Faction vs faction which can be fun, as mini armies fight around the map, attack resources, castles, or defend castles in sieges.   It is simple yet interesting. Definitely a game I would recommend getting, especially if its on sale."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online Tamriel Unlimited is a beautiful MMORPG which is well worth the time and investment. After a somewhat underwhelming start, I have come to love playing this game (500+ hrs in and there's still so much left to do).Pros:+There is an epic and beautiful world to explore solo or with friends.+Game has strong character creation and progression.+Solid quest design with a multitude of quests to choose from.+Quite a few DLCs available to further expand the world and quests available.+Relatively simple crafting system available in game.+Wide range of armor sets, character customization items & crafting motifs available in the base game & through DLCs.Cons:-DLCs along with cosmetic items, mounts and pets can be quite costly even when on sale.-Multiplayer rarely feels like a crucial aspect of the game.-If you're lucky enough to get stuck in a pile of rocks, you have to pay gold to get unstuck >_<(sigh! srsly devs?).P.S.Ayrenn <3."
Positive,"Q. How does this compare to other Elder Scrolls Games, Morrowind, Skyrim, Oblivion etc.  The answer is rather simple, you can't compare it. So if you're looking to buy this game to further your Elder Scroll's experience. Pause for a moment. This isn't Elder Scrolls, it's a game made inside the Elder Scrolls universe.  Tamriel  Is as beautiful as ever, nostalgia is everywhere, from the unforgettable landscape of Morrowind, to the ice cold unforgivable landscape of Skyrim. Cyrodiil however, it is where living legends roam the countryside intending on making you their prey, where castles and keeps and being assaulted by marauding adventurers. Survive if you can or conquer if you wish to be crowned the Emperor. There really is a world for you to explore and lose yourself in. Q. Gameplay  To put it simply, It's an MMO (Massive multiplayer) meaning, you'll spend most of your time in ""Third Person"", but there is the option to enter ""First Person"". Which is better?, from experience Third. There's often so much going on inside a dungeon or when you're delving into the madness of the world that being able to see what's happening around you is the difference between life and a swift but somewhat temporary death. If you've played Morrowind you'll be accustomed to a very in-depth character creation, that is not quite the case in TESO (TheElderScrollsOnline). Character creation is not as in-depth, nor is it lackluster. Your weapon and armour essentially define you. Meaning the class you pick at the beginning, from which there are six are essentially the cherry on the cake.  Q. Do I need to equip my credit card!  Not quite!. Although you'll need to acquire the game to play!. Much has been said about the   Crown Store   The name given for the in-game market. This is a place to buy cosmetic mounts, cloths and in-game dlc!.   Crowns  depending on your financial situation can be expensive. Most of us were not born into riches. Some of the better gear in the game is locked behind DLC. This is a fact, but, if you're in the game for the long run, all is not lost!.Work hard at a profession in the game, or simply burgle you way till your purse can hold no more, then sell items in a trade market or Fence ;-) ( Trade market requires you to join a guild - More details below), then when you've amassed a small fortune, you'll be able to trade  gold coins  for  Crowns  with other players.  How trading crowns works If you're willing to part with Gold for Crowns, then ask in Zone(General Chat) for someone who is a regular and known seller(or buyer) of crown items, trade with the trusted. They need to  gift  the Crown items to you  then you need to  give  them the gold, hence why trust is necessary. Hopefully one day Zenimax will implement a way to ensure that when these items are traded, it's done without the worry of gifting your crowns without the gold coming your way. This means, yes, you can acquire the DLC's in the game without hurting your bank account. Thankfully there are fortunate people in the game who like to buy Crowns and trade them for gold. Q. Is there a universal auction house?. No. You'll need to join a guild, but there's no need to worry. Trade guilds are, well they are trade guilds!, so if you're somewhat anti-social for personal reasons please don't worry yourself. Some trade guilds do offer the chance to do dungeons together or run around and politely put hideous monsters back to sleep, then run off with their loot. Guilds can have up to 500 members and you can join five guilds in total! meaning if you join five active trade guilds, you can trade with many more people, buying low, selling high. Often people are so wrapped up in trading, the world of Tamriel weeps at the loss of their footsteps outside the city walls. Although some of us do not! More herbs for us to collect! (Oh, if you're a Morrowind baby, I'm sorry to tell you, you will not need an PHD in alchemy, sadly it's much more simple in TESO)  Subscription  To sub, or not to sub. hmmm, This really is a pain! I love the subscription due to the fact it helps with quality of life. I've decided to copy and paste from TESO's website the details, it's better you decide for yourself. Underneath I'm going to give some thoughts on a few of these things, to explain in a little more detail.  Non-ESO Plus™ Members  Need to Purchase DLC game packs, No crafting storage bonus, No free crowns, No extra bank space, no bonus gold & XP, No bonus to crafting, No costume dyeing, Transmutation Crystals - No bonus to currency cap, No exclusive deals.  ESO Plus™ Members  Full access to all DLC game packs, Unlimited storage for crafting materials, 1650 crowns per month, Double Bank space for your account, 10% increase to Gold & Experience acquisition, 10% increase to Crafting Inspiration & Trait Research rates, Double Furnishings & Collectables space in player housing, Costume Dyeing, Exclusive ability to dye costumes, Transmutation Crystals, Double currency cap for Transmutation Crystals, Exclusive access to unique Crown Store deals.So,  bank space  . Yes it's lovely, with sub, you go from 100 to 200. But you can buy more space in-game with Gold, so if you're not subbed, you can go from 100 to 150, you buy 10 spaces at a time - each becomes more expensive. In game, there is an  Outfit station  non-subbed can still use this! ""Outfits are completely different from Costumes. You can design your characters armour (outfit) appearance with the outfit station in any major city as well as some of the smaller towns (check your map!). At first you'll only be able to make gear relevant to your species. As you make characters from other races or buy ""Motif's"" from the trade guilds, you'll start to flesh out your collection. It takes time!Also you can open a window called ""Collections"" - Choose appearance - Head - Hide Helmet! wuhuuu. Costumes! These are items that go into your ""Collections"" - They are full outfits, head to toe. As a sub you can dye them, non-subbed, not so. Unless you get a free set of paints in game, sadly you'll not be able to dye them, but most people use the outfit station as it really is super cool!. I don't want to bore people, nor scare them away. I've tried to cover as much as I feel is relevant without making people feel like they're reading a book. This is an MMO! Yes, you're going to have to work for what you get, it won't chase you across Tamriel and throw itself into your backpack. All things take time, so not being subscribed just means it'll take longer.I've had issues with the game, I've contacted Zenimax and I've been blown away with their kindness. I've read negative comments regarding their customer service, but four times I've contacted them, four times they've put my mind at ease. It's hard to fault them, they've made a beautiful game and like all business's they're trying to make money to continue keeping the ElderScrolls alive and well. To buy or not to buy.It's Elder Scrolls. It's beautiful. It's all voice dialogue, but just as many lore books to be read, there's decisions to be made, caves to be delved in, pockets to be picked, guars to be admired, daedric princes to be rebuked. There's hair-tingling moments when you meet certain people from certain races that you thought had long perished, there's vampires and werewolves, battlegrounds for the brave. It's Elder Scrolls. You decide. Till then, thank you Zenimax for making over 1000 hours of my life very enjoyable. Thank you for putting a certain boat, on a certain river, with a certain Census and Excise Office, in a place I'll always think of as home. <3 Morrowind."
Positive,A good game for an old man.
Positive,I still haven't even started the main story quest.
Positive,"FOR NEW PLAYERS TO THE GAME: this review is for you, as it is my experience from being a completely new player with no idea what is going on.  Bullet points of review after intial intro, to keep things short and sweet for those looking to buy.After being a WoW veteran since beta and playing various other MMOs (FFXIV, SWTOR, EQ, EQ2, etc.), I wanted to test this game out after it had the initial terrible reviews and then the ravingly good reviews after the rework patches.  I also was playing a LOT of skyrim special edition and wanted to expand upon that universe.THIS GAME is decent.  For a new player it is immensely confusing, the world is not very linear to begin with and I really had no idea what I was doing when I made my initial character.  The tutorial and messages for new players as they play the game are lengthy, but not much time is given to read them.  Since the world is ""do whatever you want and play"", it sucks for new people since there, of course, is a best and worst of what you can do in certain situations.That being said, this game is NOT skyrim.  You can't get away with wearing leather armor as a caster, as it really provides no benefit.BULLETS:- Extremely confusing to start, as the game has SO MUCH depth- Alliance doesn't really matter (from what I can tell), but there are WAY more people on Aldmeri Dominion- The combat system is awesome, but takes some getting used to (active combat, blocking, interrupting, etc.)   ~MUCH better combat than other games where you just press the buttons to do the dmg- Racial aspects DO MATTER A LOT.  It will effect your end-game if you want to be an elitist- The only thing you can't ""reset"" is your class, so choose wisely at the start for class-specific abilities and passives- You are NOT LIMITED by your class, as weapons dictate abilities (i.e. resto staff = you can heal as any class)- Addons are slightly more annoying to use and there is a specific amount of memory given to them, which is a bad thing.- Crafting is rather interactive and much better than other games, however without an ESO PLUS membership it sucks.- ESO PLUS membership is almost NEEDED due to the crafting bag and general access.  ALMOST- CROWN STORE is NOT worth it AT ALL.  Items are WAY overpriced.  Excessively so.  Watch youtube for crown purchases   ~Crown crates are random loots and can contain stupid stuff such as potions and general worthlessness- FORUM accounts are SEPARATE from regular accounts, when you buy the game pay attention to an email for them- Armor shown at character creation doesn't matter, you can get a style motif in the game to make the other races' armor- You have two skill bars (one being gained at level 15) so you can swap between two weapons if you want- Side quests are sometimes hard to find, there are addons that can help you.- There are damage meters for this game (Addons)- I am still confused for a lot of the UI (isn't just social, guild, inventory, character tabs - much much more).- breaking items apart at crafting stations is often better than selling them, be sure to check the attributes of the itemAll that being said, I recommend this game on the FREE-TO-PLAY version, but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you watch youtube videos for beginners BEFORE purchasing.I DO NOT RECOMMEND the CROWN STORE, many things on there are already available to you and you can be literally throwing your money away.  IGNORE that entire aspect unless buying UPGRADES or DLC (like imperial race upgrade)Play around with character creation, class testing, crafting, and weapon interaction before seriously committing to anything.NOTE: If you get a sub, you get 1500 crowns per month you sub.  ESO plus of 3 months can provide you with the DLC and upgrades you may want and be cheaper/more beneficial than straight purchasing crowns."
Positive,"THE MOST CASUAL AND SOLO FRIENDLY MMO OUT THEREIs this Pay To Win? NoIs this Pay To Enjoy? NoIs this a Boring Grindfest? NoWhat is this game?This game is the most extensive single player Elder Scrolls RPG experience across the whole of Tamriel, that you can also play with friends, but without the grind and pay to win elements of the usual MMOs.Are you penalized for not subscribing?No, not exactly. Everyone is on par performance wise, you don't lose out in skills or gear, neither does a subber's mount move faster than yours. What's notable in the subscription is access to all available DLCs (excluding Summerset), and the crafting bag. Crafting bag is only invaluable if you are into crafting for storing materials which otherwise take up your inventory, and all DLCs can be individually bought outside of a subscription. What do you get for the entry price? (It's very often on sale for USD$10)ESO is a game that sets heavy emphasis on freedom of play as an RPG and sets as little limit on exploration and questing as possible. Players pick one of 3 alliances but are free to explore any parts of a zone since enemies are scaled or explore any alliance freely to pick up quests, not necessarily in any order though each zone will have a particular story quest line unfolding and 5 zones make up an alliance's story quest line. This is aside from your character's main story quest line which eventually unlocks another zone. Everything adds up to a massive amount of content for RPG players to enjoy, and that is just the base game. Like any good RPG, this game has a wide array of skill lines to progress, weapons, armor, class, race, guild and world skills. The freedom to learn abilities and passives across multiple skill lines in each of those categories allows players a lot of freedom in how to play their characters. Like previous Elder Scrolls games, you can even become a werewolf or vampire.Cut the Crap, I mean GrindCharacter progression goes hand in hand with the amount of content so you are constantly progressing as you play and don't have to actively grind. Reaching level cap of 50 unlocks a Champion's point leveling system. This system is account wide, so every character that hits 50 can access your Champion points without needing to grind all over again. This system even has a boosted experience gain daily which can accumulate for 14 days to assist progression for casual players. Unless you are the type who prefers to power level and repetitively grind dungeons to max out your character, my advice is to just do content. The character progression and content is so extensive that all you need is to play and you will eventually get there as you play through the game. Man Hours?You are looking at hundreds of hours just to complete everything in the base game, over 1000 hours if you play more than one character and intend to max out your champion points.What if I only pay for the Standard Edition?Undoubtedbly, there's the understanding of paid content expansion aside from the base game (standard edition already comes with the Morrowind expansion), and there are perks tied to a couple of these expansions in terms of crafting, but note that the game is designed that none of those are essential to playing and completing any content at all. Players can but need not be involved with trading or crafting to play the game.Gear wise, each zone offers 3 gear sets plus 3 more from each zone's dungeon and a couple of craftable sets, so options are plentiful. The advantages of better performing sets (some exclusively in DLCs) in the hands of a min-maxer can be significant, but really anything goes. Never in my 700hrs of play did I feel handicapped for having random gear and not BIS sets.Aside from content expansions, the other store items are purely services and cosmetics, costumes, mounts, player housing and consumable boosts. No pay to win items. Now some of these items are seasonal and comes in the form of loot crates. I have to mention the developers are big on rewarding players with some of these for free, through non-grindy events designed to be hard to not win them, or through the daily log-in bonus. I have not paid for anything other then zone content DLCs but have gotten plenty of cosmetics for free through questing, daily rewards and free loot crates.Bravo Maestro!MMOs often get away with mediocrity in the sound department and no voiced dialogues outside of cutscenes. The beautifully orchestrated signature musical scores of The Elder Scrolls series is subtly ever present in the background along with epic battle music and fully voiced dialogues for every NPC giving the game an immersion befitting of an Elder Scrolls game.Which edition should I buy?TESO Standard Edition - includes base game and Morrowind Chapter (Morrowind DLC + Warden Upgrade)TESO Summerset - includes base game and Summerset Chapter (without Morrowind DLC + Warden Upgrade)TESO Collection - includes the above as well as Thieve's Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Orsinium and Imperial City DLCsTESO Elsweyr - has multiple editions, one of which includes base game, Morrowind, Summerset and Elsweyr chapters.TESO Standard Edition has massive value when on sale for $10 considering the hundreds of hours of content, the reason also being there's no separate Morrowind upgrade on STEAM, and buying Morrowind + Warden separately on the Crown store costs 5000 crowns or $50.Never buy TESO Summerset, you don't get Morrowind + Warden class and it only costs a few dollars more for the TESO Collection during a sale. TESO Collection is currently the best value in early 2019 after getting a 30% permanent price reduction and when on sale for additional 40% off is ridiculously cheap at $29.99 and gives you the DLCs upfront permanently.TESO Elsweyr is the latest chapter and commands a high price, not recommended to buy it for the base game and Morrowind + Summerset to get started in TESO as the TESO Collection has more content and value when on sale.Final WordsESO has been reworked and feels like a whole different game since it's release, in a good way for players. This game combines the feel of an MMO such as 4 men dungeons, 12 men trials (raids) and taking on open world bosses with a grand scale RPG that can be played completely solo or with friends."
Positive,"Let's be realistic, your Skyrim install finally broke because of too many Serana waifu molagballin' mods and we're never gonna get TESVI so it's not like you have a choice."
Positive,"Ultimately, I recommend Elder Scrolls Online(ESO) due to its overwhelming amount of fun content, especially if you're mostly interested in PvE. If you're a ""completionist"" type of player then playing a bit of PVP with your PVE is still pretty great. If you're predominately a PVP player then my recommendation quickly turns into a toss up.All of the NPCs are animated w voiced dialogue and there are many well-written quests/stories, some are even heart-touching. When you're bored with quests, there are dozens of other neat elements of this game where you can spend your time. You could buy and decorate a house or you could creatively use those furnishings by building a house directly out of them. Crafting has been designed in a way that it is not only a useful but lucrative feature at every point of the game. Essentially, ESO is a successful MMO that has built so much content into the platform over the years that it is easy to feel overwhelmed with deciding what you want to do next.If you are only interested in PvP, a recommendation becomes more challenging. The best part of PVP is that sets, skills, and attributes are fluid enough that there is a lot of freedom in making builds. The fundamental elements and additional mechanics offer you a great diversity of combinations to play around with and make your own. I've had a lot of fun in Cyrodiil where the alliance vs alliance vs alliance pvp occurs....That said, ESO has consistently had terrible server-side performance during prime time and I assure you it is more than frustrating. Not only does this affect your enjoyment when your skill or potion doesn't actually go off, probably causing calamity, but this also occurs for everyone else... so you get to deal with frustrated people in general, too! The broken functionality surrounding server capacity is so consistent that it has become a mechanic that people not only try to utilize... some try to cause failure state to occur so that they can utilize it.To me, ESO feels like an ""asset"" that had a 5-year lifespan assigned to it by management and despite it's successful player population surge during 2020 they've stuck to that plan. I feel this way because ZOS's servers performed pretty well when PVP events were going on because ZOS set up more shards and servers. Without an event going on, it felt like servers were being taken offline in an effort to save on costs. I'd be shocked if the subject of server investment was ever publicly discussed by ZOS because the solutions they have offered/implemented were a severe compromise that have crippled some playstyles of the game. Group sizes were halved and you can no longer heal people outside your group. Even the randomness of probability-based effects(6% chance to cause x) were removed from every set in the game, with the intention to remove random-number-generator calculation costs(!!!). I mean... I salute their ingenuity but despite the changes, server performance remains bad enough to quit over. Some players are hoping that Microsoft's acquisition of ZOS will result in proper hosting such as a switch of platform... well, it's just as possible that the current strategy remains unchanged and this asset will continue to be neglected. It's also possible that cutting the server bills happened because lower costs makes you look like a juicier acquisition target? Yeah, at this point I'm just making educated guesses. If you're reading this, though... can you find someone to turn the servers back on? Then add to all of this that the scoring rules for the Cyrodiil campaign make success meaningless. Its meant to reward more money to people playing on a less-populated faction, which is good, however ESO also overcompensates the worst performing alliance with a huge score bonus. In a 1v1v1 month-long campaign this changes every social dynamic for the worse since it means that 1st place only needs to wreck their biggest rival... and so the weakest team often slides easily into 2nd place because they literally didn't log in so they received a 2x score bonus. The difference of rewards for 1st/2nd/3rd place aren't meaningful but these irrational rules for a competitive mode makes it all so... pointless.The fact that nearly everyone in Cyrodiil is frustrated by the terrible performance causes general toxicity. Since there isn't any tangible reason for winning the campaign(or fighting against mechanics for 2nd place), your ""allies"" in Cyrodiil are often the most toxic people in the game and they will relish the opportunity to take a scroll or hammer you conquered and run it straight into the enemy, giving it back to them.So clearly, unfortunately, recommending my favorite part of this game isn't possible. You can have tons of fun with PvP but you need patience or friends to suffer through it with. I've said enough on the game but with an MMO it's important to also review the community.ZOS managed a good community. There are many guilds filled with people trying to make the best out of the game, making schedules for their preferred content. You can use the guild finder to easily filter guilds based on content. And you can join/trial as many as you need, as long as you need up to 5 ;). There are community-written mods which we all rely on to make this an enjoyable game. The people who play ESO are usually really cool but we're also dealing with a game lore with race wars so obviously it's good you can report/block conventional trolls and racists.However the toxic elements of the community really stick out because you can't help when a glass cannon queues into your group as a fake tank(well, you can try to kick them but you're still left waiting for a tank.) You can't help it when someone charges through the entire dungeon in front of you, dragging all the mobs with them and skipping all the content. You can't do anything when your friend spent 15 minutes setting an ambush so they could steal an enemy hammer and massacre them... just so someone on your alliance could watch you like a hawk in order to grab the hammer when it eventually drops, so they can deliberately run it into a lava pit. You can't do anything if you attempt to buy crowns with gold and they defraud you(technically ZOS will repay you ONE TIME if you get scammed this way, their stated position is 'buyer beware')... never mind that this is a scam caused by ZOS's determination to never add crown trading to the trade window. These failings really stick out like a sore thumb."
Positive,"One of the better MMO's on the market right now. I will keep this simple, I won't waste your time as everyone has different tastes with MMO's and there is alot of debate on whether ESO is a good game or not within the MMO community. I will simply go over pro's/con's.The Good:- HUGE open-world to explore and lots of open-world content such as quests, delves (mini-dungeons), public dungeons, bosses, treasure chests, materials to farm, etc. -No Pay2win- Alot of customization, but I will explain this further, later in the review.- The combat is a bit mixed. Some classes/weapons are more fun and versatile than others, but this is entirely dependent on the player's preference. The only true problem with combat is the absolute necessity to weave your light-attacks in-between your skills. Alot of players don't like the idea of animation canceling being required for good damage in end-game content. With this in mind however, I find the combat fun regardless.- Making big money/gold isn't hard, it's just time consuming when you're a newbie. Don't worry about this too much until you're max level.- Leveling is fairly easy, if you're into that.- This game has enough lore to fill up 60,000 books worth.The Meh:- There is a lot of DLC. This game has been out for a long while, and the dev's monetize this game via DLC. The base game is big, but the collection of DLC's are bigger. More fun content is nice, but it can be expensive if you want all of it. Optionally you can buy a subscription for ESO+ which gives you access to ALL DLC in the game except the newest expansion at that current time.The Bad: -A lot of the customization is locked behind a paywall that is the Crown Store, and a lot of the motif (armor/weapon style) pages are locked behind RNG and/or pricey purchases with in-game gold. This becomes a lot easier to handle as you play longer.- The community is very helpful most times, but you're going to get some assholes who can ruin an experience such as trial (raid) leaders who disband a party of players because they are salty over something, thus wasting everyone's time. Zone chat can be silly-fun but again there is some weirdo's who can be off-putting. There is also PvP players and PvE try-hard's who can be nasty as well. This is just gaming community in general though. - The lack of tutorials are off-putting. Expect to have a lot of questions as you play.- You WILL need guide's to understand end-game content (veteran trials/dungeons). You can try to wing it, but expect a lot of failure unless you get carried by your party-members. - Half of your performance as a player will depend on your build, meaning your armor/weapon set and your class skills. If you just slap on anything you feel like and then attempt harder content, chances are you will fail. There must be some sort of value in what you build. Overall, I love this MMO despite it's flaws, I give it a solid 8/10 at the moment."
Positive,"You do NOT have to play this game as an MMO.  There is SO much content and 90% of it can be done solo, and is just as fun and just as immersive as games like Skyrim.This game is NOT Skyrim online, and never will be.  However, if you like the Elder Scrolls universe, you will LOVE the content."
Positive,"It is very simple if you like The Elder Scrolls games and lore you will also like this game, it is extremely rich in story and lore about the whole TES universe. This game is not hard and it is more focused on PVE side which make it enjoyable to play and no rush. You will experience the whole Tamriel and each country and race. Quests are very story rich and you can spend months to follow each main and side quests. However newer expansions are very poorly written and you can see that they just rushed to release it to take the money, i do not recommend them. Even if this game is mmo, most content you will experience is singleplayer which is okay for story because you need focus to follow everything and relax same like you are reading the book. Skills and combat are okay, not to hard, not to easy which make not to lose to much time in combat and not to speedrun to much. For someone like me that likes to take screenshoots and enjoy in cosmetics this game is also good at it. There is a lot of good places to enjoy the view and a lot of cosmetic items to unlock."
Positive,"Preface: I do not have thousands, or even hundreds, of hours in The Elder Scrolls Online. There are plenty of reviews from seasoned veterans. I wanted to write this review from the perspective of a new player, because if you're reading this, that's exactly what you'll be. MMORPGs can be a make or break for people within the first dozen or so hours, even less sometimes. I've been playing MMORPGs since 1996; I started with The Realm, advanced to Ultima Online, and I've played World of Warcraft (WoW) for the last 11 years.If we're going to compare The Elder Scrolls Online to any popular MMORPG of this era, it's most comparable to WoW in almost every single way. That said, it's a very vanilla WoW, hearkening back to the days of old, perhaps only as advanced as The Burning Crusade was (WoW's first expansion); not the new age, cookie cutter, infantile garbage it has turned into. The user interface (UI) is severely lacking, and learning even the basics of the game is incredibly daunting; I found myself struggling hard, especially with the map system, for the first few days that I played. Without add-ons, there's not even a mini-map on the UI, nor is there an experience bar. Be prepared to download a lot of add-ons if you plan on playing this title.The world of Tamriel itself is ridiculously massive, with tons of exploration opportunities, achievements to unlock, caves to explore, dungeons to pilfer, waypoints (fast travel) to unlock, cities to visit, and an overwhelming amount of quests to complete. Regardless of whether or not you're into Elder Scrolls lore, this entire release is a prequel; so that will interest lore fanatics, and also lead in newcomers to the series. The graphics are excellent, a bit better perhaps than Final Fantasy XIV, and the entire world is beautifully detailed. If you're looking for a game to get lost in with immersion, this is the one. It also helps that every single quest is voice-acted, so there's a very minimal amount of reading for those that skip by reading quests if there's too much text involved. It should also be noted that players in this game are friendly, and are usually willing to help newcomers. Dungeon queues are exhaustingly long at times, but I found that requeueing sometimes gets an instant pop, making me wonder if the netcode or matching is bad. You can join up to 5 guilds at one time, and all of your characters will be put into each guild that you join; so you don't have to go out of your way to keep getting invited when you roll alts.Crowns and the Crown Store are quite possibly the biggest downfall to The Elder Scrolls Online. Now, buying in-game items with real life money is a choice left up to each individual. You can buy mounts, pets, homes, furnishings, and a whole slew of other things, even items that help you level and so on. The thing is, everything is absurdly overpriced. The crown to dollar ratio is roughly 100 Crowns per dollar (at least in CAD), so let's say 1,000 Crowns is $10; doesn't sound like a lot at first, but consider that mounts range from 1,200 ($12) - 3,000 ($30) Crowns, and the nicer homes can go up to a whopping 13,000 Crowns ($130). Suffice it to say, unless your pockets run deep, you will need to give up the idea of attaining all in-game collectibles. Many of the Crown Store offers are also a pressured ""Limited Event"", which makes collectors succumb to non-refundable impulse buys, and none of these items can be unlocked by simply playing the game.Though beyond the aforestated, many of the in-game mechanics are obviously handicapped to play in favor of making you want to spend your hard earned money in the Crown Store. For instance, mount stamina/speed/capacity; you can pay in-game gold to upgrade one of these three attributes every 20 hours, which will literally take 60 days PER STAT, PER CHARACTER, or you can buy them from the Crown Store in bulks of 10. If you want an XP boost, you have to buy XP scrolls from the Crown Store. If you want your own personal merchant to call upon while out in the wild, it's a whopping $50. Want to be a Werewolf or Vampire? If you can't find someone to bite you, it's $15. The list just goes on and on, and quite honestly it brings the entire experience down. Paying for DLC is cool, mounts yeah okay to a certain point, but when companies start purposefully handicapping in-game content to pressure players to buy upgrades with real money, that's scummy.While The Elder Scrolls Online is a decently fun MMORPG, something about it lacks the addictive nature of other games of the same genre. The release is going into its second expansion, Summerset, and the level cap is still 50 (since launch), the Warden class came with Morrowind, but no new races have come about; save for the Imperial race, which has to be bought in the Crown Store for $10. That said, it's also a very large game, even just the base title can keep players entertained for thousands of hours through hundreds upon hundreds of quests, dungeons, raids, and world bosses. If you want to get the best experience that you can a monthly subscription will be needed, but it's not required. A monthly sub unlocks all of the DLC, rather than having to pay for it individually with Crowns, you get 1,500 Crowns per month, and a few other things including a separate, infinite resource holding bag for crafting. If you can look past the greed of the Crown Store, the lack of addictive gameplay, and the extremely vanilla properties of The Elder Scrolls Online, you may just have fun. It's refreshing to see an MMORPG without cookie cutter builds, and no catering to the masses to provide playability for everyone. It takes time to learn and get used to, right down to the most basic functions. More importantly, the questing is fun, and the world is massive. Prepare for a lot of clicking, though, at least until you get to a high enough level to use only your skills.The Horror Network Curator | Group Click for Gore"
Positive,"Works flawlessly on Linux.Switched to it from WoW. More immersive, better single player content and more dynamic combat."
Positive,A girl asks me to talk to her dead boyfriend ghostThe ghost boyfriend tells me that he never loved herI tell her the truth and she runs awayA few minutes later I found her ghost crying.
Positive,The only MMO in the world where the female characters in-game are actually played by females. 10/10 i'm married now
Positive,"I don't know how I've never reviewed The Elder Scrolls Online before, probably because I'm always just playing it instead! It's not perfect, but it's a really fun MMORPG and a good Elder Scrolls game. There is new content 4x a year and an active community in PVE and PVP both. Crafting, housing, the economy, questing, theorycrafting, trials (raids) and dungeons are all engaging and high-quality. I have 18 max level characters (on my primary account) and my ""main"" has over 200 *DAYS* of playtime. It's probably the single game I've gotten the most value out of ever."
Positive,"It took me about 100 hours of playing ESO on Steam and on Stadia mobile before it ""clicked"". I kept thinking ""I wan't to like this game so bad! Take me away!""... and it didn't feel like it was. My partner has over 3000+ hours sunk into ESO and I wanted to have that same connection with a game. I am a Destiny convert, and have now learned how easy it is to fall into the trap of holding a game's identity up to another game out of assumption that it will give you the same reward, or lack thereof. Many attempts at a character, making it to like level 20 and then stopping, starting a new one. Never finishing a quest chapter or DLC. Then suddenly one day I realized I am 100+ hours deep in this game, and I play it at least a little bit every day. It finally hit me that I am actually playing the game exactly how it was intended to be played. MY WAY! Once I realized that I had been trying to force this game into something it's not, the game world totally opened up and invited me in. To make a long story short. Free your mind before you start this, and let it take you away once you're there. Let your curiosity drive your story, and this game will reward you beyond the likes of any other on the market right now. It might click for you right away, or in 100 hours like me. Just don't try to seek-out the point of the game, because you kind of create the ""point"" of it. I'm glad I stuck with it. I think I'm in this for the long haul now. <3"
Positive,"Cons:- Differs from other TES titles in that you only occasionally change the world and NPCs rarely if ever stay dead (but there's a possible lore reason for it and it's an MMO so what do you do)- The zones feel small compared to other TES games- Unless you pay monthly for ESO plus, your inventory might feel cramped, especially just starting out before being able to afford inventory expansions- I find the direct PVP to be inaccessible to new players at this point- Has a ""meta"" that's hard to ignore (which the developers are trying to correct)- Takes up like 70 gigs of drive space (I got an external drive)- Has an in-game cash shop with not-so-mircro transactions and some RNG based lootPros:+ Excellent and aesthetically pleasing character customization (if you aren't for some reason determined to make a hideous character like in Oblivion)+ Classes, races, skill lines, and the freedom to distribute a limited (but still generous) amount of skill points encourages diversity between players+ Being able to explore never before seen areas of Tamriel (extra con: - Only slivers of Elsweyr, insert sad cat emoji here)+ Kate Beckinsale, Bill Nighy, John Cleese, other actors I don't remember but there's the guy who played Dumbledore (the one who's still alive, Something Gambon), the one for Twilight Sparkle (if you're into that, but she's good however you slice it), THE THERAPIST FROM UNTIL DAWN, AND also, PRESIDENT JOHN HENRY EDEN AS MOLAG BAL WHAAAAAAT, and of course the OG Wonder Woman as Azura, as per usual+ Even though the maps are small they are jam packed with quests and happenings (which might be what makes them feel small, there's hardly any wasted space)+ The paid cash shop content is either merely cosmetic, or is DLC that is absolutely worth the price for the extra work and polish put into it+ SO. MUCH. LORE.+ The PVP in Cyrodiil is pretty good if you're not skirmishing, just use siege machines and run away from peopleSome notes for those curious:Elder Scrolls Online takes place millenia before the events of TESV: Skyrim, so don't expect to see any dragons (because they're not back yet). Similarly, please realize that the Aldmeri Dominion alliance isn't any more evil than the other alliances you can choose from. They're not high elven supremacists in this game (source: Queen Ayrenn literally condemns high elven supremacy in one of her dialogues). You're the prejudiced one for thinking so. :)Extra words from me:I'll be honest, when ESO first came out, all it took were a few screenshots and some bad early reviews to get me to stick to the single player games. I figured it would come and go like The Matrix Online, but, like that One guy, it persisted. I probably wouldn't have liked it at launch, but when it had a free weekend at the beginning of summer this year and I was burnt out from a tough semester of pretending to like ancient philosophy, I tried it out. I ended up buying Gold edition for myself and my wife (I've always been partial to the Thieves' Guild and Dark Brotherhood), and we played it together (which I highly recommend, playing a TES game with a friend is amazing). I'm not sure how many things they've changed since launch, but it's caught me.This game's got quests and sidequests with engrossing stories and memorable characters, beautiful landscapes and cities with music to match, and not everything looks the freaking same like in Skyrim. You can fight bears, run dungeons, drink mead with the Nords; not once will you ever be bored. There's crafting, cooking, enchanting, alchemy, stealing, killing, adventures, achievements, everything.And listen, because I know some people care about this, the game doesn't try to tell you anything about your character except that Mannimarco killed you and trapped your soul in Coldharbour. People consider that an Elder Scrolls staple, and it's in this game, so you're welcome. There are even user-created add-ons to enhance the experience, though they aren't quite as wild as the mods for the single player games can get (as far as I know, I haven't gone down that rabbit hole and don't care to because ignorance is bliss).So, especially if you like the Elder Scrolls games, I highly recommend ignoring all the sorely uninformed negative reviews and buying this game. If you have always wanted to explore Tamriel, not just confined to Skyrim, or Vvardenfell, or Cyrodiil, you should absolutely get this game. If you need that sweet succulent lore, you need this game. If you have friends that also like Elder Scrolls and you wish you could play together, you should all get this game.Whatever your choice, I wish upon you Bright Moons, walker!"
Positive,"There's a heavy emphasis on being a subscriber (gated content, boosted exp, monthly allowance, etc.), but for $8 I got about 430 hours of content (explored every available area, completed all quests, and finished all activities) through one character."
Positive,"This review is strictly from 6.1.4. It's when I put up my armour and moved on from the masterpiece that the game is. The game may have changed - for the better likely.I must recommend this game. It's just too damn good. I spent most of the lockdown grinding it. Now, before you turn around and say, ""I've tried it before, the combat/game-play doesn't feel as fun. Well, there's a simple solution to that. Invest some money in the game, purchase the necromancer class, play them as a ranged Magicka class and enjoy every minute of every hour whilst playing the game.The game is as cool as it sounded; you can level any route (obviously, some are better than others). Becoming a vampire or a werewolf is quite simple, so if that's your thing, ask in a guild or a town, and people will do it for free. You get so many skill points at this point that you shouldn't worry about not having enough. You will because with every area come to these things called sky-shards, 3 of these, reward you one skill point and within the whole game I think a total is close to around 300 sky-shards. Meaning 100 bonus on top of what you get from quest-lines/story-lines. There will be a point where you just get bored and spend them on useless crap.Stories in this game are fantastic; they are in an Elders Scrolls-y fashion for sure. Many mythological characters we only hear in the main 5 games are actual talkable characters in this. There are your side quest-lines, dark brotherhood, or thieves guild or whatnot are all full of fun and lore. Some require doing stupid side quests to level your standing/level with the specific guild, but all of the quests flesh out to add to your surroundings and feeling of this natural world.Guilds in the game are what guilds should be in all games. Non-commit. Obviously, if you're in a raiding guild, you'll be expected to show for events, or a trading guild will require a min selling amount every week. To explain it better, you have the availability to join multiple guilds. I used to stick to a casual guild that ran gear runs (some key sets drop in raid level dungeons and people are usually ass at their role and need these runs to get a better feel for the class). These casual guilds are more than often very lovely and very easy going; I haven't had a lousy guild experience, well, maybe that one odd person, but they get usually kicked out quick. The other side of the game is trading. For trading, each town/settlement has 1-7 traders. These are all owned by a guild. Guild leaders can bid for a trader based on how much income they get from taxing players for using their traders. You can only sell at your guild's trader.Obviously, due to this, there is a finite amount of traders, so underdeveloped guilds might have a trader once a month in a random spot that's not very populated. But giant top-level trading/raiding guilds will have constant traders in capitals and bustling areas. So obviously, you won't make the amount you need to cover your trading tax and can then put in a fee to the guild that covers you for that week, usually ranging from 10k-500k, depending on the traders' location. To bridge the gap of some traders having better spots than others, a MAJESTIC tool called Tamriel Trade Centre was birthed. Now, it's a simple tool you download, install, and whenever you launch the game, it syncs the prices of how much everything in the world is currently worth, so a potion might one day be worth 50 gold per bottle but go up in price if its new or not many people are crafting it making it surge to 100 gold per bottle allowing you to know what the general selling amount it should go for. TTC also enables you to search for particular crafted/farmed gear. If you need something asap and for cheap, head to the site, select your platform/region and look up the gear or mats, and you'll be able to find the items you need. Make sure you launch the app every time you run ESO, though otherwise, the tool will give you out of date prices, nor will it update the website with the items you have listed.PvP in the game is something different. It reminds me of GW2, where you have a large war campaign and need to capture elder scrolls/keeps/outposts to gain area. It's a way that you can level from scratch, so if PvE is not for you, go to the campaign map once you hit 10 (or maybe it was 15) and level that way. When I was leaving, they were introducing global cool-downs to AOE effects as the servers would be under heavy load and cause substantial lag issues. But I cannot recommend the fun you have with PvP (I'm not personally generally into PvP in MMO's); it's on another level. I remember playing as a healer, meeting some of the top players in our Alliance and becoming one of the ""casuals"". Just remember to ask to join a party; if someone is advertising the guild like a b****, leave and try with someone else. I met a lot of great friends through PvP. Alternatively, I recommend just doing some of the campaign quests that are in surrounding villages. They are fun but not as fun as the outside-campaign quests.Right, mounts in the game are a bit weird... because, in a way, you could say they are the one P2W mechanic, not really a P2W, just a pain to level. Every mount is split into 3 parts stamina/speed/carrying capacity. They are pretty self-explanatory; you spend 250 gold every 20 hours to level one of the 3 skills by 1 point. Each tree has 60 points available per tree. So, even if you were to do it perfectly, it will take you about 150 days to get a fully levelled mount. It is HIGHLY recommended to fill out your char slots and just log on on each character to level the mount on each one. The way I did it was focus on Speed>Stamina>Carrying capacity. The P2W issue comes in that you can buy an item that levels one of these mount skills by one, and you can just stock up on them if you have the money.That being said, you will receive items daily as part of the rewards calendar; you miss a day, it just means that your calendar decreases by a day. So you might not get the last few items. Hence it's recommended to log onto a character once a day, even if it is just for the reward. The shop is full of cosmetics, and that's what its good for, because sooner or later, either you'll save up millions for someone to gift you a pack (unless you're from Germany where packs are banned, so you have to ask someone outside the country for it) or you'll end up buying crowns (premium currency) and wasting it to get that awesome pink wolf mount.The subscription in the game isn't a must-have; I know a lot of people that played without it and didn't suffer. But once you sub, you won't be able to go back. Not having to worry about running to your bank is an exceptional experience. The crafting bag just makes life so so so much better. You get the 10% boost to XP, too, as well as access to all current DLC/Expansions apart from the most recent one. Which is just a no-brainer. Also, you get a nice chunk of crowns every month.The DLC/Expansions release on the game works as such. First, they release an expansion sized update to the game (usually £30 on release but can get it on cdkeys for half price usually); they then follow it up with 2 DLC sized stuff, usually much smaller but still incredibly noticeable and relevant. It's a great model; it adds new gathering/crafting skills and really creates a constant fresh feeling to the game with new sets/new recipes/new activities.Dailies/Weeklies are fun, unlike WoW, where you want to shoot off your leg doing them. These will take an hour max. You get your usual do a dungeon for a boost of XP. Your crafting is based on your proficiency at a crafting tree; how many points you invested will change the materials you craft with; these quests give you great rewards. I would go on, but I've reached the word limit for a review.To finish off, as someone else said in the review: this game ruined my life. Had fun tho 👍🏿"
Positive,"PROS:LOTS of available solo content for those that don't want to group up, (not just questing).Combat system compared to traditional MMOs is very engaging.Dungeons are varied, challenging and engaging.  Arguably best in genre.Good balance of hand-holding vs. figure it out yourselfMASSIVE and beautiful world that always feels populated.PvP is extremely well done.Plenty of content in base game + Morrowind without feeling left out.CONS:Need addons to get access to features that really should be part of base game (like a mini map).Trials (ESO's version of Raids) should have a grouping tool for normal difficulty versions.If not careful how you spec your character, can end up weak at everything.Game still has some framrate issues from time to time should should be optimized out by this point."
Positive,"This game is so amazing, it will entirely replace your need to socialize outside of an electronic interface. Real people are stupid. So are people in this game! However, you can ban people in the game. All kidding aside, I've been able to grow a lush beard, and I'm a lady! All hail not going outside. VIVA LA ESCAPISM! also, a fair warning: RUN. RUN NOW. DO NOT START PLAYING THIS GAME! There are far too many options that will keep you entertained for aeons. I just wasted 14,209 hours of my life. I could have learned 10 new languages, specialized in two forms of martial arts and discovered the cure for cancer. And yet, here I am spending money I don't have on shiny pixel pants. GOTTA GIT EM. The end."
Positive,"This is my first review, and i'll keep it short:I've been playing World of Warcraft for 6 years straight. Now, the latest addon Battle for Azeroth kind of fu**ed up the game, not that it was different before, but BfA really hit hard. I think what kept me playing it was my guild and memories. After watching the Elsweyr trailer and watching uncountable youtube videos about wether ESO being worth it in 2019 or not, i put my faith into the community and preordered Elsweyr. The first few hours were kind of disappointing i guess, not because the game was bad but because there was so much that i didn't really know what to do. But after that, oh my, this game really got me. Now after over 70 hours in 2 weeks i think i can say that ESO is far far better than World of Warcraft will ever be able to be. The quest design reminds me of that in Skyrim. ESO just feels like a singleplayer Elder Scrolls, pushed in the MMORPG universe, made multiplayer and enhanced by like 100x the size of content of Skyrim and previous titles. The community is even better than the one in WoW (Sorry for comparing only to WoW but that's the only game comparable to ESO i've played for many years). I can safely say that I'll be playing ESO for at least the time I've played WoW, if ESO survives that long, what I'm sure of, if more people recognize the superiority of ESO in the MMORPG genre."
Positive,I'm a solo player and I love this game... you may have noticed since I have more than 8K hours in less than 4 years.. I love that it doesn't have to be a gear grind like other MMOs.   I have characters that are perfectly capable today in the gear they started wearing 4 years ago.   That's not to say that there haven't been some exciting new armor sets introduced in the last 4 expansions but that they are not required just to play the game.   In contrast I took a break from another game for about 3 months.  I went back out of nostalgia and my gear was so outdated I couldn't even solo the daily quests to upgrade to basic gear to get into a dungeon to grind for better gear.  I'll never go back.   There is a tremendous amount of content.  And up until the Microsoft purchase there was a lot of commitment from the publisher to keep it going.    As Microsoft is where 'MMO's go to die'... I have bad feeling about the future.  On the other hand.. there is so much to do that you could play for weeks/months/years before it becomes an issue.   We shall see how Microsoft handles Zenimax and Bethesda as time goes on.       The free to play vs ESO+ experience is an issue.   If you want to craft.. ESO Plus is almost a requirement.  As the big thing that ESO Plus brings to the table is storage space.  Not only bank storage but crafting storage.  If you are a crafting fanatic.. you will not be happy with Free to Play limitations.  But Free to  Play is a great way to check out the combat systems and general feeling of the game.  And  for non-crafters it may be everything you need.  Would recommend The Elder Scrolls Online to anyone who likes MMO's and hates to grind xp or gear.
Positive,"Almost 4,000 hours put into this game. Might as well put it on my resume. :')4,200+hoursStill lovin' this game. <3"
Positive,Its wow for people who don't like wow.
Positive,"Several of the negative reviews of late are due to some bizzare sense of justice combined with the Reddit bandwagon mentality.This game is amazing!  The quest work is well done and each area is hand crafted.  No ""go fetch 10 Wolf Pelts, they only drop 10% of the time from Wolves"" here!  Many of the quests can even be completed without any fighting if you so desired.$10 gets you the base game which has the vast majority of content.  The main story in the baseline is fantastic and epic, and has great voice acting from Michael Gambon and John Cleese and others.  Literally hours of fun and a lot of replayability without even getting into the possiblity of rolling multiple characters.DLC is small and targeted with two exceptions: Morrowind and Summerset.  These are larger DLCs and change your starting location.  Personally I miss the original campaign's start, but since I've done it a few times I don't mind how I have to start the Main Quest.  For new players I would recommend just buying the base game.Morrwind and Summerset unlock bigger areas and each have their own epic quest.  If your character has beaten any pieces of these quests, characters will recognize you and dialog will change.Don't like playing with others?  Not a problem.  95% of the content can easily be done solo.  I've been playing solo for years.  Like playing with people?  There is a whole lot more depth to the game and you can join multiple guilds per character.  Plenty of end game content if you don't feel like rolling anew.Legit, I can't think of a better bang for your buck game.  Fans of the Elder Scrolls universe should give this game a shot.  Fans of MMOs should give this a shot.  $10, get Tamriel Unlimited, and just play.  No subscription necessary.The subscription gives you some quality of life stuff AND unlocks all the DLC for you, so you can try before you buy if you don't mind paying the $15/month or whatever.  But its completely uncessary.  It took me realizing I've been playing this game for years to just fork over the subscription at this point.100% works on Steam.  There *was* a temporary (a few days) issue with some parts of North America logging in to ESO due to a problem Zenimax had on their side of the Steam integration.  It was resolved quickly, but without much fanfare or acknoledgement from Zenimax which caused some people grief.  I know I was able to play every day during those weeks except for a 4 hour period just before it was fully fixed by Zenimax.BUY IT!"
Positive,"Don't buy it, you'll lose your life. Best time I've ever spent. Would never do it again."
Positive,Played around 1000 hours on only 1 character and I can't say I've done all the content. It's a very big game
Positive,I'm more of a solo gamer.  This game has plenty of content I can do on my own without having to depend on others.  I  can also group up when I want to which is very nice.  Still don't get the guild stuff figured out but I'm sure eventually I will .
Positive,"TLDR - Good Game Solo or With Friends Only need to spend the first $20 everything can be attained. Not grindy and LOTS to do. Pros-----------------------Grind and Ease of playYou can play as casual or intense? as you want. If you don't want to grind you don't have to almost everything is level scaled so your level 37 casual friend can attack world bosses with a level 492 and have just as much fun. But for the more serious players you can grind and min max to get the extra edge but it is never too difficult.  -Things to do I have played around 1,500 hours and have only scratched the surface of some of the content of this game. If you want to do group dungeons do that if you want to pvp do that if you want to enjoy the story and play solo do that and if you don't want to do something don't. I have not beaten the main story line which I plan to do and only tried my first arena with some cool people I met in a daily dungeon. So much content.-Community Very friendly and helpful community never ran into a toxic player and I'm mostly in cyrodil (pvp area). Met and made so many friends playing this game. If you ever need something or help open up zone chat and be overwhelmed with support. Also noticed a high amount of female players more so than any other game I've played. CostYou only need to buy base game everything is attainable for free in game. (I still spent way too much housing is the real end game XD and Pacrooti the Final Boss)Cons with Suggestions--------------------------PVPPVP is fun but they do not care about the PVP community. An example is battle grounds where you used to be able to choose a game mode like team death match etc. now you are no longer allowed to choose it is random. Most players liked team death match and not so much the other game modes so now half of the players in the other modes still treat it as team death match. This was probably an attempt to make the other game modes played more but that is how the devs want people to play instead of what the community wants to play. Also cyrodil has been neglected massive pvp area. It would be awesome to add some excitement to the region and make these areas more like new world so these keeps mean something allowing guilds to get actual production from the mines in the form of materials. (Again Still Fun)Advice for new players------------------------Choose the race and class you want to play you can do almost anything with every race and class yes some builds are more efficient than others but if you are a meta player you already know your build before you download. Also all your perks and things can be upgraded later.Upgrade Horse Every Day!!!! and max out speed first.equipment does not really matter until level 160 either use a full training set (ask someone in zone chat). Or experiment. Find a Guild! or 2 or 5. There are guilds for everything from social to trading find a few that match your interests and you will definitely make some friends. Don't grind just do what you want and you will gain XP fast. But... Daily dungeons and battlegrounds are good for XP at the start. You don't like your starting area go somewhere else. $$$ stuff, Subscription is nice but not necessary play some before you make the decision to subscribe. If you get crates sell the consumables for gems. Again you can get everything for free even those dlc zones have free access at certain parts of the year and in my 1500 hours I have only fully completed three zones."
Positive,I left WoW BfA for this.  I'm not going back.
Positive,2.5k hours spent having racist debates about fictional races in zone chat12/10
Positive,"Do you like Skyrim? Do you wish it was multiplayer? Then don't get this game because it isn't Skyrim with multiplayer. It is an MMO plain and simple, with an Elder Scrolls skin on it. It's fun, don't get me wrong, and some of the lore is... relatively interesting if you like that sort of thing. But many people come to it thinking it'll be different than the reality. All in all it's pretty fun, not enough to hold my interest for too terribly long even with playing with 2 friends, but interesting nonetheless. You can spend hundreds of hours and get enjoyment, or a couple dozen and feel done with it. It is by no means fantastic and I'm sure there are free to play MMO's that are better, but it's passable especially since it's no longer subscription based. If it was free as well, it would be perfectly fine by me, and probably be scored way higher in general but sadly Bethesda doesn't seem keen on the idea of making it completely free. But who knows. Decently hard too, as the final available dungeon in the first area still kicks my ass, and I'm able to go to whole other regions with double the enemy level."
Positive,"Bought this game years ago around when it came out didn't really play it or give it a chance. Recently I started playing it and I honestly love the game. Even Tales of Tribute. The combat, character, crafting and skill systems are all really well done. Really enjoy how you can make your character how you want. To bad there are still issues with lag and performance. It can take away from the PvP side of things. Then there is the difficulty. I feel like there is no middle ground difficulty anywhere in the game. It's either a walk in the park where you don't have to think at all or its absolute tweaker mode where you have to be hyper focused. For any new players don't bother buying any of the crown store DLC just get ESO+ getting the DLC won't give you access to double the inventory space or the crafting bag. Unless you want to sit and constantly juggle your inventory. I made the mistake of buying the DLC in the crown store I thought oh right on I'll permanently own the content (I don't like subscriptions). Which is true but you can't permanently buy the double bank space or the crafting bag. So you still need ESO+ which gives you access to all the DLC anyways.Don't let the crown store turn you into a sucker like it did to me. I have explicit words id like to share with ZOS. Oh well hopefully this helps someone not make the same mistake I did."

Positive,It's a beautiful game and I've been playing it daily since 2020. There's so much to do and so little time to do it all.
Positive,solid game. they do need to bring prices down on the eso store
Positive,"A very good game with a good amount of issues, mostly benign or understandable.Should I play this if i want to get into the MMO genre? Yes and no. It's a baby mmo with a decently difficult endgame, but compared to any other mmo on the current market its extremely easy. If you're looking for a challenge anyhow. If you're looking for an excellent social experience and really good questing ect. for an mmo then yes, definitely buy itIs it worth buying the expansions? On a sale yes, the expacs are good but theyre not necessary for you to have over a hundred hours of gameplay before running out of things to do. With the greymoor expansion releasing soon, and summer sale in a month no doubt there will be a good sale on expacs if you want to get in without a big pay gapDLC? Expacs are the major dlc of the year but they start a year of something that contributes to an overall story which gets a part 2 zone around christmas or so (to my belief) for the extra dlc if you still love the game by the time you'll need it or want it I suggest ESO plus monthly plan as it gives you your payment in ingame premium currency as well as access to all dlcs and many other goodies. In general a very good ingame optional subGameplay? Combat is not tab based nor full fledged over the top action, but it can be rather fun and with esos build system you aren't exclusively locked to a mage or a warrior. Of course there is limitations as it is an MMO, but they're very minimal compared to other mmos as a result there are only 4 base game classes and 2 dlc classes. Dungeons and ESOs version of raids called trials can be extremely fun and challenging at endgame. Early on just enjoy the show and explore! as for class choice, all classes and races can do well at anything it just helps to be a certain race with some for minmaxing purposes which in eso is mainly just for pushing world records weekly and getting the rarest most difficult achievementsp2w aspects?The necromancer and warden classes are dlc, Warden is good in its own ways while Necro is pretty broken at the time of this review but its not uber broken that it becomes p2w. Its more the meta right now thats making it strong rather than the class itself but the metas shift with major updates so id say eso is definitely not p2w, but like any game with pvp there is metasLastly pvp. PvP for large scale is based on the alliance you pick which is your race, the imperial race which is paid for(launch bullshit) can go to any alliance and any race any alliance pack(have purchased was worth) allows you to bypass the race boundaries for alliances. Outside of pvp as of 2017, alliances dont matter really. PvP is the least cared about aspect of eso as most of its playerbase are Rpers and PvErs. thats not to say pvp is dead, least on north america server. Right now with the quarantine its more lively than ever but with that lag becomes an issue. Before the quarantine pvp was still very lively, less likely to lag. If you come into eso looking for siege castle like pvp and dont have any expectations for performance you can enjoy yourself quite well I'd say but take this part of the review with a grain of salt. There are battlegrounds which is team deathmatch, koth, crazy king, and a ball type mode like halos Oddball, they can be fun, but the population that plays them is pretty low, and theyre very good so you might have a rough time. I prefer Cyrodill(large scale pvp zone with pve options) cause i'm a chaotic monkey. in conclusion, I love eso and i dont see myself quitting for a long time, I'm really glad i found this game cause the pros far outweight the cons. The community is extremely friendly and while yes like any game there is toxicity, it is not very common and its almost always losers with no friends. If you're a diehard lore loving elder scrolls fan you may have issues with this game as it takes place in an alternate timeline to the main line of games, but if you take that into consideration, or just enjoy the lore rather than let it dictate you entirely, you'll enjoy the world eso has been built up to so far"
Positive,"Ok take this review with a grain of salt....if you are an Elder Scrolls fan you will think this is the best thing since the invention of porn, if you are one of those kids that spent 600 hours placing buckets on the heads of npc`s in Skyrim NO this is not Skyrim Online you will be a bit...well sad. BUT (and it`s one big but) as a standalone game in the MMO scene unfortunately ESO feels more like a social experiment that is ran by some mad scientist from Zenimax Online.The good!For the first time since the second game in the ES universe we get to play in the entire world (mostly) with the abundance of lore specific to each region,race and faction. We get to see the past of Tamriel and the events that lead to the single player series. The world itself is great and being treated like a single-player quest driven game where your friends or randoms can join in on the fun is great. Each quest is truly unique, each region is amazingly detailed and oozes atmosphere, no matter where you go it feels like a real place.The classes follow the standard ES rules: choose a template and expand using EVERYTHING! Two handed giant sword on a skinny robed wizard...sure why not. A giant orc spellcaster that channels his spells with a bow, yes please go on. The variety is off the hook and you can build and test as you please. And to aid this comes the fact that you may level as you please as well. You are scaled to a higher state so you can go play wherever you want on the map, be it quest, grind or just do dungeons. You are unrestricted in your approach to the available content. Crafting is as in depth as you`d expect from an ES title offering you the usual array of options: make weapons, cook, craft metal armors or robes, alchemy and enchanting and even making your furniture for player housing. Though sluggish and slow there is an interesting appeal in such a diverse and well crafted world to pick up such a profession and immerse yourself in the economy of this thriving world.The mediocre.As mentioned above you may level as you see please with the available classes and in whatever gear and skills you wish. Well.....there`s a catch. Once you reach the maximum level and start grinding your Champion Points (a post game progression system that allows you to augment your class further without changing it`s role) you hit the brick wall of this game`s progression. Not all classes and skill trees are created equal. Viability of builds is essential in an MMO and this is a case of too much even for the producers as the wide variety of options is limited once you reach the endgame. Your character that wields 2 swords in a robe using summons to defend himself might not be the best option or even viable at all for even the more difficult dungeons. This is slowly eating at the variety and dividing the community as most people that want to roll with they`re own unique approach are being left behind by both the increase in difficulty of most veteran dungeons and the players that want to progress and have a more min-max approach. The bad.OH BOY!!! Let`s talk DLC. This is really questionable as we have 3 types of DLC content. 1. The expansion (Morrowind and Summerset, with Elsweyr right arround the corner) are great offering more of everything:class, world, quests, dungeons and gear. If you get in the game and want to expand your content it`s best you start with these. 2.Quest hubs (Orsinium, Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, Murkmire) offer a new area to quest in 2 cases here guilds and skill trees that long term ES fans are quite fond of. Fancy stealing and murdering, well now we got you covered but these lack impact outside of the designated guild quests with only thieving being expanded to offer people a new way to earn some little more cash and XP on the side. 3. Dungeons....YES end game dungeons are being sold as separate 2 dungeons DLC packs. This is mind boggling as selling your endgame is just gating the community or forcing them to spend money they might not want or have at the time of release.The redeeming qualities. Trials are ESO`s raid contents  and they offer a chance for people that don`t have any DLC`s to get gear adequate for the end game. These are not as in-depth mechanics based as in other MMO`s (WoW being the prime example of excellent raiding) but they offer a challenge and decent rewards for dedicated players. The PVP is amazing. From the arena-like Battlegrounds mode to the full on Alliance war that pits the 3 factions of the game in an all out war with forts and resource nods to capture is a blast. You even get siege weapons that can be constructed and use by the actual players to siege enemy forts. This is quite rewarding and it even offers it`s own 2 skill trees (that for some reason prove quite viable in even most PVE builds). Conclusion.While I`ve not covered all aspects of the game the main elements of an MMO have been reviewed and I`m sure everyone can make an informed decision on the game. As a final note I recommend picking up a copy of the game base game and giving it a try, but overall it`s quite a mixed bag. So far the devs have walked a fine line as the game already fell in the pit that led most MMO`s to being closed but the constant additions and improvements keep the game running and the community is well and running strong even if the numbers are not as big as the millions it once had. Unfortunately history showed us that PVP oriented MMO`s have quite a tendency to lay down on they`re face and die suddenly, and ESO needs to step up it`s PVE content (that is not locked behind DLC paywalls) as well as balancing some classes and skill trees. I will not discuss player housing, cosmetics or events as these are what you`d expect from any other MMO just done in a higher quality and more appealing way.  The buy to pay approach is excellent for getting a feel for the game, and for the first time in MMO history a dev actually made leveling FUN, varied and most important of all NOT SODDING BORING. There is much to like about ESO but there is also the mark of impending doom as one small misstep from the devs could prove fatal (yes all the signs of previous failed MMO`s are here) but so far they proved to be on the level keeping things going smooth and safe. And with the new Elsweyr chapter arriving soon we can only hope things will get better.Part 2! The fuckening.So let`s discuss progression. OH BOY if it ain`t fucked from the very beginning. While going anywhere and level up cause scaling makes sure everything is fine, dandy and fair....where`s the challenge?! I ain`t gonna get hyped cause of the epic quest I did in let`s say Shadowfen (no one likes Shadowfen let`s be honest now) at level 45 when someone else right next to me just dinged level 5 doing the SAME QUEST!!! And this applies to the rest of the game even in itemization. Itemization is totally up the bum with random world drops being as viable as dungeon loot or even substitutes for some Trial loot. Basicly no matter what you do....you CAN AND WILL get end game gear. So having at least SOME progression zones would be nice, like some areas for levels 1-10, most for 10-40 and finally 40-50 and end game content. I don`t think that would be much of a sacrifice.Speaking of progression let`s talk dungeons. Short version: pretty good! While they go from easy to hard faster than the Mclaren X reaches 100 per hour it suffers from a bad case of LACK OF MECHANICS. Most later added dungeons (DLC) have quite a large amount of do a certain something or get a one shot kill to the face. Same goes for Trials. As a concept it`s great. You don`t need to put away 3 hours of your life for them, biggest one being Halls of Fabrication in a worst case scenario could be an hour and a half. Variety is high both in design and mechanics, and some as Sanctum Ophidia, Asylum Sanctorium and Cloudrest are nice boss rush style runs. Veteran difficulty is where most people will find the challenge they seek."
Positive,"If you are considering getting ESO here are somethings that you should be aware of before your purchase. 1) If you don't like spending more money than you have to, i would not recommend this game because sooner or later you will see something in the crown store you want and blow loads of money on it. However if you have a strong grasp on your money then its not too much of a problem.2) If you are really passionate about Elder Scrolls  you will dump tons of hours a day into this game. There are tons of quest and lore to explore and fun stuff to do in PVP and in PVE. For the most part it does the lore well and in other places it does not. Non the less, it is a fun MMO Elder Scrolls.3) If you like questing then I would recommend that you get the DLCs, these zones even if you are not into questing they have good items, armor sets and collectables you could acquire.4) Wait for the steam sale on this game most of the time you can get the base game for pretty cheap and the DLCs as well.5) Be aware that if you invest into crafting you will want to get ESO plus (which is a monthly subscription that gives you crowns and other bonuses which also allows you to play DLC zones without actually buying them could be a good alternative if you do not want to buy them.)Recommendations for beginner players:1) if you want to have a start on getting money i recommend collecting and selling crafting materials, usually by selling tempering alloys and dreugh wax. I farm these at the shores at kenneth's roost.2) get invested in the crafting will help you out a lot especially when you start getting into CP.3) enjoy the quests and have a good time. Note that this is still an MMO at its core so there will be lots of grinding.I hope this review is helpful to all new and existing players!"
Positive,ruined my life
Positive,I will short review.Game bad launch.Now better.Buy if sale.Me no regrets!
Positive,I left WoW for this and I am not going back. The player base is mature and helpful plus you can play many different styles and even make your own builds and still compete. The progression is amazing and is a delight to just come on and craft. You can be in 5 different guilds for all different types of things for trade reasons or for trials (raids).  Don't be cheap and not get ESO+. if you are spending 20-30 hours a week on the game there is no point not too. You spent 18 bucks to see a movie these days and 15$ for eso+. One of them you spend 2 hours doing the other 100's a month. Add it all up. GL and enjoy!
Positive,"Ah ESO, another MMO that had an incredibly rocky launch that still haunts it to this very day. Nevertheless, I'll try to sum it up quickly with a more elaborate explanation below~Do I think ESO is a good game? - YesDo I think ESO is worth playing - YesWill I like ESO if I'm coming from Wow : BfA? - EeeehESO is a very different game to it's main competitors, the being WoW and FFXIV. I've played both, WoW since Vanilla. For starters, ESO's gameplay and combat system while hotkey based is completely different from the other two games. ESO requires finger dexterity and good muscle memory to execute your rotations properly along with animation cancelling and avoiding the deadly zones of ""bad"" on the floor. I'm personally not very far into endgame yet but even I can see that this game is going to be a challenge to learn in order to push myself for high tier content.Speaking of content, this game has an insane amount of it. The beauty of ESO is that because nearly everything in the game scales to the player's level, nothing is ever made obsolete by time. Elsweyr just launched with some kick ass Dragon world bosses. Those same Dragon world bosses are still going to be relevant years into the future, the gear you collect today at max level will still be usable years into the future. It's refreshing, because nothing becomes obsolete it means that everything in the game is open to you to try, and there's a damn lot of things to try.Obviously a large part of an MMO is questing, I'd personally say ESO does this better than any other MMO I've played. Each zone has an overarching narrative to follow, punctuated by several smaller self contained side stories to explore through the zones often times with recurring characters who WILL remember your previous actions and choices in most cases. Some of the writing and voice acting can be hit or miss, but it's a refreshing way to level and experience the story when each quest actually seems important.Another important point is obviously the community. Now, I can't speak for it all because every game has bad apples, but from playing on the NA Megaserver I have to say, ESO has one of the chillest and friendliest communities I've had the pleasure of being part of.Now that I've sung praises let me just get a small peeve off my chest. ESO does have a cash shop, and yes, I would personally say it is horribly overpriced and the crown crates are simply horrible. Thankfully, everything available is cosmetic and any consumables that affect gameplay are weaker than ones that can be crafted in game through player effort for FREE. That brings me onto the point of the game's DLC. Yes, you can buy them off of the crown store, no you shouldn't.ESO plus is the game's subscription option, it gives you access to all of the DLC packs, bonus XP and most importantly, an extra bank to store all of the game's many crafting materials in and trust me, once you go crafting bag, you can never go back.ESO has quite the learning curve, it's overwhelming to start with and can make you feel lost. I would recommend watching a few videos, reading some guides and such to prepare yourself. Or you could be like me and dive in feet first and waddle around lost for about six hours and slowly figure out the basics of things on your own, whatever works for you.To conclude. ESO is an amazing MMO, personally I would call it the best one currently available. It had a rocky launch but it has massive fixed and improved itself over the years and is definitely here to stay for many more. The base game is dirt cheap half the time and requires no sub to play, I would definitely recommend that any fan of the MMO genre give this game a hearty try, you might just find your new virtual home (also yes there is player housing it's sweet)"

Positive,"As a MMO and Elder Scrolls fan this game is a dream come true for me! Literally.I remember that even back when I was replaying Morrowind and its great expansions for the who knows what time together with my best friend, we have imagined how would it be to be able to play together in that for that time vast and very rich world. That was still true for both Oblivion and Skyrim, but as the time passed and we got older we has less and less time to game together, but that didn't stop us to talk about our ES experiences when we would meet. Tragically when the TESO came out my friend was no longer among the living. So even if my life got crappier as the time passed by, the same could not be said for this game, as it ages as some high quality vine.The community is great, I would even go that far to say that it was the first MMO in which I had almost none negative experiences with other players.As far as I am concerned it is a Masterpiece!!!"
Positive,"Played it with all the four classes, doing all those quests, still love it. Huge content for a base game mmo (Gold Edition). -includes worthwhile reading and listening to dialogues.-reading the lorebooks-killing daedras and alliance skirmishes-audio is good to your ears-stealing stuff to earn gold-trial runs are worthwhile-Casual friendly-ERP/RP friendly-economy is base solely on the community-RNG is not good sometimes, no token system? sure!-NOT A PAY TO WIN, grind to win though.-We need more Bard musics though.2017 will be a blast indeed, can't wait for PvP content now.9/10Worth a buy!"
Positive,Escaped an inter-dimensional prisonSpawned at townSaw a chickenKilled the chickenCity guard arrested meHe asked me to pay 17 goldI didn't have enough gold to payWas sentenced to death9/10 would recommend
Positive,"This game is amazing, honestly the hours I’ve sunk into it is antonshing and honestly a little sad. Maybe it didn’t get the best start but now it is truly a game to be reckoned with. It’s also not like WoW where you need to sink hundreds of hours into it to be considered good. The quest design is amazing and it’s actually fun to be level 1 because of the scaling system. If you want a game that you’ll enjoy and have fun with, get this game."
Positive,I just finish base game.
Positive,Easily the best and only game that got me sober and kept me sober.  Much love for this one.
Positive,i like this game but i dont have friends
Positive,"For years I've played the Elder Scrolls games and wanted a multi-player option.  Elder Scrolls Online isn't Skyrim, so try not to expect that, but it is incredibly immersive.  And gorgeous.  Now that One Tamriel is a thing, the game is that much better!   You never outlevel content. You can team with anyone, regardless of level, and it's scaled for everyone.  So you can take your shiny new level 1 pure healer and team with your high level friends!  They keep you from getting squished, and you buff and heal as you go.   Use the DLC to add dimension to your character.  Are they an accomplished thief?  Can they snatch pretty baubles from the pockets of citizens?  Are they an assassin who takes contracts for pleasure or gold?  Perhaps they're from the jungles and ruins of Maazzatun, or maybe adopted by orcs after a shipwreck.   Crafting isn't difficult to learn, and materials are quite literally, scattered all over Tamriel, waiting to be found or harvested. Code of Conduct:  ESO is the first MMO I've played that includes a Code of Conduct.  Hate speech is not tolerated.  Period.  Basically, don't be a d!ick.  When you see these insecure little twerps mouthing off in chat, just take a screen shot and use the Report option.   Player housing!!!  Buy a home with Crowns (in-game cash store) or buy the same home (or cavern!) with gold earned, found, or stolen!  Find plans for furnishings and decorate the place to your heart's content! Morrowind expansion coming in June 2017! The community is the most helpful and friendly group of people that I've gamed with since City of Heroes was shut down.  Except on free weekends/weeks... Then the trolls come out to play.  But even then, it's never as bad as normal, everyday Zone chat on World of Warcraft, and the more mature members of the community tend to shut down the troublemakers.  Usually with biting humor to which the offending person or persons responds with, ""Yer MOM!"" then runs off to pout.  There are two things that I'm really not a fan of in ESO: The Market/s.  There is no one market.  The current market system is needlessly complex and requires far too much effort to find the things you need.If the devs would create a market that served everyone, it would make it significantly easier to find what you need, and have the best chance of selling that blue or purple loot.  A market players dream!There is no ""Search"" function in the markets.  You can't search for say, ""Ancient Elf Motif.""  You have to use the drop downs to browse to the general category of motifs and scroll and scroll and scroll and probably not find it.  Go to another merchant for another guild, lather, rinse, repeat.  It's needlessly tedious and frustrating.   Costuming and coloring.  You don't get access to the entire color palette from the get-go.  You unlock colors as part of Achievement rewards so in the beginning, you have very few, and very ugly, colors to dye your armor.  Crown Store costumes:  You have to buy dyes from the Crown Store to color them at all, and one of those devs likes really, really horribad shades of green and likes to mix them with other colors which will ruin a given palate for me.Coloring in general:  Some textures have ""baked-in"" color that warps the shades of whatever color that you're trying to slap onto your cuirass or robes.  Oh, and every ""red"" that I've unlocked so far is pink on almost everything I put it on.  Red is awesome.  You won't catch me wearing pink in analog life so I'm sure as heck not going to put it on my toons in a game.  :pI'd also love to see conversation responses have consequences as they have in Star Wars: The Old Republic. Many times the only response/s are things my character would never say.  And many more times, I wish I could be snarky.  You know, those Altmer and Dunmer could certainly do with having their over-inflated egos taken down a peg or five.  ;)  Having your entire group being able to contribute their responses as if it was an actual conversation rather than, ""click-click-click-blah-blah-blah.  Okay, let's go.""  People who want to read everything tend to feel rushed by those on the team who don't read the quests.  Solution:  Try to find three other people who like to read along and get your adventure on! If you love fantasy but don't care for the cartoony appearance of WoW (or the toxic community there), give Elder Scrolls Online a shot!"
Positive,"Been playing ESO for nearly 2 years now nonstop. And here's what I have to say about it. To clear up any confuson, NO this isn't skyrim the MMORPG, that's what many assume about this game then leave dissapointed because of it. It's an MMORPG that takes place in the past, thousands of years before any of the maingame Elder Scrolls Games began. The Main quest is simple, you're the vestige a soulless person out to fight against Molag Bal, the daedric prince of rape and corruption to get your soul back. you meet some interesting characters who will aid you in that quest.  But like all TES games, the strength isn't in the campaign or the main storyline, but with the freedom it gives to the player. Now with One Tamriel out you're free to visit any available location on Tamriel given that you discovered the wayshrines for fast travel. if not you're free to explore and literally walk throughout the land. Enemy npcs are scaled to your level so you won't have to worry about stumbling upon Overpowered enemies...that is unless you're in craglorn or cyrodil which is designed for more skilled players. The crafting is amazing, from the begining you'll be able to teach yourself the basic skills in tailoring, smithing, provisioning, woodworking, enchanting, and alchemy. as for how skilled you get in one or all of those crafting skills, is entirely up to you and how much time you dedicate to it. but the payoff is worth it when you're in a higher level or in a guild. Need to craft an epic level hallowjack or stalhrim armor that makes you regenerate stamina for your super OP PVE Nightblade build? you can do it given the time researching traits, style motifs, and getting the necessary materials all available to you. Need to craft an xp boost because you don't want to spend 100 crowns for an xp scroll? get a psijic ambriosa recipe, max out your provisioning skill, and get the needed ingredients. the list goes one from there.you'll also have in game guilds to join such as the fighters or mages guild. Each with their own unique storyline and rewards, to progress through the ranks you either hunt certain enemies or go out and search for lorebooks. you're also able to fully customize your character and dye armor and shields given that you unlocked some dyes by unlocking the required achievements. which will keep you playing the game many times on multiple characters to get. The game also has one of my favorite things, a roleplaying community which is something I never got to experience in the single player Elder Scrolls Games. you can have your character interact with other player's characters, go into political debates of Cyrodil, or go grave robbing, mercenary missions, mage school lessons, missionary work, give sermons, fight against other players, the list goes on.Lastly to top it all off ESO is now introducing the playerhouse feature which can be earned through in game gold or crowns, meaning everyone can get it if you have the money IRL or not to own it. which i'm sure will add for even more hours into the game for those who have been playing it for a while now. The strength of the game is from the player's freedom of choice to do whatever they want in this open world MMORPG based on the already crazy and amazing Elder Scrolls Universe, and the amazing community and support surrounding this game. So grab a copy, make your character, and go out into this very unique fantasy world."
Positive,"Great game, tons of stuff to do. Buy it after they drop the subscription fee in march 2015."
Positive,"First MMORPG game I've ever played. It was kinda confusing when I first started as I had no friend to guide me through the game. There were a lot of things that I didn't know but the community in this game is ridiculously NICE. They are extremely helpful, especially the ones from Guilds. Sometimes you get free stuff from random people you don't even know. You can have random people helping you with gear farming, power leveling, quests, world bosses, anything at all. I try to give back to the community by doing the same, especially to people who really just started playing the game. Coming from FPS games with very toxic community meeting toxic players no matter where you go whether its in your own team or the enemy's team, it's definitely a huge difference. Part of the reason why I'm not going back to FPS games is because of how toxic the community is and it really just take away your experience and fun. Definitely would stick around longer in this game <3"
Positive,"Lets get this out of the way, it is not Skyrim Online! Most of these bad reviews on steam seem to be from people expecting to be Skyrim over the internet. Yes, the lore is the same and it takes place im Tamriel but its unfair to compare a MMORPG to a standalone game.Elder Scrolls Online is a breath of fresh air in the MMO scene, it breaks the convencional class stereotypes of most MMOs. Yes, there is 4 classes to choose from but those are just templates, any class can use any weapon or be a tank, a healer, a dps or whatever kind of class you can think of (with certain limitations). You level up the weapon/armour/skill ability by using it but you are not restricted. Dont like that massive 2 handed axe you started with? Change to a destruction staff. You like the axe after all? No problem, go back to using it.Storylines are really well done, main quest is amazingly good and the side quests can be more interesting than the main plot at times, im one of those persons who has little patience to follow all the plots and i find myself actually listening (yes, npcs are voice acted) to the story plots. Quests are the usual for a MMO, yet theres very few quests that tell you ""Kill 10 of these, collect 5 of those"", altough you end up doing that anyway in most cases, it is not the quest objective itself, so you dont feel like youre ""grinding"".One little detail i like about ESO is that other people cant ""steal"" your quest objectives most of the time everyone sees their own stuff, with some exceptions. For exploration addicts like myself, ESO maintains what Skyrim did, hidden quests, lore objects, hidden books and skyshards to look for.Group content is fairly good, ranging from world bosses, dolmens and the usual dungeons. Veteran dungeons can be really challenging and require team work and actual tactics contrary to some other MMOs. Its a shame they didnt made a better use of group tool as from my experience seems most people are either not aware it exists or simply dont use it.So yes, its not Skyrim Online and it will never be, if you decide to play ESO thinking it is ,then you better save your money but if you look at it as a MMORPG and, like me, played and got bored of the usual standard type MMOs, then you might be pleasantly surprised.UPDATE: Not only ESO is subscription free since the 17th March it also has two new systems, Justice and Champion System. Justice its the start of which i hope will be the coming of Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood, cause it allows players to steal, pickpocket and murder NPCs, still needs some minor improvements but it can be really fun.As for Champion system its a whole new sets of passive skills basically increasing even more the possibilities on creating all different kinds of builds/classes, altough i hope they remove some useless passives and replace others in the future and for someone that completed all the quests only way to win Champions points,for now, its just brainless grinding of mobs,group content and not much else.Finally the new Crown store that came with the drop of subscriptions sells pets, mounts, cosmetics and consumables, so far nothing that allows players to have advantage over others."

The first is that I tried other MMOs during an ESO break, and none of them were better, with even more bugs and flaws.Although ZOS still has opportunities to improve on the communication of their plans and approach to the game, there were things that they did this past year that really showed an acknowledgment of the player experience and demonstrated consumer empathy. The largest of these was to implement curated drops on top of the stickerbook, which considerably reduced the grind, a point about which I and many others complained endlessly when it came to their game. Despite combat issues in Cyrodiil, which they are doing a full court press to finally fix this year, I recommend the game, and if you have never dropped in to ESO, now is the time.Start of original review:I've played this game since beta, and as an endgame player for about two years now. I have just about 6000 hours invested in the game since the start. Here are the pros and cons:Pros:1.Elder Scrolls IP (if that is something that appeals to you).2.Beautifully designed graphics with an immersive quality (particularly newer content)3.Multiple ways to play the game with highly customizable build options that are very accessible to newer players.4.Very flexible for single player and multiplayer content – there is something for everyone here.5.Combat is very dynamic and requires some practice and skill to master.6.Your abilities in the game are not contingent on paying any additional money. The only thing investment gets you is inventory control convenience and cosmetics.7.The community is, on a whole, very friendly, and the guild options make it possible to meet people who engage with the game on a variety of levels and interests.8.There is a very active and creative third party addon community.9.There are many ways to engage with the game, including the housing features, single player, multiplayer for 4 player and 12 player content, role play, and a number of PVP options.10. The quests are very good, much better than most MMOs, with good writing and some top-notch voice acting.Cons:1.Constant changes and tweaks to gear, gameplay, and mechanics make it near-impossible to settle down and hit your stride. Once you get used to playing a certain way with an optimized build, the rug gets pulled out from underneath you and you are starting over.2.Viable participation in endgame is locked behind so many grindy requirements that it can take a new player months to get to the point where they are even teachable for veteran trial content.3.The combat system mechanics are inscrutable and difficult to learn. In order to understand your characters and their builds, it literally takes hours of research on third party sites to get to the point where you comprehend the interplay of character stats and how that affects your in-game performance.4.The PVP offerings in the game are broken. Cheaters are not rampant, but definitely present, and the game design does not make it easy for ZOS to put walls in place to prevent exploitation. Each third party script or bot that gets produced needs to be individually researched and the code re-written to prevent cheating, so it’s prevalent. Furthermore, performance of PVP with respect to the servers is truly awful. Lag is such a bad problem that ZOS has literally been running player tests for months wherein mechanics are drastically changed in pursuit of identifying the root cause of the lag, and after all of that, they still have not figured out what the problem is. During some battles in Cyrodiil (a large PVP zone), the lag can get so bad that it almost acts like turn based combat.5.Many of the changes that ZOS makes causes considerable harm to the veteran player and their gaming experience, because the changes are meant to accommodate newer players and make endgame more accessible. The principle of accessibility is not the problem – it’s that after you have played for a certain time and achieved a certain level, you are not guaranteed to retain what you have earned in the game, forcing regrinds of content you’ve done over and over again just to get at parity with where you were prior to the change.6.The game is almost unplayable without the addons that the player community provides. You can technically play it, but the time wasted without the addons is such that it would be ridiculous to make an attempt to play without them.7.The “crown crates” that drop various cosmetic items are a third party currency gambling black box. ZOS does not provide any transparency on drop rates, but the community has stepped in to publish these data, which are not comprehensive and whose calculations are based on sample availability.8.If you run a guild, the cash outlay to provide offerings to your guildmates (such as crafting stations, practice dummies, and various conveniences) can run into hundreds of dollars. You don’t have to do that, but people who want to run a successful guild by providing attractive offerings to retain membership need to be aware of the stakes. If you run a trading guild, an enormous amount of time is required to manage gold inflow, alliance management, and competitive intelligence in order to be able to reliably secure a trader.Despite the positives, I’m not recommending this game because, ZOS as a company does not listen to their customers. When changes are made, it’s obvious that part of their motivation is to force more seasoned players to keep grinding over and over again to recapture what they had prior to the change. They keep moving the finish line, both to attract new players, while also willfully and needlessly punishing veteran players for their loyalty in the name of increasing veteran player screen time in order to increase the probability of cosmetic sales. These players are essentially exploited. Cults take advantage of their adherents by using the “sunk costs” heuristic as a disincentive to leave, and ZOS ruthlessly abuses their loyal players in the same way without empathy or explanation.The so called “community managers” do not address player concerns head on. Any public face for the game is purely promotional in nature. Decisions about game design and mechanics are ostensibly listened to when those changes are placed in testing, and they ask for feedback, but they do not respond to or address any of the feedback even when it is universally negative, given that ZOS’s apparent business objectives of creating more grind constantly trumps the enjoyment of the loyal player’s gaming experience.In short: if you care long term about what happens to your character’s abilities in game as a result of changes, this game is not for you. Game play changes are constant, unyielding, and with no end in sight. Furthermore, the player’s PVP experience is permanently broken due to its terrible performance, which is largely driven by ZOS’s lack of investment in adequate hardware resources combined with their terrible and outdated engine, and there are no plans to ever address either of those issues. The only reason I still play is due to the excellent friendships I have made in the game, so at least I have some cool friends to suffer with as we experience a shared misery of unending chaos and uncertainty. Together.If you love the story and world of Elder Scrolls, and want a single player experience with casual multiplayer engagement, then none of this will matter, and I’d recommend the game. But given that it is an MMO, whose ultimate objective is to better your play to a point where you can clear difficult content and/or play against excellent players in a competitive setting, the disappointing and frustrating destination is ultimately not worth the journey."
Positive,"2.5k hours in and i still haven't completed everything. not even close in fact.ESO has Alot of content, some of it is indeed behind a paywall but if you're getting 2.5k hours out of it why not splash out on some dlc here and thereIs it P2W?  debateableyes some of the better sets are DLC However, this doesn't mean that you can't access them. you can have a friend craft them for you. you can join a guild that has the crafting stations in their guild house or you can simply buy them from one of the Guild Traders. Use TTC in your web browser to find out which traders have your item in stock. PVP Large scale pvp is a problem right now. there is alot of lag on the servers. you're better off sticking to small scale, either battlegrounds or Imperial city especially if you are using a lower end pc. PVP feels satisfying when it goes right, frustrating when it doesn't. PVE can be as casual or hardcore as you like. any class can fill any role. character respecs are not locked behind a paywall. you can respec everyday or more depending on the role you want to play if that is what you want. you can play Solo or in a group. Quest, explore or clear dungeons.You will likely develop a love hate relationship with this game. it has problems as does most other games, but it does feel rewarding when you achieve what you set out to do, but that's the catch. like any MMO you need to have an objective. something you want to achieve or you will burn out on it.However... my biggest gripe with the game is Zos's marketing strategy.ESO plus gives you access to all the games DLC's (Great) Double XP (meh) Craft bag which is basically unlimited storage for crafting ingrediants which can only be obtained this way. (great...ish) and the equivalent value in premium currency.(EXCELLENT)IMO eso plus is greathowever however... every 6-12 months the new chapter releases. as a new player you buy this for the same price as a new AAA title and it gives you access to this chapter and all the ones before it. this is classified as an ""EXPANSION"" not a ""DLC"" therefore your subscription does not cover it. as a long time player and subscriber. i have to pay exactly the same price as a new player would for this chapter except i only get the latest content because i already have all the previous ones. as far as Zenimax are concerned, their loyal players are just walking money boxes. other than that. great game"
Positive,"Good game, easy to get lost. 500 hours. Still don't understand anything."
Positive,It just works

Positive,"Will keep the original review below just for context but you are now able to purchase the standard edition even if you already own the base game and get the morrowind expansion. My review will now be changed to a recommendation for the game. I was really enjoying the base game and thought to myself, why not see what the price of the morrowind chapter is on steam, since I saw it there previously. I go to the store page and to my surprise the option to buy morrowind is gone. After a little bit of digging turns out they had moved it to their crown store (their in game store where you use their premuim currency). I looked back at the steam page and saw that the standard edition now includes the morrowind expansion and it was on sale for $9.99. I tried to add that to my cart but steam said I already owned the game and couldn't be purchased even though I dont own the morrowind expansion. Turns out the only way to get the morrowind expansion by itself is from their store at 3,500 crowns which means one has to buy their 5500 crown pack which costs $39.99. While this doesnt effect newcomers to the game it makes people who already own the game have to pay more for the expansion and is a way for the company to force players to spend more money. Until this changes I will keep this negative review up."
Positive,pleased to report that my odds of having sex have dropped to 0 after my latest and greatest purchase
Positive,"Ok hear me out. This game isn't made by the people who should be making an Elder Scrolls game. However, it is actually doing a pretty damn good job of feeling like an Elder Scrolls game. Solid MMO experience. Tons of community engagement with events happening all the time. You'll be slaughtered in PVP and left wondering why you exist on a core level. Tons of great solo, small group, and large group content. Huge housing feature. Really really solid."
Positive,"I bought this game to fill the hole in my heart that World of Warcraft had left. After being burned from it time and time again, I put WoW down and searched for a new MMO. After searching, I decided on FFXIV or ESO. Seeing as ESO was on sale, I decided that would be a nice way to get into a new MMO. I loved this game. Despite the huge installation that came with it, I played this game every day, from the time I woke up to the time I went to bed. For about a week. And it has made me see both the flaws and best parts of this game.So, starting with the flaws, the shitty subscription service. It is made to taunt you. ""Oh, you're running out of bag space? You could subscribe to ESO Plus and get an unlimited storage materials bag.""""Oh, no, your bank is getting low on room? Pay up with your valuable gold or pay for a plus membership.""As someone coming from a $15/month MMORPG and playing over 3000 hours on just one character, seeing a membership wasn't new. But the way it was implemented was just the scummiest, most money grubbing POS way to implement it. And then you have the crown store. It is just shoved into your face from moment one. Microtransactions are nothing new. But they are becoming an accepted thing and it's disgusting. Does no one remember buying a game and getting all of the game's content? None of it being locked behind paywalls? It is utterly disgusting, being a person growing up in this era and seeing game development devolve into the money grubbing incessant pit that it is now.Outside of the microtransactions, this is a great game. The quest lines are rememberable (although not remarkable), the community is friendly, and the atmosphere is on point. There's no real need to go into the specifics of the goods because they are the part of the game that drags in the most players. I know for the first 40 or so hours, I was raving about how amazing this game was. I was ecstatic that I got a great game for so little. But once I took my rose tinted glasses off, I saw the game for what it was. Just a way to make a quick buck. And as I've begun to look at games more critically, I've realized that's what the gaming industry is nowadays. Just a way for corporations to cash in on naive gamers who believe empty promises and lies time and time again. The future is bleak for AAA gaming. Let's hope it gets better."
Positive,"IntroductionElder Scrolls Online (ESO) is a hit-and-slash based MMORPG game based on the Elder Scrolls (duh) universe made by Zenimax Online (Thanks for the correction, Oni, metareaper, and flobish). Players will explore Tamriel and do quests given by NPCs across Tamriel. This game is focused both on PvE and PvP, each requires a lot of time to master and grind. Similar to its offline relative, TES V: Skyrim, ESO has a massive content in it and you can expect thousands of hours of gameplay.  Quest's style is also similar to Skyrim. Instead of 'Kill 50 monsters' or 'Collect 100 chicken feets' like in other MMORPGs, ESO offers various kinds of immersive Skyrim-like tasks. Like 'Tail Dar'Van to the secret place' or 'Change A or B's sword with a flawed sword' or 'Assassinate Lord Quintus Jarol in his estate'. These quests involves stealth, lockpicking, pickpocketing, assassination, choice-driven outcome, and many other elements. In short, ESO is a story-driven MMORPG with rich content that offers the player a new way to interact with the game.Common Misconceptions1. Pay To Win?Definitely not. Purchasing 'Crowns' - ESO's premium currency - will only cut down your grinding time. If you have the time to grind and enjoys the grinding process, there is really no benefit you can get from Crowns. ESO Plus members only gain a crafting bag, all DLCs, and 10% bonus XP. In my opinion, membership is quite useless if you have the Gold Edition. Crowns will also unlock special cosmetics like special mounts and pets. But again, they are just cosmetics. They have no advantage over the free items. However, I always encourage everyone to purchase premium currency and DLCs to support the developers. Purchasing Crowns is not completely useless. You can browse around the store to see what kind of benefit it offers over non-paying users.2. Is this Skyrim Online?No. This is set exactly 948 years (Thanks for the correction, Mr. Cracktus Jack!) before the events in TES V: Skyrim. This is the 2nd Era and even Talos has not been born yet, moreover the Dragonborn. A lot of people keep asking in-game ""WHERE IS THE DRAGONBORN?! Or are we all dragonborns?"". If you pay attention to the in-game calendar, it's 2E (Second Era). Skyrim is set on 4E (Fourth Era). This is definitely not Skyrim Online, but it is set on the Elder Scrolls Universe. You will still meet or hear familiar characters like Akatosh, Mara, Thieves Guild, The Dark Brotherhood, etc but this is not set in the same time with Skyrim. Expect MMORPG-compatible quests and storyline instead of complete similarity with Skyrim's gameplay.Pros1. Rich content. Tons of story, side-quests, items to unlock, hidden collectibles, crafting system, skills, characters, etc. Side-quests are mostly a bit cliche but that's compeletely understandable. You can't expect them to write thousands of well-written story. I do, however, have to give them credits for the great main quest's storyline.2. Active and friendly community. As expected from a pay to play game, the community does not have a lot of toxic players and they are very helpful to new players.3. Very large map. This means there are tons of exploration bonuses and sights to see.4. Better fighting animations. Compared to Skyrim, it is not as crude. Not as smooth as Warframe but it is still better than Skyrim.5. Not the best and latest graphics but it looks awesome and up-to-expectations from a 2014 game.6. Almost no trollers. This is gold for a MMORPG. I can enjoy online play without the presence of people who intentionally ruin the gameplay.7. Definitely fun to play with friends. This is not one of those solo-focused MMORPGs. Having 1-3 friends to play with will be very beneficial to your ESO gaming experience.8. Helpful Add-Ons will cut down your grinding time9. Grinding process is not boring. Again, they are not like those 'Kill 100 headcrabs' MMORPG.10. Emotions made the social interactions very alive. I spent a lot of hours just messing around the city with various emotions (/kowtow, /lute, /bucketsplash, etc). People around me are surprisingly very supportive in creating a mutually entertaining random fun (e.g. flash mob, orchestra, mass-play-dead, etc)11. If you're into Role-Playing (RP), there are a lot of RP guilds in ESO. I'm not into RP myself but I saw one of them in action once and I can say their dedication is amazing.12. You can create up to 8 characters and you can share the items & money between them. IMO, this is another golden point. ESO offers a massive room for improvisations, practice, and testing. Devs did their best to balance out everything so you can try out every class/alliance/race in-game without having to pay a single dime. Grinding new characters will not be as difficult if you already have one well-off 'main' character.Cons1. Musics are not as epic as Skyrim and mostly 'meh' quality. This might not be important for some people but IMO this is a huge letdown, considering the fact that this has relation with Skyrim.2. Very expensive crown store items. Want those cool-looking armors? Be prepared to pay ~$50 for each style. However, you can get them for free if you are patient in farming for the motifs. 3. A bit confusing for new players. There are way too many elements to learn and it takes a long time to know your way around. ESO needs a better tutorial system.4. IMO, I agree with others that Bows are a bit underpowered. I have seen numerous discussions about underpowered bows in various zone chats so this seems as an issue that devs should address.5. Stealth kills are a bit weird. You can only insta-kill using Dark Brotherhood's special Blade. Stealth damage should have more value. However, I agree with Oni that stealth wasn't meant to be a huge element in the game. Stealth system exists but it's just not well made.6. Gathering resources seem to be severely under-rewarding. Stealing items from town markets and deconstructing them will give a lot more resources faster.7. No Asia server.8. Combat with same-level enemies takes way too long and this is the very first thing my fellow gamers noticed whenever they watch me play. It seems that I'm not the only one who thinks that the enemies are too tanky.  9. Crafting system lacks explanation. I had to watch kevduit's video on YouTube first before fully understanding it.10. Kills mid-low spec PC. My friends have a laptop with specs above the minimum requirements, but they can barely play smoothly (2 - 30 fps). I understand this is a heavy-load game, but it would be great if they have more optimization options.ConclusionESO is definitely a MMORPG to look at. I am not a huge fan of MMORPG myself since most of them are pay-to-win or have similar patterns of gameplay. ESO is unique. It looks awesome, it has worth-reading stories, and abundant content. I believe this is definitely worth trying. I am still not that far into the game when I write this review so I may update this review again one day. I hope this review can be helpful for you. Thank you for reading!"
Positive,"Oh boy, how to talk about my new obsession…Elder Scrolls Online has really got its hooks in me, and I’m not an MMO guy at all. In fact, I usually get frustrated and bored before getting too far into these types of games. There is a ridiculous amount of price to content ratio here even if you pick up just the base edition, and it would take forever to describe everything I liked or disliked in such a massive game. So, as a non MMO player, I will list what issues I have with the majority of them and how ESO fixes or avoids these issues.1) Boring, Tab Targeting CombatAnyone who has played WoW remembers the frustration that came from being 40 feet away from a wild boar whose attack still manages to hit you because his attack was already queued up. The combat in the majority of MMOs is usually a static, detached affair, watching from afar, barely paying attention while numbers ping away. ESO’s combat is a much more input driven and reaction based system. Left click, and you attack. Right click, and you block. If an enemy is about to attack and you’re out of range or hiding behind a rock? They miss, as to be expected. A giant storm atronarch fires a charged lightning bolt at your face? Dodge roll out of the way and avoid the damage if you're quick enough. This isn’t the only MMO to have an action based combat system, but it serves the game well and keeps fights interesting. During the more intense fights I am at the edge of my seat, spamming healing spells, rolling away from danger, and interrupting enemy casts with well timed bash attacks. As good as Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim were, the combat system are the weakest aspect of these games. ESO’s combat is very good for an MMO, but would be considered dull in a single player RPG, in my opinion. However, with ESO's variety of movement skills, dodge rolls, and varied abilities I can safely say that the combat in this game is definitely better than the combat in main series Elder Scrolls games, and anyone who disagrees with me needs to go back and replay vanilla Skyrim and remember just how bad that game’s combat really is. There’s a good reason why “Stealth Archer” is a running joke in the series, turning the game into a stealth based high critical damage FPS just makes the awful combat pass more quickly, which is sad considering that the most fun form of combat is also the one that gets it over with the fastest.2) Generic Collectathon questing“Collect 50 bear hides” quests are the bane of many MMOs, and while ESO definitely isn’t without a few of these quests, the majority of the content tries to tell a story within them. As superficial as this is, the voice work and dialogue options sell these mini stories well, although some better than others. Some quests are also surprisingly compelling, it is clear that Zenimax Online has tried hard to make their world one that’s believable and immersive, which is commendable. Despite the effort they put into the writing and storytelling, if you rush through all of the quest content to level up quickly I can see you getting burnt out pretty quickly, which leads to my next point.3) Level GrindingMany MMOs only let you do the “end game content” when you hit max level. This has led to the phenomenon of many games being filled with “power levelers” as players try and get to the “Real Game” as fast as possible. Remember WoW’s Chinese power leveling economy? With ESO’s One Tamriel update, everything in the world scales to your character’s level. When I first heard about this, I was pretty upset, since this mean that even the crappy mudcrabs from the starter level will still take a couple of hits to kill, despite your character's level. It is admittedly jarring to see a character covered in flames and glass armor struggling to kill a measly wild wolf. However, after playing through some of the vast content offered, I understand now why they added this level scaling mechanic to the game. Since the content scales, from level 10 onward you can start doing the massive Alliance PVP and the four man dungeons, even playing alongside Level 50s and above. This means that even as a casual player I can get into some pretty challenging dungeon crawls and massive PVP battles at my own leisure, which is something in other MMOs I would have to grind levels to get to, by which time I would have most likely have lost interest.4) Class/Role RestrictionsMost MMOs have very strict classes with little room for experimentation. While the holy trinity of Tank, DPS and Healer is present in ESO, the way weapon, class, guild, and armor skill lines are delineated mean that anybody can make any kind of crazy character combo they want. Want to make a Khajitt Sorcerer wearing heavy armor and shooting arrows and lightning bolts alternatively? Go for it! Want to try a sneaky Orc Nightblade who heals his teammates and maims his enemies as a support class? Totally viable! Obviously if you want to min/max there are definitely optimal class, weapon, armor and race combinations to choose, but the freedom to experiment and the ease of refunding skill points means that you are allowed to experiment with unique character combinations without fear of ruining a build and wasting your time leveling. I am currently attempting to make a Breton Templar Tank who also heals on occasion, but I couldn't resist getting the skill that allowed me to hurl javelins of pure light at long ranges, sniping mobs from far away. One thing I would recommend is that when you create a character, decide from the beginning to either put 90% of your stat points into Magicka OR Stamina, not both. Unfortunately, splitting your stat points between both will make you a jack of all trades, but master of none. 5) Subscription Based Payment PlansOnce you buy ESO, it is yours to play whenever you want. When I tried out Eve Online (and boy was that an experience) I always felt a constant pressure to play the game because of its subscription model. My brain would tell me, “NO ROCKET LEAGUE FOR YOU, MUST GET YOUR $15 PER MONTH WORTH.” In ESO, the game is playable without a monthly subscription fee, so there is no such nagging voice in my head. There is an ESO+ option which lets you access all the smaller DLC and a separate crafting bag in game, leading to more convenient inventory management. However, you can buy this DLC separately, and with eight character slots and a shared bank space, it will be a long, long time until you can’t just manage your inventory through mules. I really think Buy to Play is the “sweet spot” of MMOs, compared to Free to Play which may lead to some purchasable items giving an advantage, Buy to Play manages to fund the developers without creating a need to monetize their product further.I have yet to talk about the addicting crafting system which lets you specialize in six different disciplines, or the chaotic massive battles that is the Alliance PVP, or the excellent add-on support which allows you to customize the game's already slick interface to your heart's content with user generated tools. With the player count rising lately, plus the large Morrowind Expansion’s release this year, I can see this game having a long, healthy future. Are there more hardcore MMOs on the market? Undoubtedly. Are there “better” ones? Probably, but for a player like myself who wants nothing more than to explore the lands of Tamriel at their own leisure, this is the best MMO I have ever played. Call me a casual, fine, I’m proud of it. If what I’ve written above appeals to you, I would recommend checking out this very special MMO."
Positive,"Review from Oblivion / Skyrim player who does not play MMO´s it´s surprisingly good.i wasnt expecting all voices to be not only voice acted, but better than what we got for usual bethesda games.the main storyline is very epic and grandiose.the side-quests are lower stakes and entertaining.crafting seems very involved though i didnt get into it much, same with house building. phenomenal music.great to visit some places i had never seen and re-visit some old favourites such as morrowind.seems like the game can be played fine solo but it´s not difficult to find groups for the harder dungeons. the downside; you better do what i did and wait for a decent sale otherwise it´s quite expensive if you want to purchase the whole game with all the areas. that´s about it for the bad part, can´t think of anything else really..i´m enjoying my time exploring and probably will continue to do so for quite a bit of time."
Positive,"Some dude said ""The base game has very limited content"" lmaoThe base game will take you forever to complete, the zones are huge, the story lines are extensive, ESO+ gives you your money back in in-game currency so you can use it in the shop to buy cosmetics or even DLC and Expansions, on top of that, you get a craft bag that really only matters to people who are serious about crafting (hence why it's called a craft bag) so it's not a necessity, and it's a way for you to support the devs so they can continue bringing you content and expanding ESO, I've played this game for around 4k hours on Xbox, met some awesome people, did a lot raiding and all of it was worth it as the game continues to grow, you can buy the game and all of it's expansions, which is tons of hours of content for less than Modern Warfare 3."
Positive,"very cool very nice, i have immortalised my dog within this game, he's always there by my side adventuring with me."
Positive,"I dare you to not buy it, This game will utterly consume your life. You'll lose your precious life. If you still insist on playing then be prepared to get withdrawal."
Positive,"At the time of installation, the game requires 102 GB of hard disk space. Consider this when you download."
Positive,Consumed my life.10/10
Positive,"For an MMO, has the immersion and storytelling of a standalone RPG game. Every line is voice acted, every map has its own story, You scale to any region's level to allow i m m e r s i v e adventuring. The world is your oyster.Not a game for you if you're looking for flashy action."
Positive,"I would highly recommend this game as it is one of the best MMOs I have ever played if not the best.  My background in MMOs has some WOW with a lot of LOTRO and RIFT.  To me those three games were similar with the systems and interface etc. and were fun for a while until they were not.However, I can tell you that ESO is very different from those games in the interface, system and combat among many other things.  It is the most fun of all those games by far to play solo and you can join a group very easily almost instantly when you want group play.  Been playing for about 6 months and heard they had a rough launch, but this game is humming right now and can tell you that there is a very big player population.  Apparently they did some major updates after launch and fixed a lot of issues.  You see players all over the place in the starter areas, remote areas, hubs and there is no shortage of trading guilds that are in every city.  Believe me you could see a difference when Rift and LOTRO lost a lot of players with everything turning into ghost towns.  Two of the best features of this game that make it superior in my opinion (without mentioning the awesome graphics and large open world) is the questing and the lean combat interface to make the gaming and storylines the centerpiece.  With the questing this game feels way less grindy than those other games.  There are no silly go get 5 of these and kill 10 of those for no reason as everything ties into quest chains and leads to some really cool plot lines with some smaller like saving a village to epic threads.  Therefore, you almost never feel like you are doing something just as filler to kill time etc. Also, every quest NPC talks with a close up screen when you interface with them so it feels interactive and you almost have to pay attention to the story by default to some degree so it makes things more meaningful.  Now for crafting you still have to gather materials which can be a little grindy but the questing and storylines in this game are top notch with a major quest thread for the main game plot.  The other part is the interface where you do not have to have 8 toolbars and like some serious players in WOW have your game look like an analytics dashboard more than an RPG game.   This game features questing and adventuring and makes you focus your energies there instead of having every power available at all times with your screen looking more like NASA command control than gaming.  Those of thus from traditional gaming backgrounds appreciate that aspect although i did play that style for a while with those other games.  A wizard had to memorize a certain number of spells for the day and did not have their whole spell book available at all times - old school gaming geeks will get that reference.Anyway, for those that may have checked this game out at launch (or not in the last year) should take a look again because this game is really good.  They also have a major gaming company behind it so they have a very polished product now which is not always the case.  One other thing I have to mention that is unique is the world is really open and there is no go here when you are this level then go there when you are that level etc. but everything scales so you can quest anywhere.  Therefore, the world is not segmented like traditional MMOs so you end up doing a lot of traveling and they provide quests and other reasons for you to explore and not feel like you have to follow a script.  So it is a much less predictable or sequential experience as adventure can take you anywhere even to places you have already been but maybe not seen everything.  You end up doing zones over time with back and forth which feels more fresh and less stale than older models.  Truly open world...Anyway, will stop here and really believe this game is a bigger player than people realize and will be moving forward because it is original in a lot of ways and did not copy WOW or some of those other games.  I heard the term 'WOW clone' in the past with LOTRO and Rift and other games.  This game is not a WOW clone at all as Elder Scrolls has their own scene going on and like what it brings to the party.Thanks for reading."
Positive,"The first week aber I buyed this game everyone,realy EVERYONE asked me how it is.I couldn't give them a good critique, now I can.After I reached the veteranranks and played some PvP in Cyrodiil I think I can give a decent review about this game.The Game:The Elder Scrolls Online is a MMORPG based on the Popular RPG series.Like in every Elder Scrolls you first decide your race and create a character. The creator is good and you have many options.Now comes my first -, because of the story of this game you can only choose a race to a specific faction.For example, Orcs can only be created if you want to play for the Daggerfall alliance.It is possible to remove this barrier, but I personly don't like this decision.After you created your char, and choose one of 4 classes, you get thrown into the tutorial area, that realy teaches you everything important pretty much like the jail in every Elder Scolls before.After that you get thrown into the world in a starting city.The Gameplay:Unlike most other MMORPG's, ESO has nothing like Block,Parry,Evade chances. No the battle in ESO is active, you will constanstly moving around,use your spells and special moves,humanilate your mouse and try to kill everything in front of you that doesn't like you.The basics of the combat system are Elder Scrolls like, left mouse button weak attack,hold the button for a heavy one, left mouse button is block. Added to this is a evade roll, a push move, that cancels casts and special moves as well as one ultimate move. Spells and special moves are placed in the qucikslot and you have 5 abilitys + one ultimate move.The spells and abilitys reach from buffs,to damage,over tank and crowd controll to AoE buffs and debuffs. Pretty much like in every MMORPG.The only real difference is the world. ESO is build a lot around exploring, you will find a lot quests just by walking around, always find new areas and slice,dice and burn you your way trough the world.There are dungeons for groups and raids like in every MMO, there will always be something to do for your char.The Classes:The character creator offers 4 classes, each class specialised in 3 different areas.Dragonknights for example have 3 skilltrees. You level these trees up, by killing mobs and completing quests, after it ranks up,you can skill new abilitys, make the old ones better,skill passiv buffs and so on.One Skilltree the Dragonknight has is Irdenes Hearth, mainly a support tree with groupbuffs,some healing and some CC,as well some damage and Tank abilitys. The other two trees are a Tank and a DD tree.Now comes the clue, the classes are specialised, but don't have set armor or weaponry.You want to creat a mage in heavy armor with a bow? Just do it! ESO will not say you how you're supposed to play the class. You have 3 trees and it's up to you how you build your character up.In the capital citys of each alliance is it possible to reset all skillpoints for ingame money, the game wants you to experiemente and find your way to play your class effective.So,JUST DO IT!The World:The World is cut into different areas. Each Alliance has 5-7 areas only your alliance can enter. There is it possible to collect ressources,chat with others,look for a group,steal things from NPC's,trade and of course look stupid.The areas are pretty big and full of dungeons,citys and special places to explore.But be aware, there're some Bosses in this areas. They're in their own camps don't worry,but they can be hard to beat alone, but are usualy possible to take on 1vs1. At least I never had problems with them.Other than that so called ""Dolmen"" are spread arcross the world. These things are the Oblivion gates of this game. You kill some kultists,then some Deadra and after that drops Molag Bal elite enemys to finish you. Theses enemys vary from big jokes to ""omg I can't even scratch this guy!"". And it's 100% random what elite mob will spawn, it can be a pushover or a freaking nightmare.After you cleared cold harbor, you can explore the areas of the other alliances. Metaareas, you won't be able to met or see players of other alliances there.As soon you reach level 10 you can acces Cyrodiil. Cyrodiil is a big PvP battlefield,where the alliances fight for every little piece of ground. Or better. Does someone remember the destroyed fortresses in Oblivion? You basicly fight in them years before they were destroyed.The world itself is beautifull and the areas of every alliance are very different, you will also be able to visit areas,you never visisted in a other Elder Scolls before,as well as revisit someone,aka Skyrim.The System:ESO builds on a one buy one game principe. You buy the game, you have it, you don't need to pay money to play it.However,the games adds expension as DLC. You can purchase them in the ingame shop.Outside of the DLC is nothing in the shop you need, a lot of prestige stuff, but nothing important.The basegame however is already huge. Your own alliance + cold harbor = level 50. Thats the max level after the next update,you don't need any DLC's to reach the maxlevel,acces Cyrodiil or raids.However, there 2 DLC's I can just offer everyone. The Starterpack,what allows you to create any race at any alliance and the imperial edition. The imperial edition gives you another race as well as a free horse. It's worth it trust me.Fazit:ESO is a good game, it has a lot charm of the other Elder Scrolls,sometimes I even got nostalgia feelings as I quested in the Dominion.The game looks good, it plays good and thx to the MEGASERVER! you will have all people of your continent on your server,always."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is part of the ever popular Elder Scrolls franchise; this is the first multiplayer instalment however. The game was released on PC in April 2014. The game got rid of the subscription to play in March of 2015; however a full purchase of the game is still required for account activation. The game is set in Tamriel, much like the other games, but you are able to traverse many more different locations compared to the previous game's one location model. The game play in this game is quite similar to the other games in the series, in that you can play in either first person or third person camera, and everything is largely nonlinear. The game throws in a good mixture of quests, events and of course, exploration.  You are able to play as a number of difference racers, some of which I have not seen before in the Elder Scrolls series, so it’s nice to see more variety here. Along with four different classes to select, Templar, Dragonknight, Sourcer, and Nightblade.  The combat in TESO is similar to that of World of Warcraft, you have a set number of action bars available, and you mash the button you want to use, there is of course an optimum rotation your character should be using rather than just rolling your face across the keyboard though. I much preferred this combat system to what of Oblivion even though it may come across as simplified. Whilst the game is an MMO, I have to say I only really played it as a single player experience. You will occasionally run into the odd other real player when you are out in the world, but there is no real need to interact with them. Each time you level up in game, you are given points to spend in three main stats, health, magicka and stamina – along with a skill point. These skill points can be spent on new abilities for your class, a different weapon set, your race and even any guilds that you are a part of. This allows you to mould your character to exactly how you want it to be. I went with a rogue type character that snuck in and killed enemies before they had a chance to realise I was even in the room, but there are plenty of other play styles. Since this is an online game, the graphics are going to be a little watered down, but the game still looks really good, comparing it to an unmodded Skyrim, it is actually on par with its style if you ask me. I was playing with everything maxed out and on 4k resolution, but even so, it looked gorgeous. Some of the environments you are in look so flush and vibrant with wild life. If you are playing on a less powerful computer though, you will find a huge amount of graphical options that will allow you to lower the settings to get the game to run – this does make the game look very poor though, it isn’t a very well optimized game sadly. The story in Elder Scrolls Online is something which really hooked me straight away. I learnt more about the lore of Elder Scrolls in this game than all of the others combined. The plot is indirectly linked to the other games, and takes place a thousand years before the events of Skyrim, and 800 years before Morrowind and Oblivion.  There is a huge amount of lore to be found in the game, whether it be a quest, or a book, or a random event, there is plenty to learn about if you are interested in the lore of Elder Scrolls.This game has some fantastic voice acting in. Every single NPC that you need to talk to for a quest is fully voice acted and is done to an extremely high quality level. I was expecting having to read a lot from my past experience with MMO games, but I was pleasantly surprised that I could sit back and enjoy the dialog between the NPCs. This may have been why I took so much more information in than previous games in the series. The locations and zones that you will find in Elder Scrolls Online are ginormous. One of the very first zones you visit is one of the biggest I have seen in a game. It takes you a good 15 minutes of just walking to go from one side to the other. A lot of it does tend to be emptiness with the odd random enemy sadly though. The towns seem to be a hive of activity from either other players or NPCs so it gives you a sense of not being alone in the huge world.  There is one main quest which you will follow throughout the course of the game, but in good RPG style, the meat and bones comes from the side quests. Each line of quests has its own backstory, a problem you have to solve, and then a resolution which will sometimes result in you having to make a decision and then you will be given a reward, and in most cases this will be equipment. Whilst most of the quests in the game can be considered repetitive, I didn’t really feel as if I was completing the same one over and over again – because I was so immersed in the story, I wasn’t just going to kill X amount of bandits, I was aiding the nearby village from future attacks, so on and so on.  Some of the quests can be hard to locate the quest giver, but as you get close to an NPC that will offer you a quest, you will get a marker on your map. I have been playing The Elder Scrolls Online for almost twenty hours, and I am only level 15 with my character. The max level for any character is 50, meaning there is a boat load of content in this game and I am by no means getting bored at all. I can see there being a large amount of replay ability too. Creating a different character with a different play style will no doubt give you another 200 hours of content after you finish your first. You also have the end game content as well, such as veteran dungeons, crafting, and of course, PVP.Technically, The Elder Scrolls Online is technically sound. I had no issues with bugs, crashing or glitches. Everything is working as intended with no problems. Obviously you are going to need a stable internet connection to be able to play properly; but with the large amount of settings to configure, you should be able to get the game to run on almost anything. I would like to have seen a field of view option, but maybe I am asking too much there. The game also has capabilities of using add-ons, I didn’t find a need to use any, but should you require some, you can use the Curse client to manage and install them all for you without any issues. In summary, if you play this game as a single player experience, or maybe even hook up with a friend to play through, you will get a huge amount of enjoyment out of it. If you go in expecting it to be a bustling MMORPG game, you will be servery disappointed.  I am having an awesome time playing and I am thoroughly enjoying every moment of my experience in The Elder Scrolls Online.

Positive,"I have always loved games from Bethesda, but not all is sunshine and sparkles . There is a lot to say about  The Elder Scrolls Online , but I will try to keep it short: When I was a new player, the gameplay felt pretty straightforward and both quests and main quests was (and still is) both exciting and somewhat accessible, or so I thought until I started using addons with Minion which made it even better. After a while, maybe creating a home for your characters sounds cool as you have collected random lamps and plants which may drop from fiends and harvesting mushrooms, which is a whole other part of the game to be explored (and we all grind for crafting plans because of it, hehe].There's a jungle of guilds out there and I had to do some hit and miss before I found the one right for me ( PS: those who claim to have a non-toxic community in the zone chat are the worst ones ). I've made a lot of new friends and joined the discord community as well where we can ask for gear tips, plan dungeon runs and discuss irl politics. If you're one of those social types, you'll quickly find people like you who shares the same interest, whatever that might be. If you're not, some of the content in this game will be challenging, but do not fret: you can ask for people to group up temporary in the zone chat and join a queue for dungeon run (the queue system has been broken for quite some time as I write this review which kind of mirrors how players are  disregarded by the developers,  but enough about that).As all platforms with an online communication function, you'll also meet a lot of weirdoes, trolls and people who have an unhealthy interest in Argonian biology, but occationally you'll see players giving great stuff away for free to anyone who replies in the zone chat and we all love generous people, a small shoutout to those who tries to make a community great for new and veteran players alike.While that's being all well and good, there can be plenty of bumps in the road, some of which Bethesda is well known for: Bugs (computer generated non-insects), silent players being randomply kicked out for ""spamming"" (also a bug), a weak effort to make the game accessible for people with low vision (bot unable to handle languages and reads the chat out loud in anarchy mode + weird playstation-like interface), constant server crashes, lazy daily rewards (you get stuff a calendar for logging in), high effort gives lame awards (spoiler  for example a memento which is money raining on your head when you have finished collecting a list of stolen items for Thieves Guild ) and an unforgiving drop rate for a long list of items (I hope I one day get my hands on Shivering Cheese).All in all, as expected, this game is far from perfect, but both in solitary and with friends you can have hours of fun and to this day I'm not even finished with the main quest 'cause I do random stuff with my guildies or get distracted by the chats. A game worth exploring, you're always welcome to join in with the badasses and cool kids for a new adventure."
Positive,"I heard bad things about this game during launch ... and boy was it a mess. Mixed reviews mostly, but I would say a good sum were negative with good reasons behind their statements. So I decided it would be best not to touch this game. Three years pass, and many, and I mean MANY changes have been made. Hearing about it's major updates and making my friends very satisfied with the game's current state, I decided to give it a go.So, was it worth? The short answer is ... Yea, very much so. The long answer? Game is beyond massive ... you will unlikely explore everything even if you play this game for weeks. Every class is fun, with unique mechanics and much variety to make your character stand out. Graphics are quite amazing and detailed, hell it might even top vanilla Skyrim's graphics. Main quest, guild quests, and important quests are all very interesting to take part in. Addictive gameplay when it comes to fighting, and you will probably love the combat system. Can invest in being a baker, blacksmith, wood carver, ahchemist, enchanter, and much more. Unique cosmetics like having a pet, having a horse, having unique armor pieces and more. Character creation has just enough to be satisfying and making your character stand out. Can play with friends, do PvP in a massive zone, and co-op to your heart's content. Each faction is vastly different than the others, making you want to try each one out. Atmosphere and the environments were astounding to check out. NPCs, the story, the plot, the lore, ect. matched my expectations perfectly. Voice acting, the dialogue, and choices you can make does feel impactful. Books to read that can make you spend 30 minutes on a single book or longer. Dungeons and ruins were incredibly fun to explore in. Multiple ways to level up, and you can continue to level past 160 with many benefits. Most bosses in this game are awesome, and can be challenging to take down by yourself. Plenty of options to play with so your experience in ESO suits your preferences. A lot of side quests will get old pretty fast, or feel too similar to previous side quests. Each faction only allows you to pick between 3 races. If you want to pick any race for any faction, it's behind a paywall. PvP feels unbalanced, and only works in a tight meta based build which is unfortunate to say. Being a werewolf / vampire in PvP sucks, as you'll die within seconds to Silver Bolts (Fighter's Guild Perk) All enemies in the game scale with you, making progression feel lack luster or abscent. Very easy to get knocked off your horse if you're nearby enemies as an attack is sent your way. Little reason to every buy anything from the markets when you can craft / find better stuff. Most of the hair / armor / great stuff in the online store is quite expensive, turning people off from buying. Can't even buy things straight up, you buy tokens which is annoying to purchase and use overall. Limited options in playing first & third person, can't zoom in much like you could in Skyrim. Multiple bugs, including ones that broke my immersion like when a boss got stuck in a wall. It's an MMO, so there are elements like grinding, backtracking and so on that can be off putting.Although an MMO, it felt more like an Elder Scrolls game overall. While there are flaws and gimmicks that annoyed me, the overall experience and adventure you could have with this game definitely makes up for it. Time consuming, fun, enjoyable, and a game that has dramatically improved since launch ... I can easily recommend this to anyone who's partly into the Elder Scrolls series. I haven't even completed the main game, and I plan on playing this until it burns me out."
Positive,"Meh, the game is pretty bad.  I'm going to keep playing it to make sure its bad."
Positive,"This review will most likely get buried, but here we go....I bought this game a few months back. And it was not really that great. It cost an insane amount, and the game just felt unfinished and buggy. It also had that terrible subscription fee that made you pay a ridiculous amount of money per month....But now this game is definately worth it! So much to do, to see, to loot. This game is packed with hours of fun engaging gameplay, and great exploration. The games pace is not insanely fast, but not insanely slow, so it feels challenging but not to the point where you want to snap your keyboard in half. Graphics are very nice for a MMO. Not Skyrim necessarily, but still a great looking game. Would I recommend this game at 60 bucks? No, but if it does go on sale then snag this game.Pros:+fun exploration+GREAT fun with friends+challenging yet fun gameplay+sexy graphics+tons of things to do+a widerange of character customization+VOICE ACTING!!!+engaging solo play+pvp is incredible+Mai'q the liar...Cons:-a little bit buggy-repetitive buildings-quests are all very similiar-no way to play strictly single player-servers can sometimes lag really badlyOverall I would give this game a 8.5/10. Happy questing! :D"
Positive,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
Positive,"Its a good MMO to play by yourself, strangely the only thing that is actually worth doing with friends is random stuff around the world map like anchors, completing the little town quests or doing dungeons/delves, there are a lot of these to do but sadly quests are not shared properly and you can only do the quest at the same time, not actually work together to finish it.I personally enjoy ESO and I want to play it more with friends, but the problem is that I cant properly play it with my friends, only by myself while my friends play it too. It's like playing a single-player game but you can see your friend's avatar in the game world. (assuming you made the same choices and the game doesn't kick you into a different instance of the game world).Personal problems aside, the story is great, there is a fair amount of reading to do, but very rarely is a character not voiced, so you can just listen to the NPC talk to you. There is a lot of content, as all MMO games normally have, and ESO is no exception, it is a big time pit, you will spend hours playing this game grinding for loot or completing quests and levelling, or even just standing around and enjoying the atmosphere of the world.The visuals are great and the soundtrack is nice, for a game released in 2014, even a higher end PC on max graphics settings can begin to slow when the area becomes congested with players, I suggest playing with the settings for other player's particles and visual effects down on a lower setting.Honest final words, for the price you pay ESO is worth it, its a once off purchase and the only in-game purchases are through the crown store, but most are cosmetic or DLC/Expansions so they can be completely ignored. The visuals are great and the music is nice. If you are looking for a MMO where you can work together to complete quests, give ESO a skip, but if you are looking for an MMO where you can just play at the same time, ESO will work for you.probably a uuuuh 7/10."
Positive,"I am quite happy with this game and my purchase so far. I'd suggest this game to almost anyone and I know I have a lot more to play and do.For now my review is going to focus on the 'mixed' user review. If you spend the time to review the negative reviews you'll find a common theme. 'Boring' and 'massive download'.The download file is indeed massive, it's a large game. The updates are big, the game is big, even patches seem to be fairly large. So come into the game with the expectation you're going to spend a bit downloading before you can play. This should rule out about 50% of the negative reviews.The other 30% of negative reviews come from a general theme of 'boring mmo'. As we all know, or at least should know, a lot of time and effort goes into the ambience of the Elder Scroll games. The small side stories, the heart, the emotion around the play. The entire game is like a massive novel, there is some reading to be done and a lot of voices to listen to. I would strongly suggest that for those of us who want to get involved with a great story and fantastic lore, play this game.If you're looking to rush and skip all dialog and just run between point to point to grind missions of course it's going to be boring. You're purposely skipping the content just to level up. Don't do that, then say the game was boring because you purposely made it boring.The reviews for graphics, gameplay, physics, etc are all great. The game feels like Skyrim and the other ES games and in my opinion does a great job of bringing it online.In short don't let the 'mixed' reviews fool you. The true reviews are the positive ones. Most negative reviews focus only on the file size and how grinding is boring. Don't let those fool you."
Positive,"The story and world mythology is amazing! Most players are stat hounds moving through objectives without appreciating the narrative. I like to read the books, consider NPC comments, and think about the role I play.  I take it easy, and I think I enjoy this game a lot more than most. WOW became to childish and repetitive (grinding, ugh!).  This is just right. And the combat system doesn't get so complicated that you have to study stat boards but not so simple that you can blindly spam. Great entertainment."
Positive,"Let me put it this way: This game can not be fully explained, only experienced. It looks beautiful, it sounds beautiful, and combat makes you feel like a badass.I have played it until now about 523 hours and just hit Veteran 12... so much more to find and explore...Great graphics, nice character customization (not as good as Tera in this aspect), massive worlds and plenty of quests to perform and mobs to fight,I love the bosses being hard to kill, it is a challenge, and slow leveling? that's what I like.  but if there is one word I would use to describe ESO it would be: ... (Masterpiece)."
Positive,"TLDR at the bottom.Having played ESO a couple of years ago and logging over 300 hours (honestly not a lot) over the years not on Steam and watch the progression of the game, I can only say positive things about ESO.When ESO originally came out, it was buggy, not really balanced, and a big cash grab. That's quite frankly why the game originally was a big let down. However, over the years, they've made many major improvements. Some of the major improvements include getting rid of the mandatory subscription model, making everything scale, allowing players to venture over all of tamriel without getting to max level. These changes, along with more omptimization really made the game a lot better.As for the gameplay, it is a very typical MMO style game. There is melee, magic, and archery as the three combat styles. You have a bar of spells you can use (5 normal, 1 ultimate). Some spells are support spells, some spells are combat spells, some spells are situational spells. There is a roll dodge feature so that you can avoid certain abilities, and the sneak ability comes in handy especially during multiplayer (I will talk about multiplayer a bit later). You can group into a party of up to 4 people to do quests on a normal basis, with a full raid party of up to 24 people (6 groups of 4). Generally for the PVE only, you can also do everything solo no matter what class you are. Additionally, like many other MMOs, ESO has a crafting system that is rather nice. Whether it be increasing enchating, alchemy, smithing, woodworking, etc. there are a wealth of noncombat skills to level up and gain experience in.A little on guild side now. Similar to other MMO games, you can join a guild to interact with people. There are dungeon guilds, PVP guilds, trading guilds, casual guilds, etc. You can even make your own guild as a personal extra bank for items. Trading guilds are a great way to make money faster by selling your ingredients or items (way more than NPC merchants will buy them for). You can also use guilds to buy ingredients or items you need or want. If your guild gets rich enough, you can even bid for a guild trader.The game also has a really awesome dungeon system where you can do them in a group. There are the basic dungeons that you can go in with 4 people and simply kill monsters till the end. But there are also bigger, harder, and more experienced dungeons that require a more tryhard team. Some dungeons are even scaled to the point where you should be going in with a 12 man party sometimes (trials I beleive). Dungeons are a great place for loot and keep the game interesting, whether it be casually or more tryhard.Lastly, the best part of the game is probably the multiplayer. When I say the best part, I actually mean it. The basis of multiplayer is that you are part of your faction, whether it be daggerfall covenant, aldermini dominion, or ebonheart pact. Each faction holds keeps and buildings that can be captured by another faction. Each faction also starts off with 2 elder scrolls each, and these can be stolen/captured. Now this might not seem that good, but trust me it is. There are trebuchets, ballistas, flaming oil, etc. for sieging and defending. Imagine this but with a full 50 v 50 v 50 in a three way battle. I have actually gotten to the point the battle is so big that my sound cuts off. That is truly some good stuff. Additionally, the multiplayer scales your player, so even at lower levels you can enjoy multiplayer to a degree.Overall, the game has gotten much better since I originally started playing, so much that I bought it again for steam. I would highly recommend any person who is a fan of MMORPGs and not stuck with World of Warcraft to consider playing ESO.TLDR: ESO is a very improved game from what it originally was with a good PvE, fun dungeons, and AMAZING multiplayer.Rating: 9.3/10Recommend Price: $20 for base, DLC may vary"
Positive,"This game is my happy place and my hours will show it.  I've been a guild officer, Trials leader, and became a Grand Master Crafter (without taking the cheese step).  However, I can't recommend it to everyone at this time without some qualifications. The current creative direction of the game is finally listening to player feedback in some areas like story design of new content, while ignoring all other player needs.  The game peaked, in my opinion, at some point in the last two years and is now in decline regarding its fundamental feel.  It has far to fall though, so don't worry you can still get an amazing 1k hours in.  Just know that they will be rug pulling some of the best builds and ways of doing things.  Company leadership also has one of the most wholesome and reasonable communities of any game ever, let alone any MMO but will engage in toxic comments constantly against player concerns.  Now, with that out of the way let's get onto the review!For PvP players, the game is no longer worth your time and certainly not worth your investment to get up to a good level of competence and gear.  Too much has been changed in failed update after failed update, including major changes to how combat feels and to how data is hitting the server (far less data is hitting the server).  For PvE players who want a feel good game with endless amounts of rich content, then this game is more of a true Elder Scrolls game than it is ever given credit for.  I give it a solid 8.5/10 on quality, but bump that up to a 8.9/10 for raw scale after all the High Isle content has been added.  The story of Vestige, this world, and all the small groups and towns within it is enjoyable.  But when you are playing the story it is for the story, as for some reason the insane choice was made to not make story missions actually rewarding, save for the skill point.  In this age where players want more difficulty there is sadly not a way to increase it.  Once you hit gear level and make any improvements to gear then all content in all areas of the game (except for trials and vet Dungeons with a party) is utterly trivialized.  So yeah, 600 hours of story content and side quests that's on ultra easy mode is annoying, even if it's not quite as bad as horrifying as I'm making it seem.  Adding a little more difficulty and a little more rewards though would have made it one of MMO's best experiencesThe early game is a little rough to learn, as things are kind of obtuse.  But if you can make it to a major city and tinker with the crafting benches and learn to read the maps, it will be mostly smooth sailing from there.  Just focus on leveling up and doing story missions and you can participate in everything easily.  The One Tamriel system in this game works so well that after first finding it weird I have since come to love the ability for anyone at any level to group up and go almost everywhere.  In my opinion, this game is better as a tank or healer than it is as a DPS.  The skills required are more social and cerebreal than the raw practicing on a dummy that the DPS must do.  I'd say the game is a full 2 points better as a tank and 1 point better as a healer than as a base DPS.  One note, the latest changes ""nerf"" healing leaving you not being able to give precise and refined levels of outgoing heals, procs, etc to such a granular and intense level.  In a way that's for the best as my healer was so god-tier overpowered that I could save anyone who was not one-shotted.  The class design in this game is beautiful, and I wish they were not homogenizing it so much.  Wardens and Necromancers were truly a special experience (though I recommend necromancers only for veterans or those who are patient with a good awareness of what's going on around them during battles).  In my opinion the Templar class has not aged as well, and even as Dragonknights have gotten some revision something is still less than satisfying there even as they remain crunchy and impactful.  The Nightblade is the polished corvette of the old classes and it never gets old to cloak on people and sneak up behind them to crit strike.   For people who like to farm materials and then craft housing with them... This game is a solid 11/10.  The housing scene is passionate and has some scenes that feel like a professional interior designer made them.  Guilds focused on such are worth joining.  I had fun in this game.  I even found it richly fulfilling.  I also do feel it has an endgame more than some critics, especially having recently played some games without such.  In my mind the pinnacle of this game is dungeons, either with friends or queued with randoms.  They just flow well and are interesting, giving a good balance of time investment to rewards for each run.  To get good at veteran dungeons is also worth it in my opinion, and the extra dungeons are worth the subscription alone.  Be careful in listening to online content creators and guides.  Why?  This is an MMO that requires a heavy time investment (though it's not forcing you to constantly re-level everything and rat race constantly, so that's a plus) to be able to have a wide selection of gear and a lot of skill points.  You simply cannot come close to building what you'll see in guides and it's hard to get yourself set to the idea that even assembling all the parts of a beginner's build takes some work.  I have seen guides ruin most people's experience with this game and cause them to have such unrealistic expectations that we all laugh at them in guild.  You will not start out the game being able to get mythic items (the leads take forever to farm, and that's after days spent scrying and excavating in mini games, so imagine week-to-weeks for veteran players to do), you absolutely should not gold your gear, and you shouldn't even imagine doing vet Arenas for the special weapons unless you have a sibling sitting next to you that can teach you when it fills you with rage and despair.  I've seen people quit over the ideas given to them by the latest YT vid.  I really wish this game portrayed weapons well, as many people simply never get or even try for the chase weapons.  They aren't even necessary for most high level builds which are powerful with just a 2 gear sets and a monster mask set.  Go into this game with some patience, an open mind, and ignore the creator community and devs.  Just play the game and go to your guild for advice, as guilds in this game are the only people who are honest and represent the community.  They'll make gear for you and help you to do dungeons to get the better gear.  I'm serious, go play this game for the guilds, the friends, the story content, and the housing.  If you do that, you'll be happy like I was for a few thousand hours.  This truly is a good game and more fulfilling than most.  (Oh, and also DO NOT BUY THE CRATES.  Everyone warned me, but I did and regret every single time I did, they are the worst boxes in any single game currently out there.  99.99999% of everything you get from them will be chaff.  They shouldn't be legal, and in this case they are literally that bad to the point they make gacha games seem generous and ethical.)"
Positive,"honestly the best argument against playing this game is that I went from kind-of interested to having played for 1000 hours in under 3 months so, you know there's that"
Positive,I dont like MMOs but I ruined two semesters because of this game
Positive,"I have been playing this game off and on since a week or two after release, and I can tell you that this is unlike any MMO I have ever played.Short Story:Good Game, buy.If you want a more detailed review, read on:This isn't an ""online Skyrim"" that you can play with your friends, although some people have managed to perceive it as such, even after playing for many hours.My favorite thing about this game is that while there are subscriptions and in game currency, it doesn't have to effect gameplay. Most MMO's, if you don't have a subscription, and I don't know.. Cartel Coins, you wont have as much fun and wont have cool stuff. I have played this game without a subscription, and I can say that there isn't a massive difference, you can level up almost as quick and still do hundreds, if not thousands of hours worth of gameplay without it. The biggest perks of a sub are dyes and the crafting bag ( having played before the crafting bag, I will tell you that it is worth a sub all on it's own.) A lot of negative reviews I've read have to deal with download space and time... It's that way with all MMO's, know what you're getting into.All the others have to do with how Bethesda and Zenimax are greedy for offering in game currency, those people obviously have no grasp on how the current climate in video games are going, specifically in mmo's (loot crates, pay to win, microtransactions. etc.). I'm not saying they're totally wrong, but I hope they have a nice bed living under that rock. I personally don't mindpaying a bit extra for added content as the game goes on, the people making the content have bills after all.I've seen a few bad reviews about offering Morrowind as a paid DLC. My first point on that is to refer to my previous statement on not understanding what is driving profit in a lot of games these days. My second point is that I have not bought Morrowind, and I can say that it has not effected my game in a negative way AT ALL. Pros:Amazing graphics (for MMO) on high end machines, still playable on low end machines.In game paid currency (crowns) doesn't mean pay to win.PVP is an absolute blastAll MMO zone chats are toxic, but this is less toxic than mostAn almost endless amount of things to doYou can make a viable build out of any race and classGetting in depth with builds can be a lot of funAwesome voice actors Fantastic Add OnsCons:Load screens can suck during high traffic hours.PVP can be a bit zergy (Can also make for a lot of fun though)Can be a bit grindy if you let it.Builds can often change based on patchesNot having enough time to spend playing the gameOverall I would recommend to a friend."
Positive,"I told myself I was done with ESO forever once I moved from console to PC and couldn't carry over my 1000+ hour save. There was no way I was going to do all that AGAIN. I mean that would be crazy right?Anyway, here I am."
Positive,Best build quality out of any modern MMO.
Positive,"This is becoming my favorite MMO, despite not liking it initially and not touching it for months. If you're coming from other MMOs like WoW or FFXIV, this is very different. It will take some time to get adjusted to the UI and the combat style, but trust me it's worth it. Tanking is a real thrill in this game for sure, and I enjoy healing as well. I'm not really a DPS player. Once you overcome the hurdle of adapting to a different kind of MMO, you'll find that every single line in the game is voice acted, and the acting quality is incredible most of the time. The story is decent, the dungeons and raids (called ""trials"" here) are well designed and interesting, and there's some good casual content like collectibles, emotes, etc. Two real criticisms I have are 1 - the monetization... it's not pay to win, but the cash shop is thrown at you a lot in this game, and the items are really expensive. 2 - there's a major difficulty jump at end-game. Everything is stupid easy for a very long time, then you enter veteran DLC content and get obliterated. There's not a lot in between. But for me, neither of these ruined the experience and I still love the game overall.If you're coming from Skyrim, you'll probably love this game, as it is similar but much much bigger, plus you are playing with thousands over other people. A few basic MMO questions answered:-yes it has the ""trinity"" of tank, healer, dps-yes it has mounts, but no flying ones-dungeons are 4 player, ""trials"" are 12 player-it has PvP battlegrounds and long-term zone PvP wars-there are no level boosts at all-the shop has emotes, mounts, pets, crafting styles and more casual stuff-$15/month sub is optional, but it gives you all DLC and bottomless mats bagDefinitely recommended from me :)"
Positive,"Remember the good old days when our elder scrolls experience was Morrowind,, running around a massive world with lots of things to do,, guilds to join, quest to complete and fun to be had.. Morrowind was the first non MMO I played on the computer, It was glorious I would download almost any mod I could find, and enhance the game in many eventful and exciting ways..  I never actually finished Morrowind, but I loved that game to pieces..  Then I got oblivion, unfortunately Oblivion was far too advanced for my poor computer, but I played it on Xbox 360 instead.. it was good, didn't really hold up to Morrowind but still good..  Then came Skyrim or as I like to call it The Milk Maid as Beth Milked it to death.. This was the first game that really had people wishing for a co/op mode..  Beth being the oppertunist they are saw dollar signs and created the MMO Elder Scrolls online..  The masses rejoiced.. well actually they complained because the game was pretty devoid of almost anything that made the Elder Scrolls great..  10 years later and the game is in a far better state but still lacking in alot of ways..The Story - Well it's an MMO, most MMO's don't really have a story, this one kinda does,, although I don't know what it is.. something about A prophet, and betrayal and Daedric princes or something... who knows..Game play - If you've played the Elder Scrolls then you pretty much know how this game plays,  do quest, steal stuff, sell stuff, buy stuff, make stuff... etc etc etc..  Funtimes to be had by almost all..Pro's - Hours and hours and hours of gameplay..  Huge game, compared to The Elder Scroll games we're used too.Decent substitute until Elder Scrolls 6 comes outCon'snot really as fun as a core elder scrolls game/Even with 10 years in the can, the game still feels emptyOnly 25 quest at a time (with thousands of quest in the game, 25 is too few. you'll often find yourself with a full quest journal and frustration will ensue)Inventory issues if you aren't sub scribed to ESO+Recommendation - If you've never played TESO before, now might be as good a time as any,, if you buy the newest expansion you get access to all the previous releases, which will add potentially thousands of hours of gameplay..   The game really has alot of content, but even with all that content eventually the game starts to feel like it Drags.. with leveled enemies, you never really feel overpowered and even at max level you can die to some random creature you were killing with ease earlier in the game..If you're a fan of MMO's then this game will be a good addition to your game playing,,  while it's more like a solo MMO, it does have some group content, which I can't really comment on, and I hear it might have raids, but I have zero experience in this game with raids or more then group content..  I'd recommend buying the newest expansion which at the time of this review was Gold Road..   I'd also ask Beth to increase the quest journal size another 10 quest or so..   it's really needed after 10 years.."
Positive,"I really do like this game, but it does take up a mass amount of space up. If I were to recommend this to someone, I would suggest that they should have a good amount of storage room on their computer, or an external storage device for their PC."
Positive,"After playing WoW for 10 years (technically 14, started during TBC but quit until end of wrath) It's refreshing to play an MMO that actually has the RPG side nailed down. WoW massively lacks being an RPG these days. The questing is superior, each one being voiced and easy to get invested into.Dungeons are fun, PVP is a blast. Plenty of skill lines to create unique builds.Easily thousands of hours of content to get invested into, I myself currently have barely scratched the surface and enjoying every moment."
Positive,Add Russian Language please!
Positive,"good game to eat food and chill cause of all the dialouge, its like 1 mission is an episode of a tv seriesgood stuff"
Positive,Don't believe the Anti-Hype.Elder Scrolls Online: It doesn't suck anymore.
Positive,"I've sunk in enough hours into the game, and have experienced both aspects of PvE and PvP quite evenly. Is Elder Scrolls Online a perfect game? No, of course not, not in any sense of the word. But it is a game that shows promise and initiative that other MMORPG's are not providing, such as WoW or FF XIV. This game started as one of the WORST MMO's I have ever played, with damn near no content, and numerous bugs and glitches. Here we are, several years later. The game pulled itself out of the dirt and surpassed any and all expectations from it, so much that it holds nearly as many active players as WoW currently does, and growing. PROS:-Hours and hours and hours of content, both PvE and PvP-Fun, engaging combat system, not to complex, but not mind numbing either, you will be kept on your toes.-Beautiful art design, worthy of an Elder Scrolls I.P.-AMAZING Soundtrack, on par with that of Skyrim and Oblivion-Non-Toxic community (Mostly)-Huge variety of playstyles, class builds, and weapon choice-Compelling storyline, as well as DLC storyline-Great voice acting, phenomenal for that of an MMORPG-Not pay-2-winCONS:-Minor bugs and glitches-Have to grind a good amount if you want to get into end game content-DLC is somewhat on the pricy side, unless you just go with sub time-Stability issues in PvP-Certain monster sets make others seem irrelevant, only 4-5 sets primarily used for META.-PvP gets far less love than the PvE content. Numerous balancing issues, slowly but surely being improved, but still there as of now.Final Thoughts:  All in all nothing is truely game-breaking for me to get me to stop playing. Every time I log in there seems to be something for me to do, whether it be do dailies, dungeons, PvP, make alts, go back and work on my crafting, or work on many of the complex quests they offer in the DLC. This game is my favorite MMORPG, and one of my favorite games of all time, I rank it far above WoW or FF XIV, as the game does not feel like a chore to complete, rather than a living, breathing Elder Scrolls world that was there far before you arrived, and will continue to be there after you are gone. I highly reccomend playing this game if you are a fan of MMORPGS, or a fan of the Elder Scrolls lore. Final Verdict: 9/10, Excellent."
Positive,"The Combat Experience - Here's the thing about ESO - If you're looking for challenging PVE experiences, this isn't the game. This game is very lax and casual, and the world scales to your level. It rarely scales enough to be challenging - unless you're fighting 4+ enemies. You get about 5 buttons to mess around with, but a large variety of abilities that you can tweak. It's very customizable when it comes to this - you can make abilities cost mana or stamina; and the way you tweak them can completely change what the ability does.IE: Blade Flurry, you can make it consume more stamina, or change it to consume mana. If you do more stamina you get harder and faster hits with the ability. If you make it cost mana it can leech life from the enemy per each hit you land.There are prompts to dodge things, interrupt things with a bash, you can roll around and move quickly, so on, so forth. Combat is very action-packed. At-least, until other players join in. You'll see what I mean in the next section.Is it REALLY an MMORPG though? - There is no ""Combat-role trio"" like tanking, healing, etc - you can tweak any class to do anything. Some classes do each sort of role better; but as stated before, you can get creative. Wanna be a tanky / taunty rogue? You can. Wanna be a heavy armored healer or wizard? Wanna do ALL of that and also tank? You can. While this may sound great - it also means that you can create any class to be fully self-centered and self-sufficient. Meaning you could completely solo dungeons and world bosses if you like. Which sort of defeats the purpose of being an MMORPG. Here's what que'ing up for a dungeon looks like. You get a fairly short que, about 5 minutes. Once you get in and realize where you are, someone who knows the game and is one of these ""self-sufficient"" types of players has already cleared the enemies and made it to the first boss and has him at half health. By the time you reach the boss, it's dead and they're almost to the next one. Sometimes people know this will happen and just want free gear - they show up and just afk until they can go to each boss and loot them. And - don't think about talking with anyone while in a dungeon, they will say you're wasting time - or not speak at all.      This is my general consensus throughout my entire leveling experience on two different characters.Don't get me started on World Events such as the Dark Anchors and world bosses - they're a breeze that anyone can show up and AFK at until the one person who's at their keyboard and actually fighting the event wins - on their own, with no help required. It's all about if you have the patience to press your buttons until the health bar is empty that determines if a person wins the fight or not. No skill necessary because the difficulty scaling is tediously easy. Well why do you recommend it then? - The game is cheap, doesn't require a subscription, and the expansions / dlc go down to more than reasonable prices constantly. There is a ton of story-rich quests, beautiful places to explore, and things to collect. Plus, if you're leveling with a friend and you two decide to tackle the aforementioned content above by yourselves, the experience is more challenging and genuine. Not to mention, professions and crafting is quite enjoyable, and if you want to play the market - you actually do need a good guild to access ""Guild vendors"" and such as that. And as mentioned before, there is a ton you can collect in this game, whether it be cosmetics, mounts, achievements, or whatever such you can find. There is player-owned-housing, but much of what you'd want is behind a ridiculous pay-wall. But still possible to do, meagerly. The holiday events are also quite fun and give handsome rewards as long as you're willing to grind the daily events for them during the timeframe. What about PVP? You haven't mentioned that.I have 570 hours in the game at the time of writing this, and I can tell you that I am no where near well-geared enough to fight most players. PVP provides a massive incentive to grind for better gear and tweak the hell out of your character and its abilities. Allthough the rewards for PVP in my opinion are quite lacking, and why I haven't struggled to ""git gud"" at this part of the game. I also don't find it fun that the only source of PVP is Duels and fighting players in Alliance Wars in Cyrodiil. While the rewards aren't amazing and the PVP has a steep learning curve, I will say that the progression for PVP seems sound. You earn Alliance Points by participating in the war for Cyrodiil, which you can spend on getting your PVP rank higher, or for advancing your PVP abilities. (You'll see what that means when you try it. It's actually pretty good.) Final thoughts / TL;DR - In my opinion - it's a wonderful singleplayer experience, but a horrendous multiplayer experience. It's a good game to log on and relax with, but if you're thirsting for challenge or are a masochistic raider like many are in World of Warcraft, this isn't the game. If you like PVP that requires skill and has good progression - this is a good multiplayer experience - however you will be limited to one zone you can fight in, or fun friendly duels out in the world. Last thing I'd like to mention, of the classes I've tried, the Night Blade has been most entertaining - with the ability to sneak around, steal items and actually make real good money off of it - as well as rare items for your collection and house building. Plus, if you're ""that guy"" who wants to assassinate random NPC's because they have a smart mouth, you absolutely can - and sometimes they drop valuable items worth selling as well. It's really an experience you don't get in most MMORPG's. Ofcourse, you can't pickpocket players or one-shot murder players, but it's still fun all the same. And the Dark Brotherhood DLC that unlocks the ability to be a bounty hunter? My god, it's wonderful. They also have skill challenges to test how quickly you can pickpocket or assassinate a specific enemy deep in a fortress or so and escape. Honestly? It feels kind of like heists in GTA:V. But without the explosives and guns. Some will say this review is narrow-minded, or ""well not all players are like that"" regarding the dungeon experiences I mentioned. And they're right, sometimes you get the rare group that is actually fun and inclusive. But when the content you're doing together is still insanely easy - there's no NEED to work together. My review is stating the facts of what you will encounter every day of your life playing this game multiplayer - there's no avoiding it unless you decide to play solo."
Positive,"Wow refugee simulator 2019.Seriously though, if you like MMOs this is as good as it gets."
Positive,"! Disclaimer: Know that this is probably totally subjective and biased as I'm one of few who prefers Asian MMORPGs to Western ones and do not like the ""best western MMORPGs"" such as WoW. Also I'm a huge fan of TES.  !TL;DR: Either you love this MMORPG or you don't. It's very unique compared to all other MMORPGs I've played and I'd highly recommend everyone to at least try it out and see what this game has to offer for themselves. No, this is not a Skyrim The MMORPG, rather it's The MMORPG about The Elder Scrolls and you'll get a lot more out of this game viewing it as such. You can play in any way you want, regardless of the class you choose and the world is HUGE. DLCs are completely justified imo and I can't wait for the housing update.Now to the actual review... This will be super long so grab your favorite drink and a snack.Honestly this is the best MMORPG I've played in a while. Each and every quest NPC is voiced and their dialogue is very interesting. Not even once did I skip quest dialogue and every quest is worth doing. The voice actors are very well chosen and I'm so glad Sheogorath still has his iconic voice. The quests are all very unique, even if the quest objectives are not. Everything is lore-friendly every quest you accept actually makes sense, as in you won't just encounter and NPC that gives you a quest just because, most quests are even connected to other quests, even if you don't realize it at first.Classes do not restrict you from creating the character you want. You can even totally ignore class skills and go for weapon and guild skills instead which every class has. Sure, class skills have their own benefits but really I'm very surprised how much freedom this game gives you in creating the character that you want. And whenever you feel like you messed up you can just reset your skill points for in-game money at a shrine.The world (the continent Tamriel) is so full of things and it's worth exploring and looking in every nook and cranny. You get rewarded for being curious with Skyshards or a bit of story that is imo very interesting. Literally every container is worth looking into as there's a small chance you'll find a crafting motif you won't find in stores (except guild stores). Every province is unique as you'd expect from The Elder Scrolls so it gives you even more reasons to go literally everywhere and thanks to the One Tamriel update this is possible with one character, no matter from which faction.I know this game has gotten a lot of negative things said about it when it first launched, and honestly it made me avoid this game, too. However after buying this game myself and playing it I can easily say it's really great. A lot of people were expecting this to be Skyrim the MMORPG but that mindset will only disappoint you. This game was never meant to be Skyrim the MMORPG, it's a great MMORPG about The Elder Scrolls, not the other way around.The combat is a bit on the basic side, to be honest, but if you like basic, then that's totally fine! The combat system is a semi-action combat with an auto lock-on for long and mid-range skills, melee is completely action combat with lock-on, though. I haven't experimented with everything yet as I mainly play on my mage Breton, but so far the combat has been fun regardless. You can swap weapons mid-battle and each weapon set has its own skill set that you can customize, this is super great as it allows you to adapt to the combat situation rather easily. With the help of mods you can even create skill set presets, but I'll get to mods in more detail later. Also you can become a Werewolf or Vampire... That's super rad if you ask me.I haven't really gotten into PVP so I can't really say much about it. Sorry about that.Without DLCs, the Mages, Undaunted and Fighters Guild are available to you, with the DLCs you also have access to the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild. Now I know what you may be thinking ""What? Guilds locked behind a paywall? WTF??"" but trust me, these two DLCs open up a big questline with their own locations and extras that I think more than enough justifies having to pay for them... After all this is a MMO, how else will they make enough money to uphold the costs for the servers? Next to having their own questlines and locations, the guilds give you access to guild skills and unlike other skills they do not progress by using them, you have to find special lorebooks (Mages Guild) or hunt certain enemies, complete dungeons, etc. etc. to increase the skill ranks.The crafting in this game is so awesome. Make your own weapons and armor, upgrade them, dye them, enchant them... It's just really amazing. Make your own potions, your own enchantements and cook food and brew drinks... I haven't played any MMO that allowed you to do all that without failure rates or requiring you to use additional items other than the base materials. No bull****, just craft to your heart's content! Of course crafting has its own set of skills, so you can't be a master in all crafts. I'd say it's pretty similar to Skyrim; you either focus on being a smith, alchemist or enchanter, or be a jack of all trades but in the end never be good enough at anything.Remember when I said classes won't restrict your character build? You can steal from NPCs or even kill them if you wish. Which gives you even more freedom in playing the way you want to. Want to be a ""Dark Knight"".. As in playing as a Templar that kills and steals? Why the hell not. Want to be a good guy even though you choose to be a Nightblade? Why. The. Hell. Not? Honestly I was very surprised when I found out you could steal from NPCs and even get punished for doing so if you get caught. Now I just wish the guards would also say ""Stop right there you criminal scum!"" when they hunt me down... *Sigh*Also there will be a housing system pretty soon... I can imagine that this will only further enhance roleplaying and make the game even better. Let's just hope they don't put all of it behind a paywall.I've been putting this off for a while as this can't be really put into the review as a criteria of why I believe this MMORPG is great, but this MMORPG actually supports the use of mods. They may only be UI mods and tiny ""gameplay"" mods, but the fact that you can use mods is super great on its own. There's a lot of mods out there already and they all tackle certain aspects of the game, like a grid view for your inventory to make it more PC-friendly, a Minimap to fill all your minimap needs, etc. etc..Now to the most important thing: Is the cash shop P2W? Absolutely not, not in the slightest. There are costumes and so on and tiny convenience things, but other than that it's all in the green. Really.There's so much more that can be said like the rest of the DLCs that are included in the Gold Edition and those that are not and the overall quality of the main quest and so on... But at this point I'll just say if you're not convinced yet, then wait for another Free Weekend to try this game or just buy it when it's on sale, you won't be disappointed, at least."
Positive,"1200 hours... I think I've spent enough time in the world to give my thoughts.I am NOT a hardcore player. I don't want to be max level. Min/Maxing takes a backseat to fun. I don't enjoy rushing through content. I want a living, breathing world that makes me feel like I am a part of it. To it's credit, Elder Scrolls Online does this very well. The world is immersive, interactive and even slightly dynamic (as in it changes in response to player action). ESO also boasts one of the most robust and diverse roleplay scene I have ever come across in a video game to date. The hardest part about the game is the first few hours, when you are thrown into the world with only a minimal tutorial to guide you along. I didn't REALLY figure out how to pick locks in the world until I was well past the 30th level on my first character... and I didn't explore crafting until even after that... but I wasn't at a loss for it. There always seems to be just a little bit more to explore and do on your first character, so much so that it can seem almost overwhelming, as at first glance it looks like a pretty simple game. Therein is the beauty of the game, in my opinion. It has depth without being unnecessarily complex or obtuse. It balances those factors very well, for my tastes, and most people I introduce the game to find the combat enjoyable and the world fun to run around in, if nothing else.The combat is gonna be the thing that either makes or breaks a game, and ESO has hit the balance just right. The action elements are there, but not so twitchy that I feel like I need to be a professional gamer to handle em, the Min/Max elements are there for people who wanna try and come up with ""the perfect build"" and all of it can be tossed out the window if you want to build a crafting character that can't be much more than middling in a fight. Leveling is handled slightly differently than in most other games. The main source of EXP won't come from killing monsters outright, but doing quests and exploring. It's not uncommon for me to gain a full pair of levels in a new area, simply by exploring and gathering resources I find while doing it. Of course, there are ""world bosses"" that spawn at designated locations, and downing them will net you a decent EXP reward and some good loot. What I am saying here only begins to scratch the surface of what the game offers, but either this sounds interesting or dull, depending on the type of gamer you are.What the game does not do is spawn a lit path for you to follow. Of course, you are free to zoom from quest to quest without stopping, but that misses the point of the world. This is a game for meandering. This is a game that WANTS you to ask, ""Huh, what's over there?"" only to find some previously unknown quest line or even just a chest you would have missed had you not been willing to wander. If you play for the destination, another game would likely suit you better... but if you play for the journey, ESO is a very decent game and one I recommend more than just about any MMORPG out there to date. It's gettin a little old, but it's still got lots of years left in it!"
Positive,"I started playing the game in April due to #stayathome COVID-19 lockdown. I was hooked to the game, I think mainly due to 3 of my friends who are also playing the game. We would do quest together and try to beat the dungeons. It was fun and relaxing, just hanging out virtually with friends.I try not to bother with the side quests. They are a distraction. I do enjoy the main quest. The story, NPC dialogue and voice over was very well done. I like to see these NPC up close and often admire at the details in their costume and when I start to look at making my toons attractive, I marveled at the level of details that a modern game with tons of budget is able to achieve.There’s really a lot of things to do in this game and it caters for different play style and interest. One of my friends spent tons of hours just fishing. He said it calms him down. I love doing dungeons and exploring delves. Another enjoy leveling up on crafting to make money.Graphics are nice but my other recent game was The Division 2. In comparison to Div 2 in the gfx department, there’s not much to wow at, although certain parts of the world is attractive enough for a screenshot or two.After 7 months, I’m not getting enough of it and look forward to entering the world once a day. Highly recommended if you are looking for a good MMO."
Positive,"(FOREWARD)Now that i've reached the endgame and spent quite sometime with this game i wanted to leave a review. Most reviews that i've read are from people who either didn't even hit level ten or spent 40 hours thinking they could speed level through the game and found it impossible. Also to really understand this game you have to completely cut it away from the main series games. THIS IS NOT AN ELDER SCROLLS GAME. It is an MMO game with an elder scrolls theme and overtone. Also in the time since launch this game has drastically evolved. a substantial patch is added nearly every month with new content, systems, and fixes.(REVIEW)Graphics- I'll start with the obvious. The graphics in ESO are gorgeous. You can really see the hard work that went into making tamriel a truly breathtaking world. From The snow in Eastmarch and The Swamps in Shadowfen to the A'likr Desert each environment was crafted in a way that makes you want to see whats next for your journey.Game World- While on the subject of the Environments the scope of Tamriel is insane. It is easily one of the largest Game world i have ever seen. Also the difference between zones is quite drastic. Sure you might see similer buildings in the same zone but that is to be expected in a game of this size.Character Creation/Development- The Character creation in ESO is probably the most robust and fluid system i've seen in an mmo to date. You have 3 alliances each with 3 races (And imperial as the tenth for an upgrade fee) and the choice between 4 classes. The thing that sets ESO apart is the fact that these classes are not constarined whatsoever. You Want a Sorcerer with medium armor that wields two swords? go for it. Every class can use any type of armor or weapon the want with out specializing in any. The only constriction your class sets on use is the specific skill line you will use.Skills- Logically the next step is skills. In the game you don't have a typical mmo skill tree. There are an assortment of skill lines  including class, weapon, armor, racial, world, guild, and crafting skills. You literally have hundreds of options for where to invest your skills. some being active hot key skills for combat and others being passives to buff your stats. This system gives you more freedom then any previous mmo i've played. Crafting- As an avid crafter i absolutely love the crafting system. A player is'nt confined to any one profession. I can use my blacksmithing skill to craft my weapons and armor, my woodworking skill to craft my shields, and my enchanting skill to craft runes to enchant my weapons and armor. Also the system is quite robust. You earn experience in your crafting skills by crafting(obviously), Deconstructing(which gives you materials as well), Improving items, and researching(which gives you traits). On weapons and armor you can research about 20 different traits which you can then use in your crafting recipes to recieves buff from increasing attack and defense to adding critical chance or increasing skill line experience. Questing- Questing is one thing most people are uninformed about. Some reviews make it out to be bland basic quests. In fact it is the opposite. Gone are the collect 10 of this for no reason and kill 20 of these because i'm bored quests. Sure some quests have those aspects but every quest has a story. You might be setting up a ritual to stop a nechromancer or finding out who killed a local merchant or helping soldiers take control of a fort. every quest has some reasoning that makes it interesting and makes you want to know what happens. also many quests can completely change whats happening in an area. Economy- This is one point that has really annoyed me. Many people are calling for a public auction house but the fact of the matter is that in a game like this Thats impossible. Eso is not based on servers. There are 2 Mega servers. With the immense population of a mega server an auction house would become bogged down with high level items which would lower the value and in turn ruin the reward of earning top tier gear. The way it is set up with guild stores makes it much more accessable. Also with the last update guild merchants have been added so that you can buy items from other guilds members. most large cities have a handful of guild merchants that will have completely different wares to choose from which helps keep the value of items.Pvp- I am not much of a pvp player so i don't have much sway on it. but from what other players have told me it is better at higher levels and always more fun in a group.Endgame- Now that i have Passed the level cap of 50 and entered the veteran rank system it really adds a lot to the game. After beating your factions story and the main story you are able to play through every quest from the other factions scaled up to your level. The content gets much harder but also much more rewarding. I am Only veteran Rank 1 out of 14 after update 4 released today But i will Update as i move forward.So all in all The Elder Scrolls Online has been a wonderful Journey for me. If you go into it expecting to play skyrim you probably will not enjoy it but if you go into it looking at it as an MMO its a very rewarding experience. PLAY THIS GAME!SCORE- 8/10(p.s. I've played this game for almost 140 hours as of this review. if your going to take anyones word for how the games is don't listen to the guy with under 10 hours. It took me 120 hours to hit level 50. I might be subjective in my review but at least let my experience speak for me and anyone else with substantial time in the game. It gets better every update!)(EDIT)- Seeing as no one is really understanding my meaning i thought i would add to this. When i say its not an elder scrolls game i mean that as in it is completely different then the main series games. It is a new take on the series but it still has all of the original areas, lore, creatures, etc... Giving a game that gave fair warning that it would be completely differentt a bad rap for only the fact that its different isn't right. If its too risque for you because your an elder scrolls fanboy that thinks this game tarnishes their reputation then the easy thing to do is just not play it. Don't tell everyone else that they are wrong in playing it when you won't step out of your comfort zone and try something new. Now enough ranting. PLAY IT. HAVE FUN."
Positive,"If you're wanting to get into ESO, you might want to reconsider. After devoting thousands of hours to the game myself (non-Steam), I'm here to warn you. You might have thought the virus was bad for temporarily ruining your social life and turning you into a shut-in. This game will do that to you for good. There is no vaccine.If you value having a partner, an income, kids, pets or anything meaningful at all, then just stay away from it. If you're determined to go through with it after all, you can expect your family to starve and be replaced by one consisting of role players and animals that don't need to be cared for. ESO will become your new, never-ending job where you're the one paying. The main tasks include scamming people for gold and murdering them for Alliance Points. The remainder of your time is mostly dedicated to inventory management, farming Champion Points and hoarding armor sets for all of your copied builds that are about to get nerfed.Showing off your fancy gear, titles and houses that no one cares about will be your new pride in life. All your goals are replaced by meaningless in-game achievements. Recognition and wealth in the game will be all you desire. Don't bother trying to escape, they'll just bait you back in by flooding you with daily awards, weekly items, constant events, overpriced crown store items and a sea of DLCs.Better log in right now and get to work. Your new life awaits."
Positive,Fun if you don't like MMOs but want to play an MMO.
Positive,Haven't touched grass since playing ESO and still have no maidens 10/10 game
Positive,Me and my Kids have been playing ESO for about a year now. Before that everyone had it´s own tablet and was gaming for themselves. At least ESO brings back family adventure! We love it!
Positive,"The sound design in this game is most underrated in any game ever. Turn off the music, walk around in first person and just listen to it all. the ambience and reverb effect is honestly beautiful. from tunnels with water reflection to even saluting against your chest changing depending on your chestplate. The gameplay is fun and the community is pretty funny and cool but the sound design is godly."
Positive,I'm not usually an MMO guy. I don't like socializing in real life much less in muh vidyagamez but I love me some Elder Scrolls so I gave it a shot and you know what? I friggin' dig it. Stay in first person and it's a very Elder Scrolls experience. Plus I haven't been forced into socializing yet so that's neat. I'm sure there's a stupid huge dungeon somewhere that'll force me make digifriends with someone but until then I'm flying solo and lovin' it.
Positive,"Go back to a time where playing an mmorpg was about getting lost in a different universe, lost into the lore, and not getting the shiniest weapon to show off.ESO gives you full freedom of your character;Want to be a sorcerer tank? No problem.Want to be a night blade healer? You can make that happen!Of course there is min-maxing, how to get the ultimate heals, the ultimate dmg with this and this class. If thats what you like. But you can also tailor fit your character to work FOR you. And nobody will go protest or refuse to take you to a dungeon because you're not using x skill.The only negative thing about ESO is if you're very poor. Not only is it buy-to-play, it also has dlc's. The DLC's is worth the money, you can buy them in the crown store and unlock them for your account forever. Or you can become a member of ESO+, ESO+ is a subscription type which in my opinion is fairly cheap. You can choose to sub for 30, 90, or 180 days. And during those days you get access to a few features. One of them being an material bank which makes life a lot easier. The other being access to all DLC's.Of course, I'd recommend just play the game, get max level. sub for 1 month and go through all DLC's. Of course, you can get to them earlier, as you get scaled up to the content. But I'm the kind of person who likes to do things in proper order. So yes:+ Voice acting+ Fair sub model+ Freedom of character/skill/builds+ Huge world to explore+ Great dungeons (No afking, no lazydodling, you have to dodge, you have to be active and run around or you'll die)"
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is a surprisingly great game filled past the brim with grade A quests, characters, mechanics and more. The game constsntly makes me smile and I play it almost every day. This game has done a lot of things right and has even done a lot of things better than Skyrim. Here are the pros and cons of the game,--PROS-Massive game world full of adventure and culture-Meaningful and mostly exciting quests-Hundreds of memorable characters-Simple yet powerful character creation-Detailed crafting systems involivng styles, levelled crafting, traits, etc . . .-Engaging combat consisting of a combination of skyrim's ""Hack n' Slash"" combat, WoW's hotbar ability styled combat, and a little bit of rolling to dodge attacks-Massive player made guilds with banks, guild merchants, and more-Player based economy for trading and guild merchants-Intelligent AI that can detect when they are outnumbered, cooperate with other NPCs, etc . . .-Skyrim style skill-based levelling-Armor dyes that can be gained as rewards for completing achievements-Intricate PvP based in Cyrodil with forts, seige weapons, missions, etc . . .-Players can become the Emperor based on the war in Cyrodil-Free-form classes that can use any kind of weapon or armor (For example, a sorcerer using a battleaxe)-The world basically levels with you, as to alleviate the ned for grinding-Hundreds of lore books scattered throughout the world to be added to your ""Lore Library""-Great dungeons filled with powerful enemies and unique loot-Many teamwork based possabilities in the form of ""synergies""-Great voice acting-Player emotes and animations-Mounts and pets-Dynamic weather and time cycle-Decent graphics-Polished UI and menus-Hours upon hours of content including lots of late-game content-Incredible framerate (compared to Skyrim)-World events like ""Daedric Anchors""-One of the best final boss battles in modern video games-A ""phasing""  system that changes certain areas of the world for certain players after they do certain quests in those areas to provide the feeling that you are actually making a difference-Epic backround music along with bards that play their own songs-Continous flow of new content and patches-""Crown Store"" filled with asthetic and conveniance items (Nothing overpowered)--CONS-Slightly buggy (mostly hilarious visual bugs)-Short ""MMO Style"" agro ranges for enemies (Kinda needed in most areas)-Very few mounts and pets you can get normally in game-No way to easily communicate during combat-Player-made guilds are account-based, not character-based-People can easily (and accidentally) steal your kills, and in doing so, steal your loot and experience-People aren't honorable in PvP, causing the fun and challenging character builds to be useless, stupid, and suicidal in PvP. Prepare for a painful amount of ganking in Cyrodil.-Lack of sweetrolls (Couldn't think of anything else)--Things that I would like to see (MY OPINION)-1v1 dueling between members of the same faction (They added it!)-Player housing where players can either purchase upgrades or build it themselves (possibly using racial styles?) (They added it!)-The ability to lock your guild to certain factions (For example, a guild is locked to the Ebonheart Pact, so a charcter in the Aldmeri Dominion doesn't have access to that guild)-More mounts and pets that can be aquired normally through questing-The function to go through a certain instance ALONE-Some sort of ""Voice to Text"" system-More sweetrolls (MORE OF THEM)This game is great, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. It's completely worth the sixty dollors its normally on sale for."
Positive,"I'm a 70 yr old lady, and I've played for some time now and I love this game. I will never be hardcore or even a good player. But there are so many things to do in this game it is almost overwhelming. Quests are very good, the story-line is very good and last but not least, the graphics are fabulous.On the downside; it is expensive being a Plus member, especially on a retirement pay (shoe-string budget). I recommend a much cheaper monthly fee. There is ofc the DLC content you get with the Plus membership but the ideal is to have a cheaper option only for that magical bag space just for crafters. Well, it's just a thought"
Positive,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5/5 I've logged more hours in The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) than I've spent pretending to understand the plot of Inception.Initially, I thought an Elder Scrolls game going multiplayer was like putting pineapple on pizza – just plain wrong. But boy, was I wrong about ESO.This game's got the Elder Scrolls freedom vibe, and it's like an all-you-can-eat buffet of quests, PVP madness, and more. The lore is intact, and I haven't seen a community this nice since my grandma's knitting club. Seriously, not a single toxic player in my 1000+ hours. It's a miracle!ESO's got something for everyone. Whether you're into serious questing, kicking butt in PVP, or just want to flex your fashion sense in Tamriel, this game's got your back. Oh, and did I mention the housing? It's like Sims on steroids – who needs real estate when you can own a virtual mansion?As a card-carrying member of the Morrowind fan club, I was over the moon to see ESO doing my favorite region justice. The nostalgia hit harder than a mudcrab on skooma. If you've been sitting on the ESO fence like I was, it's time to hop off and join the party. Trust me; it's the MMO equivalent of finding a fiver in your old jeans – unexpectedly awesome.To sum it up, ESO isn't just a game; it's my digital homeland. With 1000+ hours under my belt, I've explored more of Tamriel than I have my own neighborhood. So, if you're ready for an adventure that'll make your family gatherings look like a snoozefest, dive into ESO. Tamriel awaits, my friends! 🎮🌟"
Positive,"When ESO first released, I played it for about a month and quit. The game was buggy, the writing was subpar and the overall experience just didn't feel great. I went back to the game when the Morrowind Chapter released and thought much of the same, though the game had improved somewhat, it just left me pretty bored. In the last 2 weeks, i've put about 150 hours into this darn game, I've come to love it, not in a stockholm syndrome sort of way, but in a ""This game has improved SO much"" sort of way, and I can't quite put my finger on why. The writing has gotten a LOT better, you'll see that in later quests, especially in some of the DLC quests. The combat feels better too, I'm not sure how, i'm not sure why, maybe someone who has been playing for longer can tell me in the comments. This game also has one of the nicest, welcoming communities of any MMO i've ever played, I've only met a few douchebags and those were in PvP.If you're interested in Elder Scrolls lore, play this game, if you're interested in getting INTO the elder scrolls community, play this game, If you're interested in really cool quests, dungeons both group and solo, play the game. If you're interested in Role Play aspects, play the game, it's got something for nearly everyone and with the new content coming throughout this year, I look forward to seeing what else this game can offer me."
Positive,"I have to say, this is by far one of the best MMORPG's I have ever played. I was a WoW player for 6 years, and then it got to be boring and the same old crap. Bethesda really makes some good content. Mind you, I didn't start playing until the game had been out for at least a year and a half, because I wanted it to be improved from the catastrophe it was when it came out. Now, it has so much to offer. I have over 2300 hours of game time, with 12 toons and I love it! Yes, there is a cash shop, yes you can buy things to make your toon better, but you don't have to. And it seems like the people that play are more mature than the childish WoW crowd. Give it a shot...you won't regret it!"

Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online comes from the fabled MMORPG genre. While the game has every and all symptoms of being a proper MMORPG, it is obvious after just a few minutes that it can be enjoyed almost to the fullest while you play solo. What makes Elder Scrolls Online preferable over other MMORPGs available nowdays? That's a complex question that calls for a long and elaborate answer. I'll try to be as concise as possible.ESO has six classes. Dragonknight, Sorcerer, Nightblade, Templar are the base game classes. Warden requires a separate purchase OR buying the Morrowind DLC. The Necromancer came with the newest Chapter: Elsweyr.(newest as of writing of this review) There are ten playable races, with the tenth being Imperial, requiring you to have ESO Imperial Edition or purchasing Imperial City DLC bundle. And so we have Altmer, Bosmer, and Khajiit in the Aldmeri Dominion. Breton, Redguard and Orc in Daggerfall Covenant. And last but not least Nord, Argonian and Dunmer in Ebonheart Pact. Level cap is 50, with Champion Point system opening up after you hit maximum level. Champion Points are spent in constellations for passive buffs. Gearing is connected to CP in a way that the best gear is of CP 160, meaning until you reach CP 160, you shouldn't worry TOO much about what you wear. The rat race begins after 160. And after that there is no maximum limit of CP level, although the point gain caps at 810.When you level up in ESO(and that will happen often, as the game has pretty easy and smooth leveling experience), several things happen. First of all you get level up rewards. These can be items, gold, crafting materials, premium cash shop things like costumes, a pet, a mount. Things to make you feel good about yourself and spur you to play more. It works. Secondly you get one to three points to spend on statistics. These are Health, Stamina, and Magicka. Stats are directly connected with your performance. Health is very straightforward. More points spent in Health let you take more punishment. Pretty useless stat to be honest, unless you are using specific tanking builds that is. Fun begins when we look at Stamina and Magicka. Putting points into these stats not only increase their respective pools, but also the damage dealt by skills which use those resources. Finally you obtain one to three skill points which you can put into whatever skills you want. Skills will be discussed below, as they are what makes ESO quite unique.But how do we level up? By doing quests and... Fighting. So let's talk about the combat system, and to be specific, about skills.Just a quick note: fighting in ESO is different from classic MMORPGs. You have skills, but you target enemies just like in Skyrim, by pointing the crosshair at them. No Tab-targeting. Constant action, with light and heavy attack performed by clicking or holding left mouse button, dodge rolls, and blocking utilized by holding right mouse button. And a side note - you can use a controller to play ESO, works flawlessly with XBox 360 one, tested by me.Ok, after the notes, time for skill lines. Those are separated into several categories. Also, almost every skill line, with some exceptions, gives you access to active and passive skills. You have class skill lines, three of them, which are unique and restricted to the class you pick during character creation. Then you have weapon skills, which are available to any class. You simply equip a weapon you want. Killing one enemy with that weapon grants you weapon's skill tree. There are six categories of weapons:Two Handed: swords, maces, axesSword & Board: obviously the tank's equipment, one handed weapon & shield, you can use one handed swords, axes, maces, or daggersDual Wield: you can use any combination of one handed weapons hereBow: pretty self explanatoryDestruction Staff: covers three types of destruction staves: fire, lightning, and iceRestoration Staff(a healer's tool).Then there come Armor skill lines for Light, Medium, and Heavy Armor, which have only one active skill each, and instead focus on passive skills. Here, same as with weapons, you can utilize all and any armor you want, even to the point of mixing  all three kinds of armor available.Going further we have the Guild skill lines. Guilds here mean NPC organizations which you can join and advance in their ranks. There are more guilds, but I will list only three useful ones which you should join. These are the Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, and Undaunted. Each of those guilds offer very useful active as well as passive skills, and they don't require any DLC or Chapter, they're in the base game. There are other Guilds in various DLCs.Exploring along the skillbook you can find World skills. This ambiguous name hides three notable examples:Soul Magic: skill line allowing you to fill empty Soul Gems needed for resurrecting oneself and others on the spot, as well as offering useful passive abilitiesWerewolf: a skill line you need to obtain by either getting bitten by special NPC, another player already affected by the Werewolf curse, or buying it from the ingame cash shop(not recommended). Werewolf skill line lets you transform into a... werewolf! It is a timed transformation which erases your skill bar and replaces it with werewolf skills. Werewolves are very strong damage dealers which can also take insane amounts of punishment, although they have no tanking skills in their arsenal.Vampire:  Being a vampire gives you acces to a couple of active skills as well as an array of passives, including the one most coveted by Magicka damage dealers: increased Magicka pool regeneration. Being a vampire also changes the look of your character into a very pale zombie-like thing with red eyes. As with the werewolf, vampirism is a sexually transmitted disease which can be bestowed upon you by either a player, a special rare spawn NPC, or your credit card(again, not recommended).Note: becoming either a vampire or a werewolf is by no means obligatory, and both of those come with certain disadvantages. Vampires take much more damage from fire sources than regular players, and werewolves are very susceptible to poison. If you contact one of these diseases and wish to get cured, visit your local priest of Arkay and make a small donation in gold. All will be forgiven, just like in real life.Last worth mentioning is the racial skill line. This is obviously unique to each of the ten races and provides bonuses to specific stats and skill lines.There are other Skill lines, but those listed were deemed by me most worth of mentioning.As for PvE and PvP in ESO. You can chose what you want to do. Be a damage dealer, tank, or healer. The class doesn't matter. Simple? Not really, because this comes with some caveats. PvE is ruled by the ""meta."" There are certain class/role/race combinations that work best, and some class/role combinations which just don't work very well in group content. When it comes to content available for PvE there are dungeons, plenty of them, in normal and veteran difficulties. These are tackled by groups of four: tank, healer, two damage dealers. Then we have Trials: 12-player group instances, with normal and veteran modes. Most trials require DLCs, but there are some in base game.In PvP ""meta"" is less of a problem, because you can experiment and find what's working for you. Still, some weapon skill lines are more prominent than others in PvP. As for content, PvP has:Cyrodiil: open world war between three factions with sieges, siege engines, and all out slaughter. It has PvE elements too.Imperial City: PvPvE zone riddled with very strong enemiesBattlegrounds: 4v4v4 instanced battles fought in various gamemodes, like Deathmatch, CTF, Chaosball.End notes: ESO has performance and framerate issues no matter your rig. So much for being concise. Also reached the character limit so check comments for extra text."
Positive,The Elder Scrolls Online retains most of the elements that made the series famous in a new astounding experience. The transition from offline to online is smooth and the game itself is fun.
Positive,"Having been an old school LOTRO player who has been out of the gaming scene for a while, this has been an excellent mmorpg to get back into. and it doesn't  hurt that it isn't subscription based. that matters when you don't have all the time in the world and actually have a profession. the ability to casually play whenever or put it down whenever is a huge plus."
Positive,"+ The game scales to your level, letting you play with much higher, or lower, level players+ Most content can be experienced solo+ Very easy to pick up+ You can play with any player, regardless of faction- The scaling system can sometimes keep players from feeling more powerful as they level"
Positive,"I paid a fortune for this game and a bunch of DC's and only played a few hours. God I hate MMO'S...Imagine like, an MMO… but 70% of the fanbase is super chill middle aged DND type nerds and the rest are really fun to irritate. It’s like if Skyrim had less snow, fewer dragons, and more random weirdos in ridiculous costumes. You can be one of those weirdos.My impression after playing this game for all these hours is that this is not an Elder Scrolls game that happens to be an MMO, it is an MMO that happens to be set in Tamriel. I love this game for the sake fact that everyone on it is super chill and full of people that you can talk nerd sh*t about. While there is always that elitist group in every game, you don't even gotta deal with them! It’s an MMO for people who don't like to play with other people. It’s even one of the only games I've ever played where it’s common to run into girls!It’s an MMO for the solo-player where you can be a Simple Fisherman or a Vampire Lord with their own palace and everything in between. Kind of like a single player game with MMORPG elements, features, and group content. Very customizable and easy to play. Combat is simple and limited to 10 slottable abilities at a time. Lots of exploration. It’s an awesome game where you spend tons of hours creating an elite character just to have that character reduced to nothing three months later. Then it’s just rinse and repeat, year after year. My wife’s boyfriend says it’s an adventure simulator with lore, lizard people, and cats.Honestly it is what you make of it. Epic storyline and meaningful side quests? Check. Single player coop multiplayer check. PvP check. Mass PvP check. Raids check. Housing check. Meaningful character progression ehhh that's where it kinda suffers a bit cause while you have tons of options there's not enough challenging content for it. For an MMO the writing/story telling is fairly good and the fully voice acted NPCs are a big bonus. I also like how ESO feels a lot more open ended in what activities you participate in and that old content doesn't become obsolete just because a new ""expansion"" comes out.The music is excellent, everything (EVERY thing) is voice acted and voice acted well, ambient and enemy sounds are incredible. Costuming is basically perfect, with very minor hiccups. I've spent hours at the outfit station, and I'll spend hours more. Simply the best transmog system I've seen. Housing system is excellent. You can argue that housing content itself is drip-fed painfully slowly, which I would agree with, but at this point any newcomer to ESO would have plenty of furniture to go learn, earn, or find.The combat/gameplay is also easily the best out of any MMO I've played. A lot of other MMOs overload your hot-bar with a million abilities you'll never use, tab-targeting is clunky, awkward and out-dated, and other MMOs with ""action"" based combat feel ""off"" to me such as Black Desert Online for example. ESO gets most of it right when it comes to combat/gameplay.Like most online game communities, you have perks and generous people willing to help. Then you have disadvantages and rude individuals that ruin the experience. It takes some time to comprehend how some mechanics work, but when you do it’s a cake walk. Have someone rushing through a dungeon or degrading you? Leave. Have a complex group that’ll actually guide you? Learn from them and keep that knowledge for next time. Enjoy the game as you see fit. Don’t let the negative outweigh the positive.Outside of it just being a game, I absolutely love it. It’s given us incredible insight into not just lore but simply locations across Tamriel and beyond. We don’t have to play Arena to see all of Tamriel in old graphics before most of the locations uniqueness actually came to life or was even made, we can see how Tamriel is meant to look with amazing graphics as a bonus. ESO is a treasure trove for people that love the world of Tamriel and want to explore, see, and learn about all of itDespite all the jokes, it’s the best MMO I've ever played. I love the setting. The world is HUGE. Tons of stories, characters, mythos. I can't recommend it enough.10/10"
Positive,"==( TL/DR )==Do I recommend this game? -> YESDo I actually play this game atm -> Not really, just trading and keeping my stuff alive.Do I actually like this game, personally -> Ehh, some stuff I like, some I don't.Then why I do recommend it? -> Because it's a good game, a great game even! But it just has some annoying things in it that I don't like, and that made me not enjoy playing the game for some time, but it comes down to personal tastes. Bottomline is, it has: * Great action combat * Moderately good graphics * Realistic looking characters and world (non-cartoonish) * Amazing atmospheric areas and great scenic views, with really great audio design. * Varied gameplay with lots of skills to try and combine * ALL voiced dialog (over thousands of voiced NPCs, yes. Also even non-descript side characters you find on the street have stuff to say, often. And also, what dialog and comments you get from NPCs change with quest stages, even that!)  * Some really great quests (some stinkers too, ngl) * A really big world map with thousands of hours of content and you can go anywhere you want from the start (i.e. looking at probably +10K hs to fully explore and complete every quest in the game. Maybe even more.)It also has (now for the cons) * Really unbalanced PvP where only certain specs really thrive, and worst, other specs can't even participate atm. * Really unbalanced PvE too, but in that case, at the very top, you'll only find just a couple of classes/races that everyone uses and has to use, else you aren't as efficient as someone that does (it's all in the Math, man!) * Difficult to get to end-game, and harder to keep up with it (if you're a normal person with a daily job, that is.) * Grindy system to get the gear you want (though, it has become better over the years.) * Developers that don't know how to be measured, and that prefer the 'HAMMER' approach over the 'SCALPEL' approach to things, and often break more than they fix (specifically talking about game balance and META changes. etc.) * Ultra super easy combat for solo play that often makes the game a bit boring, if you're only into that and are just starting (depends on gear and player, ofc. and also, it gets better with time, as the harder content is gated behind getting more levels.) ==( In depth details starts here, not really needed, is more of a rant than anything... )==How many hours do I have in this game?  -> Steam says 340 hs since I bought it here, in-game my '/played' command says 291 DAYS and some change for all my characters (that's about ~6900hs or so). I bought the game originally from Zenimax store on 03/28/2014 (early access) and played it like that for several years before I bought it again on Steam. But I took several times outs from it, once around DB release, then after Morrowind expansion, and then again after Elsweyr, and I haven't really come back from that one yet. I might, though, some day.So, why I recommend it and not really play it seriously anymore?Well, the game is good and enjoyable when you're starting as a baby newb and everything is new, once you pick it up and learn how to play and find your preference in class and skills you like.  Combat is great, and fun.  Gameplay is addictive, and quests are good, some even awesome. There are stuff that I still remember from my first time playing that bring me good memories, characters I remember fondly, and things that happened that makes me sad when I remember them.After some time you start growing up and trying to play at higher level, perhaps joining a guild or two, doing end game content and progression stuff... and everything changes. Suddenly, the old content is not relevant anymore, and you draw no enjoyment from it, and the only thing you crave is trials, trials and more trials! To get your gear and upgrade it and get better at doing your role, try new content and defeat the challenges. And then is where the problem starts to make itself manifest...Keeping up with the game at relatively high level (i.e. I never was top level, maybe not even high level is appropriate here... I could call myself a moderate level enthusiast, and nothing more...) is a freaking job, takes a lot whole of time and patience, and most importantly, having and keeping friends around that can help you (and that you also can help them.)  And here is where the problem lies (for me) everything you do (or did) is gonna get blown away and destroyed by the changes the developers make every three months or so, and you'll have to adapt again, and redo most of your work, investing ungodly amounts of time into getting gear again, and into finding what stuff to you should be using and how, and which skills you need to ditch and what others should you start using. This strains the enjoyment so much, that whole guilds die and get disbanded when the changes are too severe (like it happened with Morrowind release, for example, for a couple of my guilds.)Sometimes it happens that you need to ditch a whole class and play other classes (if you want to be efficient and your share of the effort for the group, that is...), i.e. the class you like and invested most of your time into becomes rock bottom and everyone and their mother play the new OP class (which is often behind a paywall ofc. Nothing to see here...) I.e. in other words, the original Motto the game had ""Play as you want"" is not true (probably never was, but atm is the total opposite of that,) and you often have to either change to something you don't like to keep up, or simply abandon and give up... and that's what I did.But the more aggravating thing that happened to the game over the years that made me give up, is the way the developer treat the classes.  At the start of the game each class was STRONG and WEAK at the same time, some had some great advantages to some stuff and were weak against others, and between the four of them it was kind of like an extended rock-paper-scissors game where each class had a counter in a different class.  With the introduction of the Warden in Morrowind that got diluted a lot, the Warden effectively stealing things from the Templar making it better at stuff Templars used to be great and even top at, while giving nothing in return.  Same thing with Necro, and progressively each class has become an indistinguishable blur of what it were, and with the ""skill standardization scheme"" it got even worse, as it doesn't matter if you use a class skill or a similar skill available to everyone, they all are the same. I.e. the game became boring as a result, and it doesn't feel the same as it was in the past, sadly. There's nothing I can contribute as a Templar player myself, that other classes don't do better. On top of that, over the last two years they've been focusing on more grindy stuff and constantly redoubling with the annoying mechanics that makes you waste time you would want to use in content you enjoy, to go do content you don't enjoy to get the stuff you need to do things you enjoy... and, in my mind, that makes it really, really against what I think the game should be doing.So, in essence that's the reason that I personally don't enjoy playing the game anymore (as an old player, having played it in ""better times"", so to speak...) but these things won't probably apply to newer players that enjoy playing the new classes I hate, or for whom the new content that's grindy to me, is new and exciting.So, in summary: I'm old and don't like to adapt, and I work and I don't have enough spare time for keeping up with stuff. Also, as a Templar player from (almost) the start, I really miss the old days, the old greatness, the old skills. And I also miss old friends, that I used to play with in PvE/PvP and against in PvP :'/Best of wishes to everyone,Leeux.(AD forever :P)"
Positive,"UPDATED FOR HOMESTEADI have put thousands of hours into this game and still haven't experienced everything it has to offer (just now purchased on Steam to link my account)! I've been playing since Closed Beta 2 and still haven't stopped. This game is extremely underrated and got a bad reputation upon release due to several reasons: People expected Skyrim 2 or Skyrim with friends. Reviewers did an awful job, many of which did a complete 180 on their reviews in Open Beta. This in turn, turned potential players away. People expected a richer experience that can't be offered from an MMO at this current time. The game was unpolished and didn't offer the basic content that other ES games did (i.e. Theive's Guild, Dark Brotherhood...)There really isn't enough to be said about this game and its quality. It had a rocky start, but at its core, it is still the same game. Many people will deny this and say that it is a completely different game, but from those of us that have been playing since the beginning, we can all tell you that its still the same game, just much more polished. Great graphics (add ReShade for enhanced experience) Great community Buy-to-play; subscription is available with amazing benefits, but not required One of the best Elder Scrolls main stories today Controller Support Play with anyone, anywhere, anytime, any level. Faction choice only comes into play for PvP Great ambient sounds Great music Engaging combat Fully voiced NPC conversations Accuracte mouth animations for NPC's. Way better than Skyrims Flexible roles; play any class as any role (end game does require specific classes, for good reason) Addons Amazing PvP and only expanding in the future, though there are issues here and there Excellent dungeon content; some of the best I've experienced in an MMO Great solo playability 1000's of hours of content to play from in the base game alone Active developers that are actively engaged with the community Consistent updates Best crafting system in an MMO today Housing (incoming Q1 of 2017, already looking promising) Difficult end-game content if pursued Great Guild System Unique auction house. I personally like it, but some may be turned off by it Ridiculously flexible settings for graphics, sound, UI, and gameplay Decent character customization that is improving as time goes on Collectibles such as costumes, skins, mounts, pets, etc., all of which are great Real First Person Point of View (not tacky like Guild Wars 2's) Cash store that isn't filled with P2W items; all are cosmetic only with a few xp boosters and the like Each group role (tank, dps, heals) is extremely unique and quite different from other MMO's Extremely active community. Never empty zones or cities Holiday events In depth Housing System with plenty to choose from Animations are a bit rough Loading screens between zones, somewhat killing immersion No torches for exploration. A small one, but would personally love to have it Can't climb mountains No underwater exploration or swimming Pretty dull quests in the base game unless you listen to the NPC conversations. Better with DLC Immense amount of fog. Hopefully they will allow us to push it back in the future because you can't see much in the distance with it. The housing system still leaves much to be desired when compared to that of Wildstar or from what I've heard, Archeage. Plans for furniture are annoyingly hard to come by as are some of the materials to make them. It also doesn't give you too much to do in them other than a gold sink and maybe Guild Events. Hopefully they add more storage options in the future as many players are asking for.Bottom line, get the game. You won't be disappointed. It's quite low priced at the moment and can be found elsewhere for just as cheap when not on sale.NEW PLAYER TIPS: Start trait research on gear immediately, even if you don't plan to craft Check out addons. There are a ton of great ones out there at http://www.esoui.com/community.php Do NOT expect Skyrim. ESO is unique from that of Skyrim, just as Skyrim was unique from Oblivion, and Oblivion to Morrowind. They are each different and great in their own way. Embrace this and you'll have a great experience Go in with an open mind. This is an MMO first, Elder Scrolls game second, but only slightly. I think they hit a great balance Start your mount training immediately, even if you don't have a mount Save up your in-game gold to buy a horse or buy one from the Crown Store Follow conversations. The quests are pretty boring unless you know what you are doing and why by following the conversations with NPC's. They end up being amazing if you do. Keep up on the main story. Great story to be told along with gear and skill points Try to focus on one role and spec for awhile until you get enough skill points to expandEDIT: Okay, so apparently people can't read, so I'll lay this out as simple as I can.  I have been playing ESO since Closed Beta 2. This was with the standalone version (not through Steam) and therefore, Steam did not track the hours played. So yes, I have been playing for thousands of hours, but Steam shows much less than that. That's because I recently purchased it on Steam during the sale and linked my accounts, therefore, Steam now tracks the hours played, but not what I've played from the standalone version. How does that not make sense to some people?"
Positive,Ah it's pretty good but most of the dlcs are overpriced.
Positive,A decent way to kill time.
Positive,"TL;DR: There's a lot to enjoy if you're looking for a casual MMO, but emphasis on in-game gambling rewards and reliance on grinding doesn't bode well for the game's future, and the core player base is starting to feel the strain of it IMO. I believe these issues are fixable, but ZOS needs to listen to players to restore the morale. I don't ever really write reviews on Steam, however in the interest that this might help someone genuinely interested in giving this game a shot and the chance that ZOS might glance in this direction, I'm leaving my feedback as a player who has tried nearly every feature available in the game, even on a casual level. This is all written based on my own opinion and personal experience, so take from it what you will.An itemised list doesn't really feel like it can fully capture quite how I feel about this game anymore, because the issues that are plaguing it are breaching beyond simple gameplay issues. Yes, the game is riddled with a laundry list of issues that need ironing out - there's dozens of other reviews that detail a lot of them really well. Does that make it worth your time? I'd just say it's whatever you want to tolerate, because for every negative gameplay element I would also argue there are positive ones; the game can be at times, fun. There truly is a little something for everybody without being too hardcore compared to other MMOs, making the whole game easier to approach for many people.The brunt of my displeasure with this game stems from how ZOS has chosen to operate it as not a game with a community existing within it, but a vending machine. Over the last 3-4 years, the game has tended towards relying far too much on the in-game premium currency (Crowns) over delivering quality content within its chapter releases that you're already paying for ON TOP of the monthly subscription, if you're a subscriber (my opinion on the sub is ""ZOS please just make the crafting bag free for everyone, it's been 10 years after all"").The game just feels like a financial exchange now. When you log in, the first thing you are presented with is what's on sale in the Crown Store (the in-game shop) via an announcement window. No news about what's happening in the game, useful guides, patch notes, nothing. If you want anything like that you have to scroll through several pages of Crown Store ads, which insultingly tout the most expensive and flashy items one could get, but would also conveniently cost hundreds of real life dollars.I live in Canada. The highest amount of Crowns you can buy at one time is 21K for CDN $199.99, before tax. This means that at the cheapest a SINGLE crown is worth .01 cents (.009 rounded up). That might seem like a pittance, but when you have items in game that cost 14K Crowns (and sometimes more!) that means you're paying $140 for an in game item. These most expensive items are player homes, and completely optional to buy. Other items that would appeal to a larger group of people would be costumes, mounts, outfit styles, etc. They are all cosmetic and bare no real gameplay impact and can range in price from <1K Crowns to 3K+ Crowns ($30+).Weirdly enough, that above example is not what upsets me, because regardless of price you are getting exactly what you're expecting to pay for. It's the Crown Crates. They are in essence, gambling, and can cost up to $50 for a mere 15. You purchase a bunch of crates, and when you open them an invisible dice dictates what rewards you're going to get. These rewards are not curated (meaning you can get as many multiples as chance would have it), there is no special pricing for ESO+ subscribers, there is no way to choose what the top tier rewards are (if you're lucky enough to get it you still might not get what you really want, and there's no way to exchange them), they are loaded with useless filler crap, and most recently they are starting to lock additional visual features behind owning already top tier winnings (You need to own the ""Molag Bal Polymorph"" and the ""Shackled Titan Mount"" in order to see the full summoning animation of the mount; both of these rewards are the second-top tier and top-tier respectively, meaning your chances of earning even one is abysmally low). It's an inconsequential detail now, but a worrying sign that they're only going to continue that sort of thinking for future releases.There are technically free ways to earn some of these winnings in the game, but one is in the form of a laughable 'refund' when you get a duplicate item or choose to recycle eligible items (you get about 1/20 of the item's value in Gems, which are only earned through opening Crates) and the other is through grinding out menial, random tasks every single day/week for 255 days straight if you wanted to purchase the most expensive items (Going from minimum seals offered per day/week; 365x30=10950, 52x230=11960 | Total=22910/year; as far as I know that's the least amount you can earn. Top tier items cost 16k, next tier down is 8k). Having two different currencies makes it feel like they want saving money and time to be as annoying as possible in the hopes you'll drop another 50 bucks on crates.Is all of the above a completely optional part of the game? Absolutely! Nobody is forcing anyone to spend this ridiculous amount of time/money in the game just for some fancy aesthetic items you can apply to your characters. It wouldn't even really be an issue if it wasn't so obvious that ZOS was prioritising this premium content over what they're offering in the rest of the game, essentially supplementing a lack of effort.MMOs thrive off of player engagement, and the Crown Store should remain in the ""nice to have"" category, not the vending machine that's constantly peddled to you. This business issue (since the game is being run like a business, not a game at this point) is on top of the fact that you're simply getting less content for each chapter expansion. Slowly but surely things have become increasingly grindy and more tedious to earn, and the rewards for doing so are of poorer quality and harder to justify earning compared to older content in the game. There is such a difference at this point that you could literally compare older chapter releases to new ones and SEE how they're giving you less for your time played. The clothing motifs are lackluster (and less offered overall), the titles blaise, the main stories largely inconsequential, and once you complete story quests and grind all the achievements, there is no incentive to return to those areas unless they pump more consumable content into it. It's a self-destructive cycle of their own making at this point. There's basically no community in the game anymore, no social media influencers hyping it up, no meaningful goals to achieve ('why grind for this mid looking skin when I can buy a better looking one in the Store?') and overall the player base just feels burnt out. I don't know if ESO is dying, but the community certainly is. They're tired of being exploited, and it all stings a little harder when the zenith of it comes during the 10 year anniversary of this game, something that would have never happened without the loyal players they're trying to milk for cash now. In short, I would like to see ZOS stop commercialising the game to the extent they currently are, put more effort into rewarding players for their time/patronage, and re-vamp the base game content that hasn't been updated since launch to interest new players and give veterans something interesting to do. Even small changes can give people confidence, so I think treating the players a little better would go a long way."
Positive,"***DISCLAIMER: for those that believe they will like this game because they liked Skyrim, trust me it is not like Skyrim it is nothing like it do not go into this game expecting the same experience as Skyrim they are two very different types of games, and although i love both of them dearly if you want to appreciate this game you CANNOT go into it believing that this game will be like every other TES game, it is its own unique existence in the Elder Scrolls series. In addition to that, please be warned that this game is very large and i recommend that you download it through ZeniMax's official launcher from their website so that way if you want to refund it you wont have to have had so much time put into it from downloading it from steam's launcher :) ***Now to the review part:The game has tons of content it is great for group play and interacting with new people, there is a lot of fluidity in the roles meaning that no matter what class you play you can play almost any role which is great in an MMO.This game puts the whole MMO quest system on a spin as well since it is an Elder Scrolls game, this meaning that instead of some filler B.S. quests like kill 10 rats, crabs, wolves, etc. this game actually makes an attempt at a story. Is it the best story in the Elder Scrolls  series? Hell no it isn't, but hell it makes an attempt which is a farther step than most MMOs, the story is also interactive and imposes choices on the player like a typical Elder Scrolls game, however in the same sense these decisions do not make end-game changes, so the game is still able to progress wonderfully and remain lore friendly(to a degree, Dragon-Time Paradox's are a BITCH AmIRite?).Nitty-Gritty:Graphics: If you are coming to an MMO and expect jaw-dropping graphics then you might want to lower your expectations, however this game deos have some nice graphics for an MMO however if Graphics are really what matter to you here is a recently published fan-made overhaul that drastically improves the game's graphics: https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/5dvpes/pc_uber_fidelity_suite_for_the_elder_scrolls/ Music: decent, like other elder scrolls games puts you into the Fantasy setting properly :)Combat: The combat System in this game is like your typical MMO, press buttons to use abilities that consume resources, the unique thing in its combat is probably how you can use basic attacks to restore said resources, you know heavy and light attacks in Skyrim?Character Creation: Pretty solid overall, nothing too in depth, like black desert Online, but there is still enough to allow your inner creativity to shine through, whether it be making an irresistible hunk or a tall bald elven woman meant to be an ostrich.Skills Progression: This game put's a unique twist on skills with it's ""skill morphs"" and doest bind you to be forced using a specific weapon to do your role, i.e. you can tank and use a damn staff or dual blades, etc. And for those that remember the firghters guild and mages guild from prior games, good news for you! They are back and have their own skill lines and through being an active member in said guilds the more abilities you gain!Crafting: The crafting is nice and you dont have to pay to craft your things immediately like in other MMOs it is quick and concise and with a stream of addons you can easily improve your crafting experience! However, like in prior game you have to put forward the work in crafting; there isn't any of that craft 100 iron daggers B.S. to have lvl 100 blacksmithing. to increase your standing it takes time and resources.Group-Content: This game provides a TON of group content with dungeons(4-man activities), trials(12-man activites), and just overall anything you can think of for the most part can be done with a buddy!Community & Support: The support team for this game is not the best I will certainly stand by that it is not as prominent as it once was and that is a problem. The community for this game though is great! It is helpful and kind, for the most part, and it is supre easy to make friends in! And it has a wonderful Addon community, though not through Steam so you have to actually install the addons yourself(it isnt that big of a deal :p).Story and Lore: Like I said prior, the game makes a damn good college try for a story, it just isnt the best in general, but for an MMO it is pretty good, the game does also incorporate a lot of TES lore into it and incorporates it in things you may not expect i.e. expect to see a few daedric princes you've seen in prior elder scrolls games to reappear and also relics like the staff of Magnus. DLC and in-game store content: This game does indeed have dlc however, the dlc is not absolutely necessary, meaning you do not need it to fully experience the game since, as stated prior, there is a ton of content in the base game. There is also a subscription item the YOU have to choice of buying, the game in no way forces you to buy it however it is a nice service and it does incentivise you to buy it since it doe s offfer a lot for a montly subscription(and in reality you are paying for the 1500 crowns a month it comes with mainly). This game overall however is by no means pay to win and offers all players means to get good; irregardless of what one buys in the in-game cash shop. Overall, I'd give the game a sold 82/100 it does it's job well with some minor flaws here and there but there isnt anything too terrible about it and it provides hundreds of hours of play time!"
Positive,"BUY THE GAME ELSEWHERE!The game is awesome, lots of solo content (which I love, haven't even started properly with the multiplayer parts) and it really have the elder scrolls feel to it. However do NOT buy it on steam! There are reoccurring issues with the login via steam (and you can't go around it if you bought the game the past year). Buy it on their website or something, just not steam. I wish someone would've told me about this when I was buying the game. T_TA sample from Bethesda Support's twitter:⚠️We are currently investigating issues some Steam users are having regarding logging into the @TESOnline PC/Mac megaservers. #ESO"
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online is the best “buy to play” MMO’s that I have. I played it back when it first came out back in April of 2014 when it was a train wreck and was “pay to play”. I’m not going to go into details yet but trust me when I say it was not worth the monthly subscription. However, with many updates and patches the game has made huge leaps to a more entertaining and Elder Scrolls lore friendly game. ESO was a monthly subscription game but is now a standard one payment. BOT control and restrictions. Back in the day BOT’s where everywhere and they would steal loot from your kills and teleport to resource points. Basically this is what really killed the game for me back in 2014. Now I have not seen a single BOT in-game. Area restrictions, ungodly dungeon wait times, and gathering the right resources are no longer a thing in the newest 12 patches’ named “One Tamriel”. It used to be that every area had the basic level restrictions, with specific resources only found in that area, and dungeon groups where slapped together based off of player level which lead to huge wait times. Everything is now scaled to roughly the players level. This also scales your resources to what you should need at your level this includes other players. Making everyone equal in terms of level but not in terms of gear and Champion level skills. It effectively takes care of any wait times in dungeons and having to go back to an area to hunt a resource.  Mod support is still going strong. There are not a lot of mods but what is there is very useful. The download sizes is HUGE, like 200gb huge once all the updates are applied the actual size is closer to the 85gb specified on the store page. Don’t get me wrong the landscape is B-E-A-utiful and everyone has been voiced but that initial download is a beast all on its own. If you want to sell to other players, there are only two ways to do so. 1: You have to be in a guild and you can only post items through the guild vender. The guild vender is a NPC in game that stays in one location. This is problematic because the vender could be on the other side of Tamriel from you or in a DLC. 2: you can try to sell with the chat box but results may vary. You can still sell things to any NCP shop but you will get pennies selling that way. The DLC and generally all items in the official store page of ESO are very pricy. I Would wait till they go on sale to buy them because not only are they cheaper but they also try to bundle them with other DLC or usable items.   The verity of the things you can make is limited in how they look. Most of the cool and exotic skins for weapons and armor you can’t learn until that skill is maxed. It just makes this gap where all the sudden you can create weapons and armor that are made out of different materials with different strengths but they look exactly the same, it’s not aesthetically pleasing.The game is gorgeous and game play is almost identical to other Elder Scrolls games. The community is very involved in almost every aspects of the game. There are specialized guilds such as those that do only PvE and PvP but also those like mine that are part of a threesome of guilds that primarily are merchants and make a verity of things from bulk orders to custom orders for the PvE and PvP guilds.  The level cap is 50 but once that is reached you start earning champion level and unlock entirely new skill trees. I have found that the game is more fun after you reach the cap because some of the champion skill trees give you a land slide of an advantage in battle. Battle itself is a challenge because like most of the Elder Scrolls games not everything works on every enemy. Making your skill planning more relevant to fit your battling style. The game is solid and I have loads of fun playing it and I plan on playing it for a long time and that is something because I usually do not stick with MMO’s for long."
Positive,"I bought this game during the summer sale 2017 and this is prolly the greatest buy ever. In the last 5 days. I have completely stopped playing all others game just to spend time in this. 47.6 hours and I have no idea what the hell I'm doing so far. I've been doing some quests which I have no idea if it's main quest or not. I joined Dark Brotherhood and been sending bodies to Sithis -> HAIL SITHIS! WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS GAME:- OPEN WORLD -> Literally you can do what ever the fck you want in here. So far in my opinion you don't really have to follow the quest. I've been enjoying the game by just going around explore and killing NPCs . . .- ABSOLUTE AMAZING OST/VOICING -> Jfc, I feel like they put 90% of their budget in this area. EVERY SINGLE FCKING QUEST AND DIALOGUES ARE VOICED WHAT THE FCK! Holy shjt even just a normal conversation with NPC. EVERYTHING is voiced. Moreover, when I'm tired of playing, I don't even need to quit the game. All I did was pretty much sit in some corner that has NPC playing instrument and enjoy my time. The musics in ESO are so great. From OST to just some songs that NPC singing. It's so amazing. I really really really love this area.- COMBAT SYSTEM -> I would say it's great. Dodge/Block/Attack aiming combat system, I've always like these kind. If you played Black Desert Online before, ESO does require a bit more of aiming. SKILLS TREE -> You can combine and create your own skill set and it's VERY VERY abundant (is it a good word? idk sr). There are so many way you can build your skill set without much of restriction. - GRAPHIC -> I do enjoy the world design and monsters design. Also the skills animation and effect. It's very beautiful in my opinion -> Though I don't really like character design, 7/10 in my score. It's not that bad, just my personal taste, don't pay much attention to this.- STORIES -> OF COURSE, 47.6 hours is NOTHING you know, compare to players who spent thousands of hours. BUT I believe I can say, as expected from Bethesda and Skyrim series. These stories are AMAZING, side quest, guild quest, main quest, they are all so unique in their own ways and it's just great. It's really hard to get boring of enjoying the quests in ESO. -> Unless you get bored by running so far without mount . . WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE FUTURE:- FLY / DIVE / SAIL -> There is a vast ocean and sky that can be take advantage off. Since this is an open world MMORPG, I really wish to see these features get in the game. Though I think at this point it's kind of hard to bring it in the game. But again, this is just my hope. - CLIMB OVER OBJECTS -> You know that feeling when you underwater and you wanna climb up on the dock but your jump is too short so you can't jump over it? It must be GREAT if the character can grab to the dock edge and climb up. You know what I mean? [That's all I can give so far. Since I haven't played much myself.

Positive,"First time player in 2021 review:+ surprisingly great loot grinding rpg with 100s of hours of content+ story, voice acting and score are all bangers+ addon and controller support+ much of what is in the store can be earned in-game- at the start of the game you are not given much direction and can do whatever you want. this is cool but if you want to play the story you're kinda left to guides- casual group content can be marred by a limited grouping system- almost every in-game problem can be solved with a trip to the crown storeTo quote a friend I converted to this game: ""I play RPGs to get away from people not interact with them. This game is great in spite of what it is.""~~~~1000hr update~~~~~- overland content is a pointless chore once you are at a basic CP level. so many well designed areas, quests and delves ruined by content not scaling with the player. seriously, none of it is enjoyable anymore. exploring caves and delves should totally rule but they totally don't. such a giant waste of player and developer time.  i read of some people keeping a garbage loadout or just using their fists to try and make it enjoyable but why would i do that? i grinded my arse off for perfected gear so challenge me with exploration and adventure not with mental gymnastics justifying  why i should play. its sad when genshin impact of all things treats its players with more respect."
Positive,3000+ hoursAlmost all quests are unique with story definitely not a game built on redoing the same kill 100 enemies sort of quests. Im still not done with all the content offered so yea... shows you how much there is to play.
Positive,This is easily the best MMO you can play like a single player game. I'm doing everything solo and I'm enjoying every second. It feels like there's years worth of content in the game.
Positive,This game ruined all other MMOs and the single player Elder Scrolls games for me.  It's ESO or nothing.

Positive,"whatever your game style of play this has it all .. full of questing which you can do solo or in a group .. hours after hours of creative stories .. characters to love and hate .. monsters which of course you need to kill .. 4 person and 12  person dungeons and trials .. solo delves (like a very mini dungeon) .. pvp areas (3 in total) you have cyrodiil which big groups use seige weapons to knock down walls and turn flags to make the keeps/castles/forts their own .. Imperial city/sewers which you fight opposing factions as well as npc monsters ,,Battlegrounds which are 4x4x4 battles with different targets to achieveIf you like the creative side of games it also has crafting with being able to furnish your own houses (which you can unlock or buy with in game gold or crowns) only your own imagination holding you back on how your furnish them (and finding the patterns you want) I have played over 9,000 hours and still have not yet completed every zone on one single character (I get sidetracked to doing other stuff very easily) you are able to make 9 characters (more if you buy more character slots) so it's very easy to start up another way of fighting with another characteryes this game has some glitches and bugs and some are really amusing (like running on top of your mount) while others are totally annoying   all in all whether you like chilling out following quests or going in for a full on pvp fight I highly recommend this game"
Positive,"I saw recently that the reviews for ESO were mixed. So just curious, I scrolled through and read the negative reviews. Each and every single one was written by someone who had  not played the game for more than a couple hours, didnt understand game mechanics or were just straight up wrong. ESO has a lot of depth and doesn't necessarily show a new player all the ropes I get that, but far more so than a game like EVE. I personally  intend to cross the two thousand hour mark on this game and keep playing. Ive got more than a  hundred games in my library and none of them have provided me this much game time. Love it, it surpasses the other MMO's currently out there and it definitely worth playing. My ingame name is @yonderer, would love to help anyone with questions. Hopefully see you on the battlefields of Tamriel."
Positive,"In a lot of ways, ESO is the worst kind of modern MMO. It's an easy rollercoaster ride through poorly written and incredibly shallow storylines, that trivialiizes away almost all of the content in the game, and mostly relies on a endorphin treadmill to keep people engaged. And yet if you approach it just as a b tier story based RPG, there is so much content here that it's easy to get a lot of enjoyment, and the fact it's all basically free makes it even more easy to recommend. Keep in mind though that the game completely botched its switch to a 'do anything anytime' model, and there's no in game way to actually play through its content chronologically. So if you want everything to actually make sense, you'll need to follow and online guide and play the quests in the right order, otherwise you'll be wondering why one quest is having you searching for a lost character, while another quest in the same area is literally being guided by the same character. All in all, it's a fun game when you can overcome it's shortcomings, and don't expect a real MMO experience of growth, challenge and grouping."
Positive,"With 750 Hrs on this game, I can tell you this game is my 2nd favorite game (Skyrim is my 1st). What really makes this game great is to play with friends, I have played with my high school friend for 3 years on this game and we do take breaks from time to time but we constantly find ourselves coming back to this amazing game. If you are not having fun, play with friends, make friends, 98% of the ESO community are kind, all you need to do is reach out to a guild and join there discord. 100% recommend this game. Tip: Play your class, every class is good and all of the weapons are good, play what you like and have fun with. That is the purpose of all games, to have fun."
Positive,"This game is so much wonderful story that you can't finish just in a year, I guess. This game has improve my English so much and my listening skills too. (I am not a good in English tho~!). I have so many new friend in this game from all over the world. You will never regret playing this game. Thanks to developer for making this game for us.."
Positive,"Look... I played this game during beta and a couple of months after release. It sucked back then. Now they've resolved almost all of the bugs, and the game is pretty well-balanced. I can easily recommend ESO: Tamriel Unlimited these days. More people ought to get back into it. This is the future of MMoRPGs. I like it a *lot*(I am not being paid by anyone to make this review.)"
Positive,"Yup. It's an MMO, an automatic time-suck as most MMO's tend to have the power to do.The ups(for me): The music is fantastic, the zones are beautiful, the urge to be  a non-stop klepto is satisfied, and you'll never run out of things to do.The downs(for me): The combat system feels unresponsive when triggering moves to get out of aoe, or firing spells. The servers have a tendency to randomly drop(though their twitter is good at updating if there's going to be unforseen downtime) Load times are LONG unless you've got it on an SSD.Other related thoughts and things to consider:       For me, leveling has been a slow process, so if you get distracted easily by ""Hey what's that thing over there..."" expect to take your time reaching cap. Dungeons can be both interesting and frustrating depending if you've got people who are nice or nitwits.       Player Housing!!(This addition was a big reason why I chose to play ESO after being on an MMO merry-go-round.) It's instanced, so you're not fighting for plots. Housing is expensive, especially coming in as a new player, though they do give you a free Inn room you quest for that you just stuff full of fish and paintings. There is an option to buy homes, and furnishings in the Crown Store(ESO's cash shop) There are definitely some cash-grab items in there which I think, for vanity's sake.. are overpriced.         That said though, the items therein are for vanity and not going to be one of those pay to win scenarios.One last note, this game is completely playable without the need for a subscription, however if you do tend to pick up everything and horde, an ESO plus subscription may be for you, as it offers a bottomless craft bag, which holds all of your materials.Oh! If you are a roleplayer, the roleplaying community is pretty active, but don't expect to find it everywhere, ie the cities, Inn's etc as they can get instanced. Sometimes you will stumble into it, but your best bet to make contacts if guilds aren't being advertised in zone chat, is eso-rp.com."
Positive,"Welcome to Elder scrolls online.. The game IS NOT SKYRIM 2! The game is UNIQUE and EPIC!I was playing skyrim for 2-3 years and a lot of another MMORPG games, but I can definitelly say, THIS game is PERFECT. You are new player? NO PROBLEM! Game will teach you all you need to know!You want to play any way you have on mind? NO WORRIES! This game has fantastic freedom! You like questing? OK! Questing is lot of fun and there is an very interesting lore! You hate questing? OK! There is HELLA lot of ways to level up! Dungeons, world bosses, PVP, dolmens, delves, public dungeons, exploring, EVEN OPENING CHESTS will give you experience!Yea.. this game has very very bad past. At launch it was terrible and almost unplayable. BUT THAT TIMES ARE GONE, now, it is time for TAMRIEL ONE!The game changed so much things since launch and there is no doubt that it is one of best MMORPG games on the current scene now! Lot of palyers everywhere, no toxic community, helpful guildmates, interesting graphic..If you are not sure if you want to buy it or not.. I was also not sure.. But I bought it after Tamriel One patch and.. I AM SURPRISED how good the game is! I dont regret single cent I paid for this game! It is worth the money...Also, housing comming out soon, be ready!Buy it now or regret your decision forever :)"
Positive,"One of the best MMOs, period. Years ago, I played hundreds of hours of ESO on XBOX. After trying New World, I longed for a similar game where your character knew what swimming was and understood the concept of using your feet to run. So thanks to NW for getting me back into ESO. Pros:- Combat is fast, fun, and engaging. - The game world is vast and beautiful with a delightful variety of locations and creature types- Satisfying character builds with tons of potential configurations- Interesting and varied quests tell stories instead of just having you gather X items or kill X enemies.- Solid gathering and crafting features. - All the fun of an Elder Scrolls game and then some- Your character knows how to run (unlike New World)- Your character understands what swimming is (unlike New World)- Your character can ride horses and other mounts (unlike New World)Cons:- Combat in the open world areas isn't very challenging. I can crush most enemies with just one ability even as a glass cannon. It feels like playing Diablo 3 when you're right on the verge of needing to up the difficulty level. It's still enjoyable unless you're really looking for a challenge. - Some NPCs do not maintain continuity when you encounter them during different quests. This is a small gripe imho but still something that would be awesome to see improvements on."
Positive,"It's alright, I guess"
Positive,Love it play everyday.
Positive,"Can you believe it? Dragons! In your own homeland! What are you going to do?This one does not know, but he hopes his family is safe in Riverhold."
Positive,"i decide to buy this because im a fan of elder scrolls, and its a good game but im will dont pay for dlcs above the price of a 7-year-old game plus 55 R$(12$) in a garbage monthly fee to have space in my inventory"
Positive,"I play since launch and now when Elder Scrolls Online drops subscription is good time to buy ESO or back if you already have it.Keep it in mind this is not Skyrim Online is MMO in Elder Scrolls Lore.After year this game change a lot. Zenimax fix a lot of bug and start listen the community.They add justice system and is awesome you can now steal and kill NPC.The graphic is not like in Skyrim but is still quite beautiful and is well optimized. Quests are well written, the combat feels good. PvP is a little unbalanced but is fun.I would recommend this game to all Elder Scrolls Lore fans."
Positive,"As the guild leader of a werewolf community on EU and an old school elder scrolls player (Played since Arena first came out), i probably have a slightly biased opinion of the game but it I believe it to be an excellent. The graphics are beautiful (I seem to screen shot alot in this game and never really do it). The game play is fresh, and playing as a werewolf is totally fun .The DLC is not required but supplement the game beautifully. The Morrrowind chapter is a nostalgia trip to any players of Morrowind way back when.PvP is fun (albeit sometimes a pain the ass). And even running as part of the zerg in Cyrodil is enjoyable (Something I hateed in WvWvW in guild wars 2). With the Morrowind chapter you get battlegrounds, fun little 15 minute matches where you play 4v4v4 and even someone like me has a blast in it. (They even designed a gear set for my style *cough cough* Cowards Gear Set *cough cough*).PvE is excellent, a little something for everyone, normal dungeons if your a little more casual about the whole thing, veterans for people working their way higher. Trials and upwards for those players (not like me) who want to push it to the max. Questing and exploration is great, and very rewarding. Finding skyshards and lorebooks is fun and you want to do it because they grant you skill points and mages guild experience. (Not to mention, fishing, dolmens, world bosses, delves etc.)RP is there in the game, this is something my guild has just started, much to my enjoyment because I used to be part of a thriving RP community in World of Warcraft (And thankfully not the toxic AD community).As a recap, if you love Elder Scrolls, pick it up. Love MMOs, this is a different take on them, pick it up. If you are on EU and want a fun community to help you along and want to join our werewolf army, find me in game (@Seribii).The game is an excellent love letter to the elder scrolls games and will keep you opccupied until Bethesda announce they are going to release a Skyrim port for your cat or something."
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online or ESO is an MMO from the game series Elder Scrolls. If you haven't played a MMO but have played other Elder Scroll games just know that this is a tad bit different than what you are use to. Now if you are a MMO player but never have played Elder Scrolls then you will have no problem picking things up and noticing the beauty in the game. ESO did have a big flop upon release but that's because it was a unfinished game. The game was not polished or optimized, bugs everywhere very limited content. Now, the wonderful world of Tamriel is a marvelous place to explore and have many adventures. From Trading and selling within guilds to conquering dungeons and trials. The game keeps growing in content, convenience and community. Improvements are constantly being made. Elder Scrolls lore is fantastic and ESO brings all that is expected to the table. Economy in ESO is unlike most MMO's, there is no one Auction House but guilds bid on Guild Traders making guilds more of an importance than just a group of friends. The Dungeons in ESO will blow any other MMO dungeons out the water. From the immersive  combat and flexibility of classes to the mechanics of each boss fight to the most detailed architecture in each dungeon... did I mention the lore ? Yes, their are still some problems with the game like slow falls, farming bots, falling through the game, maybe a quest bug here and there but nothing that makes the game unbearable to play and enjoy. This game is one of the best games I've played in my life lol. I'm nervous about doing this review because I can't say enough about the game. I play this game faithful and religiously, I'm a guild leader and play this game with a passion! If you are looking for a new MMO to enjoy or never played an MMO and wanting to try one, this is it. I give this game a 10 out of 10. This one will see you in Tamriel! -Choo"
Positive,It's alright. You can buy base game for cheap and then buy like 1 month of sub and cancel it and boom you can enjoy everything the game has to offer. (or end up buying things separately losing more money)So either beat base content first and then focus on dlc stuff or do whatever you like you can do scrap n pieces of everything. World scales to you so you choose your adventure.
Positive,"After 5,000 hours on the official platform I can say that:- I bought all the dlcs without any real money put into the game;- I did level cp 1800 without a specific purpose, I didn't farm and I didn't do something forced on the game, I just had fun;- I made hundreds of friends on the game who helped me and whom I also help (Cons, I didn't find many male friends);- The game has a very good story with thousands of quests that are not similar, the quests give you nice rewards;-F2P. The game is free to play, meaning with the game currency you can buy the site's currency, on the site you only have customizable and the game currency is relatively easy, at a level of 400 you make around 300k gold per hour. I had about 90 million coins in the game;- There are about 40 maps, one ESO map is almost the same as the whole map in the BDO or NW game;- There are about 2,000 different mounts on the game, from ice mounts, fire mounts, void mounts, lightning mounts to cats, and adorable mounts. These mounts are just skins, so they don't give you an advantage, it's just about appearance;- Skins and customizable on the game are hundreds of thousands, I personally have 50 skins, around 3,000 skin parts like chest, lava helmet, lightning bow, void staff etc;- You can stay in 5 guilds at the same time so you can have several groups of friends, in a guild there are around 500 players;- There are around 2,000 different dungeons, from simple delve, to veteran dungeons or veteran trials (Personally in 3 years I haven't been able to finish them all);- The house system includes around 10,000 different pieces of furniture, most of them are craftable and others are disposable;- As houses there are around over 50, but a house can be like a map, you can write on youtube ""Grand Psijic Villa"", it is not the most beautiful but there are too many to write them all;- There are thousands of different end game sets, so there is no best set, everyone can create their own style of play and their own combinations;- There are around 500 slotted skills so there are thousands of different combinations. If you prefer to spit fire to attack, the other may prefer to throw fire from his hands;- There is too much to say, there is content for crafting, fishing, digging (meaning you have a shovel and looking for treasures), mining, stealing (breaking houses and stealing jewelry and much more);- PVP system It has more cons than pros, because it's very complex, there are too many sets and the balance is made monthly but it's still not perfect, it's just like the League of Legends game where the characters are not very well balanced. You can do pvp anywhere by duel but people do pvp in special pvp maps, Cyrodiil and Imperial City, or in arenas. The Cyrodiil pvp map is huge, if you don't grow your horse you have to walk straight in front of it for about 20 minutes. In Cyrodiil the pvp system is to smash castles with different tools like catapults, but to conquer different strategy points, Cyrodiil is strategy, instead Imperial City is more than 1v1,1vx pvp because it has a channel area and a surface area, the size is 5% of the Cyrodiil map, but it takes longer to walk through it because you can't use the mount.In conclusionThe game has no specific purpose, it does not force you to do something specific. There is no main content, there is content for questing, pvp, pve, housing, stealing, looting, crafting, but they do not combine, you do not need one to make another as in other games. So you don't have to waste time on this game, you just need to have fun.You can play the game alone or with friends.The game is f2p from all points of view, you can only buy skins.It's a great game.My game name @uzw"
Positive,This game is holding me hostage.
Positive,"The game had a rough launch but has improved massively since,and is definitely a lot better.Now Is there a subscription ?Yes but it is NOT required to play you can get everything ingame WITHOUT it,but it gives you a infinite materials bag (extremely useful) some crowns daily (premium currency) and some other grind helping stuffIf you're looking for a WOW replacement i'd say this is quite close,there are difference's like pets and mounts work differently for example you can't tame any pets from the wild you either purchase them using premium currency or do a quest for them and there aren't as many of them either similar goes for mounts,but you get a lot better graphics and A LOT more to do,as it doesn't get repetitive ,and i'd say it just has a nicer feel to it and a lot of other things aswell.In my opinion this is better then WOW ,it has better gameplay and the story is on par with WOW or its even better.Doesn't have a needed sub,and just overall feels better.Also inventory management will be the BIGGEST pain in you're fucking ass.unless you get the sub.Let me explain further.When you reach a middle level lets say around 30 you might gain the interest in gold or just know a way to farm it.Well from what ive learned its WRITS.Writs are like daily quests which are in every major city they tell you to go craft things (Potions,Gear,Jewerly,Food,Glyphs) Blah blah to craft these you will need the materials,and OH BOY there are A LOT of fucking materials in the game.Now of course you can buy them off from somebody els,but if you want the maximum profit you really want to just have them.Now its not hard to farm these materials you can find them everywhere and there are plenty of addons to make it a lot easier,but you're inventory will be fucking filled like the planes filled the twin towers in 9/11,and honestly i get it they want people to get the sub,but this is absolutely ridiculous.By the time you farm enough to finish all of you're daily writs the next day you might want to do some more,but WAIT there absolutely different materials or recipes that you dont know so again.You go out and find them all which of course isnt hard at all,however,at some point in you gathering adventure you're inventory will be filled with only materials and you will struggle to gather new materials for new writs.This is a MASSIVE downside to this game if you dont want to buy the sub,However,you can do one thing witch is to upgrade you're inventory space.You can upgrade it at a pack merchant,however,this costs gold and were back at the problem.Because everytime you upgrade (by 10 slots) it gets more expensive,and after a couple of upgrades you will not have enough and the prices will be quite high,and EVEN with a bunch of upgrade YOU WILL NOT HAVE ENOUGH fucking SPACE.Now is this a game breaker NO.Is it annoying ? YES (If you want gold) you want to buy a fucking wig so you dont pull out all of you're hairAnd of course there are other ways but the most effective in my opinion are materials not just because of writs you have a couple of options with themA) WritsB) sell the materials to playersC) Process them (extract) For a chance of very rare items droppingD) prob more that i dont know of but most likely not as effective as the othersScore:☐ You forget what reality is☑ Beautiful On ultra                    (perhaps some extra mods)☐ Good ☐ Decent☐ Bad☐ Don‘t look too long at it☐ Paint.exe---{Gameplay}---☐ Very good☑ Good☐ It‘s just gameplay☐ Mehh☐ Starring at walls is better☐ Just don‘t---{Audio}---☐ Eargasm☐ Very good☑ Good☐ Not too bad☐ Bad☐ Earrape---{Audience}---☐ Kids☑ Teens☑ Adults☐ Human---{PC Requirements}---☐ Check if you can run paint☑ Potato (to play)☐ Decent☑ Fast (On ultra)☐ Rich boiiiiii☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer---{Difficulity}---☐ Just press ‚A‘☐ Easy☑ Significant brain usage☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master☐ Difficult☐ Dark Souls---{Grind}---☐ Nothing to grind☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks☐ Isnt necessary to ☑ Average grind level☐ Too much grind☐ You‘ll need a second live for grinding---{Story}---☐ Story?☐ Text or Audio floating around☐ Average☐ Good☑ Fantastic☐ It‘ll replace your life---{Game Time}---☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee☐ Short☐ Average☑ Long☐ To infinity and beyond---{Price}---☐ It’s free!☑ Worth the price☐ If u have some spare money left☐ Not recommended☐ You could also just burn your money---{Bugs}---☑ Never heard of☐ Minor bugs☐ Can get annoying☐ ARK: Survival Evolved☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs---{Annoyingness}---☐ Never annoyed☐ mildly infuriating ☐ can get annoying☐ 9/11☑ Going baldFinal verdict: 7,5/10 hope this review helped you somewhat decide if this game is worth you're money."
Positive,The sewers are full of smelly rat
Positive,"So far, literally the only thing i dislike about this game, the VERY limited bag space if you dont buy the monthly ESO Plus subscription. Items pile up so fast :("
Positive,-A girl asks me to talk to her dead boyfriend ghost-The ghost boyfriend tells me that he never loved her-I tell her the truth-She runs away-A few minutes later I found her ghost crying10/10 Best game ever
Positive,"I am rating this game as a Single Player who loved playing Skyrim and honors the lore of Elder Scrolls.So if you liked Skyrim you get a lot of it in this entry. You can totally play this game solo, where you have all the main quests and tons of side quests, I would say mostly in a quality similiar to Skyrim. Also, when you wander through all the parts of Tamriel you really get to know a lot of lore about this universe.Leveling up just happens all in the right intervalls. So thats the good news.Anyway you can't overlook that this game is an MMO.So a lot of game mechanics are adjusted to fit this genre and as a solo player experience it makes you suffer.What are the negative aspects affecting you as a solo player:1. respawning enemies - where in Skyrim when you finished a dungeon or area you could easily walk everywhere - now the respawn rates are sometimes insane: when you finish a dungeon and you have to backtrack, you almost certainly fight the same foes over again - good thing is you can increase your walking and horse riding speed so you will be able to just run through these hordes most of the time.2. a little bit tedious fight mechanics - since its an MMO and everything has to be balanced, there is no exploit build, so mostly you will have 5-10 abilities you are using over and over again - that pairs badly with the respawn mechanic3. Crowded places: especially in the base game areas you will find a lot of other human players who are running, wearing ""funny"" hats, or jump around which can break the immersion from time to time. Also they will interfere with some of your quests which make them less enjoyable. In addition it can happen if there are too many players at a boss fight, not everone will get its share of the loot.On the other hand the other players make the world more vivid and they often help you in edgy fights.Moreover it's not that big of a deal of you play in a DLC area where are not so many people mingling.To conclude it's a really good game if you want to dive into another Elder Scrolls adventure solo handed and you are done with Skyrim.As usual, Bethesda is pretty fair with pay model, since you get a lot of stuff for free on daily log in, and the base game provides trillions of playtime. If you are more into it, I really can recommand ESO Plus since you get access to all DLC areas (which are about 20 or so), while also getting ingame Currency equal to the paid amount. meaning after three months of paying, you can also purchase one of the bigger DLC's ""for free"" and you can stop ESO Plus."
Positive,"During its one and a half years of existence, this game has drastically improved.It got a lot of hate online, mostly from players who tested it during the free Beta, and when I tried it during the beta, I didn't pick it up afterwards either. But now, you don't need a subscription to play, and the steady updates made the game much more enjoyable.I've been playing on a non-steam version for a while, before I picked it up on Steam.Here's a list of what are, in my opinion, the pros and cons of the game:Pros:+Huge hand crafted map, way bigger than any previous Elder Scrolls+Lots of side quests and NPCs interactions+Solo player friendly: if you don't like MMOs, it's fine, just play on your own for a classic Elder Scrolls experience+The PvP system is really well made : fight for your faction in a huge open map, take the enemy forts and scrolls to bring victory to your cause!+Fair microtransaction system: you don't need to buy costumes or mounts : you can get some by playing the game+The crafting and motif system is great : you can craft powerful AND beautiful armors and weapons, and choose their appearance+The game is absolutely gorgeous, the landscapes are breathtaking+The soundtrack is as good as ever+Curiosity is rewarding: there's a lot of thing you can find if you take the time to explore everything+Modding is really easy: there's a lot of mod to improve the UI, the map, etc... (to start modding, you can go on ESOUI, or download Minion, a modding client for ESO+The DLC are really complete, Orsinium gives you access to a whole new zone with its own main and side quests+You can now freely travel Tamriel with all of your characters!+The lore, as always, is great. You get to play in an era never explored in an Elder Scrolls before+Forky's back!Cons:-It's a MMO, so there's a class system, which can be a little restrictive, but joining NPC guilds and groups can give you acces to new skill branches, so you can work around it-The game is not optimized for high end graphic cards, so you might experience lower FPS than you would expect-The voice acting gets a little redundant: after a while, you start recognizing the same voices-The NPCs animation are a little stiff-I didn't enjoy the main quest a lot, but I didn't enjoy it in Oblivion and Skyrim either, and you can just ignore it-Heavily populated PvP campaign can get guite laggy-This game involves cheese, stay away if you do not like fondueTo conclude, a tip to enjoy this game is to play it without trying to level-grind or optimize your characters: everything is viable, you can play anything from khajiit stealth archer to orc mage until you get to endgame, so just try to have fun!"
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is an interesting game; it somehow manages to follow the same design as its predecessors while playing just like a classic MMO.I bought ESO hoping for a Skyrim / Oblivion / Morrowind style game, I wasn't disappointed, despite it heavily being an MMORPG game, it still brings back a lot from the single player RPGs, like a similar levelling system or a focus on creating an effective class. However, I think that the MMO aspect of this game does bring it down, as it often results in unnecessary restrictions that wouldn't need to be there if it were single player, such as invincible city guards, so that high level players aren't constantly killing them, or having to destroy items instead of dropping them so other players can't pick them up and trade / sell them. Generally, I think that ESO would be much more fun as a single player game with the whole of Tamriel instead of one segment like the other games.Also, I have a problem with the way Cyrodiil was handled, as it was made into the only PvP zone in the game. I can understand that they needed a PvP zone in a game like this, however, they didn't need to make it Cyrodiil, which I find be undoubtedly my favourite province in Tamriel, with its huge diversity in landscapes, dungeons and architecture; it's a really shame it was intended for PvP, as it would have so much potential as a PvE province, especially the Imperial City. Also, because it's PvP, it makes exploring and questing difficult, because if you meet someone from a different alliance who is a higher level than you, you will die, and then have to walk miles to follow the seemingly endless quest marker as they made the province larger to cater for the PvP than it was in Oblivion. Finally about Cyrodiil, they missed out three major cities from Oblivion Bravil, Leyawiin, and Skingrad, which are some of the most interesting if you ask me, and I would like to see them re-introduced.Finally, the last issue I have with ESO is the ridiculous amount of micro-transactions. They are everywhere, asking you to buy this buy that, when really it should come with the base game. ""Tamriel Unlimited"" sounds like you can go wherever you want in Tamriel, however is it NOT the case at all. Only eastern Skyrim is available, there are only a few parts of Hammerfell, High Rock I believe is complete, but some parts require DLC, There is only a tiny island for Elswyer, Black Marsh is pretty much all incomplete, the part of Morrowind that comes with the base game is tiny, you have to pay to go to Vvardenfell, and the entirity of eastern Morrowind doesn't even exist, and then there's the DLC, The Imperial City, Gold Coast, Hew's Bane, Summerset, Vvardenfell, Wrothgar / Orsinium etc. all require you to buy DLC, which is just absurd. Also, they use a paid in game currency, which just never works.Despite ESO not being a flawless game, it is still a lot of fun to play, even though it can be quite difficult to get in to, with its very hard dungeons and MMO focus. But all in all, I would recommend this game."

Positive,"I came into ESO with the mindset that it would be like Skyrim because friends kept describing it as ""Skyrim but an MMO"" and I kept thinking I wouldn't like the game because I didn't care for Skyrim. Do not go into this thinking its anything remotely like Skyrim. It may share some similarities but those similarities are shared between all of the TES games that are on the Gamebryo engine, but that's where any real similarities end. The game tries to merge lore from every TES game out there and I think it does it fairly well.While there is a class system, it's just a loose class system and I appreciate that you can really customize your skills to suit your playstyle. I enjoy that every zone scales to your level so you can quest anywhere you like. There is no xp loss/leaching nor loot loss when you join a fight being engaged by another player, nor is there one when someone joins your fight with a mob/mobs.  And best of all? It seems like the developers are actually engaging with the community in regards to feedback and are adding new content, fun little events, and updating the item store frequently- leading you to want to buy stuff.And then there's player housing, that you can decorate with items you can craft, or with items you can buy.  That's a big appeal for me in regards to this game."
Positive,"I'll say buy it if on sale, if you can get it on sale for at least half price is completetly worth it. I love it for the price that I payed.If you like MMORPG you enjoy this game a lot, it got a lot of content to explore and the PvP is great. Do not buy it expecting to be an elders scrolls sngle player game, because its not. Buy expecting to be a MMORPG in the elders scroll universe.Its buy to play now so you dont need a subcribtion to play each month. Just the one time purchase and is not pay to win. Also most importantly the game feel alive with the amount of players running around.once again buy it if its on sale, because a mmorpg is not for everyone."
Positive,"It has always been a fantasy to be able to visit and explore all the worlds of Tamriel in 1 game and also to be able to do this online.Despite this feature in ESO, it is not exactly open world based but instead the zones of the different provinces are divided into areas accessible via transportation options in the game, these areas come in all sizes and some are very wide,so the adventurous feeling we are used to from the elder scrolls single player games is still present in ESO.Each zone in the game also has its own unique story that you can follow alone or with other players.In addition to other players, you can also be accompanied by a pet, and this is also very often seen when you cross other players which makes it even more fun to watch other players, there are many different pets to choose from, well known such as a dog and then also a lot of fantasy animals.I don't have a pet yet, but you can check out some fun gameplay here: ESO also has good support for ultra-wide resolutions such as 3840*1080. You can see an example of that here: SkyrimVR was and still is a great place to visit through the VR headset, and I was sure that the other areas in Tamriel are also interesting to see through VR glasses.I then took the time to test via VorpX what the game would look like through VR glasses in 360 degrees and it was great, only via VR can you get an idea how big those huge mushrooms from morrowind really are.This is a video of VR gameplay: Tamriel's worlds are also great to experience while jogging: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkJ4Cb-kN8E"
Positive,"Just a good game, takes a bit to get into, but once you are there you are hooked."
Positive,"Is it an MMO? Yes. Do I play it as an MMO? No not really.quests are fun, combat feels pretty good. I do wish it was harder though."
Positive,"I was honestly hesitant to play this for years. I always knew it existed but didn't hear the best things about it. Recently my friends and I were looking for a new mmo to play and figured we'd give ESO a shot. We haven't stopped since. It's addicting, fun, full of good people who are helpful. Community isn't toxic in the slightest. PVP is actually fun. Quests and world are designed really well and the game just draws you in at every corner. I would highly recommend everyone to try this game out.TLDR: Games definitely worth playing in 2021"
Positive,"A surpirsingly well done and optimised game. It excells in creating an online version of Tamriel (TES world), true to the lore of the series and really huge, but has some major flaws, which I will list in Pros and Cons below:Pros:-Lots of fully voiced and animated quests. Altrough mostly primitive in design(""evil lurks bla bla, go to one marker, then to another""), the voicing and custom animation make up for that. Some even feature minor choices (roughly on SWTOR level)-Giant world that really covers entire Tamriel-Stealing! Its so cool. Sadly, you can only steal from NPC's, not from other players (oh, those BSFG memories of stealing money from other players...maybe one day they add it in TESO) . And also you can become a Vampire and drink blood of unsuspecting NPC's at night. -Casual instanced PvP is good and running smooth. No lags, no eye-blowing effects. Just be mindful that this is PvE game mostly, so PvP happends only in specific locations (Cyro and BG's), no PvP in open world.-Realistic gear. Hell yeah! Even costumes from cash shop, are all true to the lore. No pink crocodile, maid, borat and other ""funny"" costumes like in most other games. In this game - only realistic equipment and visuals.-Lots of customisation options. The possibilities at outfitting station are immense. Dress to impress! (yes, in the borders of clothes that are realistic for Tamriel lore).-Dark elvys are sexy. For the first time in TES series, female Dunmers look NOT like old hags, but actually very cute.-Relatively big online (as of December 2018). The megaservers for each region are great idea. Which means all players are in one server, and there will be enough online  so you dont feel lonely.Borderline:-Crafting. Oh yes, crafting really is great in this game. If you like crafting and stockpiling like a hamster, you will love this game. However, it may be a disadvatage to people who dislike crafting - here, to succeed, you HAVE to craft, and do it yourself. Otherwise you will be stuck with crappy gear and no money.-Gloibal scaling, aloows you to go anywhere as soon as lvl 1. Yes, you can go to vet dungeon with 50-811CP players and even do okay DPS :) Totally no level barrier - but this also can be a disadvantage if you want to powerlevel and become ""strong by leveling"". Yes, you will be weaker on lvl 50 than on lvl 20. Love it or leave it.Cons:-No endgame content for guilds. Once you complete most of the quests, get good gear, you will ask question: Now what? And now nothing. There is no endgame content, no reason to play once you reach cap. No things to contest for guilds, neither in pvp nor pve. Cyro? Its a joke, just a big instanced battleground. Raids? All surprisingly easy, some very long, but still easy.-Exploration unrewarding. All is bound to quests and scripted heavily. You cannot just go out there explore. In every ""hidden"" cave you will eventually hit a door/barrier that can only be open if you have specific quest. Also, no secrets here - all is scripted, and planned. You do what you told in quest, you don't wander around exploring...its sad, considering how big and vast world of Tamriel is. Rewards/treasures that can be obtained trough such side activities/found in non-instanced dunegeons- also suck big time. -DLC paywalls. If you think this game is not  cash grab you mistaken. Lots of DLC's, that not only cover new areas (no prblem with paying for that), but also new SKILLS, and stuff that should be in base game to begin with, like thieves guild (yes, you need to pay to gain acces to it...). Yes, you can P2W OP skills in this game.Overall: 8/10Good game, worth buying for full price if you a fan of Elder Scrolls universe, or on sale in other cases. Expect great world and lore - but dont except great MMO-play. But thats not that a big deal here - with main focus of this game being PvE and quests, you can play it as a singleplayer game. Real paradise for autists of all sorts."

Positive,"Give this game a try. First massive multiplayer game I am able to play since I have entered more-or-less-in-touch-with-reality stage of my life, hence all the cool cosmetics of the game have nothing to do with me recommending this game. Plenty of quests (all beautifully voiced) to do alone and even more things to do with friends/guild mates/random people. As a person, who prefers to play solo I very much enjoy this game. However, if you are looking for ""Skyrim online"" I don't think this one will live up to your hopes. You can stealth-kill NPCs (if you have specific DLC or subscription), you can also steal from people (don't need a DLC to do that), but this is not an open-world game - areas are separated by the unclimbable mountains or un-over-swimmable seas.The game is thankfully not pay-to-win, but if you like it and want to support the developers I would recommend getting a subscription, which gives you an access to all DLC areas and also some in-game money to buy cosmetic (emphasis on ""cosmetic"") upgrades."
Positive,"I'm not an MMO player. If you like MMOs then ignore my review.But if you like Elder Scrolls lore then ESO is really fun as you experience a lot of lore while going to lands never seen in mainline games.The game is super confusing and definitely not beginner friendly. It took me days of research to only sort of understand how to play. I'm still learning about new systems 800 hours in.I wish the game had a grittier vibe like Morrowind or Skyrim, as it definitely still has an MMO aesthetic. But regardless I love this game for the lore, characters, fashion, and sheer amount of content."
Positive,"I used to run with friends who have since quit or gone on to other groups, so I don't run dungeons anymore. I pretty much play by myself (which is okay). If you are thinking about playing it is fun and you can run with friends make friends or run by yourself it all depends on how you feel. Either way stay safe. Elz"
Positive,"If you like Elder Scrolls and MMO's, you'll probably like the game. If you like Elder Scrolls but don't like MMO's, this probably isn't the game for you. If you don't like Elder Scrolls and don't like MMO's, why are you here?"
Positive,"Pros:+Voiced dialogues (all of them)+Super big world and lots of content even without any DLC+Quests are mostly purposeful and story is good+Variety of skill trees+Little pay-to-win Cons:-Crown store (in-game purchase including DLCs, appearances, etc) is quite costly and overpriced-Mount is very necessary to save a lot of time yet hard to acquire in early game unless paying-Limited ability slots (only five+one for ultimate, 2 sets that are switchable during combat) that subsequently limits your playstyle to one or two combos-All forms of item-making (blacksmith, alchemy, etc) are very hard to start off-Quite a lot of grinding, but that's how MMORPG works anyway-Combat system is not terrible, but nor is it fantasticSome neutral comments: =ESO, being a MMORPG, is very time-consuming. This may be a pro or con depending on how you organise your time=Quest lines are getting overwhelming over the updates, and some are messed up due to the changes to storyline brought by expansions.Overall:A MMORPG with a rather small but suffcient and stable player base. Base game is worth the price and so is the ESO-plus membership, but everything in the crown store is simply too costly, though this might be a compromised decision to the removal of monthly subscription.Many people who criticise PLUS simply ignore the fact that this game was originally a monthly-sub game. They just give you the option to play without it with some more timely effort, which is perfectly reasonable imo.8/10(9/10 for skyrim lovers since you can actually visit Windhelm)"
Positive,"A fun MMO with a few blemishesThe game is great if you are a fan of the Elder Scrolls lore, not necessarily the official Elder Scrolls games, though. The gameplay is much different from Skyrim, Oblivion, and so on. There are some familiar elements from those games, such as crafting, alchemy, Fighters and Mages Guilds, etc., but the way they are executed are very different. The game is developed by Zenimax Online Studios, not Bethesda Game Studios. The way the menus work, gameplay and just overall feel of the game is not very familiar to official Elder Scrolls games.That being said, it is quite a fun game, once you start to learn the crafting, combat and navigating the massive open world. This game is great either solo or with friends. I like to do quests when I play solo so I can really take in the lore and story, and with friends we do dungeons and free roam the world. Combat can be a bit dull at times, but for an MMO it's enjoyable for the most part, especially if you have a lot of different skills unlocked and you like to switch them out, trying to find the best loadout for your character.There are some downsides though, but most of these can be totally avoided. The major glaring one that most of the ESO community has an issue with is the Crown Crates. They are basically Loot Boxes in other games, but instead of being ""addicting"" or ""gambling"" like the media calls them, they are just expensive piles of garbage. You rarely get anything good in them apart from a few XP boosts. Once again, they are entirely avoidable and they aren't shoved in your face to try to make you to buy them, but just the fact that this game has them is quite a blemish. Also the Crown Store, an in-game storefront to buy cosmetics, gameplay boosters, housing and DLC, is quite expensive. 1500 Crowns cost $15 and won't get you that much. Once again, totally avoidable, but still not good to be included.Another thing that is not entirely a flaw but a bit annoying is ESO Plus. Plus is a subscription, going for $15 a month, that gives you some very nice perks that you don't otherwise get without Plus. One of the best things you get is a Crafting Bag, which is a seperate inventory where all of your crafting materials go into and do not take up any room in your regular inventory. This is great if you like to craft a lot, espeicially if you are very into Provisioning, where you could have nearly 100 different ingredients at any time. You also get access to many DLC that you would have to pay at full price without Plus, and some of the DLC is very good, like the Wolfhunter DLC.So, all in all, this game is really fun if you enjoy MMORPG games and the Elder Scrolls universe. You just have to get used to the mechanics of the game, and learn some character builds online if you want to get heavy into PVP. I recommend it to anyone looking for a new MMO that is easy to pick up and play, doesn't have raids that take 3+ hours to complete, and enjoys the world of the Elder Scrolls. For new players, $10 is a steal for this game, plus it includes the Morrowind DLC, which us older players do not have access to without getting an ESO Plus sub (it's $30 on the Crown Store, not available on Steam anymore). It is a very enjoyable and fun game."
Positive,"This game saved my life.I am 55.My ex-wife and I had a son together, and adopted our daughter together. Both are 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you Bethesda,"
Positive,"If you need me I will be over here, stuck on the lore wiki reading about the ancient Dwemer at 1 am."
Positive,This game is awesome. There has been alot of changes in the game from when it began. The updates make the game better and better. It seem that they have listen to the players inputs and added them to the game.
Positive,"This game is quite good,I'd play it all day if I could.It's a great MMO,though reviews are quite low.Little different from the other Elder Scrolls,for example you can't steal no sweet rolls.You can be a Vampire,but makes fire damage real dire,Or a werewolf if it floats your boat,though the Fighters Guild will make you into a coat.Overall the game is great,and the console edition is a little late."
Positive,"Yes.This one could write a lengthy analysis of the pros and cons about getting into an MMO for only 6€, and getting hundreds of hours of content and playtime.But honestly. If you need to think too long, or have others encourage you why 6€ is a lot or not, for the amount of content you get, you are already wasting time.Get this game.Wait for a sale if you have to, but cost-vs-entertainment value this one's got you covered."
Positive,"I have returned to this game this month, to give it another look.A great many things deteriorate with time, not Elder Scrolls Online. More starting zones, the same simple start and the addition of new mechanics without over-complicating. It's a beautiful game, that has only become less intensive to run as time has gone on with more and more options towards your play style.Take a step away from reality and live the adventurer's life you were born for... or fish from sunrise to sunset. I want to simplify my review from the past, so alas, no such poetry. I will never stop bombarding my written speech, with more commas than the Maze Runner book series. Anyway, it's a great game. Please look into it. They have everything to offer you from Home Decor, Collectables, Leaderboards, PVP, Exploration or Commerce. Take your pick, grasp at the lot of it and conquer your goals."
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online is a really mixed bag and you might need to look at it from your expectations to decide if it's worth playing.First of all I love how the game world scales with your character. In a single player game like Oblivion it was horrible, but in a MMORPG it just takes the grind and throws it (mostly) out of the window. You can go and do any quest at your leasure knowing that the enemies will kick your butt, but only at the amount that you are expected to handle ;) The game is a lot about the abilities and how to combine them and it takes a while to figure it out (as a non MMORPG player...). Once you do get it, the game instantly gets way easier and way more enjoyable.It is not a story driven game, but at the same time it does offer a lot of good quests. Most of them are fetch quests, but at the same time you can see that the writing and voice acting makes up for a lot of the rather simple quest stages. There are a good amount of really carefully crafted quests and quest lines in the game. The amount of (real) content you get with the base game and no monthly fee is great. For 20 € the 16 'full' zones give you at least 150 hours of actual game play.The graphics are good, but it doesn't hold up to any recent game and is frankly a bit too demanding for how it looks. That being said there are moments that your jaw will be on the floor, but they aren't very frequent. The music is wonderful and uses themes from other Elder Scrolls games. The way the game ties in with all the Elder Scrolls 'legacy' is one of the reasons why it's a really good way to see more of Tamriel for Elder Scrolls fans.There is lots to do and there are lots of different ways to play the game. The real world currency 'abuse' in the game is not that bad, but you can clearly see that subscribing is encouraged. If you look for a MMO you might be a bit disappointed and if you look for an Elder Scrolls single player game too, but if you can accept that it tries to sit between those two chairs and has a bit of both then the game really offers a lot to like.I have to mention Morrowind. It's not bad, but it's certainly not worth 40 €. The zone is bigger than the rest of the standard zones, but it blocks off Red Mountain. Compared to the 20 € base game the double amount of money seems ridiculous for about 10 to 15 hours of content. Not even the new character class and the PVP modes make up for it.Overall you should really have a look at the game if it's on sale and as an Elder Scrolls fan you should even consider getting it for 20 € right now."
Positive,"Recently came back to this MMO to see if it changed for the better. (Only played a bit at launch before).They did a great job at streamlining and making the game more accessible. I've been hooked since I've came back to ESO. Corona might have a small part in it too though ;)PROS:- Huge gameworld focused on exploring. The games landmass is so big, even without DLC that you'll get loads of hours of gametime without seeing everything the game has to offer you.- Top notch voice acting. This really helps you to get immersed in the game like any other elder scrolls game. Everything is voiced. Sure some NPC's share voices but its not that distracting.- Good graphics for a game 6+ years old. Granted, I play on an older device so I haven't maxed out the graphics settings but it still manages to look good.- Unique classes who are all jack-of-all-trades. The 'Play what you like' mentality from Skyrim is still here. Some classes might not be as good a healer/tank as other classes but the options to take on those roles does exist.- Fun action combat system that gives players the option to experiment with loads of skills. Because you're only limited to having a few skills on your bars it requires some thinking and trial-and-error to see what works.- Friendly game community. People always seem helpful and aren't afraid to explain stuff about the game if you ask.- DLC, a lot of DLC(+chapers/ new classes) is available for those who want to expand the world and see more zones and dungeons.CONS:- DLC. While this is a pro this is also a con. There's just too many DLC's and not all DLC has a value that justifies the pricing. (Most are too expensive. Especially the DLC that adds only Dungeons). At least you can subscribe to ESO+ to play them for free during your subscription.- Optimization is poor. For a game that old it doesn't run too good. The devs do a poor job at making it run better and run with less lag/ping. So don't expect a smooth ride.- The game is kinda overwhelming for new players. There's just too many icons on the map. Also there's loads of underlaying systems that the game does a bad job of explaining. So I recommend watching some tutorials on them.- Not all zone's stories are consistent in quality and random quests other than story quests may get repetitive.- Inventory management. For non ESO+ players the inventory managing can get really tedious cause you don't have access to the crafting bag. A service they will probably never offer as a buy-option.- Server downtime. (Especially for Europeans) Technically nothing to do with the game but their maintenance is more often than not longer than their prescheduled times. And they always take place in the middle of the day for EU players. So you might not always get the play if you want to.------All in all this game is a must for the Elder Scrolls fans. Sure, it might not be Morrowind or Skyrim but the game has that familiar Elder Scrolls feel to it. You can get really immersed in the game due to the great voice acting, but it can be broken too if you see other people running ahead of you in a cave or quest area. If you have the base game it will net you a good few hours of fun to just experience the story and surroundings. ESO+ is a great quality of life addition that offers all the DLC (except the latest 'chapter', now: Greymoor) for free aswell as the famous crafting bag, but the game is perfectly playable - and still a lot of fun - without ESO+."
Positive,"A week ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illness and the doctors have given me a year at best. I'm so glad I was able to play this masterpiece before I go. I don't know how many people will see this; but I recommend to you to buy this game if you do see it. Gameplay, atmosphere, graphics. everything is masterfully crafted. If you read it, thank you and good bye."
Positive,"To say I don't like online multiplayer games would probably be the understatement of the year. I can write an entire diatribe on the multitudes of reasons I oppose them. On the other hand I am a huge Elder Scrolls fan and have been following the series for decades now. I love the Elder Scrolls universe, their lore and mythology. Despite Bethesda having become the Blehthesda we all know and hate in recent years, the love for the series remains. So what happens when the most recent entry in this beloved single player series turns out to be an MMORPG? Well unable to resist the allure of returning to Tamriel, I am forced to participate in that loathsome genre and hope for the best.First things first, the game is enormous in scope. It is the biggest Elder Scrolls game since Daggerfall and it allows you to visit every single province of Tamriel. From the frozen wastes of Skyrim to the hot deserts of Hammerfell and from the magma rivers of Morrowind to the lush forests of Valenwood, there is a lot of ground to cover and a lot to see. The provinces are divided into smaller zones, each with their own primary questline and numerous side quests. Not every area is included and many zones are locked behind DLCs, but I won't be surprised if at some point in the future this game becomes the first since Arena to allow you to explore the whole of Tamriel. This is without a doubt my favourite aspect of the game. As I wrote above I am a huge fan of this world and being able to explore all these familiar locations, chase landmarks, meet and engage with various legendary heroes was exactly my cup of tea. Lots of screenshot opportunities too. That's not to say that the game actually treats its world with the reverence or respect it deserves. Time to switch now to a more negative tone after the praise of the previous paragraph, starting with the premise. The game takes place long before all the other canonical Elder Scrolls games, in the mid second era, during the interregnum following the fall of the second empire and before the creation of the third. The plot revolves around yet another Daedric invasion, this time led by Molag Bal and enabled by Mannimarco, everyone's favourite King of Worms. The various runaway provinces of the empire band together into three alliances, with three races each, in order to fight Molag Bal and each other for control of Tamriel. The final tenth race, that is the Imperials are unaligned and unplayable without a DLC. In fact central Cyrodiil, their home zone, is the large PVP arena of the game and exactly where most of the inter-alliance warfare is centered.There are several issues here. First of all, the idea that a cataclysmic war like this had happened and yet was never mentioned in the lore of the other games is already problematic enough. But when you consider the dynamics of the various alliances this just becomes a bad joke. The Argonians allying with their erstwhile enslavers in Morrowind for instance rings completely hollow. Or when you think of the timeframe while exploring the world. Visiting places like Mournhold, Windhelm or even Anvil you see the cities you recognize from the previous games, which is great for nostalgia but then you realize this is one thousand years earlier, how can they be the same? Seyda Neen in Vvardenfell being an imperial-style settlement centuries before the empire ever got there was particularly jarring. Generally speaking, the premise doesn't make much sense and it only exists in order to somehow justify the three alliances, multiplayer system the game was sold on. The world and the plot having been effectively sacrificed on the altar of the MMO.With the exception of the aforementioned PVP area, the rest of the game plays largely as a typical, if a bit diluted, single-player Elder Scrolls experience. The various zones spanning Tamriel, including the main quest, can be played solo. With the exception of seeing other players mucking around and perhaps banding temporarily together to beat some boss you can mostly ignore the multiplayer aspect. Indeed I fail to see the MMO aspect as an intrinsic part of the game, but rather as something shoehorned in, as such it could only cause issues. On occasion you will go to an area tasked to kill a boss, but it's already dead, some other player beat you to it. So you have to wait for the respawn. But really the main victim of this MMO fixation is immersion. The game treats the player, in a typical Elder Scrolls fashion, as the chosen hero that will save the world. Quite hard to believe that when there is 30 other such heroes right next to you, doing the exact same thing.The failure of the game to convince of the intrinsic value of its MMO component is present everywhere. The various technical issues speak for themselves. Desyncs, crashes and all kinds of server-side issues. When doing a single-player zone why suffer through that? Give people the option to co-op for dungeons or overworld bosses if they want and keep the rest solo, it plays that way anyway. But even when the MMO part does make sense, such as in PVP areas there are problems. The load on the PVP zone was apparently so heavy that they had to introduce some heavy handed tweaks to help them cope. Such as the recent addition of cooldowns to AoE abilities in PVP, which effectively cripples a whole class. But it's an MMO, that means many players and heavy load, if your servers can't manage that why bother? The combat system itself is simplified and diluted too. Add a few abilities in rotation and click-click-click. I guess nobody said MMOs have to be deep. Right?This begs the question then, if the MMO aspect does not form a part of the game's core and only dilutes and damages the single-player experience that actually does, why is it always there to begin with? To get the answer, simply vist the game's expansive in-game shop. Bethesda, or Zenimax if you want, has gone berserk with the microtransactions. In fact, microtransactions probably is a misnomer considering it can cost you hundreds of real Euros to get a manor house or two. Everything in this game is ludicrously and very greedily monetized. This explains the MMO aspect, you see the other players with their cool outfits and you want to buy them too. Peer pressure or free advertisement. The game is also adept at creating problems so it can sell you solutions, such as the infamous craft bag. To put it simply if you plan to buy the game and play free tier, forget about it. An ESO plus subscription is necessary if you want to avoid the various engineered frustrations.So, is this game worth it? The answer is, unsurprisingly, it depends. People looking for a mechanically proficient game that is actually trying to offer them a fun experience first and foremost should look elsewhere. This game is a failure as an MMO, even if I did not dislike online multiplayer as much as I do I would never play this game for its gameplay. It's just not good enough and its raison d'être is to nickel-and-dime you. On the other hand the game is a stronger single-player experience, with the occasional co-op. As such I do recommend it, provided you can ignore the sirens of the game's shop. It's not great, the MMO part doing a fair bit of damage, but it is presentable and fairly enjoyable. Particularly for people that love the world and intend to spend a lot of time exploring.Recommended, if only just... and with many caveats."
Positive,"One of the best MMO's on the market today, amazing value for the initial investment and tons of content to keep you busy for a long long time. Highly recommend!"
Positive,"Don't be fooled by other games, Elder Scrolls Online has the biggest active map i have ever seen. There are literally tons of activities in every corner in the game and nearly endless quests to go with that."
Positive,"Good points :- Beautiful for a MMORPG- More The Elder Scrolls lore- Bosses are god tier- You can meet Sheogorath- Only TESO have the most charismatic Khajiit ever : Razum-Dar- The main quests on each different places are great ( better than the main in my opinion )Bad points :- Updates => 75% of my 700 hours- Can lag easily if there are to much persons in the same place ( like in events )- Bosses are god tier- The EUW server is often down- You can't marry Razum-Dar - All the players looks the same, character customisation is a meh/20 - Way to much similar quests ( hard to be original tho )- You have to pay crowns ( real money ) or you will never get some stuff- The monthly subscription is almost essentialIf you like The Elders Scrolls universe and you have friends to play with, buy it. Playing alone can be hard but you can join a guild so it's ok I guess ?"
Positive,"Pros:- Nice combat- Pretty good story, haven't played all of it tough- lots of sidequests and other stuff to do- Very fun dungeons- Has some TES lore- PVP is very nice- Many customization options, both for ingame and real currency- DLC and expanisions constantly releasing.- Free daily rewards- Really fun with friends- Friends found easily in-game- Nice and helpful communityCons:- The ingame currency bought with real money is kind of expensive.- Some quests are kind of repetetive- As I said, the story is pretty good, but sometimes not great.- Sometimes the lore can feel a bit out of place, but nothing major.It's overall a really great game. I'd recomend to get it if you like TES, and/or RPGs, or if it just seems fun. 9/10"

I bought the game on Humble Monthly Bundle iin November 2017 and this method worked for me. If it doesn't work for you, I am sorry, I don't know why..Regarding the game, the experience so far is great. I've been looking for a replacement for aion for years and with the recent fail of Bless I picked up this one. Ain't an Aion, but for now it will entertain me and kill my MMO deprivation :)"
Positive,"I've been playing this one for some time now so I figured best time to finally write this.The easiest way to sum this title up is ""Good for an MMO, not a traditional an ElderScrolls"".Essentially this is an MMO set in the ES world.The game has some nice qualities as well as some flaws.COMBAT & CONTROLSThe game hybrids the forms of most MMOs with that of TES, so spells and special attacks have quick bars and hot keys but only 5 can be equiped at a time meaning quick bars wont be cluttering your screen while the main controls are mostly the same as Skyrim.The combat can be a bit dodgy at times.For some reason enemy projectile spells can go through walls and even floors, as can other projectile attacks...Also going through doors or activating objects is disabled when engaged or being attacked, as such fleeing can be a joke and timed challenges can be a complete irritation from this.Although other enemy attacks can be blocked or avoided well enough that it can otherwise be enjoyable.UIThe Interface is decent for an MMO, fairly strait forward but lots on it.Its easily navigated and could be considered cleaner than Skyrim's vanilla Interfaces.QUESTSLikely one of the best parts of the game.There are a staggering number of quests accross the game that have a huge variety, from helping a farmer put out fires to helping plan a city festival to traveling through a daedric portal and saving a noble family from cultists to even playing diplomat between alliance leaders!With just how many there are these alone would keep a player busy for a good long while, not including any of the DLCs!MAPSThese are also very expansive and varied, plus the shear number of terrains is great!The game takes almost 85GB and this is a very large reason why, they just have so many details and nooks that make the land so complex.Icons are also spread pretty well across the maps.However beware with Mounts as they cannot go up the mountain sides (Sorry but Skyrim Horses are special) and they dismount you in deep water which is almost all water... GRAPHICSThese are quite nice for the most part, human meshes and textures have definately had an upgrade from vanilla Skyrim.Although this doesn't exactly extend to all other mobs, the main horse textures have definately suffered compared to vanilla Skyrim with low resolution drawn on harnesses and even drawn on eyes...There are other non-humanoid mobs that share this issue as well... Even some purchasable pets...As for the enviornments they have fairly nice textures and effects, water and lighting are as nice as SSE and lava glows.PAYWALLIn this case the game is more pay-4-convenience than pay-2-win with most purchasable items being non-combat pets, mounts, and cosmetics.DLC is also something that requires real money but unlike the rest it can be rather expensive in comparison...Overall I would rate this game a 7/10 on its own."
Positive,"First things first: I bought ESO directly from the homepage, so Steam doesn't show my real playtime.  But between my 3 characters I've played 1087 hours and I'm still playing it.I will leave out most of the generals because you can read about them in those thousand other reviews.What is the best way to describe this game? It's the MMORPG for solo players. There are many, many players still playing, which is kind of surprising for such an old game, but interacting with them is optional. Very optional. On the positive side, there is almost no kill stealing, because even hitting a MoB just once counts the kill for all players who did it. A few years ago they also added followers, which is an NPC that follows you around and helps you in fights and such. This made the need to interact with others even less (and it wasn't that much to begin with).-It does most things right, but shines in none. I mean, it really has many concepts that are well thought out... but somehow  it feels mediocre in almost everything.-It has a more or less classless system built around classes. Your class has 3 skill trees that are unique to it. But you also have many, and will get even more, other skill trees that aren't unique. This makes characters feel more and more like other characters the higher you level them. -It has the same lore, areas, and story flaws you know, love and hate from all the other Elder Scroll games - ok, except for creating your own self-healing uber-armageddon spells and spiffing fork of megadeath weapon smithing :) -It has kind of an action based combat system, but in most fights you just spam 2-3 skills and maybe parry or dodge once in a while, and since it came out for consoles you can even activate assisted targeting, which makes this combat system at least closer to a tab target combat system.-It is the most open world MMORPG; because it scales everything to your level. While this can be seen as a strength (you can play with your friends who may be high level or noobs and not be afraid of dying all the time if you decide to start as a new player more or less immediately in the latest expansion), it is also it's biggest flaw. Because leveling up does not really make you stronger, it just gives you and your opponents more options. It has a unique pay-to-play system. If you don't care about crafting, you can play it forever, just buy the latest expansion and later DLC or newer expansions, if you like playing them. However, if you pay monthly, you get access to all content and a crafting bag able to hold infinite crafting materials. This bag is shared with your other characters.This may be done by just buying the base game and subscribing to ESO Plus for 10€/month instead of buying expansions +DLCs.Would I recommend it? If you liked the Elderscroll games, definitely yes. This is the only Elderscroll game that wasn't made directly by HIM. And you know what? They made a lot of things better and it _really_ just works :)"
Positive,they perma'd me cause i named my guild Turbo Virgins 0/10
Positive,I cannot stress just how bad this game is for your social life. I started a wood elf last month and after non stop playing (over 100 hours) I've found there is still so much more to do. Needless to say if you're craving for an open world game and have an awful lot of spare time on your hands then pick this game up. All the regular updates and frequent content drops will keep you hooked for hours.
Positive,"If you want to lose your job, your imaginary girlfriend and stay virgin for the rest of your life, this game is for us!"
Positive,Nothing beats playing in a band with 2 friends to serenade randoms while they quest. 10/10 find us in your local tavern as The Boys in the Back Row
Positive,great game for solo players
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is a great way to return to the world of Tamriel, especially if you're a fan of the series. It's a game where you can spend hours leveling up your character and exploring the world, but if you're expecting a deep storyline and a lack of grindy quests, you're likely to be disappointed. The graphics aren't cutting-edge, and most quests boil down to ""fetch this"" or ""deliver that."" However, you can have a blast with friends, especially in PvP!"

Positive,"This game is like a wine. The older, the better. I can easily say that  in 2017 this will be the best mmo on the market. Community is constatly getting bigger. Not so long ago servers were pretty empty, you could only find people in cities near crafting stations, after one tamriel update everywhere I go i'm finding mixed race groups doing quests or exploring. It's pretty funny because all games tend to die with time, but with eso its all diffrent. only con I could find is that you cant get some less important stuff with in-game currency, you need to pay real money for changing hair or name. but you wont get anything from that store that will give you advantage."
Positive,"This was my first venture into MMO territory. I was initially a bit daunted, felt a bit awkward asking for help, tired to play solo and eventually left. I think I also expected it to be skyrim online, which, believe me, it's not.I came back to give it another go. Noob lessons learned the first time around now I'm totally engrossed in a beautiful and chaotic world, fighting back the forces of Oblivion from engulfing the world. It really is a stunning game world, it's size is crazy and the beauty of the world is something to behold. It's a world I enjoy so much to get lost in. If you want more Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim your in for a fall. If you want an Elder Scrolls MMO, your onto a winner."

Positive,"The best MMO I have ever played. Whether you want to solo through the story of this game like you would Skyrim or group up with other people like a more standard MMO experience, ESO has all the options available for you. I love the fact I can be as casual or hardcore as I desire on any given day.Some advice: You should consider adding some mods to make your experience a better one (like a minimap, for example), and a careful look through the settings is a must when you begin playing, but it is so worth it to do so."
Positive,I love this game. For an old codger like me it's perfect. I can play when I want and how I want and not have to worry about intense play. I can just go about my business completing quests and upgrading my character. The open-world style is nice to explore and the non-player-characters are fun to interact with and hear their stories.
Positive,its says you only need 85 GB but your really gonna need about 130 GB .bought it and cant play it due to this misinformation.used to play alot tho and i recommend it.
Positive,im too poor for this game
Positive,"This game was a disaster during launch. But over the years it has evolved to one of the best mmorpg in the world right now. It's a balanced mix of TES story telling and competitive mmorpg game play. The combat system is dynamic and fun, much more complex than TES skyrim and feels you are actually hitting things. The pvp is ok but could be improved. Overall a great game and time sink.Update since CWC: Less grinding thanks to the transmutation, or maybe just an illusion since I have most of the sets. The pvp experience is ruined by the lag, peeps running that miat shit cheating add-on, zerg ball. Single player content and questing is still on par with elder scroll. Clock work city is definitely my favourite after Orsinium. PVE feels slow because of the heavy attack meta. ZOS promised to make changes so let's see how they do it. They promised transmog but it probably takes another 6 months to implement. Spoilers: apparantly next chapter of the game would be summerset...for once we are getting to go there. EXCITING!"

Positive,The only negative thing I can say about this game for me is the fact that I don't have any friends to consistently play with.
Positive,I must've bought The Elder Scrolls Online: Gamestop Edition by accident because the merchants in this game will buy your weapons for like 10 gold each even if they're selling the same weapon for over 500 gold.
Positive,"Tried it for Free Weekend, 50 hours later I've bought a handful of expansions and quit my job and sold my house for crowns."
Positive,(IT RUNS ON STEAM DECK) - Amazing game lots of fun and enough to do to sink countless hours into playing it definitely recommend playing it and even though it says unsupported for steam deck I play it exclusively on my steam deck.
Positive,"I've been a huge fan of The Elder Scrolls game since I first played Morrowind at a friends house on his pc. I remember as a kid begging my parents to buy it for me once it was announced for Xbox. The world, the characters, and the stories that you could create were some of my most cherished gaming moments. I've continued to play each Elder Scrolls game thats been released since and probably know more about the lore of these games then I do actual world history. Now that I've had the chance to put a significant amount of time into ESO, I think I can fairly review it.First of all, let me address the monthly fee. I think that it is beyond unfair to ask $15 a month plus the full retail price of the game. With the base price included, the game adds up to be about $250 for your first year. That is unacceptable for any game, regardless of the quality. There aren't any pay to win features of the game, but they still need to come up with a better model then this if they want people other then the most die-hard Elder Scrolls fans to play their MMO.Let me just  quick fire the rest of my negative opinions before moving on to the many positives of the game. It's hard to group quest when your friends disappear because they are at a different part of the quest then you. The horses in the game are overpriced beyond belief. I played for almost 100 hours with one character and still couldn't afford a damn horse. Not cool...not cool. Also, some of the zones in the game look very similar to other zones when they should not according to the lore. That one is a nerdy complaint, but it still sort of irked me.Now for the positives. The game looks very pretty for an MMO. I liked most of the art style and had some moments when I was just running around where I had to just stop and enjoy the scenery. The one exception to this is Cyrodil (where all the pvp takes place). While I didn't spend much time there, it was huge space that was populated with almost nothing interesting to see. Other than that, the dungeons and the effects in the game are great.The fact that everything is voice acted is another amazing feat in an MMO. I know that Bioware already did this with The Old Republic, but here it is done really well. It makes the quests feel like  single player quests and makes the game a bit more immersive. Along with this, the quests are pretty good for an MMO. Compared to other games in the genre, ESO has great variety and made me wonder what cool thing I might stumble upon next.The community was also pretty good for ESO (at least when I played over the summer). I ran into alot of cool people and most were willing to help out or just have dance-offs at least. This may be related to the fact that the game is subsription based, but I'd be willing to endure a few assholes if it meant not taking out a small loan to access the game.I think the game itself deserves to be played. The developers crafted a fun and beautiful game. I am conflicted though. Im not sure whether to recommend it or not. If you want to play something a little different than your standard MMO, give ESO a shot. However, be prepared to spend a lot of money on the game."
Positive,"It feels like I have been playing ESO for a long time and I still haven't ran out of content. Even when I hit 1k hours I still feel like there is a lot to do. Pros: action based combat, voice actors for almost every npc, story books everywhere, plus mini stories with side quests and quests.Cons: combat rotation can get stale. If it does play a different class or change up your play style. Also some of the abilities seem to be a good idea to stay away from but nothing is perfect and that is ok. Other than that I would highly recommend ESO."
Positive,"I have played this game for at least 100 hours and decide to do a 100 hours review, I will be back later if anything changed my mind in further progression.I quit warframe after 2500 hours of game play and decided to give ESO a try after the game has been sitting in my game library for 3 months. I haven't been rushing into the game, or doing a power level like some players,but getting into 100 hours, I just don't get the bad reviews coming out from everywhere.  I've already spent 15 hours in ONE map just by strolling around, random stuff exploring, interacting with other people, working on my progression, attempting to solo the dungeon (which didn't go so well and hilarious btw). The environment is so beautiful, I feel lost (in a good way) and immersed myself to the surrounding, the excellent voice acting,I was spending more time just enjoying the view and the amazing music than actually do anything, my favorite time is swimming and fishing! It is crazy that there's always something to do!I cannot believe people are complaining about the gold drop in this game. People who complained about this should be castrated, seriously, play the d*mn game.Stop complaining and stop being a lazybump by doing quest/delves/dungeons.The reason the mobs drop very little gold is to discourage grinding and gold farmers, because there are so many ways of earning gold other than mindless grind!You can be rich in gold for just playing the game!You can kill enemies and sell the loot they give you, craft items and sell them to merchant,do a lot of quests and earn a F*UCKTON  of gold.ESO has fixed most of its issues  since launch and beta version and is continuing to fix the remaining ones and adding the most anticipated one as well:Justice system where you can lollygagging around and steal from NPCs,kill NPCs and go to prison, etc. Champion System ,Thieves guild and dark brotherhood is going to be added soon! The hype is real!! I am looking forward to the awesome PVP war world contents soon and from watching the PVP gameplay, it certainly doesnt look disappointing! When I saw it, my jaw drops instantly, can't wait to touch the PVP aspect of this game! I will continue to update this review as I go along the game!To the people who is complaining and warned people ahead like""do not go into PVP and play this game ,if not , get ready to be r*ped by peoples 20 levels higher than you."" Well what do you expect?! It's an MMO and progress and skill leveled based!I am new to MMO world and what I heard from a regular MMO player, nowadays ,your typical MMO games have a shitttty graphic, 4v4 or 5v5 PVP, hotbar-based combat,static world and no exploration , NO voice acting etcI am really satisfied with the game developers decision of making the game B2P. The shop is not P2W, it only sells convenience items and cosmetics. A lot of people I know are suckers for costumes and mounts, believe it or not. I'm looking at you, Victor!!The Imperial edition of this game is not locking content out!You don't miss out on quests, dungeons or any other content.﻿In a way, going B2P provides a paywall to lock out those bots , gold farmers and trolls trash.Now moving on the thing that I would like them to improve on:In this game, all the mobs are stationed in one spot.  If you tried to kite , they will only chase you so far before they go back to their spot with FULL HEALTH and forget you even attacked them. This is b*ll F*cking sh*t and I almost lost my sh*t when this happened couple of times.Grouping are major issues that needs to be addressed  as you can't join your friends in quest if you have already done the quest, the infamous ""invisible person bug"" where one person in your group is invisible and you just see the chevron over their head.  Having said that, I am pretty optimistic that they will laid out a lot of improvements over the next few months. No matter what you haters do, you can't stop ESO from becoming a success. Until next time! Post will be updated once I venture more and stop my lollygagging!!"
Positive,fishing is pretty good in the game
Positive,I still haven't completed most of the chapters and DLCs...
Positive,"getting addicted to ESO in the big year of 2024 wasn't on this years bingo card list, yet here we are."
Positive,Saved a city. Got praised by the King. Looted the King's entire castle. 10/10
Positive,"kinda dog there are no OCE/Asia servers, if there was a half recommend half not recommend option id select that because the game is rather fun otherwise, just not on 350 ping"
Positive,"Almost 600 hours...I have seen less than 30% of the maps...I have completed less than 10% of the quests...It seems like this game really deserves its guiness world record for the Most unique npcs in a videogame.If you like to chill and explore a videogame this game is for you.Personally, This game should be the standard for how games released in the Occident World should be.Don't trust people that keep complaining about performance when they have installed more than  300 add-ons..."
Positive,"I will say this, this MMO is very addicting. But like everyone says, it does not ""completely"" feel like an ""Elder Scrolls"" game. It just feels like your average MMO. But it's a great MMO at that.The main quest is kind of average too. You're basically just ""The Chosen One"" sent to correct the evil that is corrupting the land. Nothing original.Another thing to note that like most MMORPGs, this is a huge XP grind fest. So make sure you have enough time on your hands to level up and start completing them quests. Those quests will help you level fast and give you a good sum of gold too.Oh yes and one thing to note about the Imperial Edition. Although it does give you a free horse and trust me, it takes 10,000 gold to get your first horse, one thing it fails to mention and something I learned the hard way. I thought the Imperial Edition granted the ability to play as any race in any faction. But turns out, that only applies to the new Imperial race you get in the imperial edition. It only grants Imperials the ability to be in any faction.If you want to do that, you'll have to purchase the Adventurer's Pack which costs 1,500 crowns if I recall. Now before you start calling and whining about it being ""Pay 2 Win"", please hear me out. Most of what you spend with ""crowns"" which is a currency you get with real money, are mostly just cosmetics. Pets, costumes and etc. Most of these things don't grant you an advantage over others.The only way to get better is to get better gear, level up, figure out your own playstyle, play your class to its fullest extent and basically, just be good at the game. You don't need to spend any crowns to get any sort of strength over others. You get almost all of your strength from crafting, buying and leveling up. They all involve getting ""gold"" which is of course, the ""in-game"" currency. So if you're afraid this might be ""Pay to win"", toss that thought out the window right now. You're safe.The only gripe I have is that the quests are just uninteresting, which I often just skip most of the dialouge to try and complete the boring quest as fast as I can and most of the achievements can be very difficult to complete. Most of the achievements unlock dyes for you to color your armor and clothing. But the most rarest of dyes are rewarded on the most hardest of achievements. But you'll feel glad when you get them, because these rare dyes are shiny than the common ones and I like shininess on my clothes and armor.All in all, it's a very good MMO. But again, don't expect it to play like an Elder Scrolls game. Manage your expectations and just treat the game as a good MMORPG game and not an Elder Scrolls game."
Positive,"I like the Elder Scrolls Online game.I came from World of Warcraft. I played World of Warcraft on and off for almost 10 years. I wanted a change and I think ESO was the fantasy online game to scratch that itch.I also played some of the older stand alone games part of the Elder Scrolls. I actually played Daggerfall way back in the day.I played Morrowind and some of Skyrim.With that said, I like how ESO online is doing it's own thing.I like the professions and being able to make your your elite gear.I like the fact you can add your own styles to your gear and weapons.I like the general storylines, and each place I have played in ESO has felt like it's own special little world, which I suppose is not any different from Wow in this perspective, but ESO is much fresher to my eyes than Wow is to me at this date.I like the idea of joining a fighters, mage, thieves and dark brotherhood guild.I like the things that are possible to do in Wrothgar, and it's interesting to see what the Orc Homeland looks like.I like the idea of people turning into vampires and Werewolves.I like the dungeons, though some seem too hard.Dungeons do work a little bit different than in Wow. I do feel that tanking in Wow is easier. I also liked the idea of gear progression in WOW, which in this game doesn't really seem to be the case. That made doing certain dungeons easier over time.Um, things in ESO are more of a grind but in a way that make's it more rewarding when you complete a task.I preferred that vampires in older ES games burned in the sun. I do not like how vampires in ESO seem immune but I also get it as a design mechanic. I mean with alot of games with day and night cycles, how could you guarantee that vampire players only log in at night. Though I think this kills one of the cool aspects of being a vampire. Most vampire lore, they burn in the sun and therefore the vampires in ESO (though they look awesome, have a great creation quest to become one) are all in all feel a bit fake in ESO.Even if, in later stages; yes vampires hurt from fire in ESO.I like the idea of trials, they do remind me of Wow raids. At least the initial setup. I do prefer the size of WOW raids though, 25 not 12.and it use to be 40 guys way back in the day, but that was too hard to control.Werewolves seem more like beasts in this game and for awhile I was annoyed by this, because I was use to Worgen's in Wow. With that said, over time I think this is a better way for werewolves to appear. Since in most depictions of werewolves, many do not just continue to wear clothes and top hats like Worgens in Wow.I feel in a way this game is where Wow was when BC just came out way back in 2006 2007. With ESO's expansion of Morrowind, which I really do love. In a-lot of ways it reminds me of the stand alone version of Morrowind game in the late 90's I think.Though in that game, you could join 1 out of 3 houses. I was disappointed you could not join a House in this Morrowind, but as I understand ESO's Morrowind is in the 2nd era, and stand alone old Morrowind was in the 3rd era?The pvp area is cool. There are  not as many battlegrounds like in WOW and this is regretful. With that said, the one that exists right now in ESO, there seems to be a-lot more things to do in the one main battleground area they have.I like taking down fortresses and taking over towns. That stuff use to exist in WOW unofficially, with a forsaken town and alliance town constantly being taken over by either Horde or Alliance, and throughout the cities.Which was really fun on pvp servers, but too many cry babies cried and Wow Dev's made the guards so tough, it was nearly impossible to do that anymore.Hey CRY BABIES, don't come to a pvp server if you don't like running the risk of getting ganked. Stay on PVE servers.Again I feel ESO has a lot of potential. I do think it's slightly growing too and I do hope it expands.I actually secretly hope it destroys WOW once and for all one day, but time will tell about that. If that does happen though.I do think that over time two things needs to occur in ESOMaybe three.I really would like new races, and different types. I know you have a lore, but can't lore be bended somewhat?So many races also seem very similar.This is a fantasy game.Anyway not really sure if this jives with the lore though so I don't really expect this.Here are two other main things.The game needs to continue to grow. New places? Possibly another PVP area or some sort of advancement in the three faction war going on. Maybe now one side is going to win and the other sides have to join up again?Possibly consider ilevel gear progression? It kind of gives the player besides raising in CH numbers an incentive to try to keep doing better to get better gear which will make previous hard stuff easier and new very difficult dungeons trials, doable.Yet if this game just wants to stay at it's current level I think only the first two should be considered.Lastly, ilevel gear progression can produce elitists like in Wow. This is the double edge sword with the last suggestion, because I know how elitists have ruined Wow. Yet then again, I do think this option is more fun for people who want to do raids, because it makes all content more available for all of the players who play ESO and I feel this system is easier to manage to evaluate oneself.So in a sense, I am being a hypocrite here. I do feel that elitists in Wow have ruined the game for a-lot of players who are not hardcore and sometimes I have felt that was unfair to them but at the same time I would be lying to say that  I want everything equal and balanced.Meaning, if I have a chance for my character to be more powerful than yours and I have the means to do so I want to be better than you.Just like in real life. People do not want to be equal in misery with you. They want to be better than you. And that is not wrong. It's a realist to human nature. The idea that just because you exist you deserve the same equal outcome in the game. That doesn't exist in real life for everyone in many different ways. Thus why would you expect it to be the case in a game.This is also the mentality that helps you from becoming another regular person in the mob of life. This is the same reason why I feel celebrities exist.Yes, I know I am a hypocrite here. There always seems to be advantages and disadvantages with making a change. I have figured this out the hard way but it's true nonetheless.Hope this review helps. I hope it convinces some Wow people too to give this game a chance.Lastly, the graphics in this game are beautiful. I wish Wow was like this sometimes but it's graphic engine is too old yes, even though the core story and core concepts of Wow are still solid. Final, thought: Wow though despite how much I still like you. You had your time baby. It's time to give another new placeholder a chance to shine. Rest in peace World of Warcraft your almost 14, which in game years means your ancient."
Positive,"I do enjoy this game personally and have played in the beta of 2014 only to stop because at the time you needed to pay monthly to play.----- It is a smaller Daggerfall world size and easy to pick up in the sense that even with all the DLCs so far you have about 5 to 6 zones with each side and that's not counting with Coldharbour so you have quite a lot of space to go through.- Most of DLCs are tied to dungeons or trials, raids for those who are used to the WoW scene, and yet you have a large number of dungeons available to you.- You can try a bit of every skill tree that isn't class based and even get quite far with it, the only negative things so far with skills is that if you're going for jewelry crafting you will need Summerset DLC and the final negative thing is: WHERE'S MY UNARMED SKILL?! I WANT TO HAVE PUNCHING ABILITIES!- There are microtransactions but they aren't predatory ones, they won't scream at your face ""Hey, buy an exp scroll to level up faster."" you can tell that it is there but you can ignore it mostly.- About the subscription (yes it has one as you probably saw when scrolling down to see reviews) it exists and it offers quite a lot of benefits as free access to all the dlc except the last chapter, Greymoor (as of June of 2020), a bag that can store all materials, double storage and crowns (microtransaction currency), while the benefits are massive you can still play without the ESO+ subscription, you can get up to 140 inventory slots on upgrading backpack size and +60 from horse upgrading so inventory space is helpful but with some attention it isn't as needed.- Game goes on sale quite often and you do get a DLC along with it.-----All in all, I'd recommend it if you're looking for an mmo in the veins of Elder Scrolls game."
Positive,"PROS:- No P2W, subscription is for quality of life (crafting bag, extra bank storage, cosmetics), once you bought the game play as much as you want- 5 classes, 10 nations, sounds limited, but with skill trees along stuff sets you have close to unlimited possibilities for your build- Beautiful and pretty big map to explore, take your time and feel Tamriel- Lots of quests, with 745h played i've finished the main quest but i'm still working on side quests- Addons, customize your gameplay like you wish!- DLCs, new content added on a regular basisCONS:- Side quests may feel repetitive sometimes- 1 class and 1 nation behind dlc (less possibilities for the build, but still too much to try them all)- DLCs, need to buy them, but they are all unlocked with subscription (you can take a one-month subscription, rush the dlc you're interested in, and then you're good tho, exept point above)I definitively recommend this game, especially if you can grab it on sale (like at time of writting, -50% with autumn sales)"
Positive,"My review used to be negative, mostly because Steam reviews for DLC were posted for the base game, and I intended to review the Elsweyr chapter. The pricing model for the DLC made zero sense, was tailored to giving long time players the worst value, and had a very complex, confusing price variation between similarly named upgrade packages. All of this has since been corrected. All DLC has been removed from Steam; you must purchase it through the crown store. No more dishonest pricing. I still recommend you don't buy any DLC unless it's on sale, but that doesn't impact my opinion of the base game.The base game is VERY large, and not just in walking space. Every area is jam packed with things to do. I've played nearly 300 hours on one character and I don't feel like I'm running out of things to do on it yet. Playing this game as a single-player game isn't quite as enjoyable (barring the great solo quest line), but that's because most activities are designed for groups. This is an MMO, after all. Suck your friends in when the game is on sale and have a blast. If you see it on sale for 10 bucks, just grab it. The game picks up once you reach level 10 and you start piecing together a strategy for your character. Hang in for the first couple hours and the game opens up into something great.Edit: They put some of the convoluted bad-value DLC options back on the Steam store page."
Positive,"This is by far one of the best mmorpg's of today and this is coming from a person who spent 20 years grinding away on everquest. good things about this game is as follows: Content, plenty of it! there is no such thing as ""lack of content"" in this game.Main stories has been great with many of the characters that are memorable.Voice acting is superb, something we should be seeing more of in other newer titles.Graphics are pretty damn good for a 6 year old game, I think they are great out of the box as is. Being able to add stuff in add ons is so great, things like bandits ui and map pins has been a life saver for me. I'm sure there are many other useful things where that came from.Daily rewards are a godsend and they give pretty useful stuff like scrolls, food and ect.Now here is the bad, only 3 of them that I saw:DLC's yeah lol plenty content locked stuff as you can tell and there is a lot of them. however you don't need them all. the main ones you need is Morrowind, Summerset, Elsweyr and Greymoor. vMA stuff you will need the Orsinium DLC. Thieves Guild, and Dark Brotherhood if you want the extra classes and Clockwork City DLC if you are strapped on gold not to afford a transmutation station from the guild trader but completely optional since the game allows you to do tons of stuff anyway. most of the other dlc's are for dungeons, again completely optional.The ping issues holy cow, that is the main reason why I don't pvp very much, just a sudden lag can turn the ties of any strategy in Cyrodiil fix it already its been too long!!! lol.Lastly if you are a new player wanting to try out the game, don't even bother to download this game during free to play week. the download speeds from client during that time is a nightmare, lesson learned from there.Despite the 2 bad things, that they themselves can fix, I still recommend this game. sometimes its a love hate relationship, but it would be weird if it wasn't.One other thing, this is NOT a pay to win game. its a pay to play, optional sub based with a cash shop. sub is not really needed because it gives you a craft bag and monthly crown allowance. sure craft bag is pretty damn useful, but you can max your inventory and bank space with gold and still do pretty good without it. the cash shop is mostly cosmetics with the other things you can actually make or get in game such as exp scrolls, food, drink, ect. completely optional."
Positive,A dude stole everything from a place while the guards were busy fighting me. 10/10 businessman
Positive,I shouldn't have wasted my time with WOW.  This is SO much better.

Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is my favorite MMORPG, but, unfortunately, I can't see myself getting back to it anytime soon (or maybe ever).I love the Elder Scrolls franchise, and it actually took me over 3 tries to finally get invested into this game. And when I did, boy oh boy, I just wanted to play it every single day, and do all content that was available. I was just extremely invested on it.Made some great friendships, had a lot of fun (and frustration too) by doing Dungeons and Trials, even fell in love with the Lore and many different aspects of the story.Pros:- Although the graphics aren't the best, the art style is very good.- Insane levels of character customization (but, with a caveat down in the Cons section)- A huge amount of content to do, either solo or with groups (with another caveat)- Lots of great quests to do and characters to met- Gameplay is very fast paced and different from other MMOs I've played- The player housing system is so freaking cool- Can be extremely nostalgic for fans of the series- Old expansions aren't thrown in the garbage bin like other MMOs, as every content scales to your levelCons:- A lot of the character customization stuff is locked behind microtransactions and lootboxes- There is no new content that's free. Every single new area, dungeon and trial is acessible only via DLCs and Expansions.- Even though you don't need to pay a monthly subscription, if you want to do crafting, you'll most definitively need the infinite Crafting Bag from ESO Plus (which is very expensive where I live)- Open World content get's too easy too fast, meaning that very soon you'll be almost instakilling most Open World mobs. Challenging combat is only available in DLCs and Expansions Veteran Dungeons and Trials.- Server stability can be shit most of times- The game can be very unstable, and for two years straight I've seen devs promissing to improve upon it... I don't know if it has improved nowadaysSo, to finish it up, ESO is a very good MMORPG with excessive levels of monetization. I wouldn't say that it's Pay2Win, but I also wouldn't say that not owning DLCs and Expansions isn't very limiting in your build options.I recommend it, but at the same time I don't recommend it..."
Positive,"Even after 5k hours I really enjoy playing this game. Thanks to developers the game receives updates 3-4 times per year (and some players even say it's too often xD). New territories, new storylines, new dungeons and items. There are not many MMORPGs that can boast such support even 8 years after release. First of all I think it's better to to mention that this game is quite unique in ganre. It is more about story and questing than most other MMOs. Remember you played LA2, AA, BD? You took the quest for killing 20 mobs? After that you took another quest for killing 30 mobs? And again and again... So, in ESO you can forget about such quests. No monster grinding. Here you will be asked to find some lost items, solve puzzles or defeat strong monster. Of course, you will have to kill some mobs during the quest, but mostly it will be 3-5 mobs. Instead of killing hundreds of monster you will more often speak with different NPCs or read books. Every quest (even a little one) will have at least several stages. I thinks that quest system here is much better then even in WoW.There are a lot of different and interesting NPCs, and some of them you will meet in different regions, so you will understand from the beginning what you need to prepare for. For ex. when you meet Rigurd, Nord diplomat, you already know that he got into some trouble (again...). Or you meet Naryu and you already understand that someone need to be silenced.Most of the quests are not mandatory, so you complete only quests you like.Another big part of the game are dungeons. There are several types of them: caves and public dungeons (which can be completed both in solo or party); 4-people dungeons; solo trials and 12-people trials (last 3 can be completed on several difficulty levels). In all dungeons, you'll get cool items like weapons or armor, various achievements, and even cosmetics like mounts or metamorphoses.And if you prefer PvP you can visit Battlegrounds (for 4x4x4 battles) or Imperial city and Cyrodiil for mass battles. Cyrodiil is a big open region with a lot of villages and castles which you have to capture. Battle for a castle with 20-30 people from every side and with different siege weapons looks really fun, you should definitely try it!So, for the conclusion I want to mention the fact that developers are constantly adding new cool features like treasure hunting, companions system and even card game inside the main game. So you will definitely find something interesting for yourself. And I hope that the game will continue to develop in the future!If you like MMORPG - you should definitely try this one. For me it's 10/10UPDATE :2k hours has passed since my review and this game still never ceases to amaze me. In this season (year 2023) developers added a lot of cool quality of life features, such as Grand Master crafting stations or Group Finder. We are also have new big zone, new dungeons and trial, new companions and a lot of other stuff which will not make you bored. Definitely 10/10 and Labor of Love award on Steam!"
Positive,"THIS ONLY HAS MIXED REVIEWS BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK IT'S SKYRIM 2.0NO, this is NOT another Skyrim. This is an MMO. Look the game up before you buy it instead of buying a game completely different then what you're expecting.To all the people complaining about the space of the game = IT'S AN MMOIt needs to be a large game to be able to last a while like WoW.Honestly, I love this game. I've played it for 35 hours so far in 3 days and It's really good!PS ; It's not pay to win like some people are saying -.-"
Positive,"I grew up with a grandfather that loved gaming, Diablo, supreme commander, Elder scrolls series, and because of this I got into Skyrim, and most other games he also plays, and once ESO came out he preordered and became a member of Guild medieval/The Silver Legion which is a Huge MMO Guild eventually after 2 years he became an admin and is working on a huge ESO project where he is recording EVERY item, Skill, Motif, recipe in the game to basically make a guide on everything ESO, so far its a 50+ page SpreadSheet listing everything in the game, including crafting mastery stuff, its crazy.TLDR: I got really off-topic there but point is this game is a 100% Recommended from me and my grandfather. And if anyone is wondering about guild medieval or The spreadsheet, their Page is GuildMedieval.com"
Positive,"I was really hoping to get into a fun MMOBut I was also really wanting to reply Skyrim...BAM ! ESO :DHonestly, I spent the extra 30 bucks for Gold Edition. Very much worth it. I started with a horse and got to play the best thing in Elder Scrolls (theives guild). Some areas will be more populated than others, and the amount of people online varies with time of dayBut thats any MMO... But unlike other MMOs, I can go for hours without feeling like I'm running into other players.Player idle animations (when other players are looking at their inventory or quest log) look like adventures searching through back packs or reading books. I really liked this touch. If you are looking to feel emersed in the Elder Scrolls universe, but hate MMO over crowding and text walls.ESO is the game for you. (All quests are voice acted!!). Camera perspective plays out just like other Elder Scroll gamesIf you are looking for a great MMO that moves away from boring grinding, then ESO is the MMO you been waiting for :DQuests progress you at a good pace, and some quests will even scale with you. So you feel challenged but not too under powered (or vice versa).Elder scrolls online is an amazing game. Nothing comes close to the experience I want out of an MMO than ESO."
Positive,"This MMO is good for adventure. It's great to play with my wife and explore where we choose when we choose. It's great to be able to play the class we want using the skills and equipment we want, without feeling like we ""have"" to have this or that (healer, tank, fill-in-the-blank). There's always an interesting story to be found, lots of loot to be found, and cool places to discover. I'm able to mess with the crafting while my wife plays with the outfit stations.A common complaint is that the One Tamriel update, allowing the freedom mentioned above, made the combat too easy and the leveling progression meaningless. I have the same complaint, however that's not really a downside in the bigger picture. This game is great for a more relaxing and enjoyable adventure with my wife, particularly when we want to unwind or explore. If I want challenging combat and a life-and-death struggle I'll just load up Diablo II instead ('cause I'm not a professional at that game but it's way harder than D3 or D4). I believe it's fine to play a variety of games and a game shouldn't be disregarded just because it doesn't have ""ALL"" the things. This one has basically everything else, set in an interesting and deep world. I enjoy my time in it and I would recommend it to others."
Positive,Feel  peaceful and zen AF when I play this game and the stories are intense.
Positive,"Dont buy for later MacsI installed without realizing the game requires an intel cpu but, i have an apple m1. make sure you have all the right parts for this game if you have a mac."
Positive,"I am obviously no veteran player, but I feel like I am at a point where I can review this game from a somewhat educated standpoint. I tried other MMOs in the past, played a lot of WoW when I was younger, though I was always more  of a casual. I also tried out black desert in more recent history and tested Rift and DC universe when they released. Now to ESO though. Graphics wise the game is pretty good, especially the textures are of high quality. The thing is, sometimes I feel like trees and similar environmental things haven't been placed densely enough, which can lead to giving me the impression that the zones are a bit empty and dry although the game is actually packed to the brim with content around every corner.  Maybe people will disagree with me but to me a bit more detail outside of instances would improve my immersion and enjoyment of the open world. The quests are good for MMO standards, mainly because they are all voice acted pretty decently and they atleast attempt to tell an interesting story every time. You can even make a Decision that will alter the outcome of the quest sometimes and in some cases you can even alter the game world a little, like freeing a town from attackers will lead to townsfolk returning, which both are really nice touches for an RPG fanboy like me. From a mechanical point of view however, the quests are really nothing special. They are really bland if you compare them to a single player RPG like the Witcher 3 but for MMOs they are above Standart. There just isn't all that much variety in the tasks you get and the writing just isn't good enough for me to actually pay attention all the time or care about the characters. The music is somewhat generic fantasy music but very well made. For instances, I haven't done a Trial yet, which is basically the ESO version of a Raid, but the dungeons are actually fantastic, beautiful to look at, incredibly detailed, great variety in both the astetics of the dungeons and their boss mechanics. Also they come in both a normal and a hardmode. For PVP I think this game has a lot to offer, small scale battle grounds which are 4v4v4 and the huge open world pvp zone of cyrodiil that comes with a lot of really unique mechanics and content that makes it stand out from all other MMOs. When there is a large scale battle in cyrodiil and your computer can take it, ESO delivers large scale PvP like its supposed to be. The game also offers newer players a lot of ways to enjoy the endgame content without forcing them to grind for days, weeks or even months like some other MMOs do. This is mainly talking about pvp, since the main progression system that you start when you hit level 50 doesn't count in battlegrounds and by simply choosing the right campaign it also doent count in cyrodiil. The only thing that will make other people stronger than you Stat wise is gear, which for the most part also isn't that hard to obtain. For me, the gold I earned from leveling was enough to get a foot in the door and I can now compete with players that have been playing wayyy longer than me as long as I chose a non cp (progression system disabled) environment to do so. Also the game has a skillsystem that allows players to basically build whatever they can think of, like a rogue healer for example, without punishing them directly for it. And due to the immense variety in which you can customize your build you can even make some crazy ideas work comparatively well. Another few nice Rpg touches are that you can break into Npc houses or kill them if you want, though the guards will be after you if you get caught. There is also player housing which I don't knowanything about, world bosses, solo dungeons, dungeons for groups of 2 or 3, a decently complex crafting system and lots of things that I've either forgotten or never heard of so far. Some more negatives to the game are that quite a bit of content, high quality content, is locked behind Dlc. The thing that really bothers me about this is that there are 2 things I'd consider quite an advantage are also locked behind Dlc. These are transmutation stations where you can change the trait of your gear, traits being very important, and jewelery crafting. You can get by without both of them but to me these things affect gameplay too much to lock them behind micro transactions. Also I generally dislike ingame stores but I think that for this game it's okay since really you pay 20 euros once, 10 if it's discounted, and you get a huge game for the money that you can play and enjoy for a very long time without spending a dime more. And if you really like it, you can still buy the dlcs. I might do so myself."
Positive,"One of the best MMORPGs you can play.  Don't let the large amount of DLC and the ESO+ subscription service scare you away!  Even just the base game can give you hundreds of hours of entertainment.  I had over 1200 hours before I even bought expansions or zone based DLC.Tips for new players:Start your crafting research as soon as possible, it is a very slow process.  I recommend a dedicated crafter if you are serious about crafting.  The same goes for upgrading your mounts, get started early, and remember it's per character and not account wide.  I recommend doing speed first, then inventory, and stamina last unless you PvP, then do stamina instead of inventory second.  Also take it slow, enjoy the story and questing on the first playthrough.  Follow a build guide if you need, you don't have to copy them fully, adjust to your style.The Good:- Soundtrack- Story- Everything is voice lined- Immersion- Questing- Graphics are nice, given the age of the game and what all it is- So much to keep you busy, questing, crafting, housing, PvP, events, etc...- The community is for the most part one of the best, a lot of friendly and helpful people and guilds- You can be in 5 total guilds at a time- While the game is better with friends, you can enjoy it just fine without anyone- Still coming out with new content- Very open to player choice on builds, you don't have to follow meta to enjoy the game- Lore, so much lore- Pretty decent controller support, it could be a bit better though.  I main controller for this game- Add-on support- The game economy is setup well and new players can still enjoy things unlike many other games where after years of play the economy is wrecked and new players can't afford things they need to progressThe Bad:- It's slowly becoming dated (2014 release) and could use some upgrades in graphics, servers, engine, etc...- Dungeon queue times are terrible, especially if you play as a DPS.- Expansions are slowly going up in price- Too many paid DLCs, its overwhelming if you get behind or are just starting and don't know which to pick first- Crown Crate rotation is slow, so if you miss something you're basically waiting for over a year or more to get another chance.- Server issues seem more common vs. other games- Storage size is up there, but it really it a pretty massive game when you look at it- First person camera mode is kind of meh, recommend playing in thirdOverall it truly is a fantastic game that you can easily sink too much time into.  I've played off and on since beta and it is nothing like it was back then.  If you didn't like it then, it's very likely not even the same game now.  If you're a Elder Scrolls fan or even just enjoy MMORPGs, give ESO a try.If you are still unsure, wait for a sale.  You can get the base game for like $10."
Positive,"Great game, after playing it nonstop for 20h, got outside and almost died in contact with the sunlight, but at least my alliance got a lot of points in the war"
Positive,"Tamriel is overflowing with players for a reason. Voted 'Best MMO of the Year' for a reason. Against a dozen other MMOs it took 2/3rds of the votes for a reason. Elder Scrolls Online *has stolen a 7 year dedicated WoW player* for a reason.ESO is the real deal dudes and dudets--people love this game and it is growing more and more popular by the day, attracting new players and THERE WAS A SUPER BOWL COMMERCIAL. If a commercial slot in the Super Bowl doesn't scream SUCCESS I don't know what does. To give you an idea of the significance, WoW released its first Super Bowl commercial back during Wrath of the Lich King, the expansion widely considered the high point of the World of Warcraft series, when it had more players than at any other point in its history.There has been a DRAMATIC improvement in ESO over its initial launch. It could barely be considered the same game. Bugs are gone, gameplay is improved (a lot), there is a ton of new content, and it is the game it should have been when it was first released. I don't think I've ever seen a development team get their shit together so well and somehow manage to polish a pile of shit into a diamond. ESO has finally made it and it's only going to improve as the game continues to grow. With Homestead released today and Morrowind coming in a few months, things are looking mighty sweet for ESO."

Positive,"Casual RPG with all NPCs voice acted, interesting quests, rewards for exploring and can play solo or with others. Scratches that Elder Scrolls lore itch too!"
Positive,I am very casual. I don't have the time like I use to for MMOs. So far I like this one. I think the storry is interesting. Not bad for $20.
Positive,i have no clue what i'm doingbut the game looks pretty
Positive,">Be huge fan of TES III: Morrowind>See this game is on sale for $10, Morrowind chapter included for free>Heard a lot about this game being trash>""Eh, I'll try it out, see if I like it, and I can always refund it if I don't."">Create character, do opening quest and walk around the Bitter Coast>Having an absolute blast>Check to see how many hours I've been playing>It's 4 hours>Can't even refund it at this point, don't care.>Explore and quest in Vvardenfell some more, kicking everything's @ss as a Dark Elf Dragonknight>""This game is cool but just doesn't have that Morrowind feel."">After a few days of playing hit level 10>Finds Nchuleftingth, a Dwemer ruin>Goes inside>Fight a bunch of Dwemer spiders and destroy them>""In Morrowind I'd be getting destroyed in a Dwemer ruin at this level."">Come across a Dwemer Centurion>""Yeah I can probably kick his @ss, this game has been really easy so far."">Engage in combat with him>All of a sudden 4 Dwemer spiders and 2 Dwemer Spheres come out of nowhere and start attacking>""..."">Get gang banged by the Dwemer Animunculi and die10/10, Just like Morrowind"
Positive,"I got this game outside of steam when it first launched and played my first char to max level back then.got into the veteran levels and abandoned it because of the sheer grind it became along with ""thiefs guild and dark brotherhood is right around the corner"" which ended up taking ages.However! returning to the game now (on steam) and seeing all these things added, new expansions and DLCs I've refound some love for the game and is actually rather enjoying it.It is a MMORPG, but in my opinion it can be played for the most part as a single player RPG.Having just one or two friends to play with however can massively increase the enjoyment of the game, especially since levels are scaling in every area and factions only matter on a pvp level.It has to be said that this game is nothing like a Elder Scrolls game like Skyrim even if it tries to be, so don't go in expecting Skyrim online, cause you might be dissapointed like so many others."
Positive,Worse Then Skyrim better then Fallout 76
Positive,"I just login to play some quests. Sometimes - with friends. Don't care about PVP, combat system, dungeon mechanics and many more things that are being frequently complained about.Just a good story and exploration - that is what I liked about TES games, that is what I like about ESO.The atmosphere and sound are really there, so if that's what you were looking for you'll like the game."
Positive,"The games got amazing end game, so much gear and content. ESO struggles to make early game fun though. If you havnt reached CP you feel weak, this makes a lot of players leave before they even reached the good parts of the game."
Positive,"The moment you've experienced a game where every single dialogue is voiced, other games might just start to pale in comparison. Yes, even that inconspicuous NPC in the most remote corner of the game world is professionally voice acted. Each corner of this game world unfolds a new story, an adventure lurking at every turn. Just pick a direction and start running; lend your ears to the happenings around you and before you know it, you're caught up in some dramatic quest, helping others or overcoming some danger. Suddenly, it's 2:00 AM, and you're contemplating if you should dive into one last dungeon before getting some shut-eye for work the next day.There's something for every type of player. Love to jump into a quick PvP? The battleground's got your back. Want to wage wars and sieges over vast terrains? Cyrodil is the place to be. Prefer a medium-scale mix of PvE/PvP gameplay style? Try out Imperial City. If PvE dungeons are your thing, there's a whole range from easy to super tough, including normal, veteran, and trial dungeons. For explorers, hundreds of places across dozens of maps are waiting to be discovered, complete with numerous world bosses, delves, and public dungeons. If you fancy a solo single-player experience, you can have it your way. Tired of the classic Warrior, Rogue, Mage classes? Feel free to wield a sword and shield while conjuring spells. Your proficiency grows with whatever weapon you choose to master. Played Skyrim and miss it for nostalgia's sake? You'll find Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, and more. Whether you want to be a thief or a killer, it's all up to you.Are there downsides? Sure, the company may appear a bit greedy with its loot boxes and the need to purchase new chapters with real money. However, all the other DLCs in the game can be indirectly purchased with gold. Once you've got the hang of the game, earning gold becomes child's play.Moreover, the versatility of gameplay this title offers is truly astounding. Crafting enthusiasts can lose themselves in extensive crafting systems, designing weapons, armor, or even brewing potions. For the lore lovers, there are countless books, scrolls, and notes scattered throughout the game world, revealing rich backstories and hidden secrets. Social butterflies will appreciate the in-depth interaction systems, allowing forming alliances, trading, or just enjoying a chit-chat around the in-game taverns.In a nutshell, this game doesn't just offer an RPG, it presents a living, breathing world that's waiting for you to leave your mark."
Positive,"My son is a huge Bethesda and Lord Of The Rings fan. When he played Skyrim, he never stopped and fell in love and still plays to this day. He heard about this game and could not let it go, so I bought him this game. His senior year in 2019 he fell even more in love. My son was born is 2000 so he is very young, but I saw him play this and watched at how it did takes skills and concentration. I began to play and cannot stop."
Positive,"After about 3 1/2 years and 1,500+ hours here's what I have to say. If you're a fan of the Elder Scrolls universe. You're more than likely going to love this game. The game will be overwhelming at the beginning. I sank in about 400 hours of solely doing quests before I actually started to learn the game. Follow the Zone Guide for each zone to help with the overwhelmingness of everything. You'll get your barrings eventually. The story arcs of each Zone and Chapters are enough to justify giving it a go in my opinion.With that said, ESO+ is nearly a must have for the Craft Bag you get. Unless you spend $40 for enough Crowns to get a merchant to sell to while out adventuring. And at $15/mnth it's just on the cusp of being able to justify getting it. This is one of the biggest drawn backs to the game. You already spent $20 (unless it's on sale) and you still need to spend more for quality of life improvements. On top of that, you don't get a mini map unless you get one as an add-on. This is an issue that causes people to steer clear of the game all together. And I fully understand why. There are other issues as well that occur. Such as game breaking bugs that take weeks, if not months, to fix. And a large portion of the vet player base left last year after a notorious update nobody wanted was implemented. And I don't know if those players will ever be back. I wish there was a mixed option here instead of yes I recommend and no I don't recommend. I'm going to go with recommend though because I truly love this game. For all its faults and the times it infuriates me. I still love it. There is something great about the world of Tamriel we are given. And I believe people need to experience that for themselves. So I say give the game a chance. And see if you fall in love with the world like I did. If you don't, at least you gave it a chance."
Positive,It's great. Just don't go in expecting Skyrim online.
Positive,Better than WoW
Positive,"Overall a good game, but there are a few things to consider before starting.  I have a list of Pros and Cons.Pros:*Good Class Balance, can do any content as any class*Level Scaling makes all content stay relevant and fun to do*Story Content is really good and deserve time to actually play through, and there is a ton of it*Overall good community of welcoming helpful players*The individual skill leveling and Champion point system makes it so you are never wasting your time, you are always progressing your character in a meaningful way no matter what you are doing.*Item sets from early content are still used and relevant to have in end game/new content, making all game content worth doing to some degreeCons:*The servers are trash, expect to be dropped from the servers whenever there are a lot of players online*quite a few bugs that seem to be left unaddressed*The game has no system to stop people from queing for dungeons in incorrect roles, expect lots of fake tanks/healers in your dungeon ques*Pay to win, the game allows you to gift people crown store items so there is an active crown for gold economy.  *There are manufactured in game issues so that they can offer the solutions behind ESO plus, without ESO plus you get half the inventory space in your bank, half the items placed in your house and you dont get the craft bag (infinite materials bag)The game itself is a lot of fun, it is not at all like a traditional MMO.  In a lot of ways it feels like a single player RPG that you can play with other people if you want to, and I like that personally.  The game makes you want to waste your time, and I am hooked.  If the servers worked and the bugs got fixed this would be an easy 10/10 but until they are fixed its an 8 /10 from me.  100% worth a try!"
Positive,"I think the game is great, but if you really want to experience the full potential of the game, you have to get a subscription, which is about 12 (or 13?) euros a month, or a bit cheaper if you get 3 or 6 months in advance. I equate that to the cost of a movie, so it's not a big deal for me. The game is huge, and I've been playing for 6 months and have explored a lot of open world but I'm not even close to end game. The community is entertaining and helpful (usually). The performance issues...well, they are there, but it runs mostly smooth for me. I think if you play a lot of PVP, you might notice a few more issues with performance. The PVE side of things runs better, I believe. The combat is great for me, but I haven't actually played another MMORPG, so I don't know if it's better or worse than what else is out there. There's a ton of armour and weapon types and sets with all sorts of bonuses, tons of crafting (which is why it's a good idea to get a subscription, so that you can get infinite inventory for crafting materials, although your weapons and armour inventory is still limited). I love Tamriel and the world of the Elder Scrolls, so I enjoy the lore a lot, although the quests can be a bit boring and not very engaging. The dungeons and trials are a lot of fun, so I highly recommend that, and in-game trading is fun too. So, I'd say it's a good idea to get the game and give it at least 6 months of play. I don't think you'll be sorry. I plan to play more, so I'm happy with it."
Positive,I played a bit. It's alright
Positive,"I received this game as a gift and took to it immediately. I'd played Skyrim for a long time and I'd become a bit bored with it. ESO's developers have outdone themselves with the amazing graphics, depth of the DLC and the stunning world they have created. I am also an ESO Plus subscriber and having this has really enhanced my crafting. It's wonderful to have unlimited slots for crafting items and it's easy to level up within the crafting system. There are many different characters to choose from and three main groups to choose from, completely diversifying your experience.Another bonus is that the community is amazing. While there is the usual ""zone chat"" issues, I have never been disappointed when asking a question. Friendly help is almost always around. Being able to belong to five guilds has opened up a whole world of trading opportunities. The guides and the Wiki have many indepth walkthroughs for those puzzles you just can't seem to figure out. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a great MMO."
Positive,"While technically Buy to Play, I will say that the monthly subscription adds certain things that are very easy to get use to, so I personally consider this game Pay to Play. That said, onto my....Pros:* There is a huge amount of content, so if you get bored of one things you can always do something else.* Play with friends as long as you own the content. The open-world is set up so creatures scale with your characters level, so you can do things with friends regardless of level differences. Dungeons do have level requirements.* Play your preferred class in any of the holy-trinity-roles Tank//Healer//DPS. Each class is capable of filling any roles with the right selection of skills and equipment.* Very little gating in the game. Most of the content you can access without jumping through hoops or being forced to do specific content such as story. In fact, the storyline across the DLCs can be done in any order you want, even without completing the base story.* For those that like to decorate homes (I do), you can own multiple houses, in fact I am not sure there is a maximum number of properties you can own. And houses can be purchased with cash as well as in-game-gold, and you even get a free small-apartment for each of your characters.Cons:* Because you select the role you are playing, you can get ""Fake Tanks and Healers"" in content like dungeons where you group with random other players, so that they have less que time to get in. (Fortunately does not occur too often, but it does happen.)* If you are inclined to pay cash for things, it is Really easy to spend a lot of cash on things like purchasing new houses and other cash items.* I personally did not enjoy the base storyline, and there are parts of Coldharbor you have to complete it to be able to get to. (Generally speaking, I enjoyed the newer story much more then the original and some of the earlier ones.)* Adult Advisory: A portion of the players actively participate in 'adult behaviors' I personally do not find suitable in an MMO, and the developers take a very serious view on such behavior when minors are involved, so if you do engage in such be certain all participating are of age as it is a bannable offense.Summary:* All said and done, I highly recommend this game, and think it well worth the cost. It has a good community as well, with many willing to help others out, whether they are new or long-time-players."
Positive,"Maybe 1k hours is because I left the launcher running, but the other 6.5k was enjoying the game. More serious note, as with all MMOs the quality ebbs and flows based on the newest content. Necrom is the latest chapter as of this review and it is a better update than the last two (not terrible, but nothing outstanding). Community is pretty good, but starting to show its age as people migrate to newer games."
Positive,"Pretty much the most entertaining game I have ever played. There are a TON of things to do, places to explore and activities to participate in. I got the game when it first launched, and I got to admit it was a bit dissapointing, but the game that was launched back in 2014 is nothing like the current updated game. After countless and frequent updates they manage to keep the game very entertaining. If you're looking for a game that will provide hours of fun and captivating gameplay, I strongly recommend buying this."
Positive,"I really enjoy this game.It has strong smilarities to skyrim which is what initially drew me to this game. Although it's different enough to still be new and exciting.The quests are ALL voice acted which was a total win from my point of view. It is really easy to emerse yourself into this new world.Most activities/quests are soloable, and for the ones you might struggle with the community (in my opinion) is always ready to help. I've had no problems in getting aide to fight big bosses or clear dungeons and everyone is usually pretty friendly. There is a strong RP community if you are so inclined. For those that dislike rp don't worry, they keep it to group chat for the most part and it will not effect your gaming experiance.I have a fairly old computer but have no problems running this game on maxed graphics, the graphics are just a step up from skryim although not that noticably. Combat is fairly smooth, with few bugs.Other pros:- It's FREE to play. No subscription.- the mounts have a more realistic movement which can make some of them look a little foolish (bear and lion). I list this as a pro as I really like their attempt at realism in their animals.- leveling up your mounts carry capacity also increases you own bag slots.- Some of the specialised attacks have amazing animations- some of the scenes are down right stunning (background and foreground)- interface is easy to use and you can play with it hidden, with ease.- crafting is similar to that in skyrim and easy to navigate.- with some quests you get the option to be evil (kill someone) or good (save that someone). This seems to effect what the npc's say to you as you ride past them, but does not effect the quests. It can however effect your rewards for that quest though. ( I list this as a pro because I like having the option to kill an annoying or stupid character rather than save them)Cons:- questing can drag out a little, especially when the quest itself seems a little foolish or pointless.- Player market. Now to me this was a big con. The market is different depending on the npc you talk to as each npc is owned by a different guild. Only the guild that owns that npc may post listings. But anyone can buy them. So unless you're in a guild that owns one of these npc's you won't be able to sell anything for a profit. Not all guilds have this npc either, so be careful when joining that you ask if they have one and where it is. I found this aspect to be a massive pain in the ass as I like playing the market and selling my crafted goods in other mmo's as it is an easy and simple way to make gold. I do understand why it has been done this way, and it is an interesting system and idea; but as a new player this was just frustrating as I could not find what I needed easily. Because all the npc's are seperate markets they only sell what the guild posts. They are not universially linked. So you need to go to each one looking for what you need and for which one has the better prices. This can be extremely frustrating as these npcs are spread out through many maps and cities and traveling between them can take alot of time.- LFG system -  doesn't really work. You can sit there for hours and never get a group. It is faster and easier to recruit from chat instead. There are many other aspects to this game that I enjoyed and that I didn't enjoy, but I will still continue to play it and I recomend that everyone here at least tries it once."
Positive,needs more sex
Positive,An Argonian asked me to test a potion. After drinking it I saw a Mammoth being chased by a cat while screaming for help...Say no to drugs kids
Positive,"I am a 49 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently downloaded ESO and in less than a week, he had already played for over 30 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
Positive,"The main thing I like about ESO is how accessible it is. You can go to any zone, start any quest or chapter/DLC, and have fun with your friends no matter the level gap (aside from endgame trials and things like that of course). I am around CP500+, if a friend started right now, we could both party up and share quests and dungeons and world events, and just have fun.ESO is also a great solo MMO. You can solo the quests (which are fantastic btw), dungeons, delves (think mini dungeon), public dungeons, etc. The majority of what the game has to offer can be played by yourself, only certain dungeons, trails, and world bosses/events need a group. Those world bosses can have random people join to help anyway.As someone who has IRL commitments and can't play as much as I'd wish to, being able to solo content is great. I don't have to rely on spamming chat for help because I explicitly have to group. The community is great too, finding a helpful guild made my ESO experience so much more fun. The world is beautiful with a ton to explore."
Positive,"After 100 hours, I have finally designed my character and started playing.*I will rewrite this review someday and clean it up*The Elder Scrolls Online or ""ESO"" is not a normal ""Tab Target"" MMORPG game. It is instead more action oriented like Guild Wars 2.  Where you use your Left Click to attack, and Right Click to Block with your various skills that effect your attacks and defenses on your number bar. You can also sprint and roll/dodge within combat depending on your stamina stats.The base game alone (without  getting any DLC) is really big. Lot's of quests, lot's of pvp, story content, you have access to the larger portion of land out there. You also do not need to subscribe monthly to enjoy this. In fact there is no reason to subscribe unless you want more bag space, monthly ""crowns"" (The mostly cosmetic premium currency), and after you've played most of the main base game you can then play the DLC's with said sub. There are also a lot of bonuses I won't go into detail. This game is not Pay to win really, and PVP is very expanse with various metas changing and freedoms of your weapon and skill choices mixed with class. Want to shoot a bow? You can. If you want to sneak around, steal things, pickpocket npcs, and assassinate some player, you can do that as well with the right setup and learning. Or go the Sword and Shield route. Perhaps you like magic. Become a Tank,  Healer,  DPS, whatever you like. Overall ESO, has a lot of different things in it that may be enjoyable to someone specifically. You have your usual fishing everywhere, various crafting methods such as Black Smithing, Woodworking, or making clothes and jewerly. Even household furniture and yes by the way, there is an in depth house decoration system once you can afford one if you save your gold or get crowns."
Positive,"I don't know what I can say about this game that my playtime listed here doesn't already say.  It's the only MMO I've played since I bought it, and coming from over 10 years playing WoW and about 5 playing FFXIV, I play only this game now and haven't looked back in thousands of hours.I started playing the Elder Scrolls series in 1997 with Daggerfall, and since then one of the series has always been at the forefront of my collection as a go-to.There is something immersive about the characters you can create here.  My character here is one I could never bear to reroll.  I had a Priest in WoW with over 2 years of playtime on that character alone, and still never got the feeling I get with my Sorcerer in ESO.This game has more quests than... I've ever seen or imagined.  In the time I've played, I mostly just solo quest and still have not even come close to putting a dent in the quests.  I mostly fight to keep my quest log from being full.  I've never seen so many voiced lines of dialogue and so much story in a game.  Ever.For an MMO, it's EXTREMELY solo-friendly.  Any class can perform any role or solo.  I play a Sorcerer, but wear plate and carry a sword and can solo just about anything.  I always like a good solo-oriented MMO when I want to do my own thing.I highly recommend this game to anyone up for adventure and story, especially if you're an Elder Scrolls fan."
Positive,"Fun game, but much more fun to play with a group of friends. The game has a great story, but it feels too large to explore. I recommend the game for big fans of the series. If you are a new fan of the series and want an online Skyrim then this is not for you."
Positive,"Update: Difficutly issues seem to be fixed.Pro:- Best MMO out there at the moment. (Trust me I played them all there is no match for ESO's fair progression system and the loads of content)- No subscription necessary- Action Combat System for each class (Thank god. I can't stand WoW-like ""right click to auto  attack"")- Great Dungeon Design. (if they were as difficult as in earlier builds of the game)- Awesome lategame content.- Story has many great moments times 3.- Dialogue is 100% audio. No reading required ;) (Acting ranges from very good to poor)- Not much grinding.- Impressive PvP- Fair progress for non-subscription players. - Fair payment model (subscribing makes you able to buy the content so you don't need to subscribe forever and you still can enjoy the content)- More response to your achievements than in Skyrim (you really feel important at some point)- Many different ways to play a single class (the 4 classes feel like at least 8 classes)- Many customization options (even for non-subscription players)- Roleplayers and normal players coexist in peace.- Flexible group sizes.Cons:- Since recent patches: TOO EASY- No AoE Taunts (have fun tanks)- Questing in a group feels odd at times because they become too easy (Dungeons are the same)- Community isn't as lively as in WoW- 1-2 more classes still wouldn't hurt"
Positive,"I love this game, it has me hooked. The game world spans 3/4 of Tamriel (so far, and Cyrodiil is far bigger than in Oblivion) and has its PVE and PVP nicely seperated. All of the 3 factions main quests and most of the guild main quests can be done completely solo, and once you've levelled up some, a lot of the public (non instanced dungeons) stuff can also be done solo. Much bigger story than Skyrim (including all side quests) and each of the 3 factions has their own, so a good of solo content right there, all of which can be played in first person, with grapics not far behind the new Skyrim remaster.PVE now thanks to the One Tamriel update consists of being able to do ANY of the solo, public or group quests/dungeons with friends from any other faction, at any time, which was not always the case and comes as a very welcome addition to most players. You can explore together, share quests with your group, do delves (mini dungeons), public dungeons (designed for 4 players but solo-able at higher levels), group dungeons (designed for 4 high lvl players) and trials (12 player dungeons).PVP is mainly based on interfaction war between the 3 allainces that takes place in the whole of Cyrodiil, capture the enemies castles and strongholds for your own alliance, allowing a larger fast travel network for you and your teammates around the vast region. Alliances are also always looking to take and control other factions Elder Scrolls, which give buffs to the team that has them. I havn't PVP'ed as much i have PVE'd but i do enjoy both and the option is there to lvl up your chars using either (once you hit lvl 10) or both.There is also a new option for players to duel any other player (that accepts), which allows people to ""safely"" test new equipment/skills before delving straight into faction war, which is pretty neat.Overall, an absolute plethora of Elder Scrolls content for both solo players and people who want to play with friends for a very decent price."
Positive,"This is only my alt account. I've been playing for ten years now and I've had many breaks, but it's still the game I play. I have spent a lot of time and money if you added all that time up, but I always felt like it was decent value for what I got out of it.There's a lot of content now. Overwhelming amounts of content, for new players, probably, but even if you only buy the most basic version you will have hundreds of hours playtime, if it's your cup of tea. No game is everyone's cup of tea, but I've gotten several friends addicted to ESO (sorry about that, friends).Buyer beware that while the entry point can be very cheap if you just buy the base game on sale, if you're weak to the lure of cosmetic items and loot boxes, you can easily go real life broke trying to buy them all. I feel like the game has gotten more and more grindy over the years with dailies being added for every DLC and event, I rarely have time to play any of the actual content if I let FOMO push me into doing dailies (usually I only do them when there is an event and special rewards tied to them). You don't need to pay for the monthly subscription, but the convenience and value of the sub is really quite significant. Unless you're very tight financially it's worth it, IMO."
Positive,"In an age where paywalls are becoming the norm and most MMORPGs are either f2p grind fests or require subscriptions to play, Elder Scrolls Online is a fresh breath of air. Is it flawless ? no, it has it's rough edges here and there, but it is indisputabely one of the best MMORPGs in the market now. If you expected this to be Skyrim online, you will be dissapointed, but the core pillars of the Elder Scrolls franchise are still here. And the ridiculous amount of unique quests available with their own small story arcs is simply mindblowing. The main story may not be something to write home about, but some of the side quests are the best I've seen in any game. Zenimax continues to update the game with both free and paid content, and assuming they keep up with the same quality they have been delivering since Tamriel unlimited, this game has a bright future ahead."
Positive,"So, where to begin? It is a beautiful game no matter where you are, and even on lower settings it manages to look really good. There's so much to explore! I've put in hundreds of hours into this game and have barely scratched the surface of all the content. The atmosphere is amazing and there's tons and tons of items and outfits/pets/mounts to collect (and they update the microtransaction shop regularly with new options if you are interested in that). The game may seem easy at first but it is very complex with the skill system. The dungeons have their own quests/stories so it feels engaging when you play them. And wow, the combat!!! It feels rewarding and exactly like it should be.Overall it is one of my top 3 favourite MMORPG's ever and I totally recommend it."
Positive,"Close your Launcher when you play this... Had  a lot of CPU spikes with it running, leading to a lot of lag."

Positive,"""It Just Works"""
Positive,"They really made a comeback with this, the game is actually good now. Hands down best mmo."
Positive,"Making an MMO interesting and enjoyable is a complicated art. Zenimax and Bethesda did not really master it.THINGS I LIKE- Compared to any other Elder Scrolls game, this title is a significant technical improvement. Say, it has very good visuals, while not being extremely demanding resource-wise (for a modern game, at least). I often stop somewhere in the middle of exploration and save a screenshot. I mean, like, wow, they even made flowing water, so now a river is actually a river rather than a body of static liquid. The combat is a bit more diverse, too: they added actual dodging, so you can evade enemy hits instead of taking them all. Exchanging blows until somebody dies has always been the default combat mode all the way up to Skyrim, and it always felt stupid to me. Some effort has been put into usability as well, so the game is more comfortable as far as interface is concerned.- Another positive feature is, obviously, the unlimited Tamriel. Save for a few of territories which are DLC-only, the entire continent can now be explored. This ensures you an eternity of discovery, treading everywhere and looking around, finding new places and seeing new people. It’s an explorer’s dream. And it’s the Elder Scrolls universe, a true magnet for any fan of the franchise.- I can also note an interesting approach to balance, which was designed to keep all players equal no matter how far they have progressed. Thus, any region and any quest can be done anytime, and the amount of challenge it’s going to provide will remain the same. It has some drawbacks, though, of which I’ll be writing below.THINGS I DISLIKE- Combat is boring. Encounter an enemy, perform your usual routine of battle moves and see it dead. Well, sure, having a set of abilities in addition to the ordinary left mouse button clicks is great, but it doesn’t improve the situation a lot. The difference, basically, is as follows: in Skyrim your battle succession was like “attack – attack – block – attack – attack”, and here it would be “ability 1 – ability 2 – ability 3 – ability 4 – ability 5”. You will repeat this ‘12345’ dozens of times, and that’ll be it. I could also add that the abilities themselves are not quite spectacular, so I don’t really find a lot of enjoyment in practicing them.- Magic is very unremarkable. The rich variety of Skyrim spells is replaced by a small bunch of dull skills, most of which have quite limited usefulness. Tactical use of spells is nowhere to be found: you can’t exhaust enemy stamina with frost or drain enemy mana with lightnings. Visual aspect of magic hardly exists at all: it’s rather basic, I might even say featureless.- Balance has a major psychological flaw: there’s no progression worth speaking of. This will require a couple of examples.1) You’re level 10 and you crafted a sword. The sword does 1000 damage. You have then progressed to level 12 and can now craft a ‘better’ sword. However, your old level 10 sword now deals 900 damage, and the new level 12 sword does exactly the same 1000 damage. You can develop your craftsmanship to great heights and forge yourself a set of level 40 dwarven armor, but it will have exactly the same stats as the rusty iron cuirass you had when you were level 5. Basically, you cannot become better – you can only keep up to be as good as you’ve already been before. 2) Most combat-relevant stats are measured in thousands or tens of thousands. Bonuses you gain from developing your skill lines or from using special items are usually lying somewhere around 3-5%. This effectively means that your attempts to improve will hardly improve anything. Yes, you had 10 000 health before, and now you have 10 500 health. Technically, it’s an improvement, but actually, it’s the same 10k as before. - Speaking of armors, different types of equipment don’t have any drawbacks – they only have benefits. You will not move slower or spend more stamina in heavy armor compared to light armor. - Group challenges are achieved through simple multiplication of enemy health. If a dungeon is intended for a group of 10 players, the mobs will have x10 health. This is your challenge. Sounds exciting, right? Big bosses will also have skills that would oneshot you; somebody obviously thought that it would add complexity to the gameplay.- Many mobs are all the same, just having different exteriors. Here’s a bandit throwing a dagger at you, here’s a dremora throwing a dagger at you, here’s a goblin throwing a dagger at you. The same set of skills is often found throughout the entire range of enemy variations. Wildlife does add some diversity, but to a certain extent only.- Presence of other players is often annoying, especially in public dungeons: every new visitor makes enemies respawn. They will often respawn right on top of your head and overwhelm you with numbers; you won’t even be able to run for your life, because the mobs you killed before have also respawned behind your back.- A number of quests is not very well developed either lore-wise or logic-wise. Some look as if they were hastily compiled. It’s a minor thing, but it breaks immersion sometimes.OVERALLFor an Elder Scrolls game, this is a good product. It’s perfect for walking and sightseeing, and whenever the servers are not very populated, you can just imagine that it’s simply another singleplayer title in the series, where the entire world belongs to you only. It preserves some traditions too: for example, Ayleid ruins are reproduced with exceptional attention to details – exactly the way they looked in Oblivion. It will appeal greatly to any explorer-type player.However, even though it might seem to be enjoyable at first, the gameplay is not very entertaining. Many things are boring and repetitive, and interactions with the environment do not provide much excitement. Of course, there are player-to-player interactions as well, but they can just as well be found in any other MMO."
Positive,"I have bought the game again for one reason only. Cheaper transactions but this depends on which country you live in.First of all, I've played this game since launch but it was awful back then that I stopped playing within 2 months then only came back early 2016. I am still playing this game until now because to be honest, It is really hard to find an MMO that can replace ESO's innovativity when it comes to MMO genre. Now let's talk about the negative reviews of people complaining that the game is too expensive/has a lot of micro-transaction. Before I begin, let me say this to you, it is plain ridiculous! Ridiculous because these kids didn't get what they want but in no way a necessary purchase. Secondly they expected ""Skyrim Online"" but it isn't. To give you an insight, This game doesn't have any kind of paywall that is in anyway a form of Pay-to-Win nevertheless cash grab. Another thing that you have to pay is somewhat overpriced COSMETICS but you are not obligated, forced to pay, nor in anyway necessary. Lastly, ESO plus crafting bag, the root of most of the complaints. Another thing that is not in anyway neccesary but only for convinience. Before you react on this part, crafting was already designed this way since the beginning where ESO plus is still non-existent.To further conclude it, if you are looking for an MMO that is a non-tab targetting, almost complete freedom in classes, focused on both small scale & large PvP warfares, and has a very rich & fully voiced PvE content then ESO is the right one for you. However, if are an envious person and don't have enough money to buy cosmetic stuffs, expecting Skyrim online, and have enough patience for a lurning curve then stay out in this game because trust me, you'll end up bitter & hateful like the rest of the haters whom are stuck playing those grindy asian MMOs."
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online is a game that should not be compared directly to any other Elder Scrolls game. Do not go in expecting it to be Skyrim extended etc, because you will probably be dissapointed.However, this is a well crafted MMO. There is plenty to do, the progression feels good, level up rewards are neat, the exploration is extremely relaxing and the environments are beautiful. If you choose to subscribe to the game the subscription package is a nice deal but the base game still offers loads to do. In general I have a minimal number of complaints about ESO. The quests can feel a bit wooden sometimes but on the whole the various stories are varied enough that carrying out quests is enjoyable.I spent over 100 hours playing with no subscription and although it didn't put me off personally, it is a significant hinderance to play without a subscription. This is the main gripe I would put forward with regards to this game, it does try and persuade you to subscribe in the wrong ways. If you start playing and enjoy the feel of the game and world, then the chances are the subcription with be very worthwhile, but you are not in the wrong if you feel annoyed about the way they try and get you to subscribe, playing with very limited inventory space is irritating for most.Load times can be pretty slow sometimes but the voice acting is great, the music is fantastic, mostly everything else is great and overall it's a good experience. A decent game."
Positive,"I decided to refresh my review of ESO after a few more hours of game time. One thing I will add is I've NEVER reached max level or even come close (highest character is 22, lol). 200 hours and only level 22? Well I have several characters at 22, but I have so much fun in this game doing other stuff that I tend to neglect my leveling. The main setback is Role-playing. Ive deleted so many characters, and made so many characters just for role-playing. Ive never enjoyed Role-playing until I tried it in ESO. The community has been great for me, so many friendly, interesting, and odd people and characters in this game. In all the MMOs ive played it was a race to the top for me, I'd try to take things slow, enjoy the lore, learn of the world, but I always got bored. But in ESO I have so much fun playing the game that I have never really cared about my level (though lately I've been interested in PVP and plan on finally leveling a class, any suggestions?). In the MMO market, almost all MMOs are about the late game, yet I've managed to have tons of fun in ESO's early game. From quests to RP to community events. I've managed to put in over 200 hours. Is it the best MMO? That's subjective, none of my RL friends like that game. But I do, and for those people that just want a fun game, I can recommend ESO.Pardon my English. It's my native language. Americans, amirite?Oh, Zeni, Could we get a class that doesnt have so many magical effects? I'd love to be a ""magicless"" warrior! (yes i know of stam builds but there is always that class ability you just cant pass up)--- Outdated Review  ---Makes characterStarts QuestingStops Questing and runs around the worldGets slaughtered by 3 werewolves in Cyrodil.Keeps exploringLickpicks a simple chestdecides to quest againhits lvl 14looks at clockHOLY ****! I played for 70hrs?Maybe not the ""best MMO""... but damn I love it.*I was going to fix it, but y'all can keep laughing... Lockpicks*"
Positive,"After playing Oblivion and Skyrim on my PC, I have found ESO a satisfying transition.  I loved Skyrim and miss the awe-inspiring graphics of that game.  I don't have a gaming PC, so performance and graphics in ESO aren't as good for me as they could be.  That being said, the immensity of Tamriel and the diversity of quests keep me fully entertained.  In comparison to other online MMO's, with their rich and attainable house furnishings, I wish it was easier to find home furnishings (besides building blocks) and that more furniture and pets could be placed in the smaller homes.   My favorite thing about ESO is the continuity of lore and culture throughout the game.  I love The Rift, it still has the same feel as Skyrim.  I highly recommend ESO for it's immersive quality and endless adventuring!"
Positive,"Steam players don't get what they paid for. You won't be able to log in to your account several days because of a two-years old error Zenimax is not willing to solve. It's even worse for those who subscribed ESO+.Actually the game is very good, just don't buy in steam.Huge and beautiful world with numerous areas.Atmosphere are on the high level.Easy and universal character creation allows you to create exactly character you want.Here is so much stuff, and so many quests, quest log is always full.PvP and PvE worlds are not connected to each other.Possibility to play both third person and first person.There is no need to buy a subscription, all DLC can be obtained for in-game currency from players.You get free daily items. Some of these are boxes only available in crown store.Buy that if you are a fun of the TES universe."
Positive,"I played during beta and was thoroughly unimpressed. I reinstalled on whim a couple of months ago and was pleasantly surprised to find that the game had much improved. While it's still not the Elder Scrolls MMO I would have designed it's still very good and the removal of the monthly sub makes it worth keeping around.Random points: It's still a thempark MMO, with all the pluses and minuses that entails. The justice system is fun and adds a lot of flavor. Going off the beaten track is worthwhile to find things most people will miss. Elder Scrolls fans will find plenty of juicy lore bits."
Positive,"Absolutely rammed with content, and since the subscription drop and a welcomed addition of the Crown Store, Elder Scrolls Online finally feels like the game it was set out to be. Having recently completed the main storyline I can tell you that this is a superb game, surprisingly good graphics and excellent dialogue.  I was worried that the story wouldn't live up to the Elder Scrolls reputation but it truly delivered. Addictive as hell and one of the best ""worlds"" I've ever been sucked into! Highly recommended."
Positive,"Okay, so first off I would like to state a few things so you understand my point of view of MMOs.I 9/10 times don't like traditional MMOs at all because they don't have that fun single player feel of an RPG like Skyrim. That being said I will be the first to say this, ESO doesn't play or feel like an MMO combat wise unless you want it to feel that way. I always wanted to try this out before I had a good enough computer to run it back when it first came out. I since have played it from when Morrowind was the only expansion to now when we have Elswyer. A few quick great things about Elderscrolls online that make it worth playing: Great story telling, Expansive world, 3 Different factions that all have their own story line, PvP and PvE content are fun and scale from Noob to Hard mode, Great community of players that are helpful and funny usually.First expanded point on why I recommend this game is, because as much as there is a DLC system in-place most of those DLCs aren't required to experience the full experience the game has and wants you see. In many cases DLC have actually gone free like Morrowind and Summerset are full expansions and are free with the purchase of the main game. Recently they made imperial city free as well! Story: The main story is the one I have fully made it through due to having friends I agreed to play the others with. However, the main story if you love Elderscrolls and its lore you will get a kick out of it. I have a lot of fond memories of the main story and even the stories that you have for your factions. Choices: While I cannot speak for a lot of other MMOs I can tell you that the choices you make in ESO can be noticed like most Elderscrolls games which I find very cool. That adds great replayability on other characters cause quests can't usually be repeated on the same character unless its a daily quest.End-game Content: So most people might assume the game starts when you start at level 1 and work your way through the game. I would say the real game starts after you hit level 50, that's when doors start to open and the game gets 10x more fun as you can start preparing to make your ultimate build style you enjoy. PvE and PvP both have End-game content to go with these changes for your character. I have played a few of the mid-game PvE and PvP and I can say they are not on the easier side of things.PvE: The PvE in this game is super fun and most of it is actually soloable the only things you can't solo are dungeons and trials usually. The most fun I have had comes from a good dungeon with a decent group to do it with. All of the stories are soloable too so if thats your thing as well you can do that too.PvP: Okay the PvP has a few different modes you can partake in, personally my favorite is the full on full scale battle for Cyrodiil. It pits the 3 factions in a large map against each other trying to take and hold as many keeps and towns as you can as well as other objectives like holding the elderscrolls in your possession. This is the most fun as with a good day you could have like a 20 v 20 castle siege going on with actual siege weapons as well as assaulting the enemy team with attacks and siege weapons. The other mode similar to this is the DLC I mentioned before Imperial city, so if you love PvE and you love PvP this merges the 2. Where their are capture objectives in the city much like in the other parts of Cyrodiil, but the area is riddled with Daedra and powerful boss enemies roaming the streets. It doesn't end there though.. Under the city is a huge expansive sewer system that is filled with small corridors and enemies from Oblivion and other factions possibly. The last PvP thing is a game mode style PvP arena where you compete against 2 other teams of up to 4 players to score points in modes like capture the flag, domination, deathmatch, a few other fun twists like a roaming capture objective twist on domination, and a hold objective of a relic that constant damages you and your team around you, but who can hold it and get the most points wins. There is a subscription that you can pay that is not super expensive per month and its completely optional but the benefits of it are great, you get all dlcs unlocked with it as long as you have a subscription. On top of that they give you premium currency to basically buy out the dlcs as you do the sub per month and then not care if you don't want to but their are perks to the subscription if you choose to go that route which I have done and was worth it especially for crafting.I would recommend this game if you love Elderscrolls and you always wanted to play with friends. This game is a blast with friends! Just remember, don't do Necromancy in the middle of the capital city of the province and you should be completely okay!"
Positive,"Currently addicted to this game. Thanks!+Beautiful game no matter where you are+So much to explore+Atmosphere is amazing (especially when wearing headphones)+Tons of items /quests +Beautiful graphics +Always something to do+Really good MMORPG+Lots of outfits/pets/mounts to collect-crowns are stupid amounts of money so are the items in crown store.The only things I don’t enjoy about that game are how long it takes to research some traits also crowns are ridiculously expensive! I’m also an idiot for buying stupid amounts of them, the cost of some items in the crown store are ridiculous but again I’m stupid enough to buy them…Overall great game and most people you meet are genuinely nice & helpful :P10/10 would waste money on crowns again.Update 2018 - I like it so much i play on EU & NA the grind is real__________________________________________________________________Update 2022 - Been a really long time since I updated this review and I don’t update reviews often as I normally feel there is no need to, however ESO is still adding new chapters and changes so thought I would update this review and give another 2 cents (:  (I apologise in advance if this gets rather lengthy)When I first started playing (2017 I believe) I was pretty blown away with the amount of stuff that you can do, the cosmetics, zones, housing, atmosphere and the fact there was always something to do. The more I play the more I have moments where everything just feels like a chore and not so fun, sometimes I absolutely love the game and everything it has to offer, other times I hate it and can’t be bothered with it anymore as it seems like too much of a grind, BUT I will always seem to come back to the game and find enjoyment from it one way or another.Chapters - My absolute favourite zone has to be Summerset (I mention that a lot in videos) it’s very bright and beautiful, loads of colour, a lovely amount of detail, great story and atmosphere, that zone for me always makes me smile and was the benchmark in my opinion for newer chapters. After summerset I believe came Murkmire (if you like Argonians this one is for you) the zone is extremely swampy and not my ideal zone but it was free so I can’t complain :D. Then there was Elsweyr, a rather brown desert looking zone but with some beautiful areas with grass, flowers, trees and greenery the story was fine and this chapter introduced a new class the Necromancer (a fun class but the skills lack in the way of summoning corpses imo) … Then we had Greymoor, off to Skyrim we go! I enjoyed parts of this zone with the snow and frozen lakes, the towns were nice but I noticed (at least for me yes everyone’s opinions are different) there seemed like there was a grey wash over the majority of things to make everything look dull, this could be because the chapter was about vampires and they suck the life out of everything but I’m not convinced lol. The story was fine I guess though pretty predictable.After Greymoor we got Blackwood, this is where they introduced companions. I was not a fan at first because it was as if they were trying to push a single player vibe in an MMO, however I don’t hate the companions and honestly, I only use them for company and screenshots SO MANY SCREENSHOTS WITH BASTIAN! Anyway, this zone was another that I felt was missing things it seemed rather baron and again felt like it had a grey brown wash over everything to make it dull and boring.I focus and compare new areas to Summerset a lot (maybe I shouldn’t) because as I mentioned it is my favourite zone, when I look at other zones such as Greymoor and Blackwood I cant help but see and feel like they are half-assing the detail and textures, there is no reason to make something as lovely as Summerset or even Morrowind to then just make every other chapter seem so dull and flat.When new chapters get announced and they are on the PTS, I always check out the new zones (no quests though) because it’s a completely new area I always find myself excited and I overlook things that I later pick up on when I get to play the zone more and play through the main story.ESO Housing - Housing is something about eso that I’ve really come to enjoy and I love nothing more than to make pretty little enchanted forests for my Bosmer BUT, housing in eso can get extremely frustrating, you have limited furnishing spaces however if you have ESO+ those spaces are doubled (what a con huh :D) how many slots you get depend on the type of home you purchase. For example, the Grand Psijic Villa (a notable home) has space for, 350/700 traditional furnishings, 5/10 specials, 55/110 collectibles and 5/10 special collectibles (if you have eso+ the second set of numbers is relevant). These furnishing spaces are the maximum that are allowed but only with the larger homes, if you buy a smaller home the limit is reduced significantly.My problem with this is the limit given even with eso+ is ridiculous, special collectible furnishings include things such as, non-combat pets, mounts and house guests and merchants, there are HUNDREDS of mounts and pets available and they also keep introducing new house guests, being able to only place a max of 10 in a large home when you have hundreds is a kick in the teeth imo. I want a forest filled with mounts and pets, flying and wondering around to make it feel alive. Even the limit on traditional furnishings is ridiculous as I personally enjoy making homes look lived in with tiny details and nick knacks. It’s just very limited and I think it should be increased to at least 1,000 traditional furnishings and special collectibles should be at least 30. I have strong feelings about the limited furnishings if you can’t tell :DEven with the limits I have managed to make some beautiful homes, but increasing these limits would just make it much easier and give players so much more freedom with housing.Crown store - Ahh the wonderful loot box scam (crown crates) and crown store items you feel like you MUST have because “cute and pretty”. Yes, I’m truly guilty of spending money on this bs… Crowns are a currency that you buy for real money, the conversion is ridiculous. Say you want the banker that’s 5000 crowns, you can buy 5500k crowns for £29.99 (UK) you pay pretty much £30 for an in-game assistant, total there are 4 assistants at the moment not including the 4 different variations of merchants/bankers... Crazy right. One good thing about the loot box (crown crate) scam is they have introduced a new currency called seals of endeavours, you can earn seals daily and weekly by doing the random tasks they ask, these seals of endeavours can then be used to buy items that are available in the current loot boxes (crown crates). The scummy part of this is the endeavours they offer are miniscule compared to the price they have items for in the seals of endeavour store. But, it’s a free, so I can’t complain much. Save up those seals and if a new set or old set of crates come around treat yourself to that special radiant apex mount you want for 16k seals!Overall, would I still recommend this game, yes. Even though I am starting to be more critical of the game as a whole I do still find myself coming back to it and getting stuck in (or addicted however you want to say it) :D. I still have things to get, places I want to decorate, characters I want to play and so on. I think that pretty much wraps it up though I’m sure there is more I will have to say at some point."
Positive,"This game is amazing.World doesn't get old like in other MMORPG's, so questing and exploring is always relevant and rewarding. Endgame is challenging, but it comes without pressure to do it in a haste. Expansions expand the game, but without forcing players out of older zones and content. I'm having the most fun I had in a while. Subscription is optional, and there is so much gameplay freedom.I wish I had started playing it sooner.Give it a chance, first levels might be confusing but if you press through them you're gonna fall in love with the ESO journey."
Positive,"Although it has some of the typical MMO grievances, like arbitrary wait times and over-priced cosmetics. The artistic designs feel different from mainline TES titles yet like they could exist, the combat is active but not difficult, the classes and abilities are thematic and fun, and the story and dialogue are better than Oblivion and Skyrim but not amazing.Even though I'm not a huge fan of MMOs, I found myself enjoying ESO, especially late at night when I can shut brain off and grind out quests. 7/10"
Positive,"After playing this game for over 500 hours, I think it's time to write a review. Before I share my experience with you about this game, I should tell you the reason I bought this game... Like many others, I bought this game because of the love I have for TES series. So after waiting 3 years, I finally purchased The Elder Scrolls® Online a couple of months ago. The first couple of hours of TESO was strange for me. The gameplay, the game design and everything else were different than TES series while it was on the same theme. But after a couple of hours, I started to figure out how things work and started to like it. For someone who doesn't like MMORPG games, this game is so satisfying. The community is great and so friendly and everyone tries to help you if you need help. To become a powerful player, you need to grind a lot but in the meanwhile, you can enjoy different quests and no need to rush for grind as the main purpose of any game is to have a fun time. I understand that TESO is a completely different game and has a different genre than TES: Skyrim, but what I miss the most and I loved to experience it in TESO was the music and soundtracks which are timeless. Anyway, besides that. I like and recommend TESO to everyone even those who don't play MMO games, like myself. One of the good features this game has is that you don't have to pay to win. with Crowns you can only make the game more fun and has no effect in PvP."
Positive,Product received for free from epicHi everyone!
Positive,"An insane amount of content, incredible music. The most solo friendly MMO I've played."
Positive,"I haven't played much on steam, but I did play beta.Tamriel Unlimited vs. PreTU/Beta: (Sorta :D)Beta was buggy as hell, anyone who played it would agree. Some people stuck with the game while others threw it out of the window.  Those who stuck with the game got to see it grow and develop into the wonderful game it is today.  Most of the bugs have been refined, with my ~4 hours of TU gameplay, i haven't seen any bugs yet (gameplay or graphical).  It plays really nice, the combat is fluid and feels very unique to me.  The quests (so far) aren't repetative, not even the side quests.  Crafting is really nice, I was very proud when I made my first set of Iron Armor.  Something really interesting about the game is that it seems every race has it's own armor fit for the body style of the race (if you've ever played Skyrim and seen the Orc armor, it's unique like that, the Khajit have there own style of armor a long with every other race, Iron armor for one race, won't look the same as Iron armor for the other Race.) < Now, does this mean that I can't be a Nord and wear the armor of another race? From what I've noticed, race locked armor is only locked in crafting until you find a set of books called Motifs which once you read them, you learn the corresponding races crafting style, but if you find another races' armor, you can wear it, I.E. My Nord Dragonknight is wearing Dark Elf Pauldrans and Helmet. (though... I stole them ;D)Enough of that, this is getting long enough and a bit sloppy (sorry). On to the features of the game.-Thievery: You can crouch and steal like in any Elder Scrolls game from merchants, if you get caught, you will get a bounty and guards will attack you.-Mounts: They started out with just horses, now they have Horses, lions and Guars (seen in TES III: Morrowind) -Raids: I don't have much to say about them, i'm only level 7 :)-3rd/1st person-Cyrodil is a warzone, all 3 factions vying for control of the Ruby throne in the Imperial City.  Guilds can control Keeps in Cyrodil.  I don't have much more information about pvp.-Explore ""Most"" of Tamriel, visit iconic areas like Skyrim, Cyrodil, Morrowind, etc.This is my largest review, I really hope it helped atleast someone! Thank you for taking your time to read this slop xD"
Positive,"Great game play, with so much to do. You really dont need the DLC's right away til you play for a while. Also the main quest story line is so awesome. Im so glad I gave this game another chance"
Positive,"Waiting for Elder Scrolls VI but playing Skyrim for the 10th time just doesn't cut it anymore? This game might be for you. But before you jump into a fresh new Elder Scrolls adventure, do keep in mind that this is an MMO - which isn't exactly your standard singleplayer experience.And like most MMOs it comes with the usual MMO nonsense:- Mediocre Combat- A bunch of other people running around doing their quests- Grindy unless you're willing to pay real money- Enemies respawning in front of you- Occasional server issues/queuesHowever there are some exceptions:- Very few (if any) ""collect 5 flowers"", ""kill 10 enemies"" quests- Fully voice acted interactions with all NPCs- The game supports a first person view (if you prefer to play it that way)Ok so you're fine with it being an MMO, but how does it compare to other Elder Scrolls titles? In terms of gameplay and visuals it's not quite Skyrim but it's more polished than Oblivion. The storytelling isn't groundbreaking but honestly it never was in Elder Scrolls.If you're still unsure, wait until the game is on sale and get the base version for $8. It has more than enough content for you to decide whether it's your cup of tea or not."
Positive,Got kicked from all 5 of my guilds after not playing for 2 days. 11/10 experience.
Positive,It's a quest that leads into 100 mores before you finish the first one.I'll spend my life researching new weapons 10/10
Positive,"Got a lot of hate in the beginning, they corrected their wrongs and the game is really fun now. So much to do and it feels to the RPG's. Community is really great, tons of helpful people. Roleplayers make the towns feel even mroe alive. Give it a try, you won't be dissapointed, unless you don't like these types of games. Then why are you even here?"
Positive,"This game is actually amazing.This is honestly probably the 2nd or 3rd best MMORPG in the world right now if you exclude WoW.The game people love to bash is a game that stop exisiting years ago. People like to make complaints about the game but have you ever seen any relevant complaints that are of the last fe wmonths? or even this year? This game had a very bad launch but over time it grew and became so much better.They dropped the subscription and made it optional (and actually worth getting) They made it so the map has no resrictions, you can go anywhere at any time.You don't have to be a specific level to fight a specific mob anymore, everything is scaled up or down and always feels challenging.The narrative is amazing, the story and the lore is what you'd expect from an elder scrolls game. There is not a single side quest I found boring or a chore to do. There is so much content, the PVP, castle seiges and hundereds of players fighting each other is a sight to behold. The customization of your armor, gear, weapons and skills truly make you feel unique, even if you have the same class as someone you will always feel different becauseof how the skill system is designed to have you choose different ""Morphs"" of skills that can completely change everything from the look of the skill to the effects and animations. The combat is solid, this game can be played frome ither first or third person and either feels great. You can use any weapon at any time and have different skill trees per weapon. You can kill, steal, assassinate and more. Honestly the options are endless and the world is beautiful. You might even find yourself spending hours just roaming around in the world looking at different countries and cities and their unique cultures and designs. You can own & furnish your own home and own pets too. For roleplayers this is a fantastic place to let your fantasies go wild. ESO may not be The Elder Scrolls VI. But it sure is an amazing Elder Scrolls game that is you are either a fan of the series or simply a fan of MMORPGs, this is an amazing game to have an amazing experience in.If all the hours playing this game have taught me something, It's the fact that there is always this overwhelming senseationt hat there is always something to do in the game, whether it be looking for materials to craft some new gear or trying to complete every side quest, delve, dungeon, world boss and etc for every region.This is honestly a game I feel you will not regret purchasing, I may not play it too much anymore but I sure cherish each and every memory I've created playing this delightful game and I'm sure you will too."
Positive,bought it for christmas... played nothing else since then...
Positive,Terrific as a single-player game.
Positive,everyone keep asking where is the amulet of kings but never how is the amulet of kings
Positive,"ESO It's definitely one of the best games in terms of online multiplayer RPG. A lot of missions with a good and rich story. Large and also small beautiful maps, various worlds, races and in general the whole concept of the game is excellent. There is much more that I have not mentioned here and written. But if you are interested, join us in the great and endless ESO world! All recommendations 10/10"
Positive,"I've always wondered what ""immersive"" meant. No matter how many games I played they were only this. Games. I never actually feel like I’m in there. Or even sympathized with character I was playing as. Just beat the game, enjoy the story, forget the rest.In ESO though, end goal isn’t important (I don’t even know for now if it even exist). It’s the road you take. You may go wherever you want. Do whatever you want. It’s quite bizarre for me cause I cannot fully put into words. It’s just, calming. That’s probably the best word. You’re out there exploring and nothing’s rushing you. Yea, sure there is some great treat to the world but it doesn’t linger too low so your head keeps hitting it. The Elder Scrolls Online is all about exploration and strolling the area at your own peace. I remember when I was just going for next quest when I’ve heard two Dunmers talking. They were sitting near bonfire that wasn’t lit. There were no quest or anything connecter to them but I could lit fire for them. And so I did. That felt amazing. Not because I got a bit of EXP form this. But because they thanked me. Normally I talk about gameplay, music and stuff like that in reviev. Those are great. They add greatly to that feeling of being there for real.Music is just like it Skyrim.  It has nice ambience, it fits so well that for most time I don’t even notice it. As for gameplay. You may go on killing spree and kill all enemies you see. Or you can just bypass them while going somewhere else. It’s all up to you how you play. And the game is gigantic. So many places to visit. To see. To explore. I’ve been here for only 60h (for when I’m writing this) and all I’ve seen was two small islands and two areas on main land. So that’s hardly even a beginning.ESO is a game I’d recommend to anyone. It just feels like freedom, just like a place to rest a little"

I am a main Imperial race in every each of Tes games, so when i was creating my character i was so unhappy that i chose Nord, it's the most brutal war crime that I've ever seen xD, i was joking but seriously that's bad.That's all thank you for following my review so far, if you have any opinion or i made a mistake in my review just let me know in comments below, if you enjoy this review and want more reviews like this just check my profile, god bless you all and Todd Howard."
Positive,"As a 107 year old retro gamer, this brings a fresh breath of new life into my gaming experience. Im astonished by the graphics, audio, and interactivity. I cant wait to spend many more hours on this game. Its great that fellow seniors play it its given me a chance to make many a friend and foe."
Positive,"1001 hours played, dozens of 'toons made, and plenty hours of grinding crafting skills and I still don't have the slightest feeling that I've accomplished anything....and that's part of ESO's magic for me. The sheer amount of content can be daunting, but ultimately you realize that the variety allows for infinite novelty. The community is for the most part non-toxic, over-helpful to noobs, interconnected through guilds (you can be in several guilds at once), and if you are a (minor) troll like I am there's endless dumb and/or silly costume choices and emotes for your hilarious and definitely not-annoying meme characters to strut their stuff around the Vvardenfell. Did i mention it allows mods? The good: see above. The bad: Don't think about it too much."
Positive,"My favorite MMO. After hundreds of hours and dollars into Black Desert, hours into Warframe, Vindictus, and Guild Wars 2.This game doesn't do anything perfectly, but it does everything *well*. Each of the above games have something that they did near perfectly, but they severely shartted the bed in other aspects. Elder Scrolls Online does nothing perfect. but gameplay, music, writing (better than Bethesda's own writers post-Oblivion), cash shop, subscription, all are done well.There are numerous bugs I've encountered ranging from breaking dungeon instances to breaking a character's ability to sprint/block/jump, to breaking your ability to finish quests. Holy fucking shit the bugs are numerous. In typical game dev fashion, these bugs have been reported numerous times over the game's lifespan, dating back to 2017 or 2019, with no fixes.You know that thing writers do in video games, movies, etc. where they feed you enough information that an astute mind can deduce what's going on before it's ""revealed""? This game is full of that, and it really does make you feel rewarded for paying attention and piecing things together. And who knew burying a digital family with almost zero backstory would be kind of emotional?"
Positive,"There's just so much to do solo, with a friend or in a larger group.  Very immersive and I absolutely love it!"
Positive,I keep coming back after even year-long breaks: there's always something new to try out!
Positive,One of the better MMOs available today. Combines the rich lore of the Elder Scrolls game with a fairly non-toxic community of players.
Positive,"Didn't play that long. Seems like a good game so far, tho'"
Positive,"Say what you want about ESO, this game is incredible. Despite being an MMO, it very much feels like an Elder Scrolls title. The environments are top-quality, and there is more content than I know what to do with. Even the subscription for ESO+ is totally worth the money. If you like TES, and you like MMOs, give it a shot. It can get complicated, but it's fun every step of the way."
Positive,"Hi all,Before reading my Pros and Cons about ESO. I personally recommend this game, worth buying playing it.According to my point of view, I have written ""+ves"" & ""-ves"" of ESOand with *** I mentioned items (Can be purchased through Crown Store (Real Money))+ Character Creation+ Voice Selection (8 voices to select for your character, choose wisely :)+ Race & Classes+ Quests+ Voice acting+ Big world to explore+ Recent Update ""One Tamerial"" no Level Restrictions and Server Selection (US or EU)+ Armour & Weapon Designs+ Other Outfits ***+ Character Personality ***+ Special Mounts ***+ Character Experience Scaling+ PVP (One Tamerial Update ""Now you can Duel with anyone anywhere"") Note: watch out for nearby Enemies+ PVE+ Skill Tree - Changes your play style (play your mage melee or rouge with staffs)+ Special Skills like be Werewolf or Vampire+ Guild Skill Tree+ Spells & Particle Systems+ Treasure Loot+ in-Game Acheivements+ DLC ***+ XBox Controller Support+ Pets ***+ Polymorph rewards for completing quests+ Festival Events+ Dying Costumes+ Emotes+ Graphics+ Some Addons+ Friendly High Level Players (According to Players Mood, it may vary)+ No Subscription Required (You could enable the Subscription anytime if you want special benefits like Double XP, etc..) + ESO can be played without Steam Client (If you bought through Steam) I'm saying this because some might have slow internet connection or concern about their FUP so you could just exit steam and Launch the Game directly. Note: If you want your game playing time to be tracked you have to play through Steam Client. Beacause I'm playing The game directly so steam can't track my game playing time.*Sorry If I missed any Positive game elements of ESO.. Maybe I haven't explored it..------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Maintenance Time 8 hours (most of the maintance were scheduled in day time) - Maintenance for Removing exiting Bugs and Create new one (for eg. After the recent maintenance, if my character personality is enabled sometimes my character use to stand on the horse while riding.. This was not happening earlier.. Hope it will be fixed and will receive a mystery bug soon) - Limited Mounts purchasable through in-game gold- No Barber shops to change your character's hairstyle (You have to purchase through crown store)- Some of the Crown Store Items are highly priced- If you bought a costume through crown store you cant dye unless if you purchase the dye directly from the crown store (But ESO plus members can dye the costumes)- Need more game elements too be added in-game for purchasable using in-game gold (like mounts, outfits, accessories etc..)*Sorry If I missed any Negative game elements of ESO.. Maybe I haven't found it..------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Neutral Points+/- Game Size  60+ GB (if you have high speed interent Connection then go for the digital copy otherwise go with CD)+/- Sometimes you may experience playing Elders Scrolls Online as Playing Single-player Online (Skyrim Online)...+/- Timer for Carry Capacity, Riding Skill & Riding Stamina... Actually ESO team might thought this timer will encourage the player to log-in daily, to increase the mount speed/stamina/carry capacity... Some might found this timer interesting.. But, I felt bored of the timer and atleast they could use some level restrictions to learn or reduce the timer or using some black market for high in-game gold... -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I would recommend you to play Elder Scrolls Online to expereince further... If you're about to buy... go with Gold Edition it contains 4 DLC game packs, Palomino horse mount, 500 crowns to spend in the in-game Crown Store. You can't play with Imperial Race in ESO Gold Edition.. You could upgrade with Imperial Edition to access Imerpial Race in-game... It's all up to you to buy it or ignore it.. Thank you for your time..Have a good day :)"
Positive,"If I could only say one thing about TESO, it would be this; think of this game primarily as an MMORPG, not an Elder Scrolls game. Sure it bears the same name as the beloved series, but if you try and play this game the same way you played something like Skyrim, with it’s incredibly open style of storytelling, you won't get the same experience, because the game is just completely different, in every way. Having said that, trying to turn the world of Elder Scrolls into an MMORPG is quite the task, and why I personally wouldn’t have decided to do it, I think they’ve done about as good a job of it as one could expect. The format of Elder Scrolls, with it’s incredibly free and open worlds, where most of the entertainment comes from the absurd, interesting little side quests, both is and isn’t compatible with the MMO style. On one hand, the Elder Scrolls quest format of sending the MC off to kill some bandits, find some cabbages, or hunt a troll works pretty well with MMO quests, but on the other hand, Elder Scrolls has always been more about the interesting and engaging characters that you bump into along the way, with stupid backstories, or the really overly confident, low level bandits that would boldly charge towards your level 80 character decked out in full Daedric armor, shouting variations of “You’re gonna regret coming here pal”. It was these sort of absurd, yet entertaining and engaging interactions that gave games like Oblivion and Skyrim so much replayability, and this style just really isn’t compatible with how an MMORPG plays. In an MMO, most of the entertainment comes from playing with other people, because in the search for that perfect gear set, you’re going to end up fighting the same bosses dozens of times, which without other people to play alongside, becomes pretty soul killing after a few hours. Like I said, I really don’t see why you would make the decision to turn Elder Scrolls into an MMO, (actually I do, it’s a little face with cartoonish dollar signs flashing in his eyes) but although the two really aren’t particularly compatible, that is by far the least of my gripes with the game. One big issue I had, was that the game looks awful. Not awful as in low quality, but awful in the sense that it looks like they really didn’t quite know what they were trying to do. It’s an art style camel, meaning that it feels like they put about 20 people in a room together to brainstorm the games art style, rather than making the right decision, and bringing back whoever worked on Skyrim, giving it a texture upgrade, better physics, and a saturation boost. Instead, you’re left with an art style that really doesn’t feel Elder Scrolls at all, but also doesn’t feel different enough to be its own thing. I know griping about the graphics of a game is the review equivalent of kicking a boxer in the groin, so I’ll move on. In an Elder Scrolls game, the story has always been more of an optional extra, rather than taking center stage. The first time you play Skyrim you’ll probably stick like glue to the main quest, especially if you’ve never played an Elder Scrolls game before, but after that, you realize the immense amount of content in the game hidden outside of the story. If you just follow the main story, you’ll never even brush up against a huge percentage of the things to do in the game, and unfortunately TESO just doesn’t have that same feeling. The story is very much functional, and while it isn’t as interesting as the story in Skyrim, Oblivion or Morrowind, it does it’s job and is totally fine as the main quest in an MMORPG. The NPC’s are a lot less interesting and unique than in previous games, the horses are no longer all terrain vehicles capable of ascending any obstacle provided you just mash shift hard enough, and the game is a lot less buggy than previous titles. In conclusion, The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited isn’t an Elder Scrolls game at all, or at least doesn’t feel like one, but if you do insist on keeping it under the banner of an Elder Scrolls game, my opinion is that it’s a pretty terrible Elder Scrolls game, but a pretty good MMORPG. It’s enjoyable enough if you don’t try to play it like a Scrolls game, and I managed to sink plenty of time into it without much trouble. If you’re looking for something to pass the time till ESO: 6 comes out, I’d say look elsewhere, but if you’re an MMORPG fan looking for something a bit different with plenty of low fantasy elements, I’d recommend giving it a go. It’s also a huge plus that the subscription service is completely optional, and only adds quality of life stuff."
Positive,"This game is amazing! From coop pve to coop pvp or just adventuring alone, it's addictive. It has unique character designs including image, style, and build. Each character brings something special to the table. Plus you can have your own house and design it how you want adding collectibles, furnishings, or crafting your own stuff to fill your home. This game requires a lot of experience to be good at it, but people are always willing to teach you how to ""get good"". This game is ""not"" pay-to-win"", however if you like your character to be spectacularly unique, then you can purchase many extra customizations for your appearances. You can earn/find unique weapons/armor and buy/sell/trade them. All in all, eso is life."
Positive,"Never played an MMO before because this one hates subscriptions and grinding, but this one tried this game in the free weekend and was so pleasantly surprised how good it is; graphically beautiful, huge world, hundreds of quests that one can do solo and one doesn't need any subscription to enjoy the game. It is also more enjoyable to this one because this one loves the lore and the universe of the Elder Scrolls games, having played Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim. In this MMO they can visit some of those places and there's just so much to do, and they can do it almost all solo if they like, which this one likes. Khajiit has wares if you have coin."
Positive,"I started playing in December and bought the base game at 50% off. I am now raiding in vet trials and participating in Cyrodiil and BGs and enjoying this game a lot. There are bugs, and there are imbalances, and ZOS seems to ignore everyone in the Forums with useful solutions to balance issues, BUT overall this game is great and I like the direction it is going :) (please ZOS, stop putting out new shiny content and focus on fixing what you have, you are going to lose people if you don't)"
Positive,"TESO and I have had a very rocky relationship.Our first date, during the beta, was a complete disaster. It was so incredibly dull and limited, and I had to pay for my own drinks! I was happy to lose the game's number and didn't look back for a long time.Some time last year, when there was a sale, I skimmed through the patch-history and noticed that ZOS have implemented a lot of changes that made the game more elderscrollsy, like a proper crime-system. I decided to buy the game after all, and I've since gone back to it three times.The first time I played it after my purchase, I was kind of surprised how slow the leveling was, and soon grew tired of it.The second time I played, I couldn't decide on a class to play and ended up just crafting and getting bored.The third time...the third time was indeed the charm. I still haven't reached level 50 on one character after 125 hours (highest level char is 35, 4 total chars, 1 dedicated crafter), because I keep jumping between all of the classes and do all of the quests- the classes are all fun within their limited scope. I'm a very experienced MMO bittervet, but this game has been like a second spring for me. Often I deafen on mumble and turn up my speakers, with ingame-music off, and just listen to the storms, the ambience, etc. of the game-world. Visually, too, this game is often impressive and immersive. All the quest-dialogues are voiced, and the DLCs they've been coming up with have been largely solid, with a promising future on the horizon (One Tamriel, housing, etc). The gameplay is pretty average, some of it feels great, some of it feels awful, it evens out. How much mechanical challenge do you really expect from a game offering 2 skillbars of 5 skills?I would recommend this game to anyone in a heartbeat (now that it's B2P), who wants to play an MMO casually, and for the sake of experiencing a fantasy world. If you are like my usual self and want to be competitive in an MMO, be it PvE or PvP, you might want to give this one a miss, the studio running the game seem to either be understaffed or inexperienced, as a lot of even long-standing bugs aren't being fixed (including big things like the LFG-dungeon-finder) and features that have long become standard in other MMOs are still missing from the game. Maintenance duration is often unclear, there are server-issues at times, and latency to the server often isn't the best.5/10 if you're a competitive and demanding gamer*, 9/10 if you can just enjoy the ride TESO offers and have a forgiving soul (and disposable income for DLC).*I have looked at some endgame dungeons and they looked alright, I think you can find challenge in PvE in this game for sure, just maybe not to the same extent as other games of the genre."
Positive,One of the best games I've ever played.
Positive,good game. 10/10 would waste my life in this video game.
Positive,"Let me begin with stating that you shouldnt look at this as an review but just a highly subjective opinion of a fairly new player. With that said let's see what do i think about Elder Scrolls Online.I would like to keep this pretty short so i'm going to start with little conclusion ( yes conclusion at the beggining - neat i know ) and then few pros,cons and few things i find in a middle here.For me personally this game only works if i play it as a single-player offline elder scrolls game ( as much as it is actually possible in a mmo game ) . Enjoying views , getting into quest lines, reading all the lore , basically trying to immerse myself into the world as much as possible . Now once i'm forced to interact with MMO part of the game it just falls apart for me. I've quit playing MMO games some 10 years ago and it was for a good reason and while ESO solves some of MMOish problems pretty well it's still an MMO game with all the unsatisfying things it comes with.And now few pros and cons and things i find servicible in this game just to illustrate my view of the game a little bit better.Great things : + Gorgeous environments ( mostly ) . While they are not stunning all across the board i still find myself stopping everyu five or so minutes to take a screenshot because of how enjoyable to look at this game can be at times  depending on a location.+ It's fully voice acted and while some of the voice acting is hardly good i still find it pretty impressive keeping in mind how much content this game has to offer .Middling things :+- Amount of content. "" How the hell a lot of content can be a bad thing "" you ask me ? Welp it's overwhelming at points. You can't move 10 steps without encoutering a new quest and it's can get really really distracting. And quality of quests are... hit and miss . Some immensely enjoyable , some just a chore to get through. I would prefer less but better quests.Things which are not so great : - Strangely enough a class system . Let me explain . Maybe it's because i grew up playing classic cRpg games but i find classes here really pointless and confusing. You can basically play any class in any way you see fit ( mage tanks and warrior mages ) and while that sounds good and gets you through a content i do miss feeling of really playing a class and filling a  definitive role. You can do anything and be everything but at the end you feel like ... nothing . I've already changed 3 characters and still cant find one which would feel 'right' to me.Now there are way more aspects of a game i have opinion on but let's just keep it on a short side huh ? I'm not that good at writting such things anyway. Just to close this i would like to state that i most definitely  can recommend this . I've paid 9.99$ for it on sale and already got around 40 hours from it and i think i'm good for another 40 for sure so it's just amazing value any way you look at it."
Positive,"For a video review, click here: For a text review, a draft of the script is provided below.The Elder Scrolls Online is a MMO that got off to a rather rocky start when it launched about three years ago. Look up any original review and you'll find a bad game; an insult to the Elder Scrolls series that you should never touch. A lot can change in three years though.If you aren't familiar, Elder Scrolls Online is an MMORPG that takes place in the Elder Scrolls universe a few hundred years before the third game in the series, ""Morrowind."". In a world where three factions fight each other constantly, each one made up of three different races, you'll find yourself solving quests, doing dungeons, PvP, and just about anything else you would expect from this genre.The gameplay of ESO is very interesting for an MMO. There are action based basic attacks that stay true to the Elder Scrolls series combined with skills that you can stick on a rather limited hotbar with room for five regular skills and one ultimate. So long as you don't play the game in first person then the gameplay is definitely a positive factor. The game was designed for third person with the way it's camera works and the indicators that warn you about certain attacks being outside of the first person mode's field of view. I LOVE first person, but I'm sorry to say that if you play this in first person you're going to have to deal with a handicapped gameplay experience, sub-par animations (Yes, first person has different animations), and difficulty with spatial awareness. In third person though? The game really shines. Each class can use any combination of many skills that adds fun and variety and the ability to mix and experiment to create a build that works for you, and so long as you don't touch PvP, then there's a lot of viable builds out there for you to explore.My biggest complaint gameplay wise is with the crafting. Crafting is designed in a way that you have to research traits for weapons and armor and gather designs for different appearances for them. The researching alone is set up in such a way that it will take you 238 real-time days to acquire every possible trait for weapons and armor. And that's if you are consistently on top of your researching and have already progressed in your crafting skill trees. That's a little ridiculous to me and since you need to do that on every character or designate one specific character for crafting, it's a turn off from the crafting system entirely.This game offers a LOT of content. It took me months to complete everything it had to offer. The dungeons are very unique compared to other MMO's dungeons. They feel notably harder. It's like the game stresses teamwork and communication and punishes you for a lack of organization. PvP is another thing that requires organization. I found that as a solo player, your PvP experience could be not-so-good unless all you wanted to do was run around killing random persons. You need a group to really be able to push any objectives in the three side free for all castle sieging mess that is Cyrodiil.Questing in Elder Scrolls Online is better than questing in any other Elder Scrolls game I've ever played. And to clarify, I've played Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim. The second being my favorite in the entire series. ESO's questing features more choices with more meaningful impacts than any other title in the series. It brings you to more lands than every other game combined and features characters far more memorable. Even better? It's ALL voice acted. There isn't one line of dialogue in this entire game that I could find that isn't voice acted. Every quest dialogue, every miscellaneous dialogue, literally every single line of dialogue in the entire game, and there's a lot of dialogue. Of course there aren't /enough/ voice actors. There's never enough. But there's more than there were in any other Elder Scrolls game. Some of these quests will tug at your heart strings, others will have you laughing your ass off, but most importantly, there will be at least a few that you simply can not forget. The game does not lead you to quests though, beware. It's an open Tamriel, and they reward your exploration of it's vast lands with quests and other loot. If you are not one for exploring, it's likely you'll never complete every quest the game has to offer. Especially some of the more hilarious side quests.The graphics in this game are understandably sub-par. Being that it's official release was in 2014 I would expect much better, but being that it is an MMO it makes sense why it is so bad. MMOs are not known for their graphics, except Black Desert. HOWEVER, if there is one thing I can praise about ESO's graphics, it is that it doesn't suffer from the same pop in issues many other MMORPGs do with characters and NPCs popping in thirty feet away from you /as severely/. Even with max view distance, there is definitely something left to be desired. And with this game's lack of and continuously degrading optimization? You're going to need a good computer to maintain a max view distance. And in some cities, 60fps just isn't possible unless you stand at the edge of it and stare out into the ocean rather than the city itself. Also known as Riften.The sounds, special effects, and music are all perfect for the game. I have no complaints, but then again no particular praises either. Housing is a great yet buggy recent addition to the game that definitely needs some work, but offers plenty to do for roleplayers and anyone who likes to customize their own domain including guilds setting up guild halls.Overall Elder Scrolls Online is a great MMO that any fan of the series should definitely buy. The base game alone at $30 can provide hundreds of hours of fun easily, and has already provided me with approaching two thousand hours with all currently available DLCs except shadows of the hist. ESO earns an 8/10 from me. Everything that's good about it is amazing. But with the lack of optimization, glitches that are never getting fixed, and how the servers always break every time a new bit of content comes out? It loses a couple of points. If I felt I could add points for the community I would make it a 9/10 easily, because this game has one of the best communities I've ever experienced in an MMO (As long as you avoid zone chat). It's a fun game with a lot to do, and at such a cheap price, why not pick it up today?"
Positive,"I mean, don't gotta pay monthly for an MMO, so that's cool. I can play by myself or with friends, solo experience is good enough to not need homies, IMO"
Positive,"do you like MMOS [_]do you like leveling for an eternity [_]do you like Elder Scrolls [_]if you said yes to these, buy this game why havn't you already, this is your game, for everyone else its fun for a bit but gets old."
Positive,"This game has the best quests in an MMO. Even optional quests have some depth. It's all voice acted, and NPC's say a lot of stuff. This is why the game is about 60 GB. In every allience you meet with different people and do different quests. I bought it on 50% sale and i don't think you need imperial edition."
Positive,"I love the Elder Scrolls Universe in it's entirety. Wherever you may find yourself. Be it anywhere on Nirn, or the several realms of Oblivion. The sights, cities, religions, cultures, characters, races, creatures, and the creation/destruction of everything we know. All of which has so much depth and history. One could say it's much like our own world. A whole universe that's been carefully crafted and expanded upon for years. Giving us, the players, the ability to explore it all at our own pace. This game is a Lore Haven, and given it's a very solo-friendly game with an amazing community. Makes discovering the Elder Scrolls Universe all the more enticing."
Positive,"this is not the same garbage mmo i played in 2014, it's a sprawling elder scrolls ecperience, i highly suggest anyone who likes the elder scrolls to give this game another chance, because nearly every misgiving i had 4 years ago has been fixed."
Positive,"Before the recent move to Steam I have already racked up a few thousand hours in the game. Yes I enjoy the Elder Scrolls in all flavours.The accessibility updates have improved playability somewhat, I was putting up with a lot.So when using Steam, no more typing passwords. The controller support in accessibility mode works well and we have text to speech, but only in chats.What would make this better for the visually impaired?I have two items on my wishlist if any Devs are listening:Ezpand text to speech to all text in game, this would be a massive help in the inventory and other menues.The more difficult one, but I still feel it's possible, is to have a Scout. Here's the plan, in it's basic form it would call out to help you pin point the direction you should be heading. This will get you to the map marker you are targetting, a boon. They can also tie into the perks you get guiding you to any plants, ore veins etc that you find whilst on your travels. Spotting range based on level of perk.There would still be the odd quest that would be problematic, but the above would make things so much better when soloing.Until then if you see someone walking into walls in town or trees in the wilds, it may be me. Say hi.Oh and if there is anyone who fancies helping someone who is Visually Impaired out in game drop me a message. I would love to set up a guild with people willing to help and gather others who are also visually impaired under the guilds wing..... I can dream.Oh and did I mention, I really like the game."
Positive,"So glad I gave ESO a go, extremely engrossing game! So much to see and do! Been fed up reading text in other MMORPG so the voice acting is such a massive plus for me!"
Positive,"Great game, gotta pay the 15 dollar membership for it to be worth tho"
Positive,"At release, yeah there were several issues for this game.But as of recent updates that majorly change the game and how it operates, I say this is one of the best Buy-to-Play MMO's you can get out there. Worth the money.When playing this game, remember that this isn't a sequel/requel/rendition or any related version like Skyrim or Oblivion. Treat this game for what it is, an MMO spin-off game set in the same Tamriel universe, but with other players running around. If you are looking for Skyrim-like experience, play Skyrim or Fallout 4.I hope you enjoy this game! Really fun action-based MMO!"
Positive,"PROS:Great Visuals.High Population.Epic Character Advancement.A lot of choices of builds depending on your play style.Fully supported controller on PC.A God damn big world map.Supports Addons to customize almost everything like WoW.Fair pricing.CONS:A bit hard to get into (play style and building is a lot more different than the classic mmorpgs)Levelling is somewhat unsatisfying (can hit max level with grinding on the same spot)Quest indicators are pretty bad, you'll have to google every time you get lost while doing a quest.Interface could have been more simple but useful.---Cons are related to ui imo but overall 8.5/10, still got the mmorpg spirit which is unique nowadays. Dont hesitate, you'll have fun even more fun with friends."
Positive,"I told myself i'd review this game after I hit the 1k hour gameplay. Turns out it happened the day after the release of Elsweyr Expansion! THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THE WHOLE GAME (Base, Morrowind, Summerset, Elsywer and the DLCs) and I hope it Will help you purchase or not this B2P MMO.Casually playing ESO since the Beta in Feb 2014, it has a rough start on April 14 2014 with bugs and glicthes as any MMO. The quests were mundane and unoriginal, the PS4/Xbone console release delayed, laggy Cyrodiil and any true Elder Scrolls Fan would not feel like this gfame is part of the series both for gameplay purposes and lore. Fear not it has much more improved! Yet it is still not your regular single player Elder Scrolls. This is the MMO prequel to The Elder Scrolls Series and one can only appreciate it by trying it. In short: ""Is it worth it to download over 80Gb of content during a free ESO trial weeken?"" The answer: YES.""Is it worth it to purchase it?"" That really depends on you but here are the Pros and Cons:Pros +- One Tamriel Update brings you a unique perspective to the MMO, you decide what you do, where you go, which quests you follow and which faction you level up and then change it all over again without rerolling! This is the true uniqueness of the series: Do whatever you want. Before this update (circa 2015-2016) your characters would be level zone locked and faction locked until late game like any other MMO.* The game subsscription is no longer mandatory and the subscription free system is not penalizing like other MMO; yo uretain what you've unlocked permanently, and you will see no pop up windows to push you the subscription. The only drawback is you won't benefit the 10%+ xp/crafting and you won't receive extra in-game currency (gems) fot the cash shop that contains unlockables, houses and cosmetics.* 6 classes but any build you want: Tanky mage with a healing staff? DONE / Healer Necromancer? Right in there* A rich quest line system fully voiced by veterans actor of the series.* Hours of content for RPGers and hardcore PvPers alike* Challenging Trials with a ranking system* On top of the Cyrodiil mayhem PvP area, there are now 4v4v4 battlegrounds and other combinations* You can join up to 5 guilds simultaneously accross your characters* An excellent crafting system wherea you crafted gear is relevant end game (until you loot trial content)* A gorgeous dye color and costume crafting array where you can recreate Super Heroes color costume or wear a full armor match. If you subbed then went freemium, you retain what you put on your armor.* The Mega servers make the communities alive and you will always have someone or a group looking to team up for large group content or RPG* The Housing system is expensive without $$ but some of them houses and land are larger than actual cities and can provide your own private area of grandeur where you can invest time and effort for your guild or RPG friends events* Fisher enthusiat are gonna fish* The cinematography is amazing for an MMO 2014 engine* The music kicks in when you fight and adapts itself to the live weather in-game* Should you purchase the Thieves' Guild / Dark Brotherhood DLC or not, you are allowed to steal and murder inncoent NPCs then get caught by city guards.* Some daily repeatable quests are amazing (albeit repevetitive) such as the thieve heist daily or Night Mother contracts* The game supports many addons and mods by the community* The game is bug free! (I haven't encountered anything wrong, except the few /stuck occasions)* You may become Emperor for your time (see cons)CONS -- The controls and combat system feels dull even for an MMO. You accept it or hate it.- Become any class with any build when you level up but only a few sets of build per class per role are optimale end game PvE or PvP- Challenging Trials are not that rewarding once you are in farming mode (unless you enjoy breaking new time/deaths record)- Cyrodiil is divided in a few campaigns that you may choose every few weeks but the best is the < lvl50 which you won't have access anymore at lvl 50+- The DLC dungeon are expensive for the little content they bring (usually 1 or 2 new dungeons and a few cosmetics)- The cash shop item are expensive in gems so BEWARE to any ""Collect-them-all' type of persons- Once you've cleared the whole story line quests (main story, 3 factions, 3 expansions) you feel there's only repeatable quests, PvP and dungeons/Trials left to do until new content arrives unless you reroll a new class. This is the case for most MMO.- The furniture system in your house(s) is a chore! Not sure if there's an addon/mod to help it- I was told the non-Steam client version of the game isn't compatible with the Steam Client version (you will need to purchase the game again then log in with your main account ..and give the 2nd account key to your spouse/friend?)- Because your guilds are account-wide and not character based, some hardcore pvp guilds would kick you out for rolling a sub in another faction.- Altough unlockables, bank space and Guilds are account wide, Achievements are characters based so ""Achievers"" will have to redo all over again for every new character they make.- You will not be crowned Emperor of Cyrodiil unless you actually play 24 hrs a day farming PvP points with your roomates for 30 days of campaignNEUTRAL:> PvP classes are more or less balanced, it's actually harder for the devs to find that balance> The Necromancer is déjà-vu but fun to play around with in an MMO> The newest expansion, Elsywer, provides the least content material than previous expansions> The newest expansion only comes on digital as opposed to retail Collector's Edition for the base game and first 2 expansions that have all included an art book, statue and some gimmicks> The game could use a new engine with better optional PhyXs elements and texture packs for high end computersI hope it helped sheer some light to you folks!"
Positive,"My husband and I wanted an MMORPG that we could play together, and this provided the perfect solution."
Positive,you can reinstall ESO now
Positive,"Let me start by saying I played in the beta. For ... roughly five minutes, before going back to my beloved Skyrim. It simply did not hold my attention at the time.I'm pleased to report that this has changed. The world is expansive and interesting. Sure, it's a theme park MMO - but it's a good one.Let's start with the quests. I've run into very few 'twenty bear asses' quests, and even those that are like that have lore and tie into larger quests, for the most part. Questing is really the best way to level, in my opinion - you can get more skill points that way, and run into more sky shards, lore books, and anchors - more on those later. Plus, it's just interesting. The stories aren't repetitive, and it's obvious the writers had some fun doing what they did. If you don't like questing, there are alternatives, however: primarily, stabbing things in the face. Repeatedly.So let's talk about combat. It feels like Smite, a bit. Every attack is a skillshot, borrowing from MOBA terminology - you have to aim manually, rather than just tab targetting. You pick five abilities, a quickbar item, and an ultimate - and that's really all you can effectively use in combat. Surprisingly, that's enough. You pick your abilities intelligently, and you can do just about anything. Case in point: my level 13 vampire. The vampire quest requires you to kill level 38 enemies. Do the math. If I'd had the right abilities from the outset, I could have been a vampire at ten or less.Which brings me to my next point - the customer service.See, I'd been a little too trusting when I was hunting out an ... alternative life state, let's say. I was offered a chance at being horrifically mauled by a werewolf, and I accepted, eagerly. The guy who specifically offered me a bite, however, demanded five thousand gold up front, something I could barely afford. Still, I was being trusting, and I gave it to him. He then developed a mysterious case of werewolf ED, and couldn't complete the process. In troubleshooting, he suggested I log off, and so I did - whereupon he left group and ran off.This sad tale got me a pity-bite from a vampire player, instead, which was lovely - but didn't get me back my gold.So I reported the fellow who scammed me, thinking it wouldn't do much but vent my frustration.Imagine my surprise when, the next morning, my gold was returned to me with an apology for the negative experience I encountered. The customer support representative did warn me that the market was very much 'buyer beware' and that they couldn't repeat this kindness - but really, getting 'bitten' once should be enough.So that was nice.Other things of note:- My kleptomania is reaching critical mass. I'm making a decent profit by stealing literally everything I can get my grubby little Bosmer paws on. I'm curious if every faction has this many people trying to take anything that isn't nailed down, or if the Dominion - with Bosmer and Khajiit as two of the three member races - just has it particularly bad.- The guards are OP, in other unrelated news.- The game is not pay to win, so I bought a couple of things off the cash shop - cosmetic outfits and non-combat pets. I also acquired the 'any race, any faction' upgrade. It's nice, but not necessary - racial perks are just big enough to affect playstyle, without being game-breaking.- The download feels like forever, even on a fast connection - I don't want to contemplate what it would be like on, say, my 1mbps friend's internet. It's a big download, because it's a big game.- Explore everything. You might find something awesome.- I can't honestly comment on PvP - I haven't tried it yet.- I don't have to pay a subscription to maintain access to Tamriel.- I disagree with a previous commenter - with the sheer volume of weapon, armor, and skill point choices, each of my characters feels and plays differently. I feel unique without being useless, as I try on a nightblade (rogue) tank, healer, and DPS - all separate characters. There's optimal - and then there's playable. Optimal is a small, niche market - you can play anything you want, effectively.So far, there are small things that bother me - Molag Bal doesn't encompass all of the portfolios he's given in this game, you know - but overall I thoroughly enjoy this title, and feel it's well worth the money I spent."
Positive,"I feel like I have played 8 games in one. The varying ""eras"" I have with ESO are completely different from each other. I just keep coming back and play basically a completely new game. I'm about to graduate, and looking back, this was for sure one of the best guilty time investments that I've made. I don't know what to say, except that even with all that I've done with this game, I haven't even scratched the surface. So I just keep coming back, and It's always rewarding."

Positive,"I'm OG when it comes to MMORPGs. Like really OG. Like... Ultima Online OG. And I bet you don't even know what that is. 'Corp Por', zoomer! Nothing will ever be as OG. Do I miss it? No.I have been hardcore too. Like really hardcore. Like... EverQuest hardcore. And I bet you don't even know what that is. Second job, graveyard shift. Drood goes ""PoA popped!"" and GL yells ""Everyone drop everything! GO GO GO GO!"" Split pulls without mem wipes. High lvl Funghi Tunic regen to pull state. 1 hr heal chains. Complete wipe after 5 hours because a cleric went LD for 20 sec. Another hour of corpse runs. Too late to continue. A competing guild is already inside the zone entrance, damn vultures, and will mop up the rest. Word gets around... Nothing you ever did in WoW or elsewhere will ever be as hardcore as EQ was. Do I miss it, the life style? Hell no.And there were the others, the pastimes and vacations from hardcore life in EQ. DAoC, EQ2, AO, SWG... And then you came back refreshed and with a sun tan, ready for the brutal grind again.Then came WoW, the reply to EQ. They pansied down everything into something... playable. No grind by comparison. Levels just flew by. Easy dungeons. Easy raids. Easy life. And it was fun to not have to be so serious. They also solved a lot of other problems, at the expense of player freedom, yes. But hey, good riddance, I suppose. Anyway, it lasted a long time, it really did. You can still play it. It's hooked up to a life-support machine. But most of us have already left since long. It was fun but we don't really look back. And besides we're embarassingly old.Somewhere during WoW's early decline Elder Scrolls Online came along. And either you were still invested in WoW or you felt finished with MMORPGs for good. Our degenerating twitch skills has pushed us towards single play. But that's fine because there is such a wealth there these days. So we pass on the ESO offer.But ESO is not a MMORPG in the oldschool sense. It's too rich and varied and different. It's an MMOSkyrim. You can play it anyway you like but what you don't find in it, to your surprise, is the exclamation marks, the text boxes with contrived, childish quest descriptions and then yet another dose of 'collect X'. In spite of it's age it's much more akin to our more recent single player forays into la-la-land. We discover this by accident after some Steam sale. And we feel right at home. We're too old to even listen to any whining about endgame life. We will probably never even get there. Sorry, too busy having fun and actually listening to all the quest dialogue.No, it's not nostalgia. It's here and now, amidst mortgages and receding hairlines. We know what we are, and we know what we need. It's there for you too if you like. Why don't you try it out yourself? Surprising as it may seem, MMOs apparently aren't dead yet. Or whatever you like to call them. We don't care."

Positive,Love this game from the day 0. <3 The only concern is your bag space. Its always full.
Positive,"Coming from someone who is a huge MMO fan, putting hundreds, if not thousands of hours into everything from Runescape to WoW, i can confidently say that this is my favorite MMO on the market. The Elder Scrolls Online experience is unlike any other. The combat is refreshingly satisfying even after reaching the point of near mastery. Does the game have its bugs? yes. Is it perfect? No, but is it fun? Extremely. I feel this game has something for almost anyone who enjoys playing MMOs, the lore and questing experience is honestly in a league of its own, featuring almost no cookie cutter ""go gather 10 wolf hides"" quests. The world itself is absolutely beautiful and the endless amount of voice acting really sets an immersive tone while playing. To place this game in the category of 'easy to play, hard to master' is fitting. The combat and overall mechanics of the game are unique and new player friendly. Prefer more of a challenge? Have no fear. The end game content in this game will push your abilities to coordinate with your team and master the combat system at its core in order to stand out and be truly successful. PvP more of your thing? As an avid PvPer i can speak from experience. to sit here and tell you that the PvP experience is polished, would be a lie. Is it still enjoyable and rewarding? I think so, others will tell you different. I will say that i wish ZOS put more time into the thoughts of their PvP community. To sum things up, i genuinely believe that ESO is the best MMO out right now, with a staff that is constantly trying to improve their game, and a community that is equally as hopeful for the games success, it makes for an unforgettable experience. Content ranges from casual friendly to brain numbingly annoying and difficult. The world is beautiful and will leave you immersed. Pair that with one of the least toxic game communities i've ever encountered, and it leaves you with a good time. Look forward to seeing you online. :)"
Positive,"I am a long time lover of mmorpg's. I started back in the day with dial up (24kbs modem) and Ultima Online.  I played Everquest from 1996 with try outs of Dark Age of Camelot , Age of Conan and Warhammer. When World of Warcraft arrived it was the next step and i played it for 14 years.  So i guess i have some background :)I was looking for a new game to try and after watching vids and reading about it , I was already loving the graphics and character creation.   I was intrigued about the game mechanics and class skill trees , which for me is where the rubber meets the road.The devs have done a really stellar job.  The Questing and Storyline are captivating!  I feel myself becoming friends with the principle characters and thier deep background stories that describe the world  that i am adventuring in.  The many options i have to tailor my character to my individual playstyle has been a revelation and imho stands as a goal post for the rest of the mmorpg creators to shoot for.   No choices are bad ones,  there are no min max cookie cutter specs that stifle my enjoyment and in other games  made me just another ""X"" .   I am not told what to wear , what my talent tree is and my progression is not limited to the drip feed some other games use to maximise thier subs (profits) .  Well enough from me ....  if you are an adventurer at heart ,  E.S.O is something i would recomend  :)"
Positive,"I put off playing this game because of how addicted I was to Skyrim and I didn't want to spend all my summer playing ESO. I bought it on sale and finally downloaded it and now my weekend routine is- Wake up.Make some ceral.Eat Ceral while ESO launches.Finish ceral and put bowl near my collection of other used bowls.Play game until I began questioning if I should actually do something productive.Screw being productive and play for another 4 hours.Between quests I eat some swiss rolls for lunch.Realise Dad will be home in 5 minutes.Rush to do chores and hid collection of used bowls.Continue playing ESO while eating dinner.4 am and I force myself to get off ESO.Lay in bed already thinking about playing tomorrow.Whelp, it was nice knowing ya world, I got to get back to killing NPCs and getting my butt kicked by guards.But seriously, this is a great game. It doesn't have the Skyrim feel to it but it does have its own unique touch. If your computer can handle the quality then it is a truly beautiful game:3 Even if you can't crank up the quality settings, the design is still very nice. Course you can't go five feet without someone trying to give you a quest but at least there are wayshrines so you can teleport when you end up in the complete opposite place you were trying to go.KEEP IN MINDThis is an mmo! The game is fun but playing with friends amplifies the gameplay. Plus there are world bosses that are impossible to beat alone. I would recommend buying it with a steam buddy because friends in game are slim."
Positive,"I decided from the start that I was going to approach this game as though it was single player. I've played a lot of MMOs (taking a break from 11 years of WoW currently) and needed something fresh. This game has been exactly what the doctor ordered. Everything you've come to love in the main Elder Scrolls series is present; a strong main story line, a plethora of side quests that keep you engaged in the world, the little touches out in the world that make exploration a joy. The addition of the MMO element allows for the world to simply feel more populated and ""living"". Each zone that I discover I spend hours and hours in, exploring them fully and loving every second of it. The combat system is deceptively simple, and does take some getting used to. With so many skills being attaching to your weapon type or guilds, the different classes can start to feel the same which gets a little frustrating. Auction houses are sorely missed, relying instead on using guild vendors and trade chat. Bag space is also extremely limited, espcially for horders like myself. At first I was okay with what became a complicated system of mailing things to different alts, but eventually relented and bought the Plus Membership. The shared resources bag that you get with the subscription alleviated that issue. Overall, a little over 100 hours in to the game, I would give it a solid 7.5/10"
Positive,just an unreal amount of very high quality content. Hands down one of the most captivating games I've ever played. Now that they've fixed the ping issue I can't say I'd change a thing about this game!
Positive,"As long as you don't join a guild, or try any endgame content, this game is fun and great"
Positive,"This is my go-to MMO between World of Warcraft patches. If you are expecting this game to be exactly like the actual Elder Scrolls series, you are wrong. The game is basically your average MMO but with an Elder Scrolls theme. If you love the Elder Scrolls series, this game allows you to access areas that the series does not. However, some of these areas require DLC to access so that might be a con for some people. For me, paying for the Morrowind expansion was definitely worth it for nostalgic reasons. The combat is alright but nothing too special. The music is wonderful but repetitive in some areas. Plenty of content in the base game (I don't even have the other DLC's except Morrowind). I would highly suggest this game if you like MMO's or a nice open world to travel around and do whatever you want. If MMO's are not your thing or you think that this Elder Scrolls game is like the actual series, then I would suggest that you find a different game. Regardless of your decision, thank you for reading my review!"

Positive,"I've been eager to play the Elder Scrolls Online (""ESO"") for some time now and when I saw that I could pick up the game for roughly E 7,- I was sold. Well, if you're used to Skyrim then this game requires a bit of an attitude adjustment; mainly because of the different controls and because the fighting interactions go a lot faster. Also your inventory restriction is now based on the amount of items you own vs. their weight.Still, it's something you'll soon get used to and before you know you'll run into familiar looking characters like the Khajiit or the elves. You can get quests either by following along the things that happen around you or by actively seeking out challenges yourself. I've been in cities which looked to be pretty quiet, merchants only. Until I found I shady figure, decided to talk to them and before I knew I was caught up in trying to figure out conspiracies and put a stop to several evil schemes. That was quite fun!Not a clear story though, which can overwhelm new players....The main problem for new players who are familiar with Skyrim is that ESO does not really have a main story. Instead the game consists of tons of so called ""DLCs""; additions to the game (only available in-game) which consist of a specific area which in its turn is filled with many locations to discover and quests to undertake. Note that I am not talking about DLC's (or 'expansions') which you can buy on Steam, I'm talking about in-game DLC; ""game blocks"" if you will. Once you finished such a DLC then it's time to move onto the next. So don't expect a ""main"" quest together with tons of side-quests: everything behaves in the same way.Sure; there are guides out there which can tell you which DLC's you can play (and in which sequence) in order to get a feel for an ""official"" storyline, but even so: it doesn't change the fact that there's no real ""story structure"" in ESO.Fortunately you won't ""just"" finish a DLC, there's some good playing value here. I've been going at it for a few hours and only put a small dent in finishing the amount of available quests (and finding specific locations) from a DLC which name I forgot. Still... once you do finish up then you're going to need a new DLC; and that's going to cost you. You can buy DLC's using ""crowns"" which is an in-game currency, but you won't earn these crowns from playing. You only get in-game gold (no septims) and I haven't seen any option (yet?) to buy crowns using that gold.Which is why many veterans would suggest that you consider a subscription, but only if you plan on putting a lot of time into ESO (so it's not a good idea for casual players!); for E 11,99 / month you get free access to all the available DLC's in the game, so you could keep playing for as long as you'd like.Yah, but that also makes me wonder.... why should I?Don't get me wrong here: I'm definitely having fun playing. I even decided to buy the upcoming expansion (""Greymoor"") because of that and I'm quite curious to see what they have in store for us. But that doesn't change the fact that I don't really feel rewarded for my efforts.See, while you may get better weapons and gear (and more money) over time the enemies you encounter will also grow stronger, the game levels up with you. Which means that no matter how powerful you'll become you're always going to deal with challenging enemies no matter what. See, in Skyrim (""Elder Scrolls V"") you'll notice that you've become a lot more powerful if you re-visit the areas from early in the game (like the woods around Riverwood). That experience won't happen in ESO.And sure, getting certain upgrades like specific animals (""mounts"") which can help you in combat may also make you look more powerful and intimidating, but do you really think other players would notice? Your friends perhaps, but for others you're just another random player who happens to have more stuff following him along. And there's tons of such players to be seen so.... not really very intimidating (or standing out) at all.So I figured I'd get myself a nice house. And fully furnished (which costs a little extra) so that I didn't have to bother myself with collecting furniture and such (also because of the inventory limits). So then you end up with a virtual place of your own. Yah....  Unfortunately that's also all there's to be said: you can't do anything in your own house; it doesn't even have a real chest for you to use! So no matter how many houses you own you'll always be stuck with your current inventory limitations and you don't get any useful perks from this.That's just demotivating.... and it makes me wonder: what's the use of progressing? Getting stronger? So will your enemies, so there's no real reward there. Getting better looks and mounts and such? You're not impressing anyone, besides: those mounts will only cost you crowns (which are bought with real money). Getting a house? Nope: it's just a static location without providing any interaction (other than sitting down somewhere) and there's plenty more where it came from. Sure, it could be easy that you can quickly teleport there without extra costs but who cares?Besides: eventually you'll finish the DLC's which you own after which there's nothing more to do. Unless you get yourself a new DLC of course... but for what purpose other than playing & enjoying a new part of the game?And that also shows the real problem with the MMO aspect: it quickly becomes obvious that you're in a game which was designed to keep you busy playing for a long time so that you'll be extra motivated to purchase more in-game stuff (like DLCs) using real money. But although it can be a lot of fun to explore yet another new area it doesn't change the fact that eventually it'll be more of the same without getting any really useful rewards. Because the rewards you do get are only there to make sure that you can continue playing (you get better gear so that you'll be able to stand up against the upcoming stronger enemies), they won't make your life noticeably easier. At best you get a bonus, but always for a limited time.ESO is a fun game and a really nice way to dive into Tamriel to learn a lot more about it. I also enjoy the fact that you don't really have to pay anything extra in order to get plenty of hours worth of playtime out of this. On the downside though it will quickly become obvious that this game was meant to go on forever. Until you purchased & finished all the DLC's after which nothing would really have changed.This game is definitely not comparable to Skyrim!"

Positive,"They use clever marketing terms to obfuscate and justify not delivering all DLC. They achieve this by calling new DLC a chapter. When a new DLC aka chapter is released it appears that in half the cases e.g. Morrowwind and Summerset are then in marketing terms magically called a DLC and provided to ESO+ subscribers. At this time Elsweyr is still considered a chapter. Functionally and through reasonable expectation these chapters are DLC. Effectively what this means to a player is that buying ESO base game and ESO+ will not give one access to all the content as stated in the description. At this time 2/16/20, one would still be required to buy the Greymoor edition and ESO+ to receive all content. This type of marketing has been the scourge of the industry for years and must be stopped.It is important to state that when one clicks play in Steam, a launcher is started, and a timer starts. Additional updates and installations will use 30 to 45 minutes of the two hours available for a player to determine if one requires a refund. After coming to the realization of what has happened and still wanting to obtain all content one could potentially get stuck with base game for $19.99 and still be required to buy the Greymoor pack for $59.99 or each new DLC individually which will cost more. Likewise, if one determined they did not want to continue and was able to refund you would still lose the ESO+ subscription fee purchased a minimum of $15.99. Missing the refund window could potentially even add the $19.99 for the base game coming to a minimum $35.98 loss.Please approach purchasing this title, DLC, and subscription very carefully."
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online or ESO is an MMO from the game series Elder Scrolls. If you haven't played a MMO but have played other Elder Scroll games just know that this is a tad bit different than what you are use to.ESO gives you full freedom of your character;Want to be a sorcerer tank? No problem.Want to be a night blade healer? You can make that happen!Of course there is min-maxing, how to get the ultimate heals, the ultimate dmg with this and this class. If thats what you like. But you can also tailor fit your character to work FOR you. And nobody will go protest or refuse to take you to a dungeon because you're not using x skill.Economy in ESO is unlike most MMO's, there is no one Auction House but guilds bid on Guild Traders making guilds more of an importance than just a group of friends.The only negative thing about ESO is if you're very poor. Not only is it buy-to-play, it also has dlc's. The DLC's is worth the money, you can buy them in the crown store and unlock them for your account forever. Or you can become a member of ESO+, ESO+ is a subscription type which in my opinion is fairly cheap. You can choose to sub for 30, 90, or 180 days. And during those days you get access to a few features. One of them being an material bank which makes life a lot easier. The other being access to all DLC's.So yes:+ Voice acting+ Fair sub model+ Freedom of character/skill/builds+ Huge world to explore+ Great dungeons (No afking, no lazydodling, you have to dodge, you have to be active and run around or  you'll die)"
Positive,Elder Inventory Management Online
Positive,"Hands down the best MMORPG I've ever played. The fact that nearly every character you come across has voice acting just makes it feel a lot more immersive. You can access all weapon and armour skills regardless of class which makes it very easy to tweak playstyles to suit you. And of course the quality of writing is very high, both in base game and DLCs. I highly recommend this to anyone interested."
Positive,Good to play with friends and family or solo Awesome game to buy on sale You don't need members to play the hole game it will just make you level faster and get more spaces to put your items you have collected also give you DLC up till the new one Warning: You will put alot of hours into the game 10/10Good luck out there in the massive world
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online has an incredible amount of content to do to keep MMO and Elder Scrolls fans occupied for hours. Originally, I played ESO on Xbox One in 2017. There I logged around 130 hours of game time and just barely scratched the surface of what the game had to offer (That might not happen for most people though as I was playing at an extremely leisurely pace). Anyways, I've re-bought this game on the release of its newest expansion, Blackwood. So far, I had a wonderful time questing, leveling up skills, and collecting resources in Tamriel and hope to reach the endgame unlike the last time I played in 2017.Now, one of my only complaints about ESO is that there isn't an easy way to buy all the DLC. Through the Steam store, the most DLC you can buy would be in the $60 USD Blackwood edition. In it, you have the base game, Cyrodiil, Morrowind, Summerset, Elsweyr, Greymoor, and Blackwood. While those expansions will keep people occupied for a long time, if you want to receive the rest of the DLC zones and dungeons you'd have to buy at least $100 USD worth of crowns and individually buy the other expansions in the in-game Crown Store. In the Crown Store, none of the DLCs are bundled for a slight discount except ESO's first four DLC. As a result, it feels daunting trying to decide if it'd be worth spending the money to buy the other expansions since it'd cost a lot. Thankfully, people are able to trade millions of in-game gold to others who can purchase the expansions for you through Crown Store gifts. This is facilitated through Discord servers such as Tamriel Crown Exchange and World Crown Exchange where you can rely on brokers or reputable sellers for safe coin to crown trades. So, the DLC is technically earnable, but one would have to spend hours farming gold to get enough to trade for one of the DLCs.Edit: Also, I dislike how to fully upgrade your mount it'll take 180 days or $100+ USD in crowns. This is per character (You can make 9 characters.) by the way and not account-wide. Having to slowly upgrade your mount on a fresh character is not fun since the extra carry capacity and speed from upgrades is a huge boon. Even if you're playing on one character at the moment, if you have any interest in trying another class/race you should make that character. This is so you can transfer gold to that character so they can start upgrading their mount while you play on your main character."

Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is an MMO I’d consider to be the best one you can play these days. I’ve played almost every MMO out there with World of Warcraft being the first one I spent well over a decade of my life in when it first came out. Obviously, WoW is a shell of what it used to be which is why tons of MMO gamers have left by the masses straight to ESO.I can honestly say the ESO community is one of the friendliest I’ve ever seen not just in the MMO genre but in all of gaming. They’re helpful, generous, kind, and truly make this an exceptional MMO experience. Besides that, the graphics, gameplay, quests, raids, and in-game events are all excellent. The voice acting is superb, the boss fights are epic, and the music is beyond amazing. The soundtracks for each new expansion that comes out are absolutely beautiful.There is a TON of content in ESO and most of it is free since it’s a free-to-play MMO, although I’d recommend getting ESO+ just for the inventory space alone when it comes to crafting. If you love Skyrim as much as I do, this is basically Skyrim online times a million. Everything is in here from dungeons, crafting, collections, and professions just on a bigger MMO level.The community is very active, there are many guilds to join if that’s your thing or you can just enjoy the game on your own and queue up for any group-related events. ZeniMax Online Studios have done an excellent job with ESO and it shows as it’s easily the No. 1 MMO worth playing today when compared to others in the genre.Overall, I give The Elder Scrolls Online a perfect 5/5 and would recommend this to anyone that wants a solid MMO with a thriving, friendly community, and incredible gaming experiences. Whether you want to quest, fish, craft, pets, mounts, or run raids deep into the night, there is something in ESO for everyone. This is the best MMO you can play at this point in time."
Positive,"It's like WoW, except the game devs probably don't do office crawls, and you don't have to feel guilty about supporting the game. Also, and a big also at that, the game doesn't look like a javascript short on addictinggames.com. Plus there's more content in this game than like... 2.629 games combined so that's cool too."
Positive,"It's a good MMO, one of the top ones currently, the only really annoying thing is the bank and inventory system that is extremely disadvantegeous if you do not pay for the ESO plus subscription, one of the biggest pros for me is that i have nobody to play with me and this MMO allows me to do a great deal of content on my own with a decent story! Most of the time anyway"
Positive,"It's okay, but there's a huge issue with the game. There's no direction on MSQ (main storyline quests) at all, and to make matters even more annoying and overwhelming, if you own expansions, you have an army of NPCs harassing you every time you enter a city or its borders, with no way to turn it off. Then there's the fact that the base game's map and systems are absolute ass, so you need addons to make it function as if a moron hadn't made them. I shouldn't have to install third-party applications in order to get around how poorly designed a game is. If a modder can fix it, there's absolutely no justification as to why Zenimax cannot. I'd actually compare it to World of Warcraft to new players. It's got basically the exact same problem, just not as bad because there's not as much content as there is in WoW. I would heavily suggest that if you want to try it, do not buy the DLC until you've learned the game some, maybe beat the base storyline. If you do not care about stories or experiences like that, just go ahead and jump into the latest content. 3.8/5"
Positive,Updated Review! This game really suprised me. Elder scrolls series never fails when it comes to making an immersive world that is stunning and full of neat places. Now for the pros and consPros-pretty good graphics--Main story line is only good because the guy who plays the prophet also played dumbldore in harry potter.-intresting quest-LOVE the character builds you can create-Dungeons-Armor creation and crafting-dark anchors Cons-Voice chat groups would be so nice on pc instead of having to join a teamspeak or steam call-Animations for combat (only when in first person)My Conclusion. Overall this game is pretty awesome. The world really pulls of the immersion I wanted. I'd get on only playing on playing for a little then I'd look down at my phone to see what time it was to relaize ive been playing all night. This game is probably one of the best games I've ever played and I give this game a 9/10!
Positive,"Good game with a lively community, enjoyable quests, but the updates are a bit of a hassle, taking up a lot of time and coming too often."
Positive,"If you like MMORPGS, that don't feel to grindy, and have a fun combat system, this is a game you should try. I recommend waiting for a sale like the Summer Sale, where you can get the game for about 10$."
Positive,"Thought I was just gonna check it out.Now I don't play anything else.Damn you, The Elder Scrolls, doing this to me again."
Positive,Send help. I can't stop playing.
Positive,I have no clue what I am doing.10/10
Positive,Highly recommended for people interested in the Elder Scrolls lore and who would like to explore regions not yet featured in other Elder Scrolls games.
Positive,"I have been a very active WOW player over the last 5 years and now that things have become quite dull in wow, I can say that it was my best decision to play ESO again. The DLCs, the character customization, the way you can build your character and level abilities and professions gives me the immersion I always was looking for in an MMORPG! I can clearly tell that WOW lacks at this kind of aspect and when you look at the world ESO it feels much more vivid and interesting. There is always some kind of adventure around the corner. If you have a few spare bucks, give it a try and I am sure you will not regret it!"
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online, is an incredible, immersive, and tremendous accomplishment by Zenimax Studios.  Bringing such a well loved and favored franchise such as Elder Scrolls to the MMO arena is no easy task.  After a little bit of a rough beginning they have definitely managed to bring this game into its own, as a Good Elder Scrolls Option.  It in no way, feels like a sequel, but accomplishes that Elder Scrolls feel, by using some of the same UI and game elements from other Elder Scrolls titles that the fans enjoy.  The Graphics are very Pretty and the engine offers you much customization of the visual elements.  The sound and voice acting is top notch.  The game supports Mods and allows you to add some quality of life addons.  There are plenty of character options as any class can use any weapon.  Allowing for some pretty neat character builds.  There is a monthly fee for Plus mode.  I enjoy having it, but it is not needed at all.  This is not a Pay to win option either.  It allows you to play all DLC but not Addons.  It offers some good benefits to have, but is not at all necessary.    Expansion packs are good.  The current one Elsewyr, lets you travel to the lands of the Khajit.  Very Cool.  The monthly cost doesn't cover Expansion packs though, only DLC.  However you can piece together all DLC if you want, Its alot of Content though, that you are going to want to explore.  I would recommend this title for sure.  If you can pick it up on a sale, even better.  But worth full price."
Positive,"This game kicks ass! o v v oFor those giving bad review about not being able to play.1.) You may have a bad computer.2.) Did you sign up for you account through their site?If yes, go to #5. If not, sign up and activate it through your email that you provided to the site.3.) Download the game4.) Manage your memory space before playing this game, because it will eat up more than 50gb of hard drive space.5.) Once you signed up, you need to copy and paste your cd key from the steam library from the game. (Do not launch it yet until you copy and pasted the code.) To do so, just go to your library, Right click to drop down the ESOTU game til you see the ""CD Key"". That is what you will need as you launch the game after the activation of your account is complete. Steam has not mention this to other players/steam users. So bare in mind of this. Got it copied? good. Now on to #6.6.) As you launch the game, if you fail to launch the game, reinstall it. This is a bug in the download, I have had that happen to me once. Once download is done, sign into your account and as you sign it, the game will show a ""login is incorect"" error. Meaning you need to hit ""view account"" through the game to their site. As you login, there is a ""redeem code"" section. Paste the code that you have copied from the ""CD Key"" to there. BOOM! There you go! You should have no problems to logging into the game. Got a problem with the game? Check the forums on it incase. ESO has made so much improvements from the last time I have played beta. It's pretty damn good. So give it a shot or just don't play the game if you are giving nasty false reviews on this game."

Positive,One of the best MMOs I've played.I love the housing system and now with Greymoor hunting antiquities is so much fun!
Positive,I've been playing for about eight hours today. What else can one ask of an MMO?
Positive,"Before we begin. I will just admit this right off the bat. Yes, the hours that I currently have and will have will not cover everything. I understand that, However. I did play the console version for more than the hrs on the PC version. With that being said. Let us begin with this review..Now to really start this review off. If your expecting a ""singleplayer"" experience. Like what the titular series is known for...stop reading this review. This is a MMO that has gone to ""Free-to-Play"" in the sense where if you buy it once. That is it. Just set up your ESO account and all of that stuff. And you can play ESO without the need for a subscription. Of course, there is ESO plus but that is purely optional. I also like to point out with the release of the Gold Edition and the One Tamriel patch. It makes the game much more worth it. Along with all the patches and improvements they have made. This game still has a long way to go. But i have confidence in Zenimax Online.The game starts off in the realm of Coldharbour. You are a ""prisoner"" of the Daedric god Molag Bal. Once you escape to Tamriel that is when the game truly begins. Each faction has their starting location, races, and classes to choose from. The game is amazingly beautiful with great visuals and artistic look, a great soundtrack and a great cast of voice actors and actresses. Everything you remember in the singleplayer experience of the Elder Scrolls is alive and well in this game. And lastly, This game has mico-rtransactions and a very ""busy"" PvP area. So keep those in mind. There are a lot of side activites, quests and stuff to do overall.So if you want an online experience to your Elder Scrolls. I recommend getting ESO. If you were hoping for a ""singeplayer"" experience much like Skyrim...it's best to avoid this. This isn't that kind of game you were looking for."
Positive,gotta touch grass after this one
Positive,"no, you can't piss on the dog. however there are several npcs scattered throughout tamriel that will gladly pee on your pets, complete with sound effects"
Positive,"Dont go into this game thinking its just another elder scrolls game. This isnt made by Bethesda developers. its from an outside company named Zenimax as listed above. It has all the lore, creatures and everything world related from the universe of elder scrolls making it a truly breathtaking experience to play as you get to go through all the areas from previous games and places not yet explored in the Elder scrolls universe.MICROTRANSACTION HELL. that is my only complaint from this game. there is an outrageous amount of micro transactions. not just small cute things. BUT SO MANY, FUCKING, MICROTRANSACTIONS. you cannot take a breath in the menu or customize or open your backpack without having 'TODAYS SALE' 'BUY THIS' 'BUY THAT' it gets very irritating at times because they lock so much content behind paywalls such as a storyline for Dark brotherhood..thankfully, if you buy the base game you get the morrowind expansion which is extremly gorgeous and unique from any other mmo world setting ive ever seen.the game is pretty grindy but listening to a podcast or music while playing this game can become very very enjoyable during grind hour."
Positive,"I didn't enjoy this game as much when I was skipping over lore, books, and dialogue. Once I stopped running at full ADHD over clock mode and stopped to appreciate the stories and plot lines I actually found much more entertainment to be had in this title. I played it all wrong all those years ago when it first came out on console, running here to kill this and that and coming back to run errands around town for whatever reason and going back out  to kill this and that, repeat. Once you stop to observe the purpose of your actions the game becomes more enjoyable for sure. Other than that the combat, crafting system, open world, etc is all phenomenal a top tier mmorpg. One of my all time favorites"
Positive,"Yes, I love the Elder Scrolls games, and this fits right in. A lot of people may not like the MMO style of the game, but it's built in a way that you can play the entire game solo if you want as if it's Skyrim. The option for multiplayer is always there, and there is only one specific zone for PvP if you're into that. Playing it as if it's solo is still very fun. I'd say give this a try, I played around 2000 hours on Xbox before switching to PC and having to start over which kinda sucked, but it is what it is. Started in 2014, with no intention of stopping. The game is huge now with many new areas, quests, etc to explore. Just the base game has a huge amount of content, so for the price, you're getting ALOT of game. Fun to play with spouse or friend and play essentially ""Skyrim"" multiplayer. Trade gear, sell it to other players on a market to in game. So much fun."
Positive,"I was VERY sceptical to this game, scrunched my nose at it when I heard it was in production, at the release and when my friends told me to try it. Boy, was I wrong...There is so. much. to. do. I love it.The main thing I have wished would change since I started was  bigger message when an achievement is completed, cause there are a LOT of them, many pretty fun. and the banner displayed is, to be frank, a let down.Give it a try, especially if you like listening and reading the quests. They are the best part of this game. It is truly a story being told to you. With hints, secrets, love, betrayal, loyalty and all the things that make fantasy great!"
Positive,"TESO did not come up with anything radically new and actually just dusted off the familiar mechanics of the MMO genre. But it offers them in a greatly improved coat of an otherwise traditional concept and, of course, in the popular world of Tamriel. For some it may be little, for others a sufficient reason to pay monthly fees and have fun.Jailbreaking and knowing that you have a higher goal is a big cliché in itself. What kind of chosen hero are you when you see dozens of similarly chosen people passing by? In previous The Elder Scrolls games, this model was accepted because it was a singleplayer game. But online with hundreds of thousands of players? And they are all chosen.Tamriel and his states create the impression of pomp, but later you find out that a large area also suffers from inner emptiness. To some extent, this is due to a graphic concept that lacks the hallmark of originality. The world around is desperately monotonous over time. What bothered me the most was when I came to a town or settlement and found that it looked exactly like the previous one. However, I would expect some specific landmarks or architectural differences - in short, more interesting ideas.The Elder Scrolls Online is an above-average game, but it expects a great deal of enthusiasm from man for the TES series, world and realities. The better you know Tamriel, the more you will enjoy it. Be sure to try the game, provided you don't normally play much online games or you're a big fan of The Elder Scrolls. I will definitely come back to TESO to see what the updates have done with the game.  70%"
Positive,"i don't have any friend to play with :< so i quit after 43h. Amazing MMORPG by the wayEdit: i am now back with full chapter , a friend and ready to dump hundred of hour in the game"
Positive,"Highly recommended! Very kind player base, everyone is willing to help! Come join us in Tamriel! :)"
Positive,"A friend of mine convinced me to give the Morrowind DLC a shot in ESO, and hey... ain't even bad.I think what is shocking for me, is the amount of quality of life improvements that they poured into this game. If you go for the casual approach, this thing just works wonders! You can do any zone on any level because everything scales to you. The scaling covers NPC enemies, the quest rewards, the XP rewards and so on for the ENTIRE game. It even works if you make a party with mismatched levels (a max level guy can quest with a lvl 1 and everything is fine). You just can't go wrong!It's up to you then, in which order you explore and complete the world. You hate a zone? You can pretty much skip it.This game removed the tagging mechanic. If someone else kills a mob / boss, but you contribute in any way you get equal rewards. Magic!Wish you could travel to the dungeon and just go? Somehow the scaling makes even this work out! You will meet other players inside hence the 'public dungeon' term. It's like a zone, and everyone inside can just do their own thing without ever needing to group up. EZ! There are raids and hard mode dungeons that require proper organized teams, but that is for later.Faction restrictions only apply in PvP zones. Any faction can play together with any faction in the open-zones.The Crown Store is not pay-to-win to a level which would be a problem. Sure you can get some XP buffs and some bag space for money, but the main focus is on cosmetic items. Leveling in the game is fairly easy so XP bonuses do not seem like a big deal. There is no combat power for sale.I finished the Morrowind DLC, and it was well done. Very nostalgic for someone who played Morrowind back in the day.DLCs in general seem good, and worth the money. The Dark Brotherhood one is kickass so far!Here are some vids on the DLCs:ESO feels like a very well done coop MMO. Chill, but also surprisingly brave and clever at times.My char a wood elf Night Blade working for the Dark Brotherhood.Of course, also a werewolf! :Dhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1283601942"
Positive,"Absolutely an incredible game, I'm not into MMORPG anymore since i quit World of Warcraft after playing it for 9 years, that game took my life but this game really is something different. This game doesn't feel like a job, doesn't get my hooked like that game did so that's a plus in my books.This game can make the time you spend playing it fun and pretty interesting. The game is visually stunning! and easy and awesome gameplay, the soundtrack is Amazing. Ilove Elder scrolls and everything, but if you wern't into them this is great story you get to learn about this fast open world and everything it has to offer.Worth the price or even Better for for a sale get the Collectors addition like i did and get all the DLC WORTH IT. and then get Morrowind only $50 not sure if the $79 pack is worth it but if you're into all those collectibles than sure i am but i didn;t think it was to be all honest. Didn't look all that worth it. Gold Edition $30 on sale all DLC worth it wait for sale if you wait if not still worth it at $80."
Positive,Although fighting mechanism and pvp events are something to be desired in this game I can say that ESO is the best story telling mmorpg that is out there at the moment. I can just spend hours and hours of questing and going through the main and side stories. True feeling of all old Elder Scrolls that I fell in love with like Morrorwind and Oblivion.
Positive,"If you're an Elder Scrolls universe fan, then this is it. Nothing else can quench your thirst for it. You will simply love it.Edit: I've seen many reviews but none points out this very important feature. Leveling up system in this game is fascinating.You certainly have played games that you feel ""out-ranked"" or ""out-of-your-league"" kind of vibes. You just don't seem to be sufficient to play, because your friends started the game before you did, or they have more free time to play. This only applies to ""skill-based"" plays in pvp here. You can go fight a boss with a level 500 champion friend while you are a level 15 rook, and you both will almost have the same amount of damage and heal done. The reason is the weapons and armor have flexible values. Like if you are a level 10 player, your level 10 sword will deal, let's say, 100 damage. The moment you level-up to 11, your level 10 sword will deal less damage, like 92. In the meantime, the level 1000 guy with his champion sword will also deal 100 damage, just like you do. Same thing applies to your other gear, like armor and necklace and stuff. There is literally no required levels (except for the very beginning of the game) to do something or go somewhere. You can do anything anytime with anyone."
Positive,spam click the left mouse button when the circle starts spinning at the bottom right corner to access the character selection screen almost immediately instead of waiting for a long time. i discovered this by accident recently.does everyone already know about this ???i recorded a short video clip and uploaded to my personal youtube channel to prove what i wrote here ...
Positive,"I'll make this short:Do you like The Elder Scrolls franchise? Buy this gameDo you like MMORPGs? Buy this gameDid you try ESO when it was released and thought it sucked like I did?  Buy this game NOW!One Tamriel basically made it so you can go anywhere you want , whenever you want and the content scales with you.  Gone are the days of feeling like you have to be in a certain area to level.  Go explore, have fun!  Tons of lore, great crafting, and more content than you can shake a stick at.  Try One Tamriel first... if you like it, the Morrowind expansion was just released."

Positive,"Once you get into the swing of things, the meat of the game .. there is SO MUCH TO DO!"
Positive,I started playing this game just in time for my divorce. I will now begin to play this everyday for the rest of my life!
Positive,Said it needed 107 GB space. Then after install it wanted to install something more which needed 20 GB in addition --- which I didn't have. They could have just said the game required 127 GB and spared me the download.
Positive,2 hours of in game updates so i cant refund.... u got me todd
Positive,"It's been a while since I've updated my review of Elder Scrolls online. They have recently released their newest chapter. The past several months, the game has drastically changed, and in my opinion, for the better. The release of Blackwood has been smooth. Sure, I've found some bugs, but nothing game breaking, unlike some previous content patches that took forever to fix. The Blackwood zone is absolutely beautiful, the world builders at ZoS are starting to get very good at their jobs. The new Trial is an absolute blast, the mechanics are great, and ZoS has finally given us an Ash Titan that's as tough as he looks. The new Motif for pre-order, the Deadlands Gladiator Motif, is probably the nicest motif I've seen yet. In short, ZoS has started to really turn this game around. If you are looking for a new MMO, give this a shot."
Positive,"Absolutely wonderful game, when the servers are up and working.Good story writing and really a lot to do for anyone. Main story, 3 alliance storylines, several guild storylines, delves, M'aiq the liar, dungeons, trials, fishing, 4 player arenas, single player arenas, dragons, dolmens, world bosses, dig up mounts and gear, in-game card game, have a companion, walk in on a saucy conversation in a tavern, sell and buy goods with a trading guild, buy a hut, house, mansion or/and castle and decorate it or ask someone to decorate it for you and then have a party or a secret cult meeting, grind gear, gold and achievements with the many daily quests.*some/most stuff require eso+ or the dlcs/chapters"
Positive,"I've been with it since beta, and as an honest player I can say that the game is good if you're willing to spend time with it and learn it. The game had some rocky times, but it has recovered greatly, sure it still has problems but name a game that doesn't. The game has interesting and exciting content with hours of fun and adventure, which is what any Elder Scrolls game offers. It isn't the traditional play style of other Elder Scrolls games, but as an MMO it brings a new playstyle which, I personally believe, outshines many other MMO's out there today. If you have the time, money, patience, and love of Elder Scrolls lore, I think this will be a buy you don't regret."
Positive,"Something to the effect of five years ago I played this game for a few weeks. I managed to quest all the way up to level 46 in the end zone Coldharbour, and got lost. A big door to the other half of the zone wouldn't open and for whatever reason I couldn't locate the area the quest was telling me. It was mostly just ""Help King Whatever"". I was basically deadlocked just a handful of levels under the level cap, got frustrated, and essentially never came back. This was before One Tamriel, and back then I think the only couple of expansions were Orsinium and Thieves Guild (which I had bought). I remember on a gaming community I commented ""I don't understand how a game so pretty can be so boring"".Like many others, I am a WoW refugee of sorts. I played Shadowlands, got three or four characters to the level cap and was immediately bored by the token collection grind. I went on to play Warframe for a few hundred extra hours, until a promotion on Critical Role made me catch the drive to try ESO again.I'm here to say, their One Tamriel update probably fixed a lot of my issues, but it introduced one as well. Now you can go anywhere, take any quests. Exception being perhaps the alternate faction storyline but even then, I've noticed that no matter what zone I teleport to, there's usually a meta-plotline I can still undertake to solve the zone's problem without meddling with the main quest. I like this a lot.However it introduced a concept that WoW did better. Basically, everything levels with you. That means until you hit level 50 and then reach some subsequent champion levels, all your gear upgrades essentially mean nothing until ""champion level"" 160, where gear leveling stops. I felt no change in my power level all throughout this experience. That damage on my daggers that went from 800 to 1100 basically meant nothing at all and I saw very little change in the actual damage in numbers I was doing to enemies, always seeing something to the effect of ~2500 popping over enemies regardless of my level. I've found the only thing gear is good for is that extra enchantment effect, like adding spell critical or more vital: added experience from kills. This is a somewhat fundamental misunderstanding of how an adventuring RPG should work. I -want- to oneshot that elite Alit that gave me trouble so long ago. I -want- to crush that Dwarven Centurion that spat steam in my level 4 face. Instead, everything is effectively kept on an even playing field to allow other players to help each other. I can see it as an anti-griefing mechanic of sorts, encouraging high level players to tap at mobs when they see a lower level newbie struggling to take down a strong enemy. Even that I don't understand, I made a level three Warden and was hitting 8000's and taking on elite mobs just fine. Again, because everything is just leveled to you. So... I have mixed feelings.After that, I can happily say that the game does feel like a proper Elder Scrolls. There is a 'meta' (Most Effective Tactics Available) for the highest tier of content but until you reach that point, it's been pretty viable for my necromancer to be swinging a two-handed sword around. The Nightblade is supposed to be the game's rogue archetype but even they have a popular staff-using, magic-slinging build to use as well. However, I've found that getting an Addon that let's me see all locations of Skyshards and just aiming for those and you can reliably level up just by doing that, and hitting things along the way. There's a loading screen tip that encourages you to just pick a direction and run, and for the most part that checks out. It's a somewhat known fact that side quests give rather shit experience so while I usually skip quests from NPC's just standing around on the road... I'll take up quests I find in a dungeon or delve (delves are like smaller, public dungeons that anyone can join you in without a group) because I'll be doing that activity anyway, might as well get paid for it.The leveling system is unique, and you get class ability experience just by having one of the abilities equipped on your hotbar. I like this a lot, as it encourages some forward thinking. ""I might not use this ability, but that fourth one looks cool"". Much like in Skyrim, you basically just gain experience for whatever you're using. Despite the meta of my nightblade using two staves, I just use the one and use a more classic dagger set in my other slot and it's still a lot of fun.So the game does have a sort of ""play your way"" style, and if you change your mind later on it's fairly cheap to either reset skill points, or just go farm up skyshards to grab an excess of skill points and just switch builds entirely. Otherwise, there's plenty to do just by running around in the world as you won't run into much real challenge until you hit some of the dungeons implemented in the various DLC's and expansions; wherein the devs had more time to make more fickle mechanics which can throw some people off.I'm a big rogue player and I've loved doing the Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood questlines. I find stealth mechanics to be fickle and you need specific gear and champion level points invested in order to get the most out of it (otherwise enemies detect you from miles away), but I was getting by some of them just through a medium armor perk alone. They're doable, and can be incredibly intense. I'm just happy stealth is a big part of this game.It's a fine recovery from my lackluster experience all those years ago. I do however have one major complaint, that far and exceeds the problem I had with the auto-leveling of zones.I have no problem with MMO's having a subscription fee. I just feel the incentives should be more balanced. Most of ESO+'s perks are fine but there's one that kind of pissed me and my brother off quite a bit. Being subscribed introduces a bottomless crafting bag, and also doubles your bank space. (Among other things but this is the most relevant). Before, crafting was taking up the entirety of my bank space. To the point where I was considering having a mule character specifically to buy bags on, maybe even making a guild and investing in a guild bank. This is not an upgrade you can get directly from the crown store, and I wish to all the gods it was. It essentially holds you hostage, and if you don't pay up... All those materials get shoved right back into your inventory and your bank space gets cut in half. Dick move.So other than my two major problems there... If you're a Blizzard refugee and FFXIV doesn't quite have the aesthetic you're going for, this game is fine."
Positive,"Thanks to The Elder Scrolls Online [ESO] I have fallen in love with The Elder Scrolls all over again, I just have a mistress called Fallout this time, Shhh.The Elder Scrolls Online is unparalleled for an MMO and even beats previous TES RPG's in a lot of areas.I have sunk a combined 3000 hours into Skyrim and Skyrim SE, along with 1000’s of hours into Oblivion & Morrowind, and loved every minute of it.ESO continues and improves on every aspect of TES life.The sear volume of content is at first overwhelming, but it eases you in with quest like taking you through the crafting and tutorial/hints for newly selected/unlocked elements of the game as well as a huge Help referral catalogue.The game play if lovely, combat flows, conversation feels natural the whole worlds is believable [on a Elder Scrolls level] & the user interface works well. It feels like they have looked over everything people liked and/or criticised from the RPG's and bettered them.With four class types [5 with DLC, which I will be getting once I have finished with most of the the base game]; Dragon Knight, Sorcerer, Nightblade & Templar. Each focus on main elements; damage dealing, healing, stealth & magic whilst not being completely restricted to said classes. Obviously one is superior for each main play style but with the three class skill trees, racial bonuses and choice of weapons you make the setup and role play as you want.Combining or focusing on elements to create a character to your role is very pronounced.With a limited number of quick use ability slots on hand creating working, balanced setups becomes an art. Having five heavy stamina use abilities for example will leave you out of special attacks of defence quickly whilst leaving an untapped pool of magicka that could save you or your friends.With vast upgrades and variations on the previous crafting systems it is now fun again to acquire items for refining, creation, destruction, extraction, improvements, research and more over the various stations of Blacksmith, Woodwork, Clothing, Alchemy, Enchanting, Cooking & Jewellery [DLC].Then there's the Outfit station. No matter what you are wearing for armour, light, heavy, matching sets or mismatch pieces found during game play. After crafting an Outfit to your design and activating it, that is how you will look regardless of the armour and without any detrimental effects.EG: I use medium armour and at the moment it is made up of various pieces from different styles that look shocking together, but I have a rather nice outfit that I and everyone else can see that makes me look like I'm in smart clothing and a rather handsome Khajiit, if I may say so myself. This principle can also be applied to weapons, like hiding an axe and dagger as a shiny pair of duel swords.Whilst mentioning races, each has their own racial benefits just like any other TES game, except now they are grouped in one of three Alliances; Aldmeri Dominion, Daggerfall Covenant & the Ebonheart Pact.This has affects on game play, starting you off with Alliance orientated quests in completely different areas of Tamriel. This doesn't however mean you can't start & complete the quest lines that you would have had access to if playing a different race from a other alliance.The quest are seemingly endless from the main, to large faction based strings to once off small miscellaneous and even the randomly conditioned repeating mission.The content is huge, and detailed, the environments span everything in Tamriel; snowing mountains, grassy plains, erupting volcanoes, marshy swamps, forests, Ayleid ruins, plains of oblivion, sprawling coastline, busy cities, it has it all.The only negative I have seen so far is that for a period of less than 12h, I had a issues connecting to the servers, and apparently this was enough for the morons to bombard the game with negative reviews and worse, not removing them when the issue was [and still is] fixed.To prevent the likelihood of this happening again [as it seems to be an issue for steam uses] you can purchase the game direct from Bethesda and either use their launcher or put the activation code into steam and launch that way if you care to, purchasing it through steam won't allow launch via Bethesda's.I can't believe I didn't buy or start this game sooner, I have 70h to the game and I have barely scratched the surface. I find it very hard to stop playing and regularly end up playing into the early hours, far beyond what I really should do when I have work in the morning.I suppose it’s the sight of a great game.If they can add the game elements created and refined for ESO to the next RPG, TES VI will be without equal from past, present or future titles for some time."
Positive,"Please follow United Critics for quality reviewsAs a die-hard fan of RPGs and sandboxes, there’s a special place in my mind for The Elder Scrolls Franchise. Since I was introduced to the series back in 2002, I’ve spent hundreds of hours navigating the immense fantasy-themed world of Bethesda in search of adventure, loot, NPCs, and the gorgeous views of surrounding landscapes. It’s a real MMORPG video game released by ZeniMax Online Studios. The game serves as a part of the long-running The Elder Scrolls series and introduces lots of prominent features that you have never seen before. Honestly, there’s nothing about Massively Multiplayer Online games that I dislike; however, I intend to go with freedom of playing solo adventures over guild-based raids. But I’m happy that at least I tried, and I liked it.The game starts with your favorite character, who escapes from the prison in the daedric realm, Coldharbour. According to the plot, the daedric prince Malog Bal has stolen your soul, with the help of a few new allies, and you return to Tamriel as a vestige. After reaching there, you must spend a hundred hours to complete the challenging quests to approach the level cap of 50. The difficulty level will start increasing with level 10, and the advancement in missions will unlock new stuff. It offers content-driven gameplay and will allow you to experience excellent gameplay with other players from all over the world. Highly Detailed Environment and Monthly Subscription ModelSimilar to other titles in The Elder Scrolls franchise, the game takes place in the continent of Tamriel and introduces a well-written storyline that is indirectly attached to different titles. Like other MMORPGs, the game introduces the monthly subscription model, and it means you must pay monthly charges to keep continuing your gaming service. During the gameplay, you can explore the environment from a third-person perspective to kill other players or enemies to retrieve your soul to become the master. While playing the game, you can use a variety of melee weapons and other gear to earn in-game currency.Like the previous installment, the game focuses on non-linear gameplay, introduces a perfect combination of free-roaming, random events, quests, and epic battles. Although the game doesn’t present a Single-player offline play, the developers said that there would be a variety of content specially designed for those users who prefer to play solo. There are ten different races categorized into three types, such as: •Elvish Races•Humans•Bestial RacesBefore start playing the game, the ultimate job of the player is to choose one of three races and then go with character classes to choose his favorite one out of six, such as:•Sorcerer•Templar•Nightblade•Dragonknight•Warden•NecromancerYou would be happy to know that each class is offering you various attacks, passive effects, and spells.The world where the game takes place is expansive, but it doesn’t calibrate your sense against other titles available in the series. A limited distance, repetitive buildings, and scenery make you feel the game is smaller than it seems on a map. The main problem is that each zone is offering a single region for players of a specific level range, and as you advance through the game, further zones will be unlocked to navigate. The objectives you complete directly fall into a few categories, including Fetch Quests, Kill Lists, and Simple Object Finding. The complicated combat system of the game hybridizes the traditional Massively Multiplayer Online Rotation System, where the player can cycle through a set of skills and magical powers. The Elder Scrolls Online comes with outstanding gameplay, although a few well-structured systems are struggling to overcome lifeless presentation, but tough to recommend. There’s one flaw in the PvP event that the map is too large to explore. Combat was brilliant when I involved in it but found myself wasting lots of hours from reaching one place to another.Rating: 7/10"

Positive,"If you really enjoy a solo player mmo, this is the game for you. Sometimes things can get a little monotonous, but finding things in the game (like treasure hunting, housing, or just exploring the unique landscapes can help break it up)."

Positive,"Probably one of the only MMOs you will find that is not pay-to-win. Sure, there are a few quality of life benefits that you get from being an ESO+ subscriber (mostly in the amount of inventory increase, because it gives you an unlimited bag for your crafting materials), and the + subscription allows you access to all the DLCs (NOTE: this does not include the chapter expansions. ZOS defines their chapter expansions quite arbitrarily, but they usually include a large zone addition, as well as a new trial. This is quite confusing to new players, as previous chapter expansions are now considered DLCs, so if one is wan to wait long enough, you can get the chapter expansions for little to nothing, or nothing, factoring in the inclusion into the + subscription). The + subscription also allows double the bank space, and double the amount of furnishing items that can be placed into each house. All that being said, the ESO+ subscription is absolutely not necessary, and I would go so far as to say that you can get by completely fine with mule characters (although this does require transferring inventory into your shared bank for all characters, and multiple re-logging to manage inventory). Also, if you decide that you're not going to do any crafting in this game, you can get by even easier, as their is a large market for crafting materials on any guild store, and you can easily make money simply by selling them (I will buy all your unneeded crafting materials :)). This will free up a large percentage of your inventory per character, and your bank space. There are also several quality of life increases that can be purchased, these include riding lessons from the crown store, banker and merchant assistants from the crown store, and the recent addition of skyshards- provided that you have already gotten all of the skyshards in a zone on a different character, you may purchase them on a different character to avoid the need to re-farm them on a different character.  You could argue that these quality of life increases are somewhat pay-to-win- I could understand the argument. I personally don't find them pay-to-win, and I myself have not purchases any of the above, excepting only the banker and merchant assistants, which can at least by shared and used by anyone whom you are grouped with. This means if you have a friend you routinely group with, or a group of friends, it is possible you could all go in for one merchant and banker to be shared."
Positive,"Having a great time playing the aspects of the game that appeal to me. The strength of the game systems lies in never restricting player choice, the player is allowed to decide what content to experience. This is in contrast to some other MMOs which force the player base to only play one character at a time, restrict relevant content to the current patch, and who continuously remove player choices while claiming they are adding player choices."
Positive,"It's really good - after 100+ hours on the PS4 I rebought it on PC and its vastly better.  Yes you can say it's just Skyrim online but its a lot more than that, it's one of the only MMOs I know that is fair, not pay to win and doesnt require a subscription.  The base game for 20/25 dollars will last you hundreds of hours and the additional DLC will make the game unfinishable due to amount of content.  The game simply does have the most content in any game I can think of, you can play the game completely solo and only forced to do anything in a party when you're doing Trials or dungeons.Absolutely worth the price, its an absolute steal and if you're like me you'll be completely drawn into the experience and find it's hard to stop playing.5 out of 5"
Positive,"I have a lot more hours than show here, I would easily be over 10k hours if I still played through Steam.This is probably the best MMO at the moment, and I would recommend for anyone who is a Elder Scrolls fanboy or looking for a new MMO. A lot of misinformed reviews here claim to be cash grab, pay2win, and so on. The business model in this game is pay for convienence. You don't want to farm gold to buy house items? Sure, you can spend real money for it. Oh, having a difficult time with inventory? ESO+ gives you Cratbag, an unlimited bag for crafting materials. Do you really need craftbag? Nah, when you have maxed out Bank, all Housing Chests, and a personal guild bank(easy to have) you won't even feel the need for it, but it is reallu convienent to not worry about space.Endgame is kind of lackluster, it can get a bit repetitive but honestly, that's for every MMO out there. Once you complete every PvE content, you wait for the next ""Chapter"" to release for a new 12 man trial(raid), which once you complete and get the sets you need in the first week, feels like you're done with the content. Which is why, imo, PvP is the true end game, since while it can get repetitive as well, due to the nature of playing against players, the replayability of Battlegrounds and Cyrodil is really good. Questing is probably one of the strongest thing in the game. Everything os voice acted, the story is actually really good... for a MMO. There are some eh to awful quests, as with every game, but mostly they are very good storywise. You will not have fun if you skip all dialog while leveling your character, you will be missing one of the major strengths of the game. Your new character usually starts either on Morrowind or Summerset zones, since they are the last Chapters, which is completely fine since all enemies scale with your level, and ZOS improves quality over time, so playing the last chapter will give you the best experience of what the game has to offer.Overall I can recommend the game, but definitly would get it with on a promo only, and never buy the lastest chapter (Elsweyr by the time I'm writing) on the same year it's released, since it is way overpriced for what it has to offer. The base game however, it's usually stop on price wise."
Positive,I LOVE YOU QUEEN AYRENN
Positive,"Raz sees your interest in ESO, very good choice! Queen Ayrenn approves your good taste."
Positive,I've played it for a few hours. Pretty good from what I've seen so far.
Positive,I cannot describe how much I wish the Nirn was my actual home planet instead of the Earth. Tamriel would be a magnificent place to live.
Positive,The best MMORPG game i ever played. Also great graphicsHighly Recommended.
Positive,Elder Scrolls Online is my favourite game to play alone at my own pace. Of course its better with friends but taking my time and playing it like a single player game is just better than all the other scrolls games. I don't understand why i like this game.but i do
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is an enlightening & rich elder scrolls experience. The game is rich and beautifully narrated in its story, overwhelming in the dimensions of its world and enlightening in the adventure that awaits in every corner. It is packed with plenty of things to do of all sorts in a world which never seems to end & seizes to amaze. Get ready to be immersed for hours in the vastness of this game and to get lost every & each time. For the time it's been around, it managed to overcome all the issues in a continuous path to book itself as legendary. Without a shadow of doubt, The Elder Scrolls Online is one of the best games ever made, quick maths. Get good, otherwise you will be crushed in PvP. Welcome to the game, mortal."
Positive,"You know.. The PvE ain't that bad.. When It comes to the overland quests, there's a lot of content. Some of it becomes repetitive but there's some good story occasionally. Normal dungeons are easy enough. Group vet dungeons can be demanding. Normal trials can be trivial. Vet trials can be restrictive and toxic. I suggest joining a guild. PvP is a niche. Only play it with regards to balance being poor, between classes and item sets. The game is in its sunset phase. The servers aren't great. The game suffers from poor coding. Only updates are to adding a few dungeons a year, one trial a year, and very few essential balance changes to pvp and sometimes pve.. The crown store is how they make most of their money.. I suggest using a third party website to purchase said items from.. They don't deserve it. When the game came out.. I reserved a 7.5/10... Now after all this time.. It's hitting a 4.5/10... For a newer player it'd be 5/10"
Positive,"Spent alot of time in this game both on PC and PS4. It's slow out of the gate but once you get past lvl 15 it opens up into something really amazing. Especially if you have a few friends to play with or make friends along the way. Aside from FFXI, FFXIV having a special place for me ... I've got to say this is my favorite western mmo to date."
Positive,First things first I'd like to say that I'm WoW veteran with my whole high school life wasted on it.I bought this game because I was looking for something fresh and I couldn't really justify paying for gametime in WoW while playing couple hours a week.After downloading this YUUUGE thing I was hyped to get in and play but that was not the case. I actually spent over 5 hours trying to get this game to run.First I had to install it in safemode so I'd get past the javascript error. Then I was getting blackscreen everytime I tried to run the game which I ended up solving by redownloading and repatching the entire game(!!!)Then when I finally got to log in screen I got an error that game is not running through steam and cannot login(!!!!!)At this point I was ready to refund but fixed it quite easily by changing settings in compatibility mode of steam.exe and steamoverlay.exe. Basically it all had to be set for admin rights and I was good to go.After surviving this ordeal and actually getting in-game I spent 8 hours straight playing till 5am turning it off only because of exhaustion.Seriously there is so much stuff to do. I never really cared about lore in mmo's since I was always grinding hard to get to the endgame  content. This is different though. Quests are actually narated and you can get really emerged into the story.My plan was to grind to level 50 as fast as possible and get a decent PVE build but now after 40 hours I still find myself wondering around the map doing quests even reading freaking BOOKS I find around the world.So far I have encountered only one bugged quest and it solved itself just by doing other quests and returning to it later.If I don't take into account the horrors I had to go through to get this game started it runs really well and most of it release problems have been polished.I'd recommend this game to casual MMORPG players as well as to hardcore endgame players. I haven't really tried PVP yet since I haven't reached max level but PVE is great and actually challenging.I went into normal dungeon with a group of people and we wiped like 11 times on one boss before learning the mechanics and actually cooperating together to get him down.It was so much more rewarding then WoW dungeons where at this point you just spam spell rotations unless you actually go for a mythic raid.The combat of ESO is very unique unlike any other MMO I played. And I must say I love it. It actually makes you move around and engage into combat instead of just TAB targeting and spamming your spell rotations.I'll be updating this review as I go through the game but as of now I have nothing bad to say about it except: FIX THE FREAKING INSTALLATION!!
Positive,The stone creatures are made of stone and map is sooo big
Positive,i recommend this game! lots of fun
Positive,This is a fantastic MMO. The story feels so much more engaging than WoW and there is a ton to do without ever having to spend a dollar outside of buying the game. I love the level of customization this game allows with your characters.
Positive,"I've played numerous MMOs over the past 15 years ranging from Aion to Wildstar. ESO is an incredible MMO with rich story (sometimes too much much story), fully voiced dialogue, immersive worlds and terrain, superb character class customization, and captivating cinematics.  It's fantastic that I can play as a tank with each class and the mount speed could put a Lambo to shame. Huge fan of the ES series and this is by far my favorite MMO."
Positive,"Avid Elder Scrolls fan here, have never played an mmo in my life until ESO. I thought it would be too convoluted with people, or be too multiplayer-based, but it's honestly the best ES game I've ever played. I thoroughly enjoy it! :)"
Positive,"I've been playing this game for more than 2 years and I've only just scratched the surface of Tamriel. Even though it's supposed to be an MMO, I have been playing solo and still can explore and do things all over the map. Still finding new things all the time."
Positive,"It did get better...The Good:+Solid Questing+Impactful Skill Progression+Great story and Voice acting+Combat is improved (still needs work in areas) The Bad:-Grouping still needs work (this is an MMO)-Some parts of combat are still annoying-Premium Sub needs restructure-Issues with how mounts are implementedSo I'll start by saying I was one of the detractors when it came to ESO.  I played the game during beta/Open beta and came to the conclusion that while it was an okay game it was not good enough to warrant a subscription fee.  Then there was all the stuff they ended up doing with the Imperial Edition that just sealed the deal for me.  Now that they've dropped the sub and the reviews seem to be mostly positive I decided to go ahead and give this a try.I must admit so far things seem pretty good.  I've played a little over 40 hours, I'm up to level 18 now and my sorcerer is starting to fill out nicely.  I recall in the beta I had issues with how fast mana would deplete leaving you with only basic attacks.  I don't really feel that is an issue anymore, you can't just cast forever but it's balanced enough so that I feel like I get to use my spells when I want/need to and any drain could easily be bolstered with a quick potion to finish out the encounter.  I haven't played much of the other classes but I created a Templar and two-handed weapons still need some work.  The slow, unresponsivness of two-handed weapons was another gripe of mine in beta and while they have made changes to it, it still feels sluggish to me.  Example, with the mage the variation of light, medium and heavy basic attacks are very clear and visually easy to discern, using two handed it seems much harder not only to execute but to tell when it's happening.  That said I have heard they are already in the midst of re-tooling two-handed weapon combat.The pacing of leveling in ESO takes some getting used to, in the time it's taken me to get to 18 in ESO I'd probably be 40+ easily in a game like Neverwinter (another game I play occassionaly).  The good thing about their system though is you always feel like you're getting better, no level for me to this point has felt wasted.  Every skill point has been a decision of where to invest to get the most out of my class/playstyle.  I guess you could say the progression is slower but more impactful.Questing is a fairly standard trope, which isn't to say it's bad but it's nothing outside of what you come to expect for any MMO.  There haven't been any quests that have blown me away or had me thinking, ""Man that was awesome!""  Now that said I'm not saying the questing is bad or boring.  To be honest the quests are quite well written and often times some of them are good for a laugh.  Most of the voice acting is very well done which serves to not detract from the experience.  I recommend actually listening to the stories and quest diaglogue as it makes questing feel like more than just going from place to place and doing mundane tasks.  All the quests, even ones where you're just killing stuff are wrapped up in a story line of some kind.  ESO probably does one of the better jobs of any MMO to make the stuff you're killing seem relevant to the story surrounding it.  When you strip it all away any most MMO questing always boils down to go here do this and go here kill that and ESO is the same but if you actually listen to the story you won't really ever notice it.  I have yet to think to myself, ""Man I'm sick of these kill quests.""  Something I did run into in most MMOs I've played. As I said I'm only a bit over 40 hours in so far so haven't even scratched the surface really but so far I'm not regretting trying this out.  I had said I was going to wait for a sale but I was bored and went ahead and paid th $60 I'm glad it turned out okay.  I haven't had a chance to try out PvP yet, I like PvP but mostly as a side affair for when I need a change.  I also have not done much grouping or group content.  I tried to do the first dungeon but was unable to find a group.  Grouping in general though is still poor in this game compared to almost any other MMO you can think of in recent memory.  I still do not understand how you design an online game of this nature and have the grouping limitations they had at launch and while they have made improvements it's still a negative to me.Personally I don't care much for the way they handle mounts as it relates to their pricing in the Crown store.  Different mounts have different prices, which is fine but the thing is in ESO all mounts are equal.  In most MMOs you generally have different tiers of mounts and the price is usually based on that tier and then also on the ""cool factor"" of the mount.  Well in ESO it's solely based on the ""cool factor"" so to speak.  Problem is Zenimax determines that; right now there is a horse mount with flaming eyes, nostrils and feet.  Cool mount I believe it costs 2500 crowns, another mount is the Guar, it's a two legged little reptilian like thing.  Not as flashy as the horse I guess you could say be it's also a cool mount, it only costs 1300 crowns.  Now if I happen to think the guar is the more cool of those two mounts I just got the coolest mount and saved myself 1200 crowns over the other guy who thought the horse was better but we both get the exact same in-game benefit.  So basically you're paying extra crowns just based off the arbitrary decisions of whoever sets these crown store prices that thought the horse was more cool than the guar so there for it should cost more crowns.  Even though game play wise they are identical.  That is a poor system to me.One last thing I'll say is that the free to play model for this game is pretty fair, so far as that goes anyway.  The prices in the store aren't too over-priced and at least so far it doesn't feel like you're being nickel and dimed for everything.  The store is pretty new though so it doesn't have a whole lot in it yet.  I actually think the Premium sub is the biggest waste of money right now.  So far as I can tell the only real tangible benefit is the +10% xp gain but that's hardly worth $15 a month.  As of this review I don't believe there are any DLC or game packs so that part of it doesn't even factor in and the 1500 crown points, while nice, again not something I would sub for when you could just buy them as needed.  So yeah, if actually getting people to sub is a thing they would like they really need to make that more enticing.  I mean it's a good thing the free model is strong, where you don't feel like you HAVE to sub but for those willing to sub you should give them bonuses that are actually worth that monthly commitment."
Positive,"Far as MMOs go, this is a solid game. Fine graphics, sound and general stability. The quests are fun, especially the more unique DLC such as the Thieves Guild. The game also has an active modding community. But instead of going through what is great about the game, I will comment on what irks me about ESO.1. All characters guilds, bank, Champion points and mail are linked. While gear sharing across all characters is nice, it just feels wrong to me as basically characters and their achievements aren't there- as every darn thing is shared across the entire account. Mounts, pets, costumes, etc are fine ... but with how it is now, you lose the ability to just zone out on a newbie with ESO. For me, it just robs away part of the game for me.2. Level scaling. Everything, including the player is Level 50, CP160 until the player levels to 50, then they are level 50 and whatever CP level they have. This makes ALL crafting before lvl 50 CP 160 moot, same with drops as you must CONSTANTLY replace gear every level or two. It isn't a good scaling system compared to other games. Just isn't.3. Immersion for me, is broken A LOT by the non-Lore friendly bombardment of player mounts, skins and such EVERYWHERE I go. People on fire or glowing like a diamond. This contrast badly with the otherwise immersive landscape.4. Player pets, combat and non-combat, mounts are ALWAYS in the way. I am ALWAYS. They need an option to hide these from view when not in combat.5. The store molests you at every turn. Even if you are subscribed."
Positive,"Fantastic MMO. Deeply immersive. I would HIGHLY recommend getting the subscription as it basically pays for itself in in-game currency alone.I would also HIGHLY recommend reading through the books, scrolls, side quest dialogue, etc.  It becomes obvious very quickly that a lot of love, time, and attention were put into this game.You'd be hard-pressed to find an MMO that puts in the work that this one does.  It runs great on even older and/or lower end GPUs, as well.I honestly cannot recommend this hard enough if you are interested in:- Elder Scrolls lore- High Fantasy MMOs- Diverse MMO gameplay"
Positive,I watched a ghost seduce and kill another ghost.
Positive,I think my hours speak for themselves.
Positive,"Fun rpg, lots of storyline and also pve and pvp options. Endless play in some ways.For solo play, there is a huge amount of story and questing to do. Only the trials content and a lot of the veteran dungeon will be unobtainable (designed for group play, trials need 12 players to activate switches at same time)For group pve, you need to be pretty decenet and on a good build as everyone plays veteran setting (very rare to find non vet groups) though they allow new players in guilds quite often to try it out. I'm not good enough to do veteran so no group pve option for me that i enjoy (can do world bosses occasionaly just im not able to do any dungeons or trials as my skills arent good enough-its why i dont play- i have physical limits is all)For group pvp there are 3 options. There is quick queue battlegrounds (4v4) and an open world style pvp cyrodil section (AvAvA) , a smaller open world imperial city (AvAvA though usually smaller groups tend to run this area)New content comes out every year and the economy is booming where it is easy to earn currency and items now. Note: p2p items are expensive to grind, still possible though you will need to 'farm' a lot of pve/pvp content to trade currencyto other players for things like the p2p expansion packs"
Positive,"I cannot describe how much time and effort I have put into this game. It's my favorite game. This game appeals to so many different types of play styles, whether you like crafting, pvp, battling, questing, or decorating. I would recommend this game to people who are lonely. You can be a solo player yet you feel like there are people there with you. The group content in this game is amazing. You can have 12+ people in your group and try and defeat a trial. The NPCs are cool as well. Each NPC has been voice acted and some of them are funny. Personally, I simp for Razum Dar. However for new players, you will feel overwhelmed at first when you get into the game because there is so much content in the game. DO NOT FRET! There are many new player guilds out there that will help you with questing or defeating a boss and coach you on how to play the game."
Positive,"Played it since 2015, I was frustated because veteran level is so boring. I stop after Veteran 5 because I can't see progress on my character level, hell even it took me 1 month to level up from veteran 4 to veteran 5 (I'm not a grinding type of person and I have a job). And then I got busy, forgetting this game and finally came back this year. That is a great move from ZOS to get rid of veteran level.Heres the review from me.The Bad :- FPS really a big issue here, I can't ran constant 60fps. And can go below 30fps at some area (turning down setting isn't much help).- PING!!!!!! is so high. Well I live in Asia, and the server is NA. So not really big minus to, only the server is too far.- I think there is unbalance class in PvP, or maybe I just bad at it lolThe Good :- The map is really HUGE, so much to do in one map.- You can group with anyone regardless your level.- Seeing any culture in every race in one elder scrolls game is like a dream come true.- MMORPG with great Story? Yes, this game is for you!- You can do anything what you like (like in any TES games).- Lore, Lore, Lore everywhere!!!- This is The Elder Scrolls!!!"
Positive,"Sorry but there's far too much paid content for this game to be enjoyable for me. Not to mention the sheer size of the game files (which include every DLC that you don't have access to! Just sitting there!) amounting to around 100GB.The best questlines are locked behind a paywall, every DLC is expensive as hell, and some of the game mechanics are just not to my taste as a long time Elder Scrolls fan.I'm not saying ""this is completely different from Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim therefore it's bad"", I'm saying that some important aspects of TES gameply we know and love (like stealth kills, which so far I was only able to achieve with the Blade of Woe which you can only get via the DBH paid questline)Well, at least you can pickpocket NPCs and cook fun recipes. The environment is rich and beautiful and the character creator is pretty good.Maybe I'll give this game another chance in the future, but for now I can't say I'm a fan.----- edit below ----Okay. I gave it another chance! With the company of my girlfriend, I finally could enjoy this game. And although I still  think there's certain things that should not be pay-locked, the base game and Morrowind were still enjoyable. My girlfriend gifted me much of the expansion packs, and I have to say it really makes a difference. So my current review is as follows:- If you're only casually playing, and you have a friend with you, I recommend the game in its base form. Even if you're on your own, you can still enjoy the game. But if you're a die hard TES fan looking for an experience similar to the main title games, this is not going to satisfy you.- If you really want to get into it, you'll need not only to purchase the expansions (Summerset, Elsweyr, etc) to really have a great time, but you'll also need at least one good friend. I know. That's even harder to come by than money. It makes all the difference to play together.That's about it for my opinion."
Positive,I stopped playing WoW for this. Best desicion ever!If you like it this much too add me so we can game!
Positive,300+ hours and I just hit endgame and I still haven't even done half of the content that this game has to offer. Definitely worth the money.
Positive,Definitely a great game to play if you're a fan of the elder scroll games
Positive,"Very well-developed, RPG-style game. The multiplayer works flawlessly and the variety and depth of the game and the quests are unbelievable. While the subscription is not mandatory, I find the game more enjoyable with it because of the large increase in bag space and having access to different guilds like the Dark Brotherhood and Thieve's Guild. I would recommend just spending the money once on crowns to buy those two DLC if bag space is not an issue for you. An extremely fun game that will blow your mind with how much detail they have put into the game. I 100% recommend it."
Positive,I killed someone's best friend to join a Daedra cult.This game is awesome.

Positive,"Let me begin by saying that this a a conditional positive review. If you hate MMOs, then you may as well move on to something else. This game is an MMO first and foremost, with all the little annoyances that have wormed their way into this genre.That being said, this is the only MMO that I have ever played that lives up to the ideal of fictional MMOs as portrayed in film and television. There is a fairly healthy but non essential player driven economy, and plenty of content to get lost in. It is also the only MMO that I am willing to pay the subscription fee for, even thought it is not required to play the game. For $15, you get more slightly more that $15 of in-game premium currency (Crowns) for the game's cash store (Crown Store), as well as the other benefits of a plus membership (Slight XP and gold boost, Infinite crafting inventory, and access to all previously released DLC and chapters). The crowns do not expire, and can be saved up to purchase permanent account access to the DLCs and chapters, after which time the membership can be cancelled if you so choose. 90 to 95% of the things purchasable in the Crown store are cosmetic or convenience, so should you decide that you want to spend no more then the bare minimum to play this game, there is still a ton of content available to you and plenty of zones to explore and enjoy without limitation.The game's overall design and aesthetic is lifted heavily from Skyrim, but is slightly more cartoonish. If you turn off the hud in the settings, you can get some really beautiful screenshot material, and there is nothing quite as relaxing as hunting large game in the frozen wilderness of Eastmarch, or fishing off the fungal forested coasts of Southern Morrowind. The game also features a beautiful score and fully voiced NPCs, so your ears can partake in as much beauty as your eyes (lol wtf am I saying here). Some of the voice acting is a little lacking, and many actors are reused throughout the game, but that is pretty par for the course for Bethesda and Bethesda adjacent titles.Some of the writing can be quite smelly, but even then few of the quests overstay their welcome. Zone stories are to be played solo, and all other quests are sharable with friends so you can progress and quest together. There are plenty of quests to keep you busy, and so much lore to experience that I'm sure anyone can find SOMETHING they care about. Characters are created with a race and class, but weapon and armour usage is not restricted to a class based system. Any character can use any type of weapon or armour, and the opportunities to play and experiment with interesting builds are numerous. The game features real-time combat that plays a lot like Diablo, but with a first or third person over the shoulder perspective making it feel pretty action packed despite it mostly being click spamming.The biggest gripe I have about The Elder Scrolls Online is the advertising. Lots of hud elements and menus showing you portions of the game that you do not have access to because you have not purchased them can make the game feel like a cluttered mess. It acts as a constant reminder that your experience is not complete, and a tactic to separate you from your wallet as much as possible. It's so unnecessary and frustrating, because underneath the framework of predatory advertising, there is a pretty solid game that should be allowed to speak for itself.TLDR, Game pretty good, Advertising pretty bad, if you hate MMOs don't play it, if you don't mind MMOs and like Elder Scrolls then you'll get your money's worth if you spend it smart. Don't buy crowns, just buy ESO+ and save up for things you want and you'll have a much better time.GAME 8.5/10, PREDATORY MARKETING 0/10"
Positive,"The elder scrolls online its one of the games that I cant get tired off.First lets just clarify that this isnt related to the gameplay that Skyrim has (even if it has the first person view option)I mean, its a MMO and just like it. It has mechanics (just like another MMO game) but this is in Tamriel.you have different races to choose (just like in skyrim) and different classes which means there are Tank,DPS & Healer as main roles but it doesnt mean that you can't be a Imperial with main class tank as a DPS (which is in my case).And thats what I like about this, you can do a lot of different things in this world, even if you see my hrs on record (912 hrs when I wrote this) I still encounter myself with even more content and new mechanics.this game doesnt stop surprising me everytime I get on it.DLC'S : I know there are a lot of Content to get, but trust me. If you really like MMO'S as I do im sure you wont regret getting them (for story content or just for the awesome dungeon bosses & sets)I also reccomend to watch some videos of it and if you are into it, and you see the game in a disccount, then you should grab the gold edition. You will save a lot on content, trust me.(if you have the normal edition and then you get the gold edition, they work as separate games I think, so be sure to make the right choice.)The community is super warm, Im sure that if you are lost or need help, ask for it on the global chat, most of the people will help you. 8/10. -Doesnt have the (10) because there are a lot of things that they don't explain. like some in-game mechanics that you discover playing with more experienced players or watching videos and how the job system ingame works."
Positive,This game is so much better after tamriel unlimited
Positive,"It was a beautiful afternoon in the dry lands of Craglorn. This simple mage was riding his frost horse, exploring that lands, looking for materiais to a brand new armor, searching for unknown places and, who knows, for a place to drink a good cup of mead.When, without warning, a ferocious troll appeared out of nowhere, right before me, hitting me with his huge claws. I managed to keep riding my horse, desperate and unable to even think to where I was going.To my bad luck, I encountered a group of goblins who, of course, tried to taste my delicious flesh. Some of them fire mages, increasing the despair of this humble vampire.Riding my dear Beluhga (my frost horse) straight forward, trying to escape from that ruthless monsters, I couldn't see my real nemesis until it was too late: a cliff.Without any other alternatives, I rushed my horse and jumped right into that abyss, hoping for certain death, but without being devoured by trolls and goblins.But the Eight was on my side that day.As I jumped into the cliff, a fire missile from a goblin mage hit me, knocking me out from Beluhga in mid air, making me hit a tree that also appeared out of nowhere and, finally, fall into a lake. I survived.10/10 will jump of cliffs again."
Positive,"When I bought ESO I was full of doubt, not sure if I will like the approach devs make to the great Elder Scrolls lore, afraid of P2W, paywalls and other curses of modern MMOs.And You know what? I don't regret at all! Never before I have seen MMO that is so innovative: - much less grind compared to other productions, battle level which allows high level players to have fun with their friends who had just started to play the game, - champion points which are shared among the characters between your account - meaning that in end game you need to level your new character up to basic level 50 to instantly have him on 810CP, so creating new characters is almost no grind at all, - total split between class and role you play in a team which gives us tens of builds to try out, with most of them working very well, - focus on quests which are the most common way to level up, with most of them not being a typical ""fetch  10 beets"" quests I've seen in other online games - instead you get long, complicated, but also really interesting tasks blending with lore very well, similar to faction quests in Skyrim for example.To sum up, if you like Elder Scrolls lore or you are looking for good MMO don't hesitate to buy it - doesn't matter if you are hardcore player or weekend casual"
Positive,"I was addicted to drugs, now I'm addicted to this game. The Elder Scrolls Online is the best MMO I've played and currently my favorite game. I LOVE IT!A never ending gameplay with lots of exciting quests, huge player world, nice community and soooo much more to explore. Must have for every MMO and TES fan!"
Positive,"Probably the best MMORPG you will get on steam. Hundreds of hours of Quests, Dungeons and PVP to play through. Many Classes and races to choose from, mixed with your different choices of weapons leads to Fun and diverse combinations for your characters. One time Purchase with optional DLC which only improve the game, Not P2W, subscription is not needed"

Positive,"I played few hours,seems like a good game."
Positive,"One of the only MMOs that I ever played that actually lived up to and surpassed World of Warcraft.  Decent game.  Just watch out for both stuff, and for things.Also a squirrel was there."
Positive,I recommend this game only if you like the overall game style of elder scroll and have it installed on ssd + have unlimited fast internet service as it tends to download a lot. I've played the game about 130 hours over about 2 years and I downloaded more than 300GB for it!
Positive,"Well, you either love it or you hate it, it seems.  Honestly, I think ESO is a very entertaining and enjoyable MMO, but it's exactly that: an MMO.  While it's nice to dream of the full single-player Elder Scrolls experience, but online, ESO provides an experience that (while it pales in comparison to said experience) is very fun for what it is.  My main critique of the game is whole idea behind the Imperial edition of the game, something I'm sure has been complained about on more than one occasion here.  Barring off an entire race is pretty stupid, in addition to the whole any race, any alliance perk.  While valid points could be made as to how this COULD (in certain contexts) make sense from a lore perspective, chances are it will be pretty hard to justify a Nord dragonknight fighting for the Aldmeri Dominion.  It is important to note though, that the faction system as a whole is pretty restrictive, as it makes choosing one's favorite race and playing with friends a bit troublesome if the race selected doesn't fall into the same faction as the others'.  This, however, is quite overshadowed by the other benefits owners of the Imperial edition receive that others do not, such as the increased rate of XP gained through the rings of Mara and the exclusive loot they may find.Overall?  Great game.  I enjoy looting dungeons, waging battles and completing quests with friends.  While it's no Skyrim or Oblivion, ESO brings something new entirely to the table, and I would recommend it to Elder Scrolls fans (particularly all the lore buffs out there) and fans of MMORPGs."
Positive,"The newest addition to ESO, Elswyer, is a fascinating journey around every corner. Windswept deserts lie on either side of the bridge-crossed canyons known as the Stitches while untamed jungles flourish to the south. Elsweyr is a worthy successor to last year’s Summerset chapter. It’s the excellent storytelling and exploration in the side quests that outshines the dragons with heartfelt drama.I have been playing ESO since it was first available as a live retail game on Steam. The game is beautifully constructed. Most of the main story quests are brilliantly voice acted, providing a deep immersion into the storied world of Tamriel. I have purchased this game 4 times as a gift for friends over the last 4 years. I felt it was a great value for the 100's of quests, an alliance versus alliance PVP battlefield map and a full-featured crafting system to keep the creative or harvester types of gamers busy for endless hours of game time. The ESO Plus membership is a special VIP program that gives you access to loads of in-game benefits and perks, including access to all DLC game packs in the in-game Crown Store. The free Crowns you get are worth the same value as the ESO Plus members alone. You get a special crafting bag that holds every collectible resource and material used for the extensive crafting system the game has. This frees valuable bank space for you. Besides, you get two times as much bank space for all your account shared items.The new Necromancer class is by far one of the best additions to ESO since the early days. It has some very clever unique mechanics that work in any role. The land of Elsweyr itself is one of the best and most visually interesting areas to explore.Necromancy is a sensitive subject in The Elder Scrolls world because it has been outlawed by both the Psijic Order and the Mages Guild. Characters treated me differently based on the fact I practiced necromancy. I remember Abnur Tharn specifically vilify the Necromancers we were working against. I’m someone who appreciates a little Role-playing in my MMORPGs. Knowing that most of Tamriel wouldn’t approve of the way I was working to save them brought satisfaction as I worked through the individual questlines.I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves to play online games. Whether is solo, restful and explorative gaming you enjoy or instanced based dungeons where you work as a team to defeat bosses and complete objectives, this game will provide 1000's of hours of enjoyment."
Positive,I was a little hesitant to get into ESO as I am not a fan of MMOs normally. My brother talked me into trying it out and I am glad I did. This game is everything I have been wanting in a follow up to Skyrim and has been so much fun. I play mostly PvE content and have joined an awesome community that helped me learn the game early on. Would highly recommend if you liked Skyrim or really any of the Elder Scrolls games.
Positive,"Wow.....I mean WOW! And I am not just saying that because its a World of Warcraft killer in my heart. I only just picked it up as it became buy-to-play (no subscription) and to me it surprised me more than I have seen out of any game in a while. So see alot of terrible reviews of it from when it came out but I can garentee it is nothing like that now. In short its same as Skyrim but in a MMO...has the same charm as Skyrim, gameplay and feel but in a more active world. I could write alot about this game but needless to say I think it is amazing and under-rated.To expand on why I think its great...Crafting is of somewhat intresting as you can find ""Motifs"" which unlock ""styles"" of weapons/armor you can make as you only unlock your selected character's race as the only starting crafting style. Next you have traits which give bonuses to items you make...however you must find an item with the train and then research it to learn how to make it. Lastly when looting or deconstructing items you may find rare-ish items that you use to upgrade gear stats to green, blue, purple or even yellow. On another note though, doing achivments can unlock you dyes which you can change the colours of your armor simular to Guild Wars 2. Stealing is a great way to make money as well as the posibility of obtaining instructions for crafting (such as cooking instructions or a motif book) so long as you dont get caught. Creating your character's abilities has alot of freedom to it as each class has 3 diffrent combat styles but every class has weapon, armor, racial, guild skills too they can spend skill point to unlocking abilities or passives.Though the very few bad points I could find are that the game handles really really well with low internet connection speeds but you should expect to wait for game elements to load if you have speeds under 400kb/sec as there is nothing more anoying as waiting for the enemy to render while its attacking you or trying to look a invisible chest. There is also a slight problem with overpopulation as its hard to go anywhere without worrying it may be overcrowded. Lastly, there is no real auction house in the game but ""Guild stores"" which you can access by being in a guild (Guild limit is 5 per account) so you can sell items on these guild stores which is only avalible to other guild members unless your guild has a ""trader"" NPC (traders allow people outside the guild to buy items from guild stores)"
Positive,"As a person who resonates more with single player RPG type games, I have to say that I really enjoy playing this one. While it's an MMORPG, you can play it as a solo player and treat it like any single player RPG. However, I have grown to appreciate some of the social elements that this game provides. It's fun to tackle a quest with a complete stranger, and I have even made a few friends this way through playing. The best part in my opinion is that there's no shortage of content. I've put in more than 400+ hours, and I still have so much left to do. Some of the side quests are actually really interesting as well, and I've enjoyed almost all of the main story zone level content that I've encountered. I also really enjoy how CP levels are available across all characters, making the creation of new characters and classes relativity easy. Being able to get this base game at $6, I think this is a steal for anyone looking for a story driven RPG with lots of content. Being able to access 95% of the DLC with an ESO membership is also a great deal since you subscribe each month that you want to play, and not subscribe when you're playing something else. I've played on and off for the last two years, and each time I come back I'm instantly reminded why I enjoy this game so much. The crown store is a little predatory, but not necessary and not ""pay to win"" in anyway. While it's not perfect, there's so much to like that I can overlook most of the negative drawbacks that present themselves. Some of the base game areas also look a little dated, but you can easily apply mods to make it a little more interesting from an aesthetics perspective. I think it's definitely worth a try when on sale for $6, and I'd recommend it to anyone who is primarly a single player RPG style gamer."
Positive,Absolutely love it. Great game. Great for the mmorpg genre as it is today. Great action. Great quest line stories. Great graphics. All together this game kicks ass. But best of all if you are an Elder Scrolls fan of any degree it makes this game 100x more amazing. Over all i love this game. I'll add a con or 2 though because obviously no game is flawless... Not a big fan of the way the community is currently (but its not as bad as WoW). The game is so easy to solo that everyones just on there own trip. But if u want to interact i suggest making a healing charecter cuz that will obvious attract people to want to actually play with you. Not to mention since healers cant fight well by them selves it forces you to make friends. But again im new only lvl 25 so far so it could get better. Other then that the whole of the game is fantastic and beautiful for everyone but especially for an Elder Scrolls fan.
Positive,"Just a mild thumbs up from me. I really want to like this game since I adore Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim, but I just don't care about MMO's.I mainly play ESO for the story, the world and the music. Most of the great things of ESO are things you recognize from the singleplayer Elder Scrolls games. It's good at times, but the MMO style fetch quests do get boring and drag out some potentially interesting lore.Give it a chance if you care about Elder Scrolls, but don't expect a multiplayer version of Skyrim."
Positive,"It's a very good MMO, but not a very good Elder Scrolls game."
Positive,Super Chill MMO
Positive,"Yunno why I recommend this game? We learn so much about Tamriel from it! Sure, the gameplay is a bit repetitive, and there's not as much to do here as in the regular games like Skyrim and Oblivion, but I recommend this game, for the lore nerds! You won't get this much lore from any other Elder Scrolls game!You get to go to EVERY providence, and learn a bit about each of the different cultures in this game, and get to set foot in so many different environments! The deserts of Hammerfell, the snowy lands of Skyrim, the swamps of Black Marsh, the volcanic lands of Morrowind, the green mountains and forests of High Rock, the fancy pink islands of the Summerset Isle, the jungles of Valenwood, the tropical paradise that is Elsywer, and of course Cyrodiil, the very center of it all! Not to mention all the different plains of Oblivion to go to - Mehrune's Dagon's Deadlands, and Molag Bal's Coldharbor are so different from eachother, and both menacing in different ways!You don't even hafta get all the DLCs, if you don't wanna, and if you wanna do the Dungeons, just wait for the free ESO Plus Trial, that goes on three times a year.Play alone, or with friends, either way, this is an Elder Scrolls experience you cannot miss! This'll keep ya waitin' for ES6, especially if you're tired of all the Skyrim re-releases."
Positive,"ESO, Elder Scrolls Online. A game that sucked at launch, but really picked themselves up. Unfortunately, most people are only seeing this improvement after it's most recent update one tamriel, but while this update makes ESO more like an Elder Scrolls Game, its been a fantastic MMO a while now! Buy this game if you enjoy a good community, a good MMO, hundreds of hours of entertaining content (i have almost 250 and i've probably only done around 1/3 of the content, not even), etc.There always is something to do, whether that be questing, pvping, interacting and playing with guilds, play with friends (yes, they fixed the party system), dungeoning (challenge yourself with varing difficulties), or simply grinding! You play how you want, and nothing (not even the class system) can stop you. All but 3 class specific skill lines are accessable no matter what class you chose (theres a shit ton of skill lines). BASICALLY its a really good game.Sometimes there are some annoying glitches. Questing can get boring if you do nothing else. Dungeon matchmaking takes way to long (if it even works?). Can be annoying waiting for bosses to respawn that were killed by other players.TL;DR8/10   Highly Recommended:- Solid MMO, really fun. Variety of things to do. Very Elder Scrolls-y now. Good Community. Great Guild system. Fun epic PVP."
Positive,"I didn't think this game would suck me in as much as it did. This game is nothing like all the reviews from 2 years ago, which is GOOD. ESO is heavily quest oriented, and doing all of them in an area usually leaves me being a few levels over the content by the time I have to move on to the next zone. No need to grind at all for experience if you like questing.You can spend HOURS just gathering resources if you wanted. They respawn fairly quickly. There is a skill that even makes them glow in the distance so you can see them from afar, and it's hard for me to resist gathering. Treasuring hunting is fun too, and chests are scattered around to be lock picked, and you can steal knicknacks out of containers to sell to a fence.A few cool things:You can join up to 5 different player guilds at once.You can reset your skills/attributes anytime, for a gold fee.There are multiple ways to expand your inventory, but it does get pricey.Many crafting materials are shared across all level tiers."
Positive,Favorite thing about the game is that you can travel across pretty much all of Tamriel. Lots and lots of content to keep you busy as well
Positive,"ESO > Lost ArkEdit after 400+ hours: ESO >>>>>Lost Ark. What an amazing game, and I still have barely scratched the surface. Content for years, literally."
Positive,"If this game was a potato, it would be a good potato. It used to be a bad potato, but now it is a good potato. Basically, it is a good potato."
Positive,"Started playing before it was released,but stopped because i wasnt a fan of the combat system(skill spam and passive RNG evasion).Years later,i was reading that the game has a justice system now,and that there are skills that bypass passive evasion.So i gave the game another try and....im glad i did,its decent.There is no cooldown for skills,but that doesnt mean that you will just spam the same skill most of the time,especially in cyrodil.The inferface is amazing,its so,,clean''.Instead of having a clustered up interface with countless quickslots and skillbars,you have a clear view.Pve is really fun.In other mmo,s....quests often feel a bit boring to me(i always read them though).But here,every quest has a voice over,and a good one too!You actually have to read the text and pay attention,because you can choose different answers in a dialogue sometimes,or because the map alone,wont help you all the time(the treasure quest in stros m'kai for example).The story is nice aswell.In short,the game is very immersive,not just because of the quests,also because of the first person view and bards.When im taking a break from questing/pvp or when im waiting for a dungeon group,i tend to stay in tha tavern in daggerfall near the fireplace and listen to the songs of the bard there,very relaxing.Housing is another strong point of eso:You can purchase/craft A LOT of furniture and place it freely in your house.And you can also purchase a lot of houses.You can invite other people to your house,place training dummies there,duel someone,place trophies of dungeon bosses...really well done.But there are also things i dont like.A minor flaw,but i still think its worth mentioning it:there are no capes/cloaks.I heard this was done for technical reasons,so yea.....As a newbie,you will pretty much just do dungeons with people,who already did this dungeon 344 million times.This means,they will rush trough the dungeon,with,or without you.Was already kicked once,just because i was the only one who was actually READING the quest in a dungeon.Another time,people didnt wait and i had no time to read the quest.For a newbie,the dungeons are way too easy,because you always land in groups full of veterans,who could easily finish the dungeon without your help,you dont feel needed.This is,in my oppinion,the games bigest flaw:The pvp.There is cyrodil,there are bg,s and there are duels.Cryodil has been in the game for a very long time already,its fun,but nothing new.Bg,s came later,but they are....bg,s.Basic stuff.And duels are just that,duels,nothing special either.The only pvp feature standing out here,is the faction war in cyrodil,but it looks like the devs dont really care about cyrodil anymore.The justice system,was going to be a pvp feature,where players could steal from npc,s or murder them,and other players could hunt the criminals down.Now THIS would be a amazing pvp feature,but the pve crowd complained,so it wasnt added to the game,leaving everyone with a broken,,justice''system that makes it way too easy for players to,well,be a criminal,often resulting in very immersion breaking moments,where you witness the murder of npc,s you like,without anything you can do about it.Was really looking forward to some open world pvp content and i still hope we will have it one day.Maybe vampire vs werewolf fights or guild battles.Could also happen in cyrodil or somewhere else,as long as they add new pvp content besides arena-like stuff.Summerset isnt going to add ANYTHING new to the pvp aspect of the game....kinda sad.The pve is already very good,its the pvp part that needs some work.So....if you like pve,if you search for a mmo with a nice atmosphere,if you enjoy a mmo with full voice acting and you care about the story.....then by all means,get this game.If youre looking for a game with plenty of pvp features,you might not have a lot of fun here."
Positive,"The game has received a lot of bad reviews talking about how it's a WoW clone and it's really buggy, (most of these reviewers played before the Tamriel Unlimited update went live) but I don't think it's true. Bear in mind, I haven't got to endgame yet so I won't talk about it until I have, if I ever do. First of all, it's not buggy, I haven't played too much (around 30-40 hours at the time) and haven't found any bugs (unlike in Skyrim or any Bethesda game).Now, about it being a WoW clone, I don't think it's true (and I do play WoW quite frequently), and it feels way more similar to Everquest 2, mainly because it's very open (at least while leveling). When leveling up, you can walk in a direction and you'll probably find quests there, but it's also really good that it's almost impossible to get lost; in EQ2 I played through the tutorial and everything is cool, but then they take me to the city (Qeynos I think) and you're on your own, so I think ""well, I guess I can just start picking up quests outside the city"", and while it's true, I always ended up taking quests that were 5 levels higher than me, which resulted in awful grinding because I didn't know where to go. In ESO, by the time you get to the higher level quests, you'll be ready to do it, because they put the harder quests far from the starting zones. Also, the quests can feel sometimes like they are the classic ""kill X until Y drops"" or ""go to X, take Y and come back to me"", because they are (just like in Skyrim or any other game) but they know how to hide it, and also you will sometimes get a choice and sometimes it is either the evil way or the good way, but sometimes it's not; the last one I did was about getting a crown for a noble woman and at the end, a ghost that has been helping you, tells you to release him by making the princess touch a cursed crown instead of the real crown, so basically you can give her the real crown or the cursed crown. Combat is kinda action based and kinda targeted, if you've played DC Universe Online, it's pretty much the same without combos, (but way more customizable thanks to the skills being based on your guilds, weapons, class and so on) if you haven't played it, you don't have an auto attack button like in all tab targeting games, but your regular attack is triggered by the mouse button, you can block and dodge, and you can charge your attack, but you also have the hotkey skills.  Crafting is also a pretty big part of the game and it's actually pretty ok. I like it but it's not really innovative in any way. You get styles that change the look of the items, but not their stats (so you won't see everyone walking around in the same armor just because it's the most powerful one), and to change their stats you can:1) increase the ingots (or leather or whatever) that will go into the creation of the item, increasing it's level. 2) use better materials, which will increase it's level even more, and change the look a little bit, but keep the same style. 3) improve the item's quality using rare items, but the upgrade's success is based on how many of this items you use, and if you fail, the item will be destroyed. But this is also the only way to improve items without increasing it's level, which is useful because you can't equip items that outlevel you. And resource gathering isn't bad because there aren't too many mineral deposits, but you can destroy items you have to create materials. I've only been in one dungeon and it was really fun, and it's also a bit more social due to the fact that there's no group finder so you actually have to form a group, I don't really have much more to say. Imperial City PvP is also really big but I haven't played much of it, and if you're into PvP it could be really fun. It also doesn't feel forced into the experience, so if you like PvE you don't actually need to play it. Also, the graphics were criticized because they're stylized or ""cartoony"" but I really like them and you can play on potato PCs without any problem, I could run it in a non gaming netbook as long as I kept the graphics low. It's also really good that there's no monthly sub so you never feel like you need to play and you can pick it up whenever you want. All that being said, the game has it's flaws, but they don't ruin the experience (for me, at least), just hold it back. First of all is the community, specially in Daggerfall's (Daggerfall Covenant's starting zone) General Chat, it's basically Barrens' Chat. Mostly filled with assholes.  And then there's the people you'll find during your leveling experience, that will probably never respond to you and if you invite them to a group, they'll reject even though (s)he knows you're doing the same quest. But, of course, you'll also find some really cool people. The mega server is awful, mostly because there are no ""special ruleset"" servers, so no world PvP and it's also a shame for roleplayers because the only way you'll find roleplay is in a roleplay guild. And it also doesn't serve it's purpose of making zones feel more alive and having friends play with you because it has some really weird phasing thing going on. There are only 4 classes, and even though they're kind of customizable, having more would be great.Also, for the first 16 levels, your gear will look the same way except for the racial styles. There are not too many dyes and most of the easy ones to get aren't really good. One of the most important ones is that you do get that feel of ""I'm the One, but I still see 10 ""the Ones"" walking around"". And the loading screens, I don't think they are that bad for everyone, but if you have a low end PC, you will have some really long loading screens. TL;DR (kind of).After all, I think it's a great game but don't go expecting Elder Scrolls 6, which was most people's mistake, but it's also not an ES themed WoW clone, it actually feels way more open and closer to the ES experience. Also, a little advice, don't rush to endgame, just like in any ES game, you don't rush through it, and now that there's no sub, there's no excuse to rush it. I'll probably update this review once I get to endgame, and I'll also check out the RPing community and overall experience."
Positive,Nothing better I can be doing with my life except waste it on this game. And my money in fact.
Positive,Pros:+ Community+ Design+ Gameplay+ Deep lore and story+ MusicCons:- Subscription price

Positive,10/10 Better than WoW's current state.
Positive,ESO:+Very2 Open World+Many Cities+Many Skills And Items+Many Enemies+Many Quest To Complete+The Graphics Is Very2 Good9/10
Positive,"Look pal, you're missing your Elder Scrolls nice single player adventures? Time to get this game. It's HUGE and it's super story rich. Not your normal super-grind super-powerplay mmorpg, and that's exactely what keeps it alive so many years after the launch."
Positive,"At first I was very skeptical because Elder Scrolls was in my mind always the ultimate Single Player Game, but damn was I wrong.....Get this game if you like Elder Scrolls, beautifull places to see, good written Storylines and Quests and tons of books to read (which I always loved since Morrowind)."
Positive,"Well, if you look at my hours of playtime I can tell you that,this game is a form of addiction, you just cant stop playing because of the continuation of exploration and events that come along, as well as pve/pvp. Nobody in this game is 100% completed in this game because it has so much to offer.I've played every class fully, and I'd recommend this game of its amazing creation of this game.The only negative about this game is that PvP has alot of bugs and still needs fixing, but further no issues on any other playstyle.I give it a 9/10"
Positive,"NECROM 2023 UPDATEOh, I have not updated this in a while. Its still one of my top games after all these years and thousands of hours. Still have an absurd amount to finish on my 1 character (quests, stories, and achivements). Just nomintaed for 2023 Labor of Love because of the design shift to now start doing a big free Q4 update to the base game instead of a cash small dlc. SO Endless Archive was a real tipping point for me to squeak VERY loudly and clap like a seal. The actual chapter of Necrom is really good. Main quest and stories in that zone are great but the world map design for Necrom was a small letdown for me. All in all its worth it for ESO fans and the new companions are great!HIGH ISLE UPDATEI swear to god it was around 2 am (reset time for me) and I 'poped in to do a few card games' then I looked up and its almost 6am. Like what the heck dude!EDIT Nov 27,2019...I nominated this for the Labor of Love award. Didn't really buy much off steam this year it turns out but ZOS really deserves it. Each year this game gets better and better. Still enjoying this one a bunch!EDIT Feb 13, 2018...The new Dragonbones update has brought a much needed revitalization of the armor cosmetic system. We can now change the style of our armor and weapon for gold based off the styles we have unlocked. Best part is we can change the color of weapons now! A few other changes like visual ques to activate synergies has been added and they lowered the absurd cost of blocking for non-tanks. ZOS team is doing a fine job. Did I mention we can stash stuff in our homes with new storage items? Keep it up guys!I own the game and now all DLC and account upgrades permanently. With the latest One Tamriel update, the quality of the NPCs/ voice acting and the promise of player housing in 2017 (its already live on PST to some degree) ESO is a serious recommendation if you are a fan of The Elder Scrolls verse.Over 1,ooo quests [in just the base game]... a massive open world... freedom to build your character's class how you wish as you go... truly breathtaking locations... some seriously inventive quests... and of course the 'buy-to-own' game model...Before One Tamriel I would not have recommend it. Now I do. Completely. Do yourself a favor and buy this non-instanced MMO (this is coming from an ati-WoW gamer that HATES non-instaned MMOs)! I give this work of art a 5/ 5"
Positive,"Do not play this game expecting it to be purely Skyrim with multiplayer or an MMO with an Elder Scrolls skin.  You need to play it as a combination of the two if you want to fully enjoy the experience.Pros:-More emphasis on placement and movement than most other MMO's-Nostalgic feel traveling through previous zones from Elder Scrolls games-Great music-Great graphics-Great questing experience (plot, NPC dialogue, environments)-In-depth crafting system, which is required to make/upgrade some of the best items-Healing is not watching health bars, most spells require positioning and resource management-Tanking is harder because there are no Area of Effect taunts, all are single target.  You need to prioritize targets because you can't taunt them all most of the time-Resource management is important in both PvE and PvPCons:-'Looking For Group' tool is not used by players, and not reliable for finding groups for dungeons.  you must use zone chats or guilds-'Damage Per Second' role isn't any different from other MMO's, it's all a skill rotation over and over.-Grouping in general is somewhat hard to come by if you are not at end-game content or doing popular content (like dungeons)-All magicka spells can be cast while holding block, making them immune to stuns at the cost of losing some stamina.  This is the biggest flaw for PvP-PvP can be boring after a short amount of time because there is no clear ""winner"".  It uses the same model of Planetside 2 (3 alliances, none can be completely eliminated and the real invenctive is to earn points by doing PvP related things).Overall this is my favorite game in years and for now I give it 9/10, but once traditional Elder Scrolls features get added shortly (like Thieve's Guild, Dark Brotherhood, and killing NPCs) it will be at least 9.5/10 or maybe 10/10 for me."

(again)I did a first review with mixed feelings for The Elder Scrolls Online  when it first came out. I recently decided to give it another try. First off, it is important to state that this game is not Skyrim and will never be. Though, that doesn't make it bad or not part of the Elder Scrolls series. Following the colossal success of  The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim  made the hopes and aspirations for  The Elder Scrolls Online an almost impossible to create experience. Zenimax Online Studios and Bethesda, had no margin of error and the multiple reviews were quick to criticize the project. A lot has changed since then. Faithful to a very long Elder Scrolls tradition, everything begins behind bars. You don't really know why, except that you must have been crazy drunk, once again. The customization screen lets you create a character to your liking with a lot of different possibilities. You can't really process what is happening around you, but a great escape from this ""jail"" is on-going and you were ""here"". Reminding you of your escape from Helgen in Skyrim or the secret escape in Oblivion. This time on the other hand, you are escaping a Daedric prison. Not bad.The Combat system is continuous and extremely dynamic, every action requiring either a mouse click or a button to press. Very similar to what The Elder Scrolls has always been. You can alternate between quick attack, strong attack, block, interruption and ""exploit"" (that will let you put a stunned enemy to the ground with a strong attack). Let's note that the dodge mechanic (a tumble in any direction) is now useable by all characters instead of being a skill to unlock. The whole combat experience makes it for a very dynamic environment, you really feel a lot of satisfaction when you crush someone's face with a strong attack. I'm starting to think that only magic staffs could use a small enhancement in comparison to the good old steel.   Adding up to the fighting system is a skill bar, five plus an ultimate. Going from the gap closer to the poison. Nothing is really crazy or innovative but the fact that you can level up anything at anytime and use it will really have an impact on your gameplay, style and experience. You can then mix up any weapons, with any kind of armours and guilds you join will give you new skills that will add some spice or originality to your build. This freedom is greatly appreciated. It is also possible to become a werewolf or a vampire that will add up their entire perks of passive / active spells. The Elder Scrolls Online, will also let you acquire new skills by exploring, reading books, killing people in PvP etc.   In terms of questing, everything is quite linear and similar to other games. Go fetch X, go kill Y Z times. Every area opening the way for the other. On the other hand, you don't really get the feeling of always following the roadside. The extremely large size of the maps and the presence of content almost everywhere tries to give you the same feeling of freedom you could find in Skyrim while adventuring, tempted to do something else and exploring a new area at any moment's notice. Small dungeons and crypts or other instance are always present on every map for the curious adventurer. Making you forget the super important and time sensitive mission you were on because your attention deficit told you to go explore this instead. Every character and quest is being voiced and that makes what could be a repetitive and broing experience more attractive. The Elder Scrolls Online is faithful to a long tradition of well built story and lore. Even though most quests are a bit weak on that part, some of the choices you will have to make are totally heartbreaking. One of the big asset of the questing Zenimax did could also be its weakness. You feel like you are playing a Solo game; at all times. Except when you look around to see if someone's trying to kill a world boss or clear a public event.  Artistically, the game might be recycling the decors a bit too much. It becomes very obvious when entering a tower. But the fact that you won't lag when processing a ton of players fighting in PVP or big spells is quite a feat; even on some bad computers / connection. Otherwise, you will encounter beautiful landscapes and maps that will make for beautiful screenshot, but you won't find that Skyrim touch and taking screenshots in an MMO is more complicated sometimes !Finally, the crafting system is rich, probably richer than most MMORPG without being completely unreasonable it seems being able to master the crafting arts is especially long. The interface is quite horrible, but nothing mods can't fix. This review will probably see some updates with time, subscribe to get the latest. If you like this join me there:"
Positive,"The One Tamriel update makes this a lot more accessible for casual players. No grind, no bullshit before you get to the fun parts. Some of the QoL stuff like level scaling for multiplayer dungeons and free teleporting to party members seems too easy and immersion breaking but it's actually so refreshing to just be able to go and play dungeons and other fun stuff right off the bat. I don't need another x-hundred hour long grind 'before it gets good TM'. I think because of this you also don't really feel concerned about your build, FOMO for certain quests and items blah blah. You just roll up a character, pick abilities that look cool, take quests that sound fun, and have a good time. Also, two little things I like: free mount at lv 10 - with no annoying quest to start using it: it basically shows up in your pocket; and heaps of emotes that I feel just about every other modern game like this would have hidden behind microtransactions."
Positive,"BE WARNED!!!! THIS IS NOT SKYRIM!! DON'T BUY THIS EXPECTING TO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE YOU HAD WITH SKYRIM.This has more of an online RPG type of feeling. IT IS DIFFERENT THAN SKYRIM!!The game system (like the crafting, and the fighting type except the bow) is mostly the same, except maybe the skill system (the skill system is dependent on ur race and class).I'd recommend it as an online RPG game (personally, I had more fun with Skyrim, but this is also fun).(It'd be really helpfull if u guys can give it a thumbs up so that people can see this, because I have seen a lot of people giving this game a thumbs down because they expected this to be like Skyrim but online).Cheers!!"
Positive,"Fun game, fairly interesting story with a ton of quests. Very different from wow and other typical MMO's and plays more like a single player RPG which I think is part of it's appeal. Quests aren't the typical fetch and kill quests like other MMO's, another plus. For 20 bucks you can get quite a bit of entertainment out of this game, the story line is pretty interesting too."
Positive,"Best MMO in the medieval fantasy genre i've ever played. I hold it just as high (if not higher) than The Old Republic. WHich is possibly my favorite mmo. So there's a chance this one trumps it and is my favorite. Not sure though... I'm a star wars junkie. Regardless, this game is simply amazing. I'd reccommend it to anyone looking to have a great elder scrolls experience."
Positive,"When Oblivion came out, people expected Morrowind 2.0When Skyrim came out, people expected Oblivion 2.0When ESO came out, people expected Skyrim 2.0 I would say that ESO is more like Oblivion: OnlineI mean that as a good thing, as Oblivion was my favourite Elder Scrolls. ESO adopted and improved the best Lockpicking minigame from Oblivion. ESO's Racial and Architectural diversity is a lot like Oblivion's. Its not a gaggle of Nords and Dunmer like Skyrim or Morrowind.ESO abandoned Skyrim's equipable and underpowered magic system in favour of a hotkey system, meaning you can fight with a greatsword or Bow and still use magic, just like in Oblivion.The main plot of Oblivion was basically rebooted in ESO, I would argue, more effectively so. Molag Bal is a better villian to attempt to take over Tamriel than Mehrunes Dagon was in Oblivion.In my opinion, Anchors are more intimidating than Gates.The graphics are amazing, you can revisit Skyrim, Cyrodiil, or Morrowind without commiting to one Province's climate. The voice acting is phenomenal. Every single character is voiced. You won't only be hearing the same three people putting on accents to sound like Nords or Khajiit, you will hear iconic voices like John Cleese, Bill Nighy, Michael Gambon, Malcolm Mcdowell, Alfred Molina, and another 70 professional voice actors. I am spoiled after playing this game, I can barely read my own review without expecting to hear Dumbledore or Doc Oc telling me about how I'm the chosen one. Which brings me to my next point, all of the ""Main Quest"" missions where you encounter characters who interact with your personal progress are Single Player Instances. So you WILL NOT see other players talking to the Prophet. As far as you know, you are the only ""Souless One"", just like you thought you were the only ""Dovahkiin"", ""Champion of Cyrodiil"", or ""Nerevarine"". Also, the entire world is instanced in a way that prevents you from seeing players who have saved a city from destruction until you, yourself, have also saved the city. Most importantly, an Online Elder Scrolls is constantly being updated and patched. Overpowered exploits and glitches are fixed on an ongoing basis, you can't cheat your way through the game like you could in Morrowind or Oblivion. No more rushed questlines leading to plot holes and half-baked concepts, like in Skyrim. It's not Skyrim 2.0, It's Better."
Positive,i feel dumb for buying the dlcs separately and not just subbing ...
Positive,A lot to do and the mechanics are decent and not PTW unless if you are in to cosmetics
Positive,"As many other games I enjoy a good story and characters, while being able to explore and have tons of lore. This game does that for me, The amount of stuff to do in this game, from main story and side quests, to finding all sorts of things along the way is incredible, and I doubt I'll ever finish it all in my life time :)."
Positive,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this game. I've played a few MMO's in the past, and I have to say the genre had worn thin with me. Styles akin to kill X number of enemies here, pick up X amount of items there; did little to keep my interest. I decided to give this a go and I can honestly say the experience is wonderful. I'm a solo player and there is always something to spend my time doing, whether it be going on adventures with quest storylines that actually feel well thought out and are engaging, to simply wandering around collecting materials for crafting, cooking or making your own equipment. I definitely feel as though I have barely begun to scratch the surface and I'm definitely looking forward to making new discoveries in the future."
Positive,"A lvl 31 (currently) Dragonknight Nord's OpinionThis game isn't what the community wanted. We wanted an Elder Scrolls Game with MMO Elements (AKA Skyrim Online), But instead, they gave us an MMO with Elder Scrolls Elements. People seem to think that just because this isn't Skyrim Online that it is a bad game. Personally, I think it is really enjoyable. I haven't seen too much of the game, but the PvE is fun, but the only real problem I have with the game is the levelling. I don't mean to say it is too hard to gain levels, but the exp should be boosted a small bit for quests so you can actually keep up with the levels, without having to farm enemies until you get a high enough level to continue without being stomped on. In the end, if you want Skyrim Online, don't buy it. It's not what you are going to get. If you actually want an MMO set in the world of TES, then yes, go ahead and buy it.Overall, I rate it 8/10."
Positive,"Many mythological characters we only hear in the main 5 games are actual talkable characters in this. Dailies/Weeklies are fun, unlike WoW, where you want to shoot off your leg doing them. These will take an hour max. You get your usual do a dungeon for a boost of XP. Your crafting is based on your proficiency at a crafting tree; how many points you invested will change the materials you craft with; these quests give you great rewards.The DLC/Expansions release on the game works as such. First, they release an expansion sized update to the game (usually £30 on release but can get it on cdkeys for half price usually); they then follow it up with 2 DLC sized stuff, usually much smaller but still incredibly noticeable and relevant. It's a great model; it adds new gathering/crafting skills and really creates a constant fresh feeling to the game with new sets/new recipes/new activities.The game itself is a lot of fun, it is not at all like a traditional MMO. In a lot of ways it feels like a single player RPG that you can play with other people if you want to, and I like that personally. The game makes you want to waste your time, and I am hooked. If the servers worked and the bugs got fixed this would be an easy 10/10 but until they are fixed its an 8 /10 from me. 100% worth a try!To finish off, as someone else said in the review: this game ruined my life. Had fun tho 👍🏿"
Positive,"If you're looking for an MMO with clear love and care put into every inch of it, then look no further. With goals, consistent pacing, incredible voice acting as well as smooth and varied combat, in the 400 hours I've put into this game I've hardly scratched the surface. However incredible this game is, it's never without flaw.For one, the base game - whilst still incredibly vast and intricate, can be somewhat limiting without ESO+. Some dungeons and rooms will bear striking resemblance from Grahtwood to Reaper's March, but it's not enough of an issue to be overbearing. Some aspects of the game encourage routine or obsession - i.e daily login rewards.Basic recipes and unlockables do not transfer between characters, though styles do.Without guidance, some classes can be a bit of a drag.There are items that boost stats by a small amount for a limited time that you can purchase for real money, but frankly almost everything you yourself can make will always be better.I've found coming into this game to have expectations - I jumped in blind and still had an amazing time - but know that this game -is- at it's prime when you are subbed to ESO+. Trust me when I say that it, at the very least, gives you a bang for your buck. For as long as you're subbed, you get every bit of DLC and crowns to spend on fun cosmetics in the store. The DLCs and lands beyond are where this game hits it's stride. Elsweyr, Summerset Isles, Morrowind, Skyrim, High Isles, all of it. The stories are so vast, incredible, and grasping without teetering off of cool aesthetics and gameplay vibes. SPOILER:I was walking through the desert jungle in Northern Elsweyr. I heard a Khajiit calling out to me, the voice actor clearly being Liam O'Brien. Of course, I paused in my journey to hear what the cat-fursona of Illidan Stormrage needed, and he was panicked and frustrated about his temple's acolytes being utterly entranced and insane by something. Travelling to this gorgeous view, we're met with some little Alfiq named 'Skooma Cat'. He makes some little remarks, cackling and giggling before leading us to the temple, to where the priestess is perched on the ledge, gigging and crying out about how throwing herself off would let her see what their lunar gods had in store as for salvation. Turns out, Sheogorath had taken control of the temple for fun, and we have to play his game to get them unstuck.This was an optional, very easily avoided side quest. There are hundreds of these everywhere, with plots thick and writing sublime.I highly recommend this game. It can be played easily as a casual player or sweaty if you're feeling hardcore."
Positive,"I've always loved TES lore and world, this is a game where you can do what you want and when you want. You wanna PVP go for it, you might get your arse handed to you at first but who cares, grow stronger. You wanna prance around and gather flowers? Do it, you want to craft goods and wares and sell to make a profit? Do it, you want to RP with friends and goof off? Do it. This is a world where you can do what you want to do. The graphics are great, the devs are always keeping things updated and working on new surprises. The content is amazing... Word of advise if you are serious into it the ESO Subscription is well worth it just for the crafting bag alone.. Other than that, itt's just a beautiful game all around."
Positive,"+Exploration is core gameplay and quite fun. You can get xp for just discovering locations+Looting is fun & engaging, best in any mmo I've played.+Voice acted npcs & quests+Quests are actually interesting & engaging, even side quests. I feel like there's more quests than I could ever possibly do+Crafting is fun and well done (only have done it casually so idk what its like for a pro seller)+Dungeon matchmaking is done very well. Very easy for me as a casual to jump in and play as a healer or dps (haven't tried tank) any time I feel like it and get in quickly.-Combat can become boring since you only have a few abilities at once. Would be better with like 10 abilities at once or more like most mmos. This is probably my biggest gripe with the game honestly is the repetitive combat.-Graphics could be much better. The scenery is pretty but the models seem old especially characters and the colors are more dull than they seem like they should be-Sometimes it can be hard to make a female character actually look pretty or feminine. Limited character creator options for hair/face"
Positive,"TLDR: Yes, recommended. I love the Elder Scrolls franchise, and the relatability of this game to those who have played any of the single player games. For me personally, the Morrowind content is much loved. I enjoy the gameplay mechanics with the exclusion of crafting for actual competitive play, and am in love with the beautiful environments to explore, the ever-growing lore, and near-unending quest lines.Story: I love exploring the different factions' quest lines, motivations, and perspectives. And in all the years and hundreds of hours of playing, have never run out of things to do.Content: Unique solo quests, community world bosses, group dungeoning, guild raids, and things in between. Plenty to keep us entertained! Though Combat is the primary focus as is common with MMOs. I enjoy the combat and variety available, and my only complaint is the Double Hotbar swap thing that caters to console players and the inherent limitations of their controllers. Having those same limitations carry over to computer play is infuriating. Thankfully on computer it still works better than on console (works fine on console still) and the ability to add plugins for enhancing the user experience on computer is wonderful.Visuals and Sounds: Lovely music, both old from other games in the franchise, and new, brings an enjoyable atmosphere. The sound effects and audio in general is well done, making the game feel enjoyable and immersive, and the audio work for characters is well done. I am very glad to have an MMO where the dialogue is voiced, not just text. As for visuals, I find the game to be gorgeous, and appreciate a more photo-realistic style of game to immerse myself in. Many times I am exploring a region for the unique landscape and views more than anything.Singleplayer: Singleplayer is enjoyable and doable. The addition of companions made it even better. I very often quest solo to explore the stories and lore at my own pace.Multiplayer: Up to 12 people in the overworld, up to 4 for dungeons, and I forget what for Trials (raids). I have greatly enjoyed exploring Zones with a group of friends as we help each other enjoy all a region has to offer. And having the classical group roles works well for this game. One decade-long complaint I have is inadequate support for Guilds and Socializing. Please add more meaning to having Guilds such as true guild bases.Monetization: The cost vs content for the expansions is well worth it, and I hold the same opinion for the content-based DLCs. I am an opponent to Loot Boxes and the gambling nature of them. The Crown Store overall is fine by me, except for the stuff that are severe quality of life enhancements like the Banker, Merchant, and Deconstructor. Those are both expensive and can greatly improve quality of life. Things like Mundus stones and most Crown Store stuff in general is crazy expensive for what it is. I get offering actual content like new houses for money, but damn, the prices are above what I can mark as ok."
Positive,"Although it can be addictive, this non-pay-to-win game is a great MMORPG and a must-play for those who love the world of TES."
Positive,"Before I played The Elder Scrolls® Online i had a small wee wee, no friends, no girlfriend, depression and absolutely no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
Positive,Treat it like another ES game and then you can enjoy the story. The endgame I will leave to others to judge.
Positive,Played in the free weekend.Now im going to buy the full game ^^
Positive,"Overtime ESO has become one of my favorite MMORPGs, and this is coming from an old WoW Veteran.This game has wonderful visuals(graphics) and tones of lore. The community is strong and the games content keeps flowing. ESO is also great for holding you over for Elder Scrolls VI!"
Positive,"For the previous review, I apologize to everyone and the supporter of this game (Bethesda_Tisumineko), I wrote the review in a hurry, and when I am in a game and times are bitter, I hate it for reasons other than the game, and I should not complain about the game because of this. . I re-created the review from scratchThe Elder Scrolls® Online is a great mmo title and I think it can be a very fun game to play with your friends. The dlc free atmosphere, which is the main one, is inspired by morrowind and is really very good and beautiful, and I will show you some examples of the beautiful environment of this game at the end. The gameplay is very comfortable and everyone is familiar with the elder series and knows so there is no need to explain.Those who want to play this game for a long time, please do not play alone and sometimes go with your friends so that you do not feel tired or repetitive of this game. If you do not find anyone in different areas of the game, do not worry because most players go to famous areas or to do a quest (I saw the eu server) and the most famous part where the number of players is high and most quests are done there or The event takes place at the bottom of the map, which looks like an island. (Be careful because your fps will decrease due to the size of the players.) The game has an extremely long gameplay with thousands of dlc that you can buy from your game store, and can entertain you for many years. I think that was enough explanation and I apologize again for the previous ESO review and show the 3 screenshots of the game environment that I said below."

Positive,"By far the most immersive MMO I have played. You really do feel like you're in Tamriel and that things change according to your actions. No fetch quests, no kill 10 boar quests and mass turn in to move to another quest hub. Everything happens naturally as you explore the world out of sheer curioty. Everything is really well detailed and you can see that they've put a lot of care into it. Sometimes you're galloping through a lonely road and you find a NPC asking for help, and you decide to embark on it and when you least realize, you're inside some evil dungeon trying to rescue someone, and what's more, sometimes quests have different ends that reflect upon the world according to your choice! All fully voice acted.The only con I would say about this game is its price generally speaking. I find things a bit too expensive. Crowns are expensive, DLCs are expensive, expansions too. If you can overlook that, and you are a fan of fantasy medieval stuffs then you're in for a big treat."
Positive,"So after 6 years of ESO, it is still going strong, and shows no sign of letting up either. The game is brilliant, the community in game is mostly helpful and decent.I have played many more hours than shows on my profile, due to playing it through the launcher and not steam.There are some weird reviews on here moaning about one thing or another, whether critters can't be killed at high level, or it's a grind etc.....Yes it's a grind to an extent, otherwise the game would be over quick smart wouldn't it?If you're struggling killing critters at high level, then maybe play another game like pacman?!?Yes this game has bugs, which game doesn't?The game is massive, make no mistake about it, thousands of quests, daily events and group dungeons, PvE or PvP, it's your choice......ESO plus is excellent as you get all DLC (Not Chapters) and you also get infinite space in craft bag.It's one of the best MMO's out there, if not the best....."
Positive,"If you are looking for the next epic adventure Elder Scrolls game after Skyrim, then skip this and wait for TES6. I'm a single-person game player predominantly, and enjoy story, character development, and immersion more than anything else, like Skyrim and The Witcher 3.What's good? The graphics are very good and I wish the levels and enemies could grace a first-person adventure game, maybe in TES6. Vast landscapes. Adventuring with friends or random players. No subscription required. It's under constant development that is really making an entire world of Elder Scrolls come alive.What's annoying? Although you can play in 1st or 3rd person, it plays like a 3rd person game all the time. Thus there's none of the sword-play found in other Elder Scroll games. Instead you just button mash your shortcut key to do a flurry of attacks, drink your potions, and cast spells. There's no steel on steel as attacks seemingly go through everything. There's no reeling from a power attack. There's no sniping a character or monster from a mile away with arrows. The NPCs don't 'live' in the game, they just stay at the forge all day or at their shop all day. As a result, this plays more like a game of Dragon Age or WOW, than any other Elder Scrolls game in the last 15 years.However you can get it for free, minus the storage space to install it. So try it out for yourself."
Positive,It just works
Positive,There is no doubt in my mind that this is the greatest login failure simulator of all time.
Positive,"In Tamriel's darkened corners, where shadows intertwine,A tale unfolds, a chilling lore, beneath a blood-red sign.As moons converge and spirits dance on this eve so dire,The Elder Scrolls awaken, stoking a malevolent fire.In the heart of Coldharbour, Molag Bal grins with glee,His whispers echo through the night, a haunting symphony.Dread Father, Lord of Brutality, his presence now revealed,A sinister pact, a covenant, in Oblivion concealed.Through murky swamps and haunted woods, the Undead start to rise,Their hollow eyes, a vacant stare, beneath the moonlit skies.Crypts breathe a sigh, their secrets stir, as phantoms gently wail,A necromancer's dark embrace, as life and death assail.In forgotten tombs, where echoes linger, specters softly tread,Ancient curses, restless spirits, tales of the long-lost dead.The cryptic runes upon the walls, cryptic whispers in the air,A binding spell, a necromantic spell, a ghastly affair.Through desolate landscapes, shrouded in an eternal night,Vampires awaken from their slumber, thirsting for the light.Sanguine hunger in their eyes, as they prowl the streets,Beware the bite, the crimson kiss, where eternity meets.A coven in the shadows, chanting with a sinister glee,Witches' brews and hexes cast, a wicked jubilee.Hagravens cackle in the glade, a foul and twisted dance,As werewolves howl in chorus, under the moon's enchant.Within the halls of madness, where Daedric lords hold sway,Sheogorath, the Madgod, invites you to his play.In a realm of chaos, where sanity's thread is frayed,Lose yourself in the labyrinth, where reason is betrayed.As the clock strikes midnight, and darkness claims the land,The Elder Scrolls whisper secrets, a prophecy close at hand.Horrors untold, nightmares unfold, in this spectral ballet,In the Elder Scrolls Online, where the frights of Tamriel lay."
Positive,"I really wasn't expecting this game to be as good as it is. I watched that weird CGI trailer 4 years ago and thought it didn't look anything like TES, and seemed like an attempt to make a quick and easy profit out of Skyrim's success, so I didn't know what to expect from the actual game. To my surprise, it feels like genuine effort and passion went into the project.The quests are really well written and often ask you to make difficult decisions that go beyond ""the nice option and the evil option"", which is something I absolutely did not expect from an MMO. It's far from the ""mindless automatic-mode"" questing from WoW and other similar games. Whatever choice you make probably won't have any long term consequences, but the writers did a good job creating characters and stories worth getting invested in, so they still feel like they matter.As for the gameplay itself, it's good. I'm not sure what else to say about it. I've played several MMOs but I've never been a huge fan of these types of games, so I don't know what actual MMO players are looking for. All I know is that the combat is dynamic enough to be interesting, you can make some cool builds, and it's pretty fun overall. Managing crafting materials without being subscribed to a Plus Membership can be annoying, but isn't as horrendous as other reviews make it out to be, I personally just throw everything in the bank where it's conveniently available to all my characters.So yeah, I recommend it, specially when it's on sale. As I'm writing this, I only have the base game and the Morrowind Chapter (which is free) and I haven't felt the need to pay for a Plus Membership."
Positive,"Incredible quests and so much to doYou can play it alone or with friends - either way you'll have great crack.So far I haven't got bored of it at all, overall a great game"
Positive,i regret not getting this in 2015 but still has alot of active accounts and very entertaining. why did i wait for 2019 sale idk but this by far is the most fun i have had in a game for a while also very addictive for those who like mmo. There is a rich story and lore to be found in this grand adventure with defining your character play style. no need to dedicate to just a healer can be a tanking healer but it still blows my mind that i havent even scratched 10 percent of what elder scrolls has to offer. Each boss battle doesnt have to be alone there are tons of people able to fight along side you to get that lil bit of progress done.
Positive,"This game received horrific reviews and impressions when first released, so I steered very, very clear of it until it went ""no sub"" ...here are my impressions.First off - If you're looking for a MMO, in a World of Warcraft, Wildstar, Tera, etc etc etc sense...  This might not be for you.The emphasis certainly seems to be on single player questing.... Think SWTOR.  EVERYTHING is voice acted, and actually voice acted well.  The Elder Scrolls lore is all very rich, very detailed, and very accurate.  If you enjoyed any of the ES titles, you owe it to yourself to give this a whirl, if only for the amazing single player experience.Group dynamics, for dungeons and questing...  a little lacking.  While it can be great fun to roll through a dungeon with a few buddies, some times getting a group together using the group finder tool can be quite a task.  Perhaps that is because of low population, but I think it has more to do with the actual group finder tool just not working.  There is another, REAL annoying glitch that can affect your character, because of the Veteran system, essentially forcing you to beg a Veteran Character (level 50, prestiged, basically) to join your group and toggle an option so that you can enter dungeons again.  It's not game-breaking, but it is pretty frustrating when it occurs.  Another rather major issue I have with the Faction system is this.  You are given a choice of 3 Factions to join, each faction has 3 respective races of which they belong.  The problem here is that if your friends want to play, as say a Nord, and you selected a Bosmer.... you will never play with each other on those characters.  Ever.  You can be in the same guild and communicate that way, but other than that, the only opportunity you have to even see eachother will be during PVP.  That's it.  It's a move at bolstering ""Faction Pride"", I suppose, but all it really does is segregate the player base and further detract from the whole MMO experience.  It is very likely that you are going to want to play a different race than your buddy, for whatever reason  (RP, min/maxing/etc).  I have barely even scratched the surface of PvP, but from what I've seen Cyrodiil looks incredible.  Picture a massive zone that is a microcosm of the game world.  Tons of NPCs giving quests, mission boards of varying types, massive skirmishes,  castle sieges.... Very objective based, not just mindless zerg deathmatch (though that does occur).  You can, in theory, adventure and PVE in the PVP zone and never encounter a single enemy faction player.  First impressions - this area looks like a massive hit, implemented extremely well (what Ashran COULD/SHOULD have been, in WoW).The combat gameplay is excellent.  There are no turns, no global cool down per say.  Abilities use Stamina or Magicka, most enemy attacks are telegraphed and therefore require blocking/interrupting/dodging.  There is a massive amount of character specialization, in that essentially any of the 4 classes (Dragonknight, Templar, Nightblade, Sorceror) can pick and choose any of the available weapons/armours and thus unlock that skill chain.  This amazingly deep system allows you to pick and choose which individual ability to put on your ability bar, allowing for some really cool combinations.  I do have a gripe that you cannot save ""loadouts"", and have to go through a clunky process of dragging abilities on and off to fit your particular need at the given time.  Skills and Trees level up upon receiving experience, and from being present on your ability bar during exp receival.  All in all, this system is not GROUND-BREAKING per say, but quite refreshing from the standard MMO fare.Graphics and sound are just incredible.  Period.   If you have the system for it, crank up the draw distance and detail, and just marvel at how beautiful this game looks.  I find myself periodically forgetting whatever quest or objective I have, and just wandering the lands of Tamriel simply because of the incredible ambient sound and amazing attention to detail the landscape shows.  Seriously, if you like a pretty open world environment - this is it.  I question how well the game is optimized, however it still runs well enough that I have no real complaints.  Towns are massive, and I frequently find whenver I need to go to town for various tasks, hours go by without notice.Crafting in the game is fairly simple, requiring you to obtain raw materials which you then refine at a crafting station and then use those for the creation process.  Deconstructing items that belong to that specific profession is crucial to leveling up your crafting skill, as well as obtaining materials used for certain item traits and characteristics, including improvement.  You also must research traits, in order to unlock the ability to craft an item with that particular attribute.  This requires you finding a weapon/armour piece that belongs to that same family, and then spending a set amount of time (from a few hours all the way up to 32 days, depending how many traits in that family you have already unlocked) which then destroys the item in the process, but unlocks the trait for eternity.Crafting is actually quite useful for providing upgrades for you, your alts, and your friends.  Also a decent income generator.  Loot is generally pretty random in the game, and if you have luck like mine, you will frequently find that you do not actually find loot for your specific character, but for everyone else, since loot is NOT personalized or tailored to your class/spec.  The upside to this, however, unlike almost every other damned MMO out there, is that almost everything you find, is NOT BIND ON PICKUP!  Incredible, a MMO-ish game that ACTUALLY allows you to trade!  WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?Now, before you think this is incredible....the economy part of the game is.... different.  There is no central auction house.  No, in ESO, if you wish to buy/sell to other players you must join guilds.  You are allowed 5 guilds of which to simultaneously be a member of.  Each guild has a max roster of 500 players.  Joining a guild allows you access to a Guild Store, essentially giving you the ability to hawk your items to those 500 players, and browse their respective wares as well.  If you're really lucky, you join a guild that actually has a world store front, which is obtained through a bidding process vs other guilds.  Essentially, this allows players to visit a Trader NPC, located some where in the game world, who then lists your Guild Store auctions not only to your respective guild, but to any player who happens to wander by.  Obviously, the more centralized/busy Trader locations are very highly sought after, thus the amount required to succesfully bid (which lasts a week, I believe) is quite high.  It is an interesting and unique take on a MMO economy, one that many people are not fans of.  ZOS, from what I understand, did not want a system in place that would allow anyone with enough money to simply hit the auction house and kit out their character with little to no effort.  Understandable, but I also feel this was a rather thinly veiled attempt at combating gold farming, and 3rd party sites.  Probably quite effective.All in all, if you're looking for a very rich and deep single player experience that will have you yearning to go back to Skyrim, or for the next Elder Scrolls installment, I would definitely recommend ESO.  The MMO aspect of it is.... thin, but still there.  The story line is well thought out and well written, the voice acting, sound, and graphics are all top notches with a few blips here and there.  Combat is never stale, and certainly not something you can sleep through like other MMOs.With regular balance updates and hotfixes being released, I can only hope there is more great stuff to come... like... Player housing?  One can hope.Solid 8.5/10"
Positive,it's a solid mmoi would love to get into it but the boys werent too keen on this one
Positive,"Great game, I'd advice all to try it if you're in for MMOs.Also works well with Steam Proton on Linux!"
Positive,This is one of the games ever made
Positive,Closing in on 9000 hours of play. I seriously am not able to explain how much I have loved this mmorpg and I have been playing them for 24 years.
Positive,"I was hesitant to start ESO due to the MMO aspect, but after about 4 hours of playing, I'm really having fun. Simply put: if you enjoy the Elder Scrolls series, you'll have no problem enjoying ESO."
Positive,"This game is certainly not for everyone as MMORPG games tend to be. For those that do enjoy this style of game however and have enough time to sink into it this game is amazing. The game is above average in just about every aspect, however, I would not say it excels at anything specifically.The main downside is the large time investment required to get to the good stuff but if you stick with it the game is very rewarding."
Positive,"The game started out rough. I bought it when it first hit the market and was virtually unplayable.NOW however, it really carries the spirit of Elder Scrolls in regards to exploration and lore. Does it hold a candle to Skyrim when it comes to combat and physics? No. Not at all. But, atleast in my opinion, this game is worth the asking price and will keep you busy for hours and hours. If you like ES lore, you will eat this title up!"
Positive,"I play very intermittently, however I don't stop due it not enjoying the game -  I stop for World of Warcraft being sort of my ""primary"" game. This game is excellent for me to play when World of Warcraft runs dry. I always find something to do, the superior PvP, getting all the quests done, dungeons like I have never seen before and an enjoyable, faster paced playstyle.If you current play a different MMORPG and need a break, I highly recommend ESO for that break"
Positive,"600+ hours in and I still haven't come close to finishing the available PvE content. I've played TES games since Morrowind GOTY first came out and I was initially skeptical of the idea of an online Tamriel. But ESO has everything I love about sandbox games: tonnes of quests, visually & mechanically different zones, environmental storytelling, all kinds of possibilities for creative & viable builds (if you're not a min-maxer), interesting NPCs, and a lot to do as a sneaky thief-type. And I can play with my DS4 controller on PC, so bonus. It feels like an Elder Scrolls game to me, even though reviews at launch said otherwise. This game also got me to try PvP for the first time. I spend 90% of my time in solo PvE - questing, harvesting, trying to climb cliffs - but playing PvP in a large group, raining seige weapons and support spells, is lots of fun and lets me feel useful without constantly dying to 1v1 players. ESO isn't a perfect game, by any stretch. Every major update (every 2-3 months) re-unbalances the game, such that a lot of build advice from six months ago just doesn't work anymore. Finding those last few collectibles without addons is a pain. Zone chat ranges from positive to politics-related trolling, but the ""Ignore"" feature makes that easy to deal with; choice of guilds helps too.(Side note: The recent One Tamriel update has made group content a lot simpler: cross-faction PvE means there are more people in the former ""silver"" and ""gold"" zones, I no longer out-level content by doing ~too many~ quests, and the battle levelling means that I can group my lvl 50 main with a lvl 20 guildie and *play* instead of steamroll all their enemies for them.)tl;dr: 8/10 After fifteen years refusing to play any game wtih a subscription fee, I now have an ESO+ sub."
Positive,"Vet here, played for some years now on console. Moved to PC a few weeks ago, and starting my journey a fresh. Excited to see what new characters i can come up with. The game is absolutely amazing, endless things to do, literally never got through all the quests entirely yet. Hours upon hours of content. I play solo mostly so everything in the game is accessible for solo players as well as group players. The stories and law are amazing and really draw you in, one of my fave parts about the game is the stories. My only negative thing i can say about the game is, no cross platform means you cannot carry your items, characters, or mounts to another platform. I had so much stuff on my console account and could not transfer it over. My hope is that in the future we can either get a refund for those items or we can somehow purchase account transfers for older characters. Literally thats the only negative i have to say. I absolutely love the game, would love to see the new deadric princes hairstyle in the store sometime to aquire."
Positive,"To become playable the game requires a lot of 'quality of life' changes to be made in the interface, controls, and gameplay settings. I do not understand why the default settings are the way they are, but I wouldn't recommend the game without fixing them first.1 Example: dodge-rolling is an essential combat mechanic; it lets you quickly avoid ground attacks, and can make incoming projectiles miss you. By default the inputs for dodge-rolling are setup so that you have to double-tap a movement direction to action the dodge. This doesn't sound bad in theory, but to be able to detect if an input is a single or double-tap there has to be a short delay where the game determines if you want to run or roll. That means in combat your character will stutter for a moment before rolling as you have to make an input with a fixed-duration delay, on top of the already existing latency (as it's an online game) and this feels terrible. To make it more responsive you have to disable this completely and bind rolling to another form of input (a different key/button). Why is this so wrong by default?2 Example: Perhaps in pursuit of immersion the developers decide by default your health bar and abilities should not display any information. The health, mana, and stamina bars are just vague lines that go up or down. How much are they changing? You don't know, unless you enable them to display values (numbers or percentages) in the settings. Similarly you will experience abilities that cause buffs and debuffs, but for some reason by default you're not allowed to see what is active on your character or on your enemy (unless you can tell by the particle effects on the model). You have to enable buff visibility and buff duration timers in the settings (useful to know how long effects actually last). This 'hidden information' also even applies to damage numbers. It's not for everyone, sure, but for myself and others I've spoken to enabling outgoing and incoming damage numbers completely changed the game feel. Your actions no longer feel weightless and unresponsive if you can actually see the numbers appearing to show how much damage you're doing. It seems like essential feedback to know when your attack hits, crits, misses, gets absorbed by shields, or reduced by armour buffs/blocking. Why is this so wrong by default?The actual gameplay is pretty good though.It has a real-time action combat system with lots of fun abilities and weapons. There's story stuff, quests with voiced dialogue and non-repetitive objectives. The quests are interesting in their own right, but most of the quest chains, and some of the one-offs actually reward you with desirable cosmetics, and skill points; which lets you unlock spells and passive effects.The crafting systems are actually useful for making gear, upgrading your gear, and making money. Gathering is fun too. Cut some logs, mine some ores, pick some plants, catch fish, pick up rocks, dig through rocks, etc.The dungeons and PvE content is also infinitely relevant due level scaling always being applied everywhere. You can go anywhere at any time and it's always going to be worthwhile as you can gain experience and skill points.You can even do PvP if you want something to raise your blood pressure a little higher. PvP consists of standard MMO things like duelling and battlegrounds, but also has an entire sub-game with the 3-faction warfare on Cyrodiil which focuses on big group battles and siege tactics to gain territory.There's also a lot I'm not mentioning, like the very in-depth player housing system, guilds, trials (or 'raids') and a bunch of other stuff I can't think of, but still. It's worth buying whether its on sale or not as it's forever free to play and has really improved over the years since its release.The ""ESO Plus"" membership isn't essential at all, but it is a big quality of life improvement if you like to loot every crate and barrel you see, or enjoy gathering raw materials and doing crafting as ESO Plus gives you unlimited inventory storage for crafting materials. Without the Crafting Bag you will run out of inventory space constantly and have to micromanage your items 24/7. It also comes with other features like 10% bonus to gained exp and gold, as well as unlocking all of the DLC zones for as long as the membership is active. I think it's very frustrating to play without ESO Plus, but I've always played subscription-based MMOs so I don't find it too weird to be paying monthly to support the game and get a few perks. None of the benefits of investing money result in unfair or Pay-2-Win advantages, it's all just cosmetics and convenience. Overall I'd recommend the game, as I've said: The only negatives are the default settings making it feel bad and confusing until you change them (and improve them with AddOns). Once it's correctly set-up in a way that feels good for you it becomes a very immersive MMO with a lot of focus on exploration, experimentation, and playing how YOU choose to (a feature that's essential with the tag of ""RPG"" that many other games have forgotten). It has something for everyone, I believe, and it's definitely worth the price."
Positive,Storage is the only problem I have with this game ;v
Positive,Enjoying this game so much!  Lots of things to do.  You can go questing or do activities with your friends.  The community is very helpful for new players like me.  Everyone helps everybody.
Positive,A bit old UI and graphics but well fleshed out.  Good group play as well as solo availability.
Positive,"Surprisingly good for single player questing, not just fetch quests, well written."
Positive,"This game was honestly horrible at launch, but as a fan of MMOs and Elder Scrolls games I can tell you that as of 2017, this game is one of the best out there, it really gives you the 'Adventurer' and 'Hero' feel old MMOs used to give you.Honestly, give it a try if you're a fan of TES or MMOs in general, you won't be disappointed."
Positive,"Despite a rocky launch, this game has shaped up into one of the greatest MMOs ever created.Crafters, raiders, PvPers, anyone with a love of the genre should experience this game!Buy it once, play it forever. It's worth it."
Positive,"I am still a newbie in this game, As per me this game is still a good game to play in 2021. Good story, Fun, Multiplayer and many thing to do which makes this game so good. Trust me if you are really new to MMO / MMORPGs then i recommend to start with this game, don't go with free MMO / MMORPGs they are all PAY 2 WIN and you will have mixed experience, go ahead with this game and enjoy."
Positive,"1. Recommended Purchase/to Play2. Recommended to Purchase on Sale/to Play3. Not Recommended to Purchase/to PlayPros & Unique Feautures    High Quality Graphics & Details (Realistic)    Great Storylines/Story Rich, quite Interactive.    Regular Updates On New Content     Versatile Class Builds    Variety of activities and ways to level up    Open-World PvP    Supports Add-ons    Other Aspects Of Elder Scrolls ImmersedCons & Missing Features    Quantity of Bugs (Not Always Impactful)    Unfixed Bugs    Overwhelming At Start    Proper Gameplay Requires Subscription    Pricey In-Game StoreLet me start with telling that The Elder Scrolls Online has become one of my favourites MMO-games. Over the course of the time i have played quite a few MMO's and TESO is quite a number 1 for the moment. Despite it not being perfect in terms of bugs and bugs that will remain unfixed, it needn't be perfect for all that i can offer. There is a rich atmosphere, great in detail and high quality graphics. Along the lines of that you have the capability to customise your character in a lot of ways. The world of Tamriel is massive, this i mean literally. Even after a years of playing, you wont be thorough with the content it overs. Various Storylines with also a continuation  with the regular updates on new content. A lot of side-stories and side quests. Group-events, dungeons and delves. Dungeons can be done in various difficulty modes and with time new Dungeons arrive. Despite choosing a class, your character can become anything, this because of the high versatility with the way you build up a character. You can for example take the Nightblade class, mainly reffered as assassin, but despite that it can be a healer or tank even. There are lots of different types of sets with different passives and actives you can craft your own build and character to your liking. Due to builds being so versatile and not a linear line has been drawn to this, same on questing and storylines that can be followed in any order. It can be quite overwhelming as a starting player. However hold on and let it all sink in, take it slowly and you will pave your path soon. The PvP is another great aspect of the game. While it has an arena-type of PvP mode, it also has an open world PvP where the battle is between all players in the current server of a faction. At character creation you choose one of the 3 factions for your character. The open-world PvP is like a medieval castle siege and you have to work with each other to capture the castles and conquer the lands in the name of your faction. In TESO you can be part of up to 5 guilds. This means you do not need to be in one singular guild and guilds can specify themselves into what their focus lies on. You can find RP guilds, PvP guilds, PvE guilds, Trade guilds, Social guilds and mixed guilds ofcourse in the game. To play the game properly you will need to have Subscription, this is mainly due the craftingbag and double bankspace. While you adventure there are a lot of resourcenodes that you can harvest, this is essential in crafting or trading. The craftbag soaks up all your craftingingredients into a specialized bag for it. If you are free-to-play however all the ingredients stockpile your inventory, then you have to decide to either discard them or not collect them. Which is a waste. Also in-game items such as cosmetics and/or account upgrades, collectibles tend to be pricey in the game, a cosmetic mount for example could cost £15. All with all it is a great game, loads of content, group acitivities and things you expect from an MMO. There is a lot more to mention about the game, but i tried to cover the essentials. I just hope someday my friends will play this game with me, cause with most games this game too is more fun with friends.© Siviria Ashariel 2019"
Positive,Just amazing. No words to describe this amazing MMO.The best RPG / MMO / whatever you call it... Only 1 bad point:-more than 100GB which is normal since it is a huge game :D-expensive dlcsReview: 9/10
Positive,"An awesome MMO. Things and points I like most on the game:- This game is so beautiful it has really good graphics.- It makes fun.- No Pay2Win.- It haves a stealing system, you can steal items. My mind: Currently I Have 31 hours, I spend to this game. And i still love it!  Now an example: I have played Shaiya, compared to ESO , it is much better. I paid the full price , and I don't regret it.  If you like MMO's, then get this game! Every grammar mistake is a present for your next birthday you fags  This here is my  first Review."
Positive,"When I was younger and this game came out, I was skeptical about an Elder Scrolls game being multiplayer, and didn't want to try it out and thought I wouldn't like it. Well, I am now eating my words because this is definitely my favorite MMO of all time. This game still has the feeling of freedom that the Elder Scrolls games have, and the game doesn't contradict the previous established lore. Also, the community for ESO is one of the most wholesome, nice, and friendly communities for an MMO I have ever seen. I have never ran into a toxic player in my 400 hours of playing so far. This game has something for everybody, wheither it be questing for storylines, PVP, fashion, housing, or even money making with a super unique economy system! If you have been on the fence about ESO ever since it came out like me, I think you should give this game a try! I am a HUGE Morrowind fan, and this game did the lore and everything perfect for Morrowind. Seriously, check this game out!"
Positive,"-=GAMEPLAY=-The leveling system is the best system I've come across.  At first it seems awkward but it opens up so much in terms of gameplay.  Essentially a lvl 1 char is as strong as a level 50 character.  After level 50 you earn champion points at which point you actually start to get stronger, similar to Diablo 3 paragon points if you're familiar with that.  Your gear determines how powerful you are but it's directly based on your level.  I.E. lvl 10 char with lvl 10 gear is stronger than a lvl 50 char with lvl 10 gear.  Because you lose stats for each level you are over your gear.  You do gain more skill points and open up more character build possibilities with level progression but it's not so much that it completely offsets the balance of the game.What this all means is that you can play with any of your friends no matter what level they are in any zone you want for PVE content.  The alliance you choose only matters if you PVP.  This is genius and all MMOs should implement something similar.  Nothing worse than not being able to play with your friends because they outleveled you.-=PVP=-Castle Sieges are exciting and the skirmishes in Cyrodil are a blast.  Also due to the level and stat system mentioned above it is the most fair PVP system in an MMO that I have ever seen.  I personally play the under level 50 campaign and it's still pretty active with Guilds focused on PVP gameplay.  You do run into tryhards on occasion that have OP builds, don't sweat it just come back with a bigger army.-=CONTENT=-The main campaign is voice acted and setup for solo play.  Side quests can be done with a friend but are generally all setup for solo players.  Group content comes in with World Bosses, 4 person dungeons, and 12 person trials.  There is alot of content that you can pour alot of hours into.-=GRAPHICS=-This is extremely subjective but I find the graphics to be beautifully done.  The game gets the atmosphere right for something in the Elder Scrolls Universe.  The world, the characters, the gear all fits perfectly.  Thankfully there aren't really any costumes in game that look ridiculous like so many other MMOs on the market.Side Note - If you are a crafter or you just like looting everything, make sure you get a subscription,  the craft bag is amazing.  Also opens up all the DLC while it's active which is nice."
Positive,Good game! I love THE ELDER SCROLLS
Positive,unbelievably good story line. lots of singles content. very good mixture of dungeon types
Positive,"If you're looking for engaging gameplay, story and epic music while trying to beat down demons and dragons with a shit ton of health, and if you're looking for friends, this game will do you good."
Positive,"This is an older game (2014), and still easily competes with games 2018+.  The worst thing about this game is the same problems with other games this day and age, all the micro transactions.  One could easily have a great time without the micro transactions but overall I would rate 8/10."
Positive,"This game went from being god awful to being shockingly good.The Crime and Justice system is the first of its kind I've seen in an MMO. The crafting system is something I think all MMO's could learn from.For those expecting Skyrim with friends... Its not that. As a matter of fact I would say that, besides the setting, this game has more in common with Fable than Elder Scrolls. There's even a quest which features the voice actor of the Fable Guildmaster that has a jab at how he was handled in Fable. Thar archery system in this is handled nearly identically to the bows in Fable as well.On its own its a decent MMO with an incredible player driven PVP battlefield. Players can erect siege engines, destroy towers and buildings. I havent spent enough time in the PVP yet but what I did spend was mindblowing. We tried to take over a farm from the aldmeri dominion with a small strike force and one catapult. We nearly succeeded too, but the enemy got reinforced and we had to pull out. Its a weird cross between planetside and a typical MMO in the PVP.So far, beyond a couple outliers, the fetch quests have been well explained and voiced, making it feel like I'm not just grabbing 8 macguffins for my next level. The combat is very active and I have found I cannot dual screen like I can in Quickbar based MMOs. I need to be focused in combat or else I will die, which is a refreshing change. The quick travel in this is just explained by ""MAGIC"" and you can either use a wayshrine to travel for free or use a small amount of gold if you cant reach a shrine safely. I find the teleport much nicer than watching my character go all across the terrain like in other MMOs.With the advent of Buy to Play instead of a subscription I imagined they would end up with a SWTOR like second and third class citizen model, where XP is reduced for non subs and you cant do things like dye your armor. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. THERE IS NO SECOND CLASS CITIZENSHIP MODEL IN THIS GAME. If you buy it, you own all of it. No Subscriber only areas, no VIP lounges, just the whole ham MMO. Subscribers will have access to any DLC that drops (That nonsubs can buy), but in my opinion that is absolutely fair. So far, I am extremely impressed with this turnaround and hope many of you will play this with me."
Positive,"This game is fun but you really need to put the hours in to get anywhere, i play with a couple of friends and it's hard to progress as a unit and because we don't have unlimited time to play this it feels like it would take years to ''complete'', either way it's a fun game and worth a buy if it's on sale"
Positive,"I now have over 3000 hours on this game and I still haven't explored it all. It has the three things I love most in an RPG.  Big open world, character creation, and most important, open choice. That is, you have a choice when it comes to completing a quest or not. Some games will place you back at the beginning of a quest if you die or want to walk away. They splay QUEST INCOMPLETE across the screen and just plop you back (I'm looking at you Farcry). Elder Scrolls games let you decide to finish something or just walk away and do something else. I love that choice. It helps put the REAL in role play."
Positive,"One of the best MMORPG games i have ever played, its endless lotta customization and a very open mapi mean its Tamriel"
Positive,best 400 hours I've spent on a game. well worth it
Positive,75% of everyone's hours in the game are from downloading.

Positive,"For years I played several online RPGs, trying to find a good home but none ever hit the mark of being even ""passable"". They all had several flaws (either bad UI/UX or lack of controller support) or had cooldown based combat which was a snorefest after a while because there's barely any challenge. Also the questing system was always the same - either fetch or kill X minions. It's like World of Warcraft put a curse on these kind of games, they're all children of WOW but basically worse in every single thing since most of them are free-to-play, so they had to heavily monetize it.ESO, in a way, fixed all if not most flaws of all those games: combat is action based, almost no cooldowns, so it's always a challenge to play. What I feel is most important is that all content scales to your level, so you can basically do anything, anywhere. You can even run a stealth Orc or a Khajit tank and the game won't punish you. Content scaling also means that you can group with any friends anywhere and do any content, without level restrictions. Also, quests are generally very varied and they all have some interesting and diverse story attached to them. While writing isn't the strongest point of this game, it's good enough.I sincerely feel that there's no other online RPG game that come even close to ESO. Every single mechanic is well designed and decently balanced (PVP is out of the discussion here). Also, the detail of the world, graphics, and lighting are all extremely good, specially the dungeons. Game also features partial Controller support which is very welcomed for this kind of game. Cosmetics are account wide, so once you buy something, you buy it for life. There's housing and it's pretty good.The only caveat of the game I'd say, is the pricing, which (besides the base game) is quite high for mostly everything - I also recommend to never purchase loot boxes because they don't even have a pity timer. But you don't need any of that to get 70% of the game's content (which is basically 100% of the content of most other online RPGs) and events are pretty generous as well.Edit: It seems that ZOS fired their previous monetization strategist (a good decision) and changed the whole princing issue. While pricing is still high and crates are terrible, there are as of now TWO ways to earn premium currency for free, which is a really fair move for everyone. First, they introduced Ouroboros crates which are basically free gems. And second, they allow to trade in-game Gold for Crowns, which effectively makes most if not all content in the game unlockable by playing it. It's great news, honestly.Overall, if you wanted to play in an immersive world full of people and things to do, you can't go wrong with this game. Nothing comes close to it in terms of refinement / engagement. I strongly recommend it for casual playing too, since the game doesn't force you to play every day - it's fine to leave it for some months and then return."
Positive,"Best game out there so far.  Some other games have jumped the shark or have gone the route of making playing seem like a part time job just to even feel like you're gaining ground.  The story telling even in the side quests have you intrigued and involved. Truly tries to bring back RPG in MMORPG instead of leaning more toward MMOPvP.  Lots of beautiful lands, content for a very long time even in the base game version.  Refugees from other games (like myself) will be overwhelmed for a little bit when starting as the freedom to explore anywhere is a new feeling. No more outleveling where you are at. No game on rails pointing you to this or that or lose out."
Positive,"other than continuously running into paywalls and having like a 30 item list of daily chores i feel obligated to do or else i feel i fall behind, the incredibly laggy servers, the pay to win whenever a new set or mythic or skill group is released, this game is pretty fun. all this aside, i do genuinely enjoy this game as my hours played can tell, so long as it doesnt die i will sink another 3500 hours in it."
Positive,"MMORPG With HUGE World And Still Expanding...... The Action, The Skill Leveling, Multiple Difficulties, PuzzlesOne Negative..... AS YET PC Players Can Not Play With PS4, XBox, Etc Players :-( So I (PC) can't join in game with other family (PS4) as yet...."
Positive,This game must have days of recorded dialogue. The amount of elder scrolls lore in this game is unmatched. As you spend hundreds of hours exploring and learning about the world you will gain an appreciation for the dry wit in the writing and cultural the depth between nations.
Positive,If you've played wow for the last decade this will feel like what you've been searching for to fill the empty void in your soul that blizzard created when the casted stop trying on themselves. Do your self a favor and play you'll have a blast and it will be new :)
Positive,"After a very shaky start, this game has been transfigured almost beyond measure with some of the biggest patches I have ever seen in a game. It's now pretty much the perfect MMO - great character customisation, a huge mature world, masses of quests and dungeons, and the most amazing large-scale PvP to date.Yes, you do have to pay a one-off fee, but there's no monthly subscription required, and you aren't continually being nagged to purchase stuff to play-to-win unlike some free MMOs. It's also Mac-compatible, and unlike competitors like Guild Wars 2 it's true native code, not via an emulator, so it runs great on a MacBook. So if you're a Mac owner it's really a no-brainer choice. Actually on any system it's a no-brainer choice. Best MMO on the market today, hands down."
Positive,A solid MMORPG from an iconic franchise; With tons of content and a large player base.
Positive,The best MMO RPG game!!!
Positive,"after spending few hours in a game and learning basics, i am finally ready for endgame content."
Positive,It's not WoW.
Positive,"I  have many hours into this game, I originally purchased it when it launched and recently upgraded to the Steam version, and I have a character on the XBox.  The game is easy to get into, lore heavy for anyone who loves to read, very easy to solo, plus tons of multiplayer events, dungeons, raids, and pvp to partake in, a great crafting system, and the paid subscription is well worth it."
Positive,"As someone who got into the franchise because of Skyrim, I really like this game. I don't actively play with anyone else, so it's more of a really big single player game for me. I'm currently 60 hr in and not even close to finishing the 3rd area of what looks like a crapton of areas. Definitely worth the $10 I paid for the game."
Positive,"I find fantasy type games a bit hit and miss for me, most of them miss in all honesty. But I do like the Elder Scrolls universe and Oblivion and Skyrim were two games I did really enjoy. I have noticed this game many times and wondered if it would be worth a try but never got around to it, at least not until now. At this stage I am still very much a noob and I don't really have too much of a clue what I am doing but it is already clear that this game is brilliant, if you like this kind of thing. If you like the Elder Scrolls thing then I would say you will like this as it feels familiar but also different from the SP games. There is definitely a lot to learn and it does seem overwhelming at first but I wouldn't worry about that, I certainly didn't and just jumped in and so far I have really enjoyed this game. The world is interesting and makes me want to explore further and complete more quests and it appears this game world is really massive, so there's plenty to explore. The world looks great and has some cool inventive creatures and fauna designs and although the graphics aren't amazing by any means, they do the job nicely as well as the sounds being decent too.Of course they certainly are trying to sell you all manner of in game purchases and DLC content etc but I have literally ignored it (I don't even know what they are selling yet) and it hasn't left me feeling like I am hindered by not opening my wallet. If you put hundreds of hours into the game you may well want to buy stuff but it doesn't seem like casual players would feel they have to and there is every chance I will never hand over more cash than the purchase price. So is this game worth it? Yeah, absolutely"
Positive,"So Elder Scrolls Online, in my opinion, is a great game. ive been playing for a few years now and i havent lost interest. I know this game got a lot of guff over its quality. so many people said it was trash. to explain a bit, Bethesda is great at making single player games. Its what they do. when it comes to MMO theyre just not in their element. ESO can be very enjoyable. it just pales in comparrison to other games in the Elder Scrolls universe. if you played one before ESO (like Skyrim) then you might not enjoy it as much. The issue was people had a mindset of what to expect from previous games and got something completely different. ESO is its own game in its own right. That being said, the game has alot to offer. they dont have leveling zones so you can play with any friend you want and the creatures wont be to overly powerful. The item crafting mechanics are my personal favorite. I thoroughly enjoy being able to create armor and weapons that can surpass set items that you find throughout your journey. The sense of accomlishment i recieve from this is what  aim for. Moving on to other matters , the base game is quite extensive in content to begin with. you wil spend hours just trying to complete the main story let alone the other side missions and story archs. And to add on to that  you can purchase DLCs to change and/or prolong your experience. the only downside i can find to it is that if you dont own any premium content you will be taunted by the feature they bring. you have the ability to find materials or see style motifs that you would absolutely want to have but are restricted from actually having them. A great example would be that you are able to find, mine, collect, and refine material to make jewlery but you cant use the crafting station that actually makes the jewlery unless you have the Summerset Expansion. Other than that i have yet to have a bad experience in the game.Baseline is, I would recommend Elder Scrolls Online. It has so much to offer and so much more still in coming updates."
Positive,"I really like Elder Scrolls Online, for a long time it was kind of an on and off game for me. It took me over two years to reach level 50, partially because the amount of other people running around with level 690 and higher made it seem like I was perpetually behind.However, once my friends decided to start playing, that's when things took, it's a lot of fun to do dungeons, (four person content), with friends and just run around questing with friends. I am now almost level 300.No longer did I have to measure myself against other random players instead I was able to focus on having fun.Besides dungeons and quests there is World Bosses, several to each zone, some have over 6 million health, and when the average player has between 20-40k health only, those World Bosses are very challenging, sometimes even for large groups.Spend long enough at it though, and you might even manage to solo one. :) Only took me two years to manage that.Another aspect of PvE is trials, (12 person group content) there are several in the game and are some of the most challenging content, a single mistake during combant can lead to the whole group wiping out and having to restart the battle. PvP is not quite my cup of tea but the few times I've tried it have nearly led to a heart attack, way to intense. But, that may just be my overall inexperience with the kind of fast thinking mechanics heavy pvp combat in this game.The part of PvP I do enjoy is dueling, you only have to focus on one opponent so it requires a lot less stress, but also a lot less reward.So my advice is give this game a try, you may find beginning difficult, the mechanics confusing, or be fustrated with lack of leveling, but once you stop worrying so much about grinding to the next level and just focus on having fun then it becomes a truly enjoyable game."
Positive,Not a Typical MMO but still very fun to play. It king of plays like a single player game for the most part until you get to group  events.
Positive,"Very good game, good story and playstyle. Have some bugs, but bugs get patches for short time. This game is playable allone, just for story, or you have fun with friends in dungeons and story too. Is a good rpg is fun, is not for all players, but for me is best rpg for fun with friends and roleplay :) Buy in sale is recomendet :) Year 2020 and i still enjoy this game and new adventures from new well made it DLCs allone or with friends :) Edit 2021 - i still enjoy story and players in this game and i always use this game for relax after hard days :) Is year 2022 new DLC come High Isle come and i enjoy this beautiful game :) Well with year 2023 come new dlc and also some updates what makes game even more enjoyable still love this game!"
Positive,"Let this be clear: do not expect this game to be a regular Elder Scrolls, for it psychically cannot have the same amount of freedom/mechanics as a solo game. You should expect limited interactions to NPC and other tools from the mere multiplayer aspect.Thus if you have the POV of a mmorpg player with a deep interest of lore, this game is one of the best out there, but if you sit down and expect it to be as serious or random as Skyrim or Oblivion, you'll get a bit disappointed.Being open-minded about it pays off imo, though, cause regardless of this, it's really great fun once you remove those expectations. The community is the friendliest and most respectful I've seen in years, the game mechanics are very well put-together, the plots and quests are nice and can explain lore untouched in other Eldder Scrolls games.A personal dislike I found in the gameplay is in the big skill set with a really short skillbar, however this is mainly subjective because I've heard/seen many other people praising it. You can explore your potential with infinite possibilities of character build basically with a chance to always re-build your hero without effort, so you don't have to worry if you mess up the first time."
Positive,One of the best MMO just don't buy it from steam
Positive,very nice mmo rpg game . epic ..
Positive,"After they remove the subsription I decided to buy this game, after some hours put into this game I would say that this is actually not a bad game, it just need some time. I recommend this game, but don't buy it with the full price, wait until it has a discount.*Edit* PVP to me is unplayable........much lag, and it's not only happening to me, loads of other people have lag problem both in PVE and PVP. Hope they fix it because I'm really enjoying this game.*PS* DON'T EVER, EVER, AND I MEAN EVER! VALIDATE STEAM CACHE.....YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."
Positive,"I nominated this game for the ""Haunts my Dreams"" award for one reason. I stopped playing this game months ago since it was taking too much of my time, basically I started to getting addict to ESO world. But last night I dreamed that I was playing it, I remember playing as my character Khajjit NIghtblade clearing dungeons. I promise I will be back to Tamriel!!11/23/2018Still playing this masterpiece ♥"
Positive,"It's definitely a good MMO. The combat was just too basic, and the combat is extremely important to me in a MMO. I did not dive deep into the game, so I cannot rate the end game. The start felt nice, but the combat drove me away. Its worth your time and money. Watch videos on it before you jump in bud."
Positive,It's a good game to play solo or will be more better to play with your friends chill and relieve daily stress
Positive,sucks lifetime from you
Positive,"Updated 11/27/2022.This game has a lot of pros and cons, so I'm going to give you a list of the primary ones for ease of reading material. Note: This review only covers PvE aspects.      * WARNING TO PS4 PLAYERS: Sony Playstation requires a Playstation Plus membership in order to be able to play this game on the PS4.Community:Pros:      * Some guilds are actually really, really helpful. Also, there are tons of guilds out there.     * Since the introduction of a ""no real-life politics"" policy (included in their Behavior Agreement you MUST agree to in order to play), Zone Chat has gotten a lot less ""toxic"". Do not be afraid to remind people that politics is a banned topic of conversation.Cons:     * Some days people are complete jerks (chest stealers, node stealers, people with small junks in their pants that think they have to get to the boss before everyone else...) Other days they're actually helpful. You'll find that in any game, no matter the platform.     * NEVER expect to find all of the available guilds via the guild search interface. The interface is AWFUL. Absolute garbage. I once spent three days searching for a guild that should have been showing up in there. I never found it because the interface is poorly designed. You can't search for a guild by name in there.Interfaces:Pros: Most are fantastic! If you hate the interface, the good news for PC players is that add-ons are aplenty and some of them alter the interface for you.Cons:     * The Guild Search tool doesn't show all guilds without ridiculous amounts of filters.     * Non-alphabetized things drive me NUTS! No, really. It makes it harder to find things.Crown Store:Pros: Some of the stuff in the Crown Store is pretty awesome. It's the only way to get some of the DLC. Buy Crowns in bulk when they go on sale! I cannot stress this enough.Cons: Crowns are pricey if you do not wait for a sale. Never buy crowns with in-game gold.  The exchange ratio is extremely biased in favor of the seller and getting much worse.In-Game Housing:Pros:     * In-game player housing! Hell yeah!     * Several empty plots of land where you can build your own house.     * Tons of recipes in-game for making things for your house.     * It can be really fun decorating and building.     * In certain zones you can get a free inn room and it's account-bound.Cons:      * You cannot claim more than one house with a single character (except for the house you get via quest in Northern Elsweyr). Use multiple characters (one for each free inn room).     * The house editing interface still needs a LOT of work.     * The ""free"" inn rooms are really small and don't fit a lot in there.     * In-game housing can cost you millions of in-game gold when the option to buy them in-game is available.     * If you use Crowns to buy housing, count on spending at least 4,000 crowns for an empty plot of land. Notable homes can get to 17,00 crowns (over $100 U.S).     * Those empty plots of land are nice, BUT you are still subject to the same max limit of items in the instance that you would be if there was a house there already. They don't give you a larger item count available for building your own.Mounts:Pros:     * Faster travel. Oh, and two-person mounts are finally out!     * Buffing up a mount's speed is not much trouble. Make certain you train something in your mount once a day (via a stablemaster), and it won't be too long before everything is maxed.     * The variety of available mounts is pretty massive.Cons: Most of the really good mounts are Crown Store purchases.Crafting:Pros: A hell of a lot of work was put into the crafting system for this game and, to be honest, it's their best feature. Honestly, it is. It's quite advanced and not so easy to simply spend gold on and just get top level crafting immediately like in a lot of games.Cons: Eight million gold for a recipe? Really? Psychotic much? Players claim it has to do with ""rarity"" or ""supply and demand,"" (excuses, both of them) but let's be honest here... PLAYERS set prices and very greedy PLAYERS will try to sell you recipes for ridiculous prices. The game designers do not set the prices a player wants to charge you for recipes.Graphics:Pros: This game has some very gorgeous graphics, and if you have the computer and graphics card to enjoy them you definitely will.Cons: The graphics are -so- good that this game is very, very graphics-heavy. So much so that older computers are going to struggle with simply loading the game (to the point of taking up to ~10 minutes or more just to load for really old computers) even with graphics settings on practically nil.Lore:Pros: Fans of the lore will not be disappointed! The game's story and lore keep nicely with previous lore and story arcs.Cons: To continue the ongoing story of ESO beyond the main areas you need the DLC/Expansion stuff. Also, there are some questionable story decisions...like how, if you choose a certain character to die in your intro story, that character is still alive in one of the DLC areas that takes place later in the timeline.DLC  / Expansions:Pros: Assassins' Guild (Dark Brotherhood)? Check! Thieves' Guild? Check! Both great DLC packs you should get. They are still my all-time favorites.Cons: See Memberships for Cons on DLC / Expansions.Mods:Pros: Hooray for modding! There are plenty of wonderful mods out there for this game, and guess what? They're FREE! That's right, they are FREE!     * As a side note, I recommend finding them via ESOUI.COM (not my website, promise!) and using Minion to manage them.Cons: When the game does a big update it will automatically turn your mods off because it considers them to be out-of-date. Even checking the box that says run out-of-date mods does not save them from this fate. You'll have to go in and re-check that box to use them until the Mod authors update their stuff. Be aware that sometimes updates can break mods, too, so they may not function properly until the Mod author does a fix. As a side note, modding is only available for the PC version. XBox and PlayStation do not have modding available.ESO Plus Memberships:Pros: You get access to all of the DLC for free, after one year of an expansion being out you get free access to it, you get some gold, you get some crowns, and you get a separate bag for crafting mats. For a full list see: https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/esoplusCons:     * If you end your membership you lose everything the membership offers.     * Ending a membership means you lose access to the free DLC and Expansions and must purchase it separately in order to play it any longer.     * Ending a membership means you lose the ability to add to the crafting bag. All of your stuff remains in the bag and you will have no problem removing items. You will no longer be able to put items into it, though.     * Ending a membership means you can't add things to your bank account until you bring your item count to below the non-membership item count.     * Ending a membership means your house items stay put but you can't add items into a house that go behind the non-membership limits.     * The free item you get each month is -usually- a tiny statue. It is not really a perk.OVERALL: Okay, so this game has gotten better since launch, and that was to be expected. Lots of pros and some cons, too There are too many to list here, really (blame the character limit).So out of everything, is the game worth it? Yes.Is ESO+ worth it? No one should tell you whether or not to get one. That decision should be strictly yours to make, based on facts alone, because it has to be worth it to YOU -- not to someone else.In the end, things change and games either grow or die. Right now this one is still growing and still worth the play time.Why are you reading this thing, anyway? GO ENJOY LIFE!"
Positive,Sweet Lord That Install.
Positive,300 hours in 2 weeks.. so many all nighters.. sucked my life away.... 11/10EDIT: 2 weeks later and I am now at 792 hours played... save me.. idk what to do.. 12/10
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is a massively multiplayer online role-playing video game developed by ZeniMax Online Studios. It was originally released on April 4, 2014, for Microsoft Windows and OS X.Excellent game with the same focus as all other known Elder Scrolls.Great atmosphere, great scenery, great story, quite engaging and curious.Everything we already know but... Online. The best :)"
Positive,"It's a pretty relaxing game. Like the other reviewers say, there are no level restrictions in any areas so you can pretty much go wherever you want and the enemies will just scale to you. This also allows a low-level player to group with higher level players and they will still be able to experience the same difficulty due to the scaling. Loot also scales. To some, this is a bad thing. It depends on the player. Quests are pretty fun, but sometimes they feel lazy and uninspired. Still, ESO offers a lot of content with the base game alone. I haven't really gotten the DLC yet as I'm only 18hrs in, but so far it's been fun questing. Combat is not as good as Skyrim's (as you would expect from an MMO) but it is better than most MMOs. There is a lot of freedom and diversity in the game, as well. Graphics are okay, I guess. The animations kind of annoy me though.Also, voice acting is top-notch.With all that said, I would recommend this to Elder Scrolls players and MMO players alike as it balances both pretty well. Not perfect, but it's good."
Positive,"Being a fan of the Elder Scroll franchise, and spending more time than I wished, I tamed dragons and built houses in Skyrim especially. Well I took the plunge and bought this while it was on the recent sale being unsure how well my laptop would run it, but it's great. Since this update it really does feel like the free roam world of the older games we all loved, so far I've had so much fun within it, crafting, foraging  and killing the creatures of Tamriel. To be honest a great game worth anyone's money who enjoyed the older games, are unsure or want to try something good in the world of subscription free MMORPG's."
Positive,"I hate to admit this is my favorite game, but this is really my happy place.  In the past 7 or 8 years the industry has tried its best and failed to make a better MMO than this.  Peak group RPG gaming.  10 years of content."
Positive,"One of the strengths of The Elder Scrolls Online is its immersive world. The game is set in the same universe as the popular single-player Elder Scrolls games, such as Skyrim and Oblivion. As such, the game features a rich and detailed world with a deep lore and history. Players can explore a vast and diverse landscape, from the snowy mountains of Skyrim to the lush forests of Valenwood.The gameplay of The Elder Scrolls Online is similar to other MMORPGs. Players create a character and embark on quests, level up, and engage in combat with both AI enemies and other players. The game also features crafting, where players can create their own gear and items.The combat in The Elder Scrolls Online is a mix of traditional MMORPG combat and action-based combat. Players can use a variety of weapons and abilities to defeat their enemies. The game also features a system where players can block, dodge, and interrupt enemy attacks, adding an extra layer of strategy to combat.The game's graphics and sound design are also impressive. The world is richly detailed, with a variety of environments and landscapes to explore. The game's music is also well-done, adding to the immersive experience.One potential downside of The Elder Scrolls Online is its subscription model. While the game can be played for free, players must pay a monthly subscription fee to access certain features and content. However, the game also offers a cash shop where players can purchase cosmetic items and convenience items.Overall, The Elder Scrolls Online is a solid MMORPG with a rich and immersive world, engaging gameplay, and impressive graphics and sound design. If you're a fan of the Elder Scrolls universe or MMORPGs in general, The Elder Scrolls Online is definitely worth checking out."
Positive,Played it a bit. its Alright.
Positive,"For a new player it is immensely confusing, the world is not very linear to begin with and I really had no idea what I was doing when I made my initial character. The tutorial and messages for new players as they play the game are lengthy, but not much time is given to read them. Since the world is ""do whatever you want and play"", it sucks for new people since there, of course, is a best and worst of what you can do in certain situations. But this game has improve my English so much and my listening skills too. I have so many new friends in this game from all over the world, it's awesome! we can share experiences and get to know each other from different countries."
Positive,"Story, gameplay, graphics and overall feel of the game are all just right for me. And the Elder Scrolls world is just amazing."
Positive,No one will read my review so I'll just say I'm gay
Positive,"A little different for a classical mmorpg, nothing about it is like WoW or LOTRO, but its definitely a good step in the opposite direction, I'm gonna say that it's a good amount like your other Elder Scrolls games but in an mmo setting"
Positive,"Elder scrolls online is a great game! I can see how people may not enjoy it as much as Skyrim or any other Elder Scrolls games, but it has to be one of the best MMOs I have ever played. Game feels good, touches that nostalgia factor and overall has a lot of great features. Fully voiced everything is amazing! All in all, I would definitely 100% recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the world of The Elder Scrolls."
Positive,"Remember how much fun you had playing Runescape back in 2007? Remember the thrill of completing a difficult quest, leveling up, and upgrading your armor, weapons and skills? Did you ever go back to try to play it again? It's not as fun. It's hard to get past the wonky music and the subpar graphics. The quests seem shallow, the jokes are clearly meant for younger people, and the combat system isn't exactly exciting. Altogether, it seems like a great concept, but one that didn't evolve along with you.Suddenly, ESO. All the fun aspects of Runescape without any of the Runescape.THE GOOD:- Combat difficulty is scaled to your level, so no need to sit and grind for hours in order to survive an early boss- There is an INSANE number of optional side quests. In the Northern Elsweyr region alone, there are something like 30 side quests to do, not including repeatable daily quests.- The game is extremely solo-friendly. If you're not the kind of person who wants to join a group for every little quest, then you'll be happy here. That said, there are certain areas where having a group makes it much easier to progress, but you'll find no shortage of no-strings-attached adventuring parties.- There are countless different unique armor sets, each with their own appearance and bonuses.- Each class, race and weapon has unique skills, allowing you to create a build that works well with your play style. Bonus points for allowing players to respec their skillpoints if they want to change something up.- The game is still supported, so new quests, regions and events are still being added (at the time of this review).THE BAD:- There are a lot of unspoken rules in the game, especially if you're a member of a group. If you break one of these rules, you may find yourself on the receiving end of a team kick, sometimes without knowing why. If you plan on playing with a group, do some research on what is expected of you.- Follow up to the previous point: For every unspoken rule you learn, there will be a boatload of people who don't know that rule (or don't care). Take it in stride, just block the people who piss you off (you'll probably never see them again anyway).- Tangentially related to the last point: You're probably going to see a lot of really messed up stuff in the zone chat. Not just swearing and creative insults, but full-on talk of sexual violence, racism, misogyny, etc. You're probably going to see some stuff that makes you angry, sad or upset. Chances are, you're going to see it every day that you're looking at the zone chat. Just block and report the person, and move on. It's not worth fighting over.- The in-game economy is bustling--though this is a good thing in general, you'll get a few bad eggs who will overcharge the hell out of unsuspecting people.- In general, you'll find that very few people communicate. While I don't see an issue with wanting to play the game in a solo aspect, some people won't even communicate while playing as a member of a group. It's just weird."
Positive,"Decent MMO. Fun. GREAT for RP-ing, since it's lore that I'm used to. Crowns are WAAAAY too expensive, also removed some key Elder Scrolls features that I think might be a dealbreaker for some.I play quite a bit of it, and I think it's quite fun. Bit restrictive, lots of expensive micro-transactions, but believe me, it isn't pay to win. Even for the PvP, it isn't pay to win. It's really just... pay to get there faster. But it doesn't take long to build a character, if you don't mind grinding, which is what MMOs are known for. The game doesn't hold your hand, which is what I like about it.Also, let me be clear. THIS. IS NOT. AN ELDER SCROLLS GAME. It's set in the Elder Scrolls' universe, but it is far from being an Elder Scrolls game. Great MMO! Terrible TES game. That's ok though. Personally, I enjoy that it isn't pay to win (I mean, thankfully. They already make you buy the game, and tbh having a subscription just makes your life hella easier, but I don't mind really, provides me with lots of fun.) and that the RP community is thriving. I appreciate that it's set in the TES universe, because it's lore that I know, and understand, and can really get into.Let's see, as of the time of my review, here are a few pros and cons, starting with the cons.-No Unarmed skill, which is highly underrated-NO CHILDREN. ??? There are legit NO children in Tamriel. Ever. The closest you get are the shortest bosmer xD-Crown store. Now, there are positives and negatives. First of all, there is a lot of... 'persuasive advertising'. They act like the crown store is the only way to get certain items. Luckily the crown store is mostly just cosmetic/aesthetic items. They make them all look super cool, but honestly if you just play the game and IGNORE the crown store, you end up getting cool stuff.-The limitations on inventory space. Now, I get the need to limit inventory space, HOWEVER... in past elder scrolls games it was based on weight and the strength of your character. They did away with all that, and now it's a starting amount of 60 slots for items (at least you can stack those items in one slot? >,>)-You can play as any race! Except Imperial... Yup, if you want to be an Imperial, you have to use crowns to buy the ""Imperial Race Upgrade."" which grants you the race, a white horse, and I think a few other silly things.-Pets are useless. Non-combat pets are a thing. Why? Because money.There is light in this story though...+Pretty engaging quests, if you like lore. They even have a pretty prevalent Maormer presence, even though you can't play as a Maormer.+Each zone is a decent enough sized, though the loading screens can get annoying from time to time if you travel quickly.+For an MMO, it's great. For an Elder Scrolls game... well... eh. But, that's not so bad, because fans of MMOs can enjoy it.TL;DR - Don't buy unless you like MMOs. This is not an Elder Scrolls game. Seriously. On the other hand, if you like MMOs and don't mind paying an initial price... dude! Get it! Also, there are less trolls since you have to pay to get in.There's my 2 cents."
Positive,"While I have only dabbled in various MMOs, ESO is my favourite. The skill system is unique and incredibly versatile! You can build your characters the way you want and remain viable, even if not optimized. Nearly all content solo-able, which is perfect for me. :) (I recommend looking up good add-ons for an enhanced experience.)"
Positive,i feel like real life is much worse than its alternatives
Positive,"Great solo story driven experience in the Elder Scrolls Universe. Combat is somewhat lacking, but the story and beautiful visuals make up the difference for me."
Positive,"After the 6 patches, this is IT! The ESO we all wanted is here. Come check out this awesome MMO!"
Positive,Ill waist my life in this game ... you should too... dooo etttttt!!
Positive,"Personally the lore, Zones and The strory line draw me to this gamebut PVP hmm dude i dont think so"
Positive,"Very good MMO and an Elder Scrolls game. Both for groups of friends and Solo players. Plenty of story even before all the DLC and no subscription fee to play after initial purchase which is a huge plus. There is a subscription, but it is in no way a requirement and you don't need it to play the full game, but it does give you 1500 crowns which is $15 worth of in game currency and you get access to all the DLC you don't already own."
Positive,"Been playing this with all chapters, the expansion and all DLCs. Wouldn't trust anybody reviewing this game with less than a few dozen hours. UPDATE 19/12/19: Five months later, I still play it everyday.PROS:- Runs well on Ryzen 5 2600, 16GB DDR4, GTX 780Ti, m.2 SSD- Richest TES experience yet.- Gameplay is fun (combat, crafting, exploring, dungeons, battlegrounds, and raids)- Story is well written, dialogue is not horrible (looking at you Oblivion)- You can be a part of 5 player guilds at once, so you'll always have people to play with- You can minimize UI elements and play almost all the content as though it were a single-player game- Can pay to shortcut your character through things like mount speed, bag size, but you can unlock it all just by playing- Alts can be shortcut along if you've completed content on your main character (for a price)- Big library of helpful UI addons that enrich the experience- Players in game are knowledgeable, friendly, encouraging, welcomingCONS:- Colour palette is muted and bland (I use reshade to fulfill its beauty potential of which it has plenty)- Game is enormous and might take a long time to download/install- Subscription benefits are so good that you pretty much have to (craft bag & all DLCs)- It might take a long time to configure the settings & addons, learn the mechanics, etc- A bunch of the ""cosmetic"" content like mounts, pets, costumes, and even housing, is sometimes only available through purchase and cannot be unlocked just by playing- Steam and ZOS forums filled with trolls & complainers with complaints ranging from poor performance to cheaters, which nobody I've been playing with has been affected by."
Positive,"I have a love-hate relationship with this game, played it since launch, loved it, then got caught up in other games for years occasionally dipping back in before leaving again.Returned to it very recently and there's been a few small changes that, imo, have improved it dramaticly.Skills now scale with your highest resource instead of default using a particular one (i.e. magic can now scale off scale and vice versa) which I think it's a fantastic change as it allows so much more flexibility in builds. I'm not saying those builds are going to be meta or whatever, but from a 'fun' perspective it's nice to be able to say 'I can now use this and not have it hit like a wet tissue because I went heavy stamina' or such.The open world is VAST. Unfortunately, at least in the original zones, it's a vast landscape of repetition. Honestly the Daggerfall zones are bland. Most zones I've seen are just green and grey, rock and grass, with little to break it up. The Dark Elves zones are a bit more visually interesting but still very unremarkable.It's not uncommon for me to lose my quest marker in the bland yet somehow also noisy landscape. The cities have the same issue, they're not very impressive outside a couple, with very little attempt to build scale. Warcrafts Stormwind, as an example, blows nearly every ESO city out of the water in terms of making you feel like it's a city. Equally the fast travel points are amazingly abundant, and can be used freely if you travel from one to another (traveling to one from just any random spot though will cost gold, which is fine). They are however also remarkably poorly placed from anything of any actual use in most places. So expect to run through these visually uninteresting and windy 'cities' frequently.Not a game breaker but eso could learn a few things about convinience. On a far more positive side you'll hear Liam o'Brien A LOT, which is always welcome.The housing system is great, honestly. Costly, both in real money and time depending on what houses you get but if you're into player housing and decoration etc then there's a lot here for you. PvP is, as in most MMOS, utterly worthless and not worth mentioning.  The classes are fun, without forcing you into them. Because you choose any skill line and any weapon it's entirely possible to never actually USE your classes speicific skills. I'm not sure why you'd go that way but you can. levelling is long and tedious, this isn't really a game you play to rush to max. Given max is pretty much 210 levels away (50 base levels and 160 'champion' levels) you're in for a long, long run if you try. Most of the fun in eso is, imo, the journey around the world, the little stories, the characters etc. It's an online elder scrolls game, if you've played skyrim especially you know what you're getting, if you haven't then you're gonna be confused but hopefully entertained. I will say though, the new player experience to this game is probably one of the worst I've ever seen. Running you through a tutorial area, then saying ""go do whatever"" with little guidance (outside of throwing terms around that the player won't understand) only for them to possibly HOURS later get a random npc pop up and say ""oh btw here's the games original main quest chain"" is rediculously bad.That said despite all the issues, it is a fun game all told and, whilst deeply flawed, like every elder scrolls game really, it's worth a go. End of the day like most elder scrolls games, you get out what you put in. Want to be an assassin for the next 6 years? Cool, go dark brotherhood and murder people. Thief? go theives guild and steal all day. (to be fair steal anyway, it's a great money maker).There are races but realisticly they have little to no impact day to day, not really mattering until and if you do high end stuff, which you don't have to do. Want to be an Orc that throws magic around whilst running with a broadsword? Go for it."
Positive,"Make no mistake, this is a great game with very active developers and a great community. I can't stress this enough though: buy it directly through ZOS, not Steam! I've had many issues in the past few months with Steam support, it's not infrequent for Steam users to get locked out while those that have an independent copy are able to log in. Wish I had known this before I bought. Anyway, fantastic game from both an MMO and RPG perspective."
Positive,"Really good game that goes deeper into the Elder Scrolls Lore. Definitely can play without subscription, but is a lot better with it. In addition, highly recommend joining a guild of some sort for maximum value of play. Overall a great game!"
Positive,Better then wow
Positive,One of the beat mmo i played great game :)
Positive,10 YEARS OLD AND STILL THE BEST MMORPG
Positive,"Played using the free trial version with no dlc*    The game is great it has good combat and spell casting is fun and not op like in other mmo's.  ESO is a mmo that is definitly more fun with 2 or 3 people but the experience is not bad by yourself.  *Ending notes:  I played this game back in 2014 and the game has come a long way, it might not be the best mmo on the market but it is up there I really recommend it, try to get it on a sale though."
Positive,"They did a big update and its still more of the same. My biggest gripe about this game is Expansions are 30+ quid yet we must spend monthly on a sub to gain access to DLC which are not included in the expansions because toddy loves to rub his giblets at our pain. Good game, never met a more money hungry company though. Worse than Activision blizzard. Hardly any mounts/collectables unless you buy over priced virtual currency called crowns. The wrothgar expansion release was bare-bones so i skipped it personally. Which brings a positive, the amount of content available is decent. That said, if you like farming mounts and the like. WoW offers more as this game makes you pay money to get cool mounts as farming is against Bethesdas motto. Imagine letting the player obtain things through gameplay. Not on their watch. Questing is good.pvp in battlegrounds is dog doo dooDungeon crawling is okayDid the arena its kinda fun just long windedNever raided as you need to be 650 level which takes years to do [ignore] >>>> I'm now level 700+ and still not raided but vet dungeons are easier. I add to this review occasionally so it clearly is disjointed. I started to grind gear in light of the new changes of 6.5. Vet dungeons are actually a fun challenge if you don't have idiots who join and leave at the first sight of trouble. Open world pvp in the ""pvp zones"" is hella funpvp is about as balanced as a midget and their fully grown twin on a seesaw.Crafting is fun but pointless once you have a build/set you don't need to do anything but pvp/quest/raidingSo many random stuff spread on the map it almost feels like ubisoft game.only reason i still play this is because my sub reoccurred and i must get my money's worth even though i know the house has already won. The main takeaway is toddy howard will get your money, he will make you grind your giblets off and you will do it for the thing. week 47, still not got my 1/6 chance item from a box which requires 3 hours of dungeoneering to open one box. [update]I bought the latest expansion and I've not played it yet. Pre-ordered it and got a mount.. which is good since you can't farm mounts and ive never bought a create to attempt to get more than the crown mounts you acquire through crowns which i obtained through subscribing to gain access to DLC's. PVP is still doo doo in battlegrounds. So many times i join a game with 2-3 team members when its a 4v4v4. Dungeoneering is good. Vets are easy now I'm cp level 900+. Got  some mouth breather moaning that i  had a shield as an offhand because i mostly pvp the other day so i just said words until he left. World  pvp i understand more, its still fun. Lack of team play on ebon heart pact is really something though. I can imagine the other factions invite and group up more. Many of times ive been forced to solo. Yes i could lead my own group and have, but I do not want to lead because leading is for losers who want to press M constantly and watch resources and castles ua. I don't want to do either. Additionally the bomb groups and warden spam is a bit OP. CPpvp is superior. Did a solo arena that i learned of recently, it was decent. Tried it on veteran and got steam rolled. The CP reset went from 810 cap to like 3200. I just hit 800 when this happened and it practically put me to the same power as when i was 600. A massive kick to the nuts if i say so myself. I haven't mentioned this, but the events in this game are pretty fun. One thing it led me to understand was motifs. Many of them drop and obtained through events. Motifs are just clothing options since you get gear and keep that pretty much the same once you have a set for the build you choose. Dress up is a big thing in this game. Made some chars i have look cool. There is housing in this game, never done it. Probably never will. Saw someone made a side scrolling plat-former using the house building via the community tab on the browser. That was kind of cool. I now own all chars max level with somewhat a complete or semi complete build. its fun to have options. the game is alt friendly.Crafting is something i understand now. I made my first char i made the master crafter. Its really good how the systems work but in old toddy howard nipple rubbing fashion. near the end of the crafting you wait up to 30+ days to research traits which is absolute cancer for a game that requires you to purchase it and makes it optional to sub to but we all know you have to sub to get the most out of the game. Hope you enjoyed my updoot. Please end the suffering of all players and cut the megaservers"
Positive,i think i can write a good review after 2100 hours of gameplay in this game :Dfirst thing first this game isnt oblivion or skyrim this a true mmorpg inside tamriel world :D and if u play skyrim u know this world is amazing1 main quest is so good and it give u a nice ulitmate if u finish it and this ultimate is so good in pvp2 there are too many quests in this game that i cant even count them :D and most of them are uniqe quests with nice story line and like skyrim y can choose what to do in most of them 3 pve is nice too it has many duengons and trials(raids) in normal mod they are easy if all of u arent low lvls :D veteran(hard) are too good and hard specilly some of them are too hard specially dlc ones and veterans of trials are very hard but if u know what to do with good team u can do them 4 pvp : the most fun of this game for me is in pvp ye pvp in this game is awesome u can go to cyrodil map and there is a open world faction vs factions pvp and its a lot of fun u can invite peoples to duel in pve zones and it has imperial city another faction vs factions world and they ad battle ground in this game too and thats nice but i wish more peoples in battlegroun :D5 gameplay is good ui is good and u can add addons to game so u can change them music and soundtracks of this game are so awesome :Dthis game woth every dollar that u spend for it and i love it
Positive,"This is such a good game for the Elder scrolls lover!Why?This game is so beautiful it has really good graphics.The music comes from older Elder scrolls games like Morrowind and Oblivion wich gives you a really nice feeling thinking back from when you played them.The Combat is plays fine, its doesnt get boring and it isnt to hard.The Quests are fun aswell, you could say they are a bit like the quests in Skyrim with a little twist.Every time you enter a cave or go outside you just have to stand still a moment to enjoy the stunning view. 10/10 would buy again."
Positive,"time over time, this game is getting better.helps closing my curiousity towards how Tamriel looks like.satisfy my need of deep lores.a world i can call home.underestimated this game in earlier years, now i cant even leave it alone, unplayed.not a fan of MMO, but still enjoy this game as a single player, and can still play with friends in case of life getting boring here and there.classic complaint, still a few bugs and glitches, but everything is okay."
Positive,"No matter what you fancy, this game has what you're looking for.*Single-player.*Multiplayer.*PvE.*PvP.*Sword and Board.*Cleric.*Necromancer.*Electromancer.*Pyromancer.*Assassinmancer.*Exploration.*Stealth.*Odd looking pets and mounts.*Economy.*Roleplaying.*Male Orcs riding around on Unicorns while dressed as fairies.*Deep Storytelling.*Endless Lore.*House Decorating.*Social Activities.*Cosmetics to spend all of your money on so that you have an excuse to not go out drinkingwith Ted from work. YOU HEAR THAT TED? I CAN'T MAKE IT THIS WEEK!*Cats.*Dragons.*Realistic Gun mechanics.*Truck Driving Simulation.Alright, maybe those last few don't quite make the list.BUT EVERYTHING ELSE is here and waiting for you to partake. And there's always more around the corner."
Positive,best mmo 2020
Positive,Bring your DLCs to steam
Positive,"This is the first MMO that I've ever played, and I have about 5000 hours logged.  My past gaming history includes mostly RPGs.  I would recommend this game to folks who like RPGs because it includes RPG elements along with the player vs player elements.  In fact, you could play this game strictly as an on-line RPG and not even participate in the player vs player elements, if that is your desire.  It has pretty good graphics for an on-line game, many of the story elements are well written, the game world is very large with lots of exploring opportunities, the game is well-maintained with frequent updates and added content, server quality has been pretty good over the two years I've played with only a few hiccups, and the game is just mostly fun to play in my opinion.  One warning though; it can be addictive."
Positive,"I love every The Elder Scrolls games. This is the best MMORPG and it will be my favorite No.1 best MMORPG. Worth buying if you true Elder Scrolls fan.- Quest is my favorite, everyone is voice acting, best questline, lores and books- Map are big, u can travel all across Tamriel and different world.- All places are balanced for now, low level player can travel anywhere and do quest.Game are great but something not- ESO market are greedy and aways bring useless limited items.- Combat system still bad, normal attack doesnt feel anything and it boring- NPC is useless and not alive, they just stay and do nothing while im dying fighting enemies. Some NPC fight for your side but it useless, because NPC deal low damage and slow attack.- Locked content, you cant get anything unless you buy DLC to unlock new skill lineThis game deserve to be free 2 play because you cant get everything unless you pay DLC u get stuff"
Positive,"The game is amazingIn a fantasy world, personalize whatever you want.This game is also worth buying without discount."
Positive,Best MMORPG in the world's .if u did not play ESO as MMORPG player just go and die. u should not call yourself a gamer .10/10
Positive,"The game is somewhat good, if you don´t mind hanging around for a while, aka hours sometimes, before you even play, or you just can´t really connect sometimes at all (happened to me like half of times I wanted to play). I´ve seen somebody saying it is just running from quest to quest, which is kinda true, but you also can pretty much explore whatever you want (which I don´t advice tho, because you will end up meeting up bosses that are not for your level, and you will die instantly :)). The world is somehow pretty, but compared to (I know, kill me) Skyrim, it is rather not so good, when it comes to design of the world and AI too. The enemies and people in general just seem like they happened to be in the world not knowing how, they don´t feel like they belong there. I don´t mean players, but everything that´s alive in the game, seems like it just happened to be there by accident. It doesn´t give me the feeling of amazing, fantasy world, but rather of being in the game, which is not what I expect from this kind of game to be. I don´t agree that fights are ""too easy"" as some people say, they are not. The difficulty is set very well I think, not too easy but not too hard (again, unless you meet something that is not for your level, as I usually would). Even with these things, I dare to recommend it, because 1) world is pretty well done, as it usually is with ES, 2) You can play with friends, 3) be proud of who you are, no matter who you are, but if you can be Khajiit, be Khajiit. I think this game has to be in library of every ES fan, even when it will be weakest piece in there."
Positive,"This is the best MMORPG I have played so far which has one of the best story, it really feels like a single player story focus game but also have the MMORPG elements from the PVE content such as Dungeons, Raids, world bosses, and many different PVP modes. Also this game supports add-ons which is basically modes that can enhance your experience even more or improve on the UI element, finding things and crafting much more easier. You can be anything and play anyway in this game from a Master Crafter to a Thief play the way you want to play. As for the leveling, there are many different way that you can choose to level, either by doing dungeons, PVP, mob farming, arenas or playing the huge story content that can easily go over 1k hours just for the base game and doing the side quest. As for the side quest, some of them are really amazing and not only provide you context to TES story but also special items, emotes and even skill lines that you will be able to use. However there are some downsides, one of the biggest problems is the Ping. I am currently living in asia and my ping is about 350+ constant but does drop to like 300 at its best. Although its a high ping the game is still playable in PVP and PVE with the occasional lag spikes and it does not feel like its 300 ping like other games such as League of legends where is unplayable. The second problem that I have with the game is the combat animation. The combat feels really clunky and heavy and at certain times where you have to do an animation cancel it does not feel and look good but if you can ignore that and in the end game you will be focusing more on your rotations the combat wont feel as bad and is actually quite enjoyable. Overall, I definitely do recommend this game to anyone with the amount of content that this game provides and the amount of activities that the player can do in this game it is worth it if you can ignore the occasional lag and clunky animations. This game is worth a play and with the ESO plus membership it gets even better with the access to all the DLC including my favorite Dragonhold, Thiefs Guild and Dark Brotherhood DLC as well a infinite crafting storage bag if you want to spend time crafting and being a Master Crafter."
Positive,"It is definitely one of the best MMORPGs I have played. For the low price and the optional, not requiered subscription model it offers, it is unique for these kind of games. You can experience the game fully without the subscription and still have fun. The worldbuilding is great and goes in harmony with the rest of the elder scrolls universe. Graphics are a bit older but still playable. DLC have to be bought but if you think of playing the game regularly i advise you buy eso plus so you can get every DLC aswell. Recommended 9/10"
Positive,"So, Its been almost a few years ESO in my wishlist and at last decided to purchase and try it. Its been a blast since then putting my about 65 hours to the game. It is just like the other Elder Scrolls but with online theme lol. You can still play it solo most of the time too but alas I'm still newbie and still learning the mechanics of the game."
Positive,"As an ex-wow/rift/wildstar and current FFXIV player its not easy for me to admit this, but, everything negative I've heard about ESO is incorrect.This game is great!Excellent questing and storyline, beautiful graphics and its elder scrolls with friends!All that aside, the things that stands out most if the combat. For anyone that has played Wildstar or other action MMO's you surely know how much difference a more active combat system can make.This game does it better - full stop!There is something supremely satisfying about knocking an enemy down, powering up a heavy hit and landing it as they are about to get to there feet, only to smack them straight back down.And this is in an MMO!!!! Never thought I'd see the day.But you really need to try this out for yourself. This isn't the game that was released to mixed reviews almost a year ago.For one the sub is gone - you get an unbelievable amount of content for $60.There have also been 6 major patches released since then - with many new features and bug fixes.2014 was such a disappointing year in gaming - so many big titles failed to live up to expectation or were flawed beyond all comprehension.Do yourself a favour and start 2015 off right.Try this game, you will be as pleasantly surprised as I am.9.5/10 (Impossible to really rank an mmo this way but hey, I tried)"
Positive,"A great MMO with an Elder Scrolls theme. The standard MMO features are present, but with the kind of questlines, characterisation and graphics one would expect from any TES games. There are plenty of quests to do across Tamriel and Coldharbour, along with areas to explore, things to kill and decisions to make. But it's the PvP and the end-game PvE where the game really starts to shine.I have a 60 day sorc, 20 day dk and others, on top of whatever amount of game time I have spent through Steam (mostly PTS). This game can be very addicting, be warned.The impending re-launch of the game on 16th March and the change in its payment model represents an excellent opportunity to new players to join and see for themselves why it has been such an underrated and misunderstood game."
Positive,"Positives:-Can go anywhere in Tamriel (enemies level to you)-Factions only count in PvP-The places you travel to are insanely pretty-The storylines are really good for each area (Aldmeri/Raz is my favorite!)-Can sink hours playing multiple toons with helpful in-game communites-Can belong to 5 community guildsNegatives:-Needs UI add-ons to make the game easier to navigate-Grouping together with friends is fun but easy to lose each other as only the leader is clearly marked-$14.99 monthly fee (optional) gives you double bank space, crowns to spend in store, access to all DLC, and an infinite crafting bag. Without this fee, you will quickly fill up your inventories."
Positive,"Great game. Whether you want to play heavy on PVP or PVE, complete dungeons or go fishing. Perfect to scratch that itch for competitive play, casual play or just fishing....did I say fishing?"
Positive,What day is it?
Positive,"(Look pal, this review isn't complete. Meaning it will be updated as I continue to play; and discover new things/features... be they good or bad!)    Very fun game! Fits into the Elder Scrolls series as a prequel (or so I hear?). Regardless, no matter what kind of MMO player you are, there is something here for you in the 2018 release. There is SO very much to do. From provisioning up a slick dinner, to questing in an effort to defie a Daedric lord. This game has it all! Very nice community, supportive and helpful from my experience. Tons of Elder Scrolls lore. There are so many books and fully voiced dialogue options. I recommend!subject to change in the future...    What can I say? This is the first MMO I have ever played! So, let me explain my current experience with the game at approximately 70 or so hours. First, lets rewind this wayyy back to 2016 (when I first bought the game)! I jump online, creating a Dragonknight Orc named Papa Tin. I begin playing the game, following the main story and trying my best to learn everything as I go along. Now, I'll admit... back then I was a greenhorn knowing NOTHING about MMOs, and seeing all the different menus and ENORMOUS map (with many zones)... I was intimidated! Not wanting to mess anything up I left the game in the dust. Rest in peace... or so I thought! Fast forward to 2018. I decided to re-enter the game! Setting Papa Tin on the back burner for a new experimental character named Tin the Whisker! I rejoin Tamriel as a new Khajiit who wants to learn all there is to know! I meet a friendly wizard who brings me to Coldharbour... and BAM! 55 hours later I've finished all there is to do in Coldharbour! Thinking I must've made some big progress, I whip out that slick journal to look at my character progress. That's when I was S H O O K! I had made LESS than ONE percent of progress on the game!! My point is, this game is absolutely enormous! Though, I think people who are fans of the Elder Scrolls series would enjoy this game more than those who don't know what the Elder Scrolls are. If you're reading this you've probably already gone through tons of reviews so I'll spare you the schlonger crap! The times that I do play this game, I have a blast! If you see the game on sale I think you should pick it up! You can play the whole game through with no extra cash transactions. At least from what I see!There is so much to do and explore!Friendly communityLore is scatterd everywhereContinuous updatingFeels fun to actually playCrafting ISN'T worthlessNew leveling systemGenerally much friendlier to newer playersStill thrivingin case the developers ever read!    1. Map Improvements! Some of us new players wish to visit specific zones right off the bat! I think something that would help make the game a bit more friendly for the new players is a waypoint update! Meaning, should someone place a waypoint somewhere in a different zone, perhaps an icon should appear on the doorway needed to get to that zone. Similar to when a quest leads you to a different zone, an icon appears on the doorway needed to progress!    2. Enemy level scaling! I currently play the game alone, and the problem I have so far is in regards to progression as a solo player. I know this is an MMO but shouldn't most of the quests be do-able alone? I feel as though many enemies can easily shred through someone's health.read up on whatever is down here, eh?I love the Elder Scrolls, I'm thinking of making guides for ESO to help out the new players. Everyone remembers how disorienting their first few days of an MMO are! Why not make it a little easier?Anyways, I hope you tiggens have a good day. If you have any tips or something to say, put it in the comments! Ah, and if you ever meet me in game that'd be pretty neat, eh?"
Positive,"People either really likes or really dislikes this game, I have never met a person that said it was ""OK"". It's either ""an amazing game"" or ""a terrible game, not like Skyrim at all"". And I think that those who dislikes the game was looking for Skyrim with friends, something that this game would never be (they said from the start that it was going to ba an MMO, and that exactly what they gave us). The ones that like the game was looking for an MMO, and this game is a unique type of MMO.I hear people say that this isn't Skyrim online, I'm here to tell you that they are right. It's so much more!This game has the gates of Oblivion with the Sigil Stones ans Scamps that follows with it, Ayleid Ruins with traps and Welkynd Stones and the Shivering Isles with Haskill and Sheogorath. If you ever played Oblivion, then this game holds a bunch of nostalgia for you. I couldn't stop laughing when I fist saw Haskill, all I could think about was the Summon Haskill spell you get from the Shivering Isles quest line in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.This game also contains the Dwemer Ruins with the Dwarven Spiders and the Dwarven Spheres, the old dragon burial mounds and the Nordic Ruins with Draugrs and puzzles. Almost everything you can do in The Elders Scrolls V: Skyrim, you can do in this game. And you can do a whole lot that you can't do in Skyrim.This game has content from all of the Elder Scrolls games, but I have only played Oblivion and Skyrim so that's all I know :PIf you are looking for Skyrim online, you're not going to find it here. But if you are looking for a unique MMO, with content from all the Elder Scrolls games and endless possibilities in character builds and playing styles, this is the game for you!In my opinion, this game is better than Skyrim.This game is AMAZING!"

Lots of repeated texturesMusic is repetitive and occasionally grating. Where's Jeremy Soule when you need him?Community can be juvenilePlayer to player trading and guilds are handled in an awkward and bizarre fashionLastly, the endless debate whether the Elder Scrolls series actually needed an MMO"
Positive,"The game is fun from what I've played, but the launcher is completely broken : always getting stuck on patches. I don't know if the experience would be better if I bought the game directly, but don't buy it through Steam."
Positive,i love 1.1m health little dino things 11/10
Positive,"Flexible builds and class cross-overs, interesting stories, reasonable FTP with options to buy expansions"
Positive,Türkçe dil desteği getirmeyin. Bizim gerizekalılar bu oyunun ortamını da bozar.
Positive,"I played the beta of ESO and was left feeling dissappointed - therefore when the game originally launched, I had no interest in purchasing it.  When Tamriel Unlimited was announced, my hope in a true Elder Scrolls online experience was renewed.  I took the leap of faith and bought the game, and haven't looked back.  In ten years of playing MMO's, I can say with a clear conscious that this is hands down my favorite."
Positive,"Even though it's a great MMO, I like how it's both a great singleplayer game :DI love the amount of stories, content, regions and cities, RPG choices, adventures, etc.Graphics are beatiful, characters memorable and gameplay is challenging.All diversities this game offers is what keeps me interested into playing it daily!Note: I've been playing it since the start of 2022., but I played it for the first time on Steam during the 'free to play' period. I own ESO on their official site."
Positive,"Here's my non bias review about ESO. I started playing this game a few years back when it first released on console, PS4 to be exact. I enjoyed myself thoroughly with my friends at the time. But subsequently I took a hard break from playing video games in general. When I decided to make a return, I build myself a PC in the process. Reminiscing about the fun times playing ESO on console, gave me the itch to refresh on PC but I didn't want to scratch the grind. In the result of that, I decided to play World Of Warcraft as my MMO of choice. Playing WOW was a good experience. But as a new player, WOW community seems very split with new players, good players, and the elitist. Even as a new player, I'm a quick learner but that doesn't matter with WOW. And there's literally no fun solo experience playing WOW. So I wasn't going to be stubborn anymore, and I grinded ESO on PC. With 2000 plus hours in ESO, reaching level cap and completing very hard content that ESO has to offer. I must say ""I didn't miss a beat"". But my issues about ESO in comparison to WOW. The best looking mounts are locked through horrible micro-transactions, the lag in cyrodiil, and this last one isn't a con but a personal preference. I wish ESO had their own version of a mythic plus system. For example, non-dlc veteran dungeons like fungal grotto 1 is child's play even with an average amount of CP. I do recommend this game but remember not all MMOs isn't for everybody."
Positive,"Easily one of the most enjoyable experiences—MMO or otherwise—that I've encountered in a long time. I had actively avoided ESO in the past, despite having played World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2 and a veritable litany of other MMOs or MMO-like games, and this review is more of a ""hey, I didn't think I'd have fun, but I've been having a ton"" review. It's ""Skyrim: With Friends Edition"", and it's just as dangerous as it sounds.In its current state (I've been playing since early October) I don't think I've played many other games that come close to this level of variety in choices in both what you're doing and how you're doing it. May not have always been the case, as I've heard of ""One Tamriel"" changes that happened post launch, and I don't think any MMO launches without issues, but the game I'm playing has somehow reignited my passion for playing games during a time I'm struggling to have ""fun"". The game is very respectful of your time, and between teleporting to wayshrines you've unlocked (or to friends), queuing for dungeons while doing your own thing, and having multiple methods of re-specializing/swapping builds or skills... even if you end up having to walk away for 20-30 minutes at a time you can still end up having a decent experience. I know the subscription has a lot to do with this as I run across the countryside, looting everything that isn't bolted down, but I have a feeling I'd still find it enjoyable even if I needed to dump cheese wheels every so often.Definitely recommend if you played Guild Wars 2 and wondered what it'd be like if the game looked better, ran better, and offered more variety and more meaningful player choices."
Positive,"I just can't belive I bought the game for 79.99$ and it comes out at 66% off 1 day later. Good game though, so much to do. And they finally mixed grouping, so I can actually just find some random guy or call upon a friend and go adventuring."
Positive,"This was both my first MMO and the first Elder Scrolls title I have played. I can recommend. I find it engaging and fun to play. The world is vast and full of interesting places to explore. The lore is equally vast and is well delivered by some excellent storytelling. The usual RPG quest tasks are couched nicely enough in dialogue and story that they don't feel like a repetitive chore.The world is very open and eminently explorable. One can carve their own path through Tamriel simply by where they decide to travel to and what quests they find interesting. While that aspect of it is very non-linear, the quests themselves and dialogue choices are mostly linear. While certainly fun, you aren't often given a distinct choice in what to say (though when you do the options are in red) which is a bit of a shame. I like a system more like fallout where what you choose to say determines that person's future interactions with you - positively or negatively - and allows you to be your character than just the silent protagonist in a pre-determined story.There is a good deal of grinding in this game, be forewarned. Though due to equal levelling throughout the world it's not a big problem I find. Mostly building your skills up can be grindy and tedious.One great part about the game is the even levelling. No matter where you go, you will always be at the right level to enjoy fighting and questing and whatever else. There's no need to grind to level up just to continue the story or to access a region on the map. The downside to this is when you're low level, you don't feel quite squishy, and as you level up that one annoying random enemy never gets any easier.The MMO part I don't really understand yet. Not sure what others are like, but I find myself just playing ESO like its a single player game along side other people playing the same game at different points.ESO+ is def worth it if you are putting a lot of time into the game. The crafting bag is a godsend. It is totally not pay-to-win though, more like pay for convenience and aesthetics.Overall, I'm enjoying it very much. Great art, great story, great fun."
Positive,"good game. but could have been better, it's still worth a try if you Like TES."
Positive,"not enough hot lizards, although cats work too i guess"
Positive,"Absolutly fenominal RPG as you would expect from the likes of Bethesda! and is one of the better pay once MMOs. Highly recomend this game to any Bethesda, Elder Scroles, or RPG fan!"
Positive,"Doesn't always work, but sometimes it does. 3000 hours spent in this Loading Screen simulator and I would definitely disconnect again. Maintenance/10 - would recommend!"
Positive,"Each time I open this game, I enjoy it for about an hour then am reminded of the messy, boring combat. Crafting + gathering is straightforward and worthwhile, quest line stories are interesting. World is immersive and pretty. Addons are supported and add nice QoL features. Recommend this MMO for its story, quests, and world, but absolutely not for its combat."
Positive,"Updating my old review of this game.Where to start…1st of all, I’m ex-progression raider for other MMOs before I started to lack time (studies+work=rip no lifing) so if you are hard core PvE player I’d suggest to move along and not bother. Game has really casual PvE – you can craft top gear to get yourself through Veteran dungeons (4 man) where you will get required gear to finish trials (12 man raids) and there (in story mode) you will get enough gear to do veteran trials. The main challenge is leveling – you need champion points after level 50. The more you have the more damage/healing you can do and more survivability you have. Also they recently introduced transmutation – you can change traits on gear which killed the point to grind gear pieces with correct traits. And they are bringing jewelry craftsmanship, which will make the game even more casual due to removal of requirement for players to farm gold rings/necks in vet trials. There are a TON of casual vet. Dungeons and only few that has a challenge. Veteran trials might seem fun but won't last long. So why I’m giving this game a positive review and have few k hours in it? Simple. My real life made me a casual player and I’m really happy that such game exists. I don’t need to spend weeks to gear up to raid, farm endless dailies and materials etc. I can just hang out here in weekends, running dungeons and trials even in my crafted gear, level up new toons, farm new titles and enjoy the story. Because I simply can’t give up on my MMO life<3Talking about the story – game base story has 3 fractions each has unique and quite long story + ton of side quests. Game is packed with small and big DLCs which you can check out by buying them or subscribing to game (~13eur/month). Atm TESO had 1 huge expansion – Morrowind, and second one incoming in the end of May – Summerset. You need to buy them but they are worth every penny. If you enjoy TES lore I suggest you to try this game!Can’t say much about PvP aspect but here’s basic stuff – the main PvP action is happening in Cyrodiil (huge open world pvp map) and mainly consists of classic castle sieging, zerging, small/local pvp battles of guilds. Unless you enjoy waiting in stealth (for solo wanderers and casual players who came here to do quests ) and ganking those poor loners there won’t be much fun for you if you enjoy solo PvP. All the fun in happening in group battles, so I suggest you to find a PvP guild that organizes raids there. Last year they introduced Battlegrounds – pretty much simple arenas with good ol’ fashion mechanics of capture the flag, deathmatch, chaoseball and crazy king (capture random flag that spawns all over the place). 10-50 tier has good pops but 50+ Battlegrounds mainly pop only on Fridays-Sundays.What I still dislike, after few k hours, about this game are achievement system. It’s not account wide (thank god champion system and collections are). Each character has his own achievement progression which means I’m locked to one “main” char to get them all (I’m achievement grinder so it bothers me).To sum up:>If you don’t have a lot of time to gear up and farm stuff – buy this game.>If you are casual player who enjoys a bit of challenge (DLC dungeons+vet trials) buy this game.>If you love TES lore and story – buy this game.>If you are hardcore player which loves a challenge and grindfest – try something else."
Positive,If you like the other Elder Scrolls games andgames like World of Warcraft you will like this game too.Pro:+real Elder Scrolls feeling+cool and interesting story+really big and amazing world+many huge updates+no pay2winContra:-expensive cosmetic item shop-bad servers
Positive,"This is a review in progress so i will update after ive played some more.So far i have only 3 problems with the game:1. The UI and menus are messy and a pain to navigate2. The combat, at least for me, is clunky and is the biggest problem i have with the game3. Ive only had this once but i kept getting server disconnects but managed to fix by restarting steamApart from these few issues its been pretty fun so far but i will update this soon after ive played a bit more."
Positive,I love this game. Nearly 500 hours in and haven't completed all content on one character. There is so much to do.. you can quest on your own or team up with a group and clear some dungeons. Yes there may be some bugs here and there but they are constantly improving the game which is great especially after one tamriel coming out it became even more fun.
Positive,"The game is fun but Zos should Make it free and upgrade the servers to have crossplay.I'm tired of waiting one hour to get some dudes to play dungeons.And yes the game is not playable without ESO+, so it will fit if its free game with subscription option, or superscription Required like wow and osrs i dont care."
Positive,"Emperor Tiber Septim, a second dragon has hit the Tamriel Trade Centre."
Positive,"Awesome game. If you are a fan of Skyrim this game is a the perfect MMO. No mandatory monthly payments. Once you have bought it, it's paid for. You CAN subscribe monthly for other perks but so far I haven't seen anything restricting me as a result of that. So far it is quite fun and feels just the way an Elder Scrolls game should. Rating: 10/10"
Positive,"All negative reviews are from when the game launched more than a year ago. However, ever since update six half a year back, ESO has become the classic Elder Scrolls game you want - but even better.The combat system has to be the best combat from any game. You feel like you are taking that swing or blow - it's similar to Skyrim combat but with more features and options to strike your enemy down.Also, you DON'T need to start off with a friend to enjoy this game. I didn't, yet I'm getting everything out of this game. The community is brilliant and many people are ready to help. This game is playable solo until after level 50, which is a LOT of gametime. However, it's very easy to join guilds and make new friends to aid you in your future adventures - especially in Cyrodiil - when you've reached that level of difficulty.This game is huge. Each zone is about the size of Skyrim (there are 4 zones) yet half of Tamriel hasn't even been added yet. As an MMO, this game will continue to expand and the rest of Tamriel will be included, meaning that the hours and hours of fun gameplay shall constantly be expanding. The graphics are brilliant. Not Skyrim brilliant, but beats-most-games brilliant.The combat system, champion system and thieving system are all brilliant. The Thieves Guild is about to be introduced and later on the Dark Brotherhood alongside a lot of DLC's (3 DLC already exist). All to come, all to enjoy. Recommended :)Why did I write this? Negative reviews from people who haven't played the game after update six annoy me.Should you let this game absorb your soul? DEFINITELY"

Positive,"For me, ESO is the best MMORPG. there are so many things to do. I love how much ZOS cares for this game. They add lots of new content. If youre thinking about getting this game, I def recommend it. One thing you have to keep in mind is that, its not TES. Dont expect Morrowind, Oblivion or Skyrim. Its a standalone game, that takes place in TES universe. Give it a try, youll love it, trust me :3"
Positive,"I've played WoW, GW2, FF XIV, and pretty much any MMO but the kitchen sink. This game suffers from a rough intial launch, most of the bad stuff you'll hear about this game are from people who didn't like it at launch. I'd recommend giving it a try, it's pretty good if you can get into it."
Positive,"I've been playing for almost 8 years and plan to play more due to my nice community. *The best MMORPG gameplay I've ever seen so far. *Some stories in the quests are amazing. *It's occasionally buggy & laggy but maintained regularly. *Long loading screens & rarely infinite loading screens*Mini-transactions for lockboxes, consumables, cosmetics & DLC.Furniture space limitation in the house design for the non-subscribed players is terrible. The half bank space, one-way access to craft bag & slow progression at everthing; all of which I can understand but not being able change furniture in our houses without eso plus subscription needs to change."
Positive,"A fantastic game! But on a side note... FOR ONLY $39.99 YOU CAN GET 5500 CROWNS, THATS RIGHT 5500 CROWNS! BET YOU THINK THATS A LOT WELL THINK AGAIN! FOR 10 EASY PAYMENTS OF $39.99 YOU MIGHT GET SOMETHING SLIGHTLY INTERESTING FROM, YOU GUESSED IT LOOT BOXES, WE STUFF THEM IN YOUR FACE, CARE MORE ABOUT THE CROWN STORE THAN THE ACTUAL GAME, BUT DONT LET THAT DISCOURAGE YOU! FOR WE NOW HAVE DAILY LOGINS, THAT GIVE YOU CRATES THAT WILL GIVE YOU GOOD STUFF SO WE CAN WARP YOUR MIND INTO BUYING MORE CRATES THAT HAVE A LOWER CHANCE AT GIVING YOU ANYTHING GOOD AT ALL! AND KEEP IN MIND THIS GAME IS NOT FREE THIS IS ALL AFTER PAYING $19.99! But no it is a good game i just dont like how thay plaster crown stuff EVERYWHERE, it is really distracting and quite annoying how almost everything good is locked behind a DLC or in the crown store, yes you can get some good stuff from logins but it is almost as if they are squeezing your hand begging you to buy the subscriber membership."
Positive,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
Positive,"Liked this MMO much more than WOW or FF 11 = reasons why?No monthly paymentFirst person modeAlmost the entire game can be completed by yourselfPVE and PVP exist in the same world, just in different areas"
Positive,"I've played too much of this game.Help me.Plenty of content -- if you like MMOs or the Elder Scrolls in general it's worth checking out.However, this is not Skyrim Online, this an Elder Scrolls themed MMO.Thousands of hours of content with a non-pay-to-win cash shop (purely cosmetic and utility items).There's plenty of solo content and group content. Be aware that doing some of the solo content in a group can be a bit wonky at times.In summary, if you think you'd enjoy playing with other people and exploring most of Tamriel, this might be the game for you.Edit:1 year later and the game is still going strong with additional DLCs and content. Morrowind was, unfortunately, sold as a separate expansion but added a new zone, class and PvP game mode."
Positive,"If you have played the elder scrolls: skyrim and came here expecting something similar to it like i did well let me stop you and i will tell you why:you need to understand that, this game is an Online MMORPG so it is way more complicated than what you used to play in skyrim. you need to download the game which is 90-95GB and then you need to download the update when you run the game which is 10-15GB, when you enter the game finally you will choose the server which is just two EU or NA so good luck with the ping in the game. and then the real problem comes out when you wanna start the game it pops up the loading screen so you chilling and waiting for the game then you realize when it's done it's the first load screen now you can see your character and then you hit the button play here comes the real big load screen then, oh finally you can play the game so you do the tutorial mission and then you need to go the real world of the game boom another loading screen and i'm talking about minutes not seconds so this is the first problem. then when you start to understand the game boom you will find out this game from bethesda and you need to pay for everything in the game like the DLC and you need to pay crowns just to play them even if you bought greymoor dlc and everything in the game just tells you to pay,  like you can do this in 20h but you can do it in 1h if you pay so this is so fuc*ed up but what can i say it's bethesda.well you can see that i recommend this game after all because tbh it's a good game from first time you open the game you listen to the soundtrack it hits you with the nostalgia of the elder scrolls games then you see how beauty the world of the game and how huge it is and the amazing missions and the good characters and the good lore and the wholesome community.then you realize this game is a good game but unlucky you because this game from bethesda ."
Positive,Been playing MMOs since I was a kid and this is one of the best out there right now. Great PVE and PVP in an expansive lore-filled world that draws from everything Elder Scrolls has to offer.
Positive,"Don't go into it expecting an elder scrolls game, and you might like this as an MMORPG."
Positive,"Great game with attention to details in lore and a deep world to get immersed in when you take it nice and slow and follow the quests chronologically, gives all the areas more context. Bit of a cash grab at times but when the mood hits me I enjoy it a lot."
Positive,Came back to this game recently (Nov 2018) and it has improved quite a bit. I really enjoy both the solo questlines that are available as well as the dungeon finder to team up with people and run through a variety of dungeons. I enjoy the combat as it is more involved than other MMO's. I look forward to more content releases for it in the future.
Positive,"Oh, it's finally time to write a review for my all-time favourite MMO. This game is part of my most favourite RPG franchise, which I've been playing since I was a child, and I realize that I may be too kind while reviewing it, therefore this review will not be about some Hardcore-ish critique, but about my personal thoughts on this project as a major fan. The first topic I'd want to discuss is complexity. Of course, we're not talking about anything as absolute as EVE Online, but the best thing to compare it to is the old Destiny 2 framework, where you had a lot of planets with a lot of things to do. Of course, if the player does not have all of the extra content unlocked, he will not be thinking about all of the guilds (6 of them), crafting (8 crafting trees), or other things like archeology (relic hunting), and so on. However, if the player has a monthly subscription, which I believe is a necessary when playing this game, it makes things a little more difficult to settle in the first few hours of playtime.Previously, I mentioned that you need a monthly subscription; here is where many players reading this will say that it is greedy to sell the subscription to people who for example may have already purchased all of the additional content, but I will outline one thing  that I think is really just eyesore FOR EVERYONE! and the title for this is the bottomless inventory for resources. It means that if you're only interested in crafting, it's much easier to buy a membership rather than all of the extra addons since there's no way you're going to keep all of those resources in your bank, inventory, or home storage...What about the world? I'd say it's great and overflowing with missions and activities for everyone! It will take you thousands of hours to finish all Pve Missions, and there is also a lot of other stuff to accomplish, such as various Pvp content and counting. The game is filled with a lore, views, stories, sounds, really beautiful soundtrack, and of course all favourite characters from previous titles such as Almsivi, Daedra lords, Divayth Fyr and etc. So, if you enjoy Elder Scrolls lore and reading in-game stories and books (not only ""the lusty argonian maid""), this game will be a treasure for you.To summarize, Elder Scrolls Online is a fantastic example of a decent MMO from the standpoint of it's own franchise and is a good example for at least me of how you should make MMO games. I'm looking forward to seeing how it evolves in the future and what happens after the entire Tamriel area will be playable!"
Positive,The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited is one of the best MMO's I've played. It gives you so many things to do and the PVP is just awesome. I've been playing this game since July 2015 and till now I am still playing it. The thing that I like about ESO is they are always working on something new. They will be launching their 3rd DLC on March. I highly recommend this game :D
Positive,"ESO has such an awesome community. I especially enjoy the quality of life components to this game that make end-game content accessible to casual players, with limited time, in comparison to most other major MMOs. The lore is rich, witty, and immersive, and the in-game world is enormous, with terrain and scenery for every flavor of preference."
Positive,"The combination of a bad 1.0 version and the fact that some people still can't get their heads around accepting this is its own game (and not Elder Scrolls VI) causes it to get a lot of undeservedly bad criticism. I haven't played all that much of it yet (36 hours isn't enough time to really gauge every aspect of an MMO) but it is, in its own right, a brilliant game, even when approached solo. The devs have done a fantastic job of listening to their players, acknowledging their faults and fixing problems, and I think it's about time that people gave this game a chance."
Positive,I absolutely love TESO <3
Positive,"I played it a little, it was fun"
Positive,This game is one of those things that you hate but you keep doing and doing. Addictive piece of shit. But that's the definition of every MMO out there - you despise everything about it yet you keep playing because you are having fun. Fuck zeni and beth and fuck this game. But the only better MMO currently is WoW which requires subscription.
Positive,"I think I like it.  It really is one of the Elder Scrolls now, not just a Elder Scroll-esque WoW clone like it was in the beginning.  Now there are areas that wisk me back (or forward?) to the prior single player game environments.  The Morrowind zone is insanely reminiscent of TES3.  Even the Daggerfall zone is varied enough to remind me of the my first adventures in this universe in Daggerfall (TES2).  My favorite part is that they have kept a lot of the lore spot on, and even the ""variations"" are interesting.  The most current Chapter - Greymoor, has a very good version of Blackreach, nodding it's head to Skyrim (TES5).  There is plenty to do, so much so, that I have been unable to complete all of it so far.Find some friends, and jump in.  ESO is fun for many types of players."
Positive,"This game is good for your mental health problems. and Here I will leave the cat, whoever pass by can pet it　　　 　　／＞　　フ　　　 　　| 　_　 _ l　 　　 　／` ミ＿xノ　　 　 /　　　 　 |　　　 /　 ヽ　　 ﾉ　 　 │　　|　|　|　／￣|　　 |　|　|　| (￣ヽ＿_ヽ_)__)"
Positive,"It's a really great game if you like the Elder Scrolls franchise, just don't expect Skyrim v2. If you like the TES franchise a lot but don't like MMOs, you can perfectly play through the story for many, many hours and enjoy the content on your own. The other players running around may or may not break the experience a little, but for me this is not an issue.This game isn't exactly like a regular TES game: you pick a class and you have class-specific skills and weapon-specific skills. The possibilities of class/armor/weapon/skill are endless: want to play a robed healer with a mace and a shield? - go for it. Want to play a heavy-armor mage with a twohander? - go ahead. I'm not saying this is optimal play, but it is certainly doable and enjoyable.Like in the traditional Elder Scrolls games there is level scaling, so you can ignore the main quest and level anywhere you want.DLCs are released regularly and they are adding more and more events (like halloween, christmas, ...), so there is new content on a frequent basis. This combined with no monthly fee makes this an overall great MMO. Some people have reviewed ESO negatively because content is ""hidden"" behind a paywall, but in all honesty the dlcs are only a fraction of the content and you have literally hours of gameplay with just the base game already. Besides that, the subscription and perks are really worth it if you play regularly: you get 1650 crowns per month, which is enough to buy 1 dlc on sale. Crowns are also on sale regularly so if you really want to just buy the dlcs, wait for a crown sale. Other than that, just buy the base game, play it and see if you like it and don't worry about dlcs yet.NEWS: Zenimax has announced that they will be making QOL changes to the load times and server stability in the next year.Pros:- In-game store is mostly cosmetic, not pay to win.- Overall friendly player base.- Very good soundtrack- Character customization- Amazing lore and storywriting- Good learning curve: new players can get around but each class/role needs to be mastered for optimal play.- Graphics are very good for an MMOCons:- ~80 GB storage needed- Load times can sometimes be long- Learning curve: while I like the learning curve personally, it seems to scare a lot of players."
Positive,"Well, shit. If it turns out I've failed this year's university exams, it's this game's fault.[EDIT: The above is still true, but now the game crashes more than a las Vegas whore on a good day out. At least 1 crash every 10 minutes, usually more. Every new update = more frequent crashes. Great game, if you can handle that.][EDIT 2: They fixed the crashes!]"

Positive,All I want to say is if you're not sure the game is going to run that good dont buy it. Why? Cause the patcher is going to take so long that the 2h for refund is going to be just on the patcher and if the game is not up to the your standards you wont be able to refund cause the refund system is really bad cause they don't actually read your notes but ok. Just a heads up.
Positive,"Good game, but be aware after the 60GB+ steam install once you actually start the game for the first time there is another 75GB+ to download. Not really sure why steam cant either have the full current content manifest in the install or simply pass the install off to the Zenimax loader which handles the extra 75GB.if you have no issues with that, and the game periodically seeming to corrupt its internal manifest wanting it to redownload everything, it is Excellent fun."
Positive,"ESO is probably the last mmorpg that is still going uphill instead of downhill. For starters, unlike most mmorpgs these days, ESO isn't pay to win(IMO, although some might argue that being able to buy the mount and storage upgrades is in a sense P2W, but like I said, to me that isn't P2W). I love how you can basically go into whichever build you want, except you can't change your class and for endgame you gotta follow endgame metas etc. but overall it is still pretty versatile. In a sense it reminds me of the good old mmorpg Mabinogi which was, to me, no doubt one of the best, if not the best, mmorpg during it's early years. Now it's just another P2W mmorpg. I definitely recommend ESO for anyone that loves the elder scrolls franchise and to anyone that loves mmorpgs."
Positive,"*** Ignore my time played on Steam, I have been playing on and off through beta and have a couple hundred hours clocked *** This is a great addition to the Elder Scrolls series for those who want a brand new MMO, it has a feeling of solo-play and multiplayer aspects that really help with people like me who sometimes like to be a loner hermit with no friends. The game has beautiful graphics and has had drastic changes since release. If you are thinking of buying this think to yourself: Are you an Elder Scrolls fan? If you are, then you should get it. I am an old school MMO player, I am one of the first 1000 in Runescape, played WoW on release through to WOTLK, played Guild Wars 2 and picked this up during the BETA. This by far has been my favourite MMO since Runescape 2001-2008."
Positive,"For the entry fee of 25 bucks, you have a lot of casual, fun content for you and your friends. I played about 30 hours solo content, 30 hours playing with friends, and both ways I really enjoyed it. Think of it as a slightly streamlined oblivion or skyrim, but never to the point that you feel your hands are tied. Its A great meat and potatoes rpg experience, would definitely recommend if you're looking for a game to play with friends of various skill levels and interests. Worst case ontario, you're slapping npcs that your buddy is trying to fulfill his quest with, screaming  ""khajit did nothing, khajit is innocent of this crime"" off into the sunset. Thats worth 25 bucks to me."
Positive,be aware highly addictive ...
Positive,"The best game I've played in many years, and I say that as a person with almost 8000 games in my Steam inventory alone."
Positive,"too many buyable collectibles for my taste (with little to nothing to collect by playing), pvp and pve are great tho,"
Positive,The best you could realisticly expect from an Elder Scrolls MMO.
Positive,Not usually an MMO player but really enjoy this game.  Felt a lot more like an Elder Scrolls game with other people.
Positive,I thoroughly enjoy this game and I would definitely recommend playing it. If you're worried about dlcs n stuff dont trip. Just buy things at your own pace cause you really arent missing out on anything if you start playing for the first time. 10/10 Fun game. 100/10 with friends if you got a group together. Screw pvp cause its just unfair >:(
Positive,"This game is my favourite game of all time. Great storyline, Great gameplay, Nice graphics, Friendly MMO. When i first started to play this game i thought mehh Im not sure if i like this or not but i stuck it out.... And im glad i did, Its the greatest game ive ever played. The gameplay is awsome, Finding new builds to play, meeting new players and helping out new players. Everything about this game is just epic. I would recommend this game to any body. So i hope this review helps"
Positive,"I used to be skeptical about the game like you, but then I took an arrow to the knee.Look, if you like playing MMOs and you also like Elder Scrolls lore.What the hell are you waiting for?Hop on mate."
Positive,A few months ago I would have said to save your money but it seems that ZOS is making some decent changes and trending more in a positive direction.
Positive,Every time I see a bookshelf in real life I start walking towards it so I can interact with it.
Positive,"The Mac version is actually playable again. Bugs abound still, but it's been usable and even pleasant. Performance is not quite on a par with the Windows version, but it's long improved over the last year."
Positive,"Good game, just don't go in expecting Skyrim"
Positive,Totally worth it! <3
Positive,It is a very story line immersive game to play if you are a fan of Elder Scrolls. Play style and skill system are somewhat unique and extremely versatile. As for group content is it quite broad the things you can do and keep you busy at all times. As you may all tell I do enjoy the game quite a bit coming from someone that has seen and played plenty of MMOs on that note this game is very similar to GW2 in the action RPG style which is another great game.
Positive,"After reading many reviews and being really turned off to the game I honestly didn't have any intention of buying it. However, I did. And every single review I had read was utterly wrong. This game is phenomenal! If you're expecting Skyrim, well it is not Skyrim. In much the same way Skyrim was not Oblivion, Oblivion was not Morrowind, Morrowind was most definitely not Redguard, Redguard was most certainly not Battlespire, etc.. etc.. Every Elder Scrolls Game has brought something new and different to the table, this game is no exception. I'll admit the overall main quest is not the best, however it makes up for it by throwing you into a very pivotal point in the Elder Scrolls universe. A good example of this would be in Skyrim the single player aspect was wonderful, the civil war however was not. You could have played Skyrim without ever noticing that a civil war was raging. In ESO the opposite can be said. I could go on and on. But with the new systems and updates to come I honestly do not see ESO being F2P anytime soon. If you're really on the edge about it wait until they offer a trial.*Now that update 3 has come out you can now dye your armor, as well as they now have Guild Shops. Which is more or less like the an Auction house!"
Positive,"I love this game! This game is not like WoW or any other game. The PvP is amazing and is even more amazing when you find a good guild to run with. The community is great as well is the economy.  Five reasons to get the game: 1. PvP is a great part of the game and is very fun2. Always something to do in the lands evern when you hit last lvl3. New things everywhere you go 4. Lore is wounderful in the game5. Constant additions to the game every patchFive reasons not to get the game1. $15 per month sucks but i dont mind if they put it into the game2. Broken class's3. Lag within the pvp zone4. Pve quest can get confusing when you dont know where to go sometimes5. There is bugs in the game but then again all MMOs have themI do think this game is worth it if you like skyrim and the other elder scroll games. BUT you have to keep in mind this game is still kinda new and is improving. You can have constan hours in this game and have fun. Everything is voiced and very nicely done. The $15 a month is kinda high but i think if they keep going in the direction that they are going this game can be real BIG on Pc, xbox one and Ps4."
Positive,"A friend and I decided to boot this bad boy up. We skip tutorial obviously, not our first rodeo. Within the first few minutes we decide to see if we can hit NPCs. Yeah you can, now we're outlaws and we don't want to give up our stolen goods that we pillaged off a dead little villager. We sit in the outskirts for roughly 2 hours begging players who pass by for some chump change to pay our 30 gold bounty. finally we get enough cash FOR ONE OF US. Plan was, I come clean, do quests, he gets gold from quests, cleans his name bang boom we in it. I do quest, he gets clean. He does quest that I already did. we don't like game. He snaps because he spent money on it. Runs into an INN and continuously slaughters every NPC that spawns. He now has a bounty in the thousands. I'm standing their in awe at the bloodshed before I finally decide I have to put him down. I challenge him to a duel and luckily the lag is on my side. I finish him off unscathed as I teleport around. His character lays dead in the middle of an inn with a giant bounty. Even if he gets revived he has to fight his way out or go to prison. He chooses uninstall."
Positive,Bethesda continues its trend of enthralling elder scrolls fans with this game ! A Marvel !
Positive,"As a 15+ years of MMORPG player (I spent a life time of a cat on WoW), this one is my all time favourite. I have witnessed the developement progress of the game year by year, and the point it has achieved is beyond what I have expected compared to its launch. If you are a MMORPG fan and haven't tried ESO yet, you are missing a lot!"
Positive,"I can only compare this to Wow as I spent a lot of time in wow and loved it - until it became so much of a grind and the hours I spent aquiring aritfact points form my toon became useless because they nerfed it to the point is was unplayable and there is no respeccing or just finding another weapon.The daily grind - OMG how many times can you do the same things over and over again???Overall, I would rate Eso A  buy and would recommend it. It can be played by those looking for solo non group type players that don't usually do MMO to those who want large group activities. However, give it a chance and learn the intricacies of trying to decide what skills you are going to choose and morphs of those skills you have to choose from. Are you going to  be a nightblade who stealths and has dual wield daggers or swords with a bow back up that uses stamina (strength) or are you going to be a nighblade who uses magic and a staffs. Any class can play almost any position though some play it better than others. You can be a mage tank if you build it right. Do some research and save yourself some gold from respec's.Sometimes, it's more of a challenge if you have only 12 spots (6 per weapon) and so many choices available that you have to  make some difficult choices for  combination you will use to play that build well than having 12 buttons to push in the right sequence that every player who plays that class will push in the same sequence and all they have to work on is timing.Crafting: The crafting system can't be beat IMO. Who would've thought. Crafting things that your main can use and not just your alts and not having to have multiple alts to craft all things. Though having a couple is nice so you don't have to put all of your skill points into being the best at every craft.Other notes:  I thought I would miss flying. Nope, wayshrines get you from point A to point B in a blink and you don't have to fight your way through a ton of mobs. (most of the time) to get to one. or just make sure you get the quest for your free inn room and telport there for free from any where in the game for free if you aren't near a shrine.  Also, If you play, you WILL find gemeplay easier with some addons, check out minion and youotube. The gold one tamriel verson and a subscription of about 15 dollars a month will give access to the base game and all dlc's including my favorite of the theives guild skill line as well as the bottomless craft bag and OMG are there hundreds of crafting ingredients you can collect as you don't have to ""specialize"" in one. No need to buy the individual DLC's.My wish list for this game:  A very strong wold boss that takes a large number of people to take down with the chance at some rare drop. (similar to WOW world bosses. they did get that right)A PVP area/scenario that places people of similar skill point levels against each other so that a non champion level player can have some pvp fun without being totally outclassed by somone who's played the game for 4 years. the capture the moving objective point is actually a very fun idea."
Positive,"Verdict: cautious recommendation. Buy it if it's on sale, but not at full price (for now, at least). Upsides:+ Art: Environment Design is mostly up there on par with Skyrim (and sometimes even more imaginative, as devs were not afraid to use the vertical space to their advantage). Textures are generally nice, though they could use an optional ""HD texture pack"". Though I also understand that said pack would make the installation weigh more than a hundred gigs, and would be a nightmare to update. Lighting system is quite impressive, and lits the interiors way better than, say, Skyrim engine would, shadows interact with lights in numerous ways and are always dynamic - all this results in a remarkable picture, even if some shaders are a bit basic.+ Script: I can safely say that I met a whole lot more memorable characters in TES:Online than I had in TES5. Apart from defined characters, a good dose of humour is applied even in some dramatic situations, like, for example, when you meet a vampire cat /ahem, khajiit/, who tries to save last few villagers from being eaten alive, and she is distracted by a thought of yarn. In spite of some players crying ""DEY BROKE DA LORE"" ""DEY RUENED DA ALDUR SCRULS"" I didn't see many violations, more so considering how inconsistent the 'canon' lore is. Cyrodiil still has no jungles, but that has more to do with Bethesda's decision during TES4 development than anything else. The so-called 'Main quest' is used more like a plot device in order to explain some events in the game world, though it does have its bright moments too.+ Voice-over: the amount of dialogue is immense, and it's fully voiced in its entirety. While there are few characters, who will make you cringe (that last Ayleid king, urrrgh), there are more than a few splendid jobs (even Sheogorath, which is not voiced by the original actor, but is still totally fine).+ PvP as idea: Having a full-fledged war with melee weapons, siege machinery and thousands of participants - looks great on paper. Too bad that this concept is undermined by balance and stability issues. More on those below.+ UI modding system: TES5 had a fair share of UI mods (mostly due to its UI being console-oriented in the first place). TES:Online supports this kind of mods as well with per-character settings, so if you don't like something about the interface, there's generally ""a mod for that"": mini-maps, map markers, HUD overhauls, trading helpers, combat macros and whatnot.+ Amount of content: while you have to choose your starting (""home"" so to speak) faction, you'll eventually get access to the zones of other factions as well. And it really does feel like three games worth of content (or time you spend on them at least).Now on to some YMMW things (you might like these, you might hate these):~ Subscription model: it has its own upsides and downsides, huge upside being no teenage trolls spamming in chat or doing /playdead + /pushups on the town square (like they did in open beta). Downside being that by paying a fixed amount of money you won't necessarily get a steady amount of content (in fact, the only big content addition to the game was Craglorn). Arguably there's no better model choice - and most certainly I wouldn't want this game to become Free-to-Play.~ Character models: yes, mouth animations are finally added in Update 5, so people don't look like sock puppets. They still look like dolls, though. Just a pair of skin/eye shaders would work wonders here, but it seems like devs don't want to increase the budget even for close-up shots.~ Skillbar ala Warcraft 3: five skills + Ulti, with additional second bar after Level 15. Unlike in TES5, you cannot dual-wield a spell and a weapon. In fact, you don't actually have any spells. Instead you have abilities, which might or might not be magical, and may produce various types of damage or have other effects on you, your allies or your enemies. So in short, Warcraft 3. DEY RUENED DA ALDUR SCRULS. Yeah, right.~ Game is overpopulated: you heard it correctly, and no, it's not a LITERELY DED GAEM by any means. So good luck finishing any dungeon on your own - more often than not you'll get inside just to find half of it already decimated by players, who got in a few minutes before you. On the other hand, you'll have no issues with finding a party. Party will find YOU, comrade.And at last, let's discuss the flaws:- The world is static. Your actions may have only a few different outcomes: a) enemies disappear from the area b) enemies become non-hostile in the area c) area is not changed in any way. No crumbling cities, no dynamic objects (the about only example of those is sky anchor, which pops every 10 minutes in predefined places), game sometimes tries to mitigate it by sending you into 'fake' zone, which becomes a 'true' zone once you complete the quest and return to it. To be fair, the devs did use a few dynamic objects in the main quest line, but that's far too few.- Justice (absence of it). Second-era Tamriel is populated with communists. No possession, no stealing, no jails. From each according to his ability, to each according to his need. This also means no Thieves Guild, no Dark Brotherhood, no Morag-Tong. Devs promised to introduce this system in one of the upcoming updates, so this might change in the future.- PvP in current implementation: when it works, it's an okay experience. You deploy siege machines, employ cover-up and deceit tactics, ambush the reinforcements et cetera. The key is 'when it works'. Game uses several servers (called Campaigns), with most players going to Thornblade. It's almost always population-locked on evenings, but that's not the main concern. Once you get inside, be ready to meet the almighty LAG. While the in-game counter breaks upon latency >1 s, the actual lag spike in >30 x >30 battles may freeze everyone in place (while you still can move around, that's an illusion made by lag compensation system) for up to several minutes. Thus taking any given fort may become an impossible feat even with prevailing forces. Currently some guilds have decided to just ditch the Thornblade and play on alternative servers. Though those might have some lag spikes time-to-time, but not any of same scale as Thornblade. Again, devs promised to fix these issues in upcoming updates, but until then this remains a flaw.- You can't make a bad guy character. Also, you have a choice. But really, you don't: this probably applies to the last two TES games as well, but yeah, it still is a flaw. Your choice is in most cases reduced to dialogue options before being given a reward, and generally only decides if that one character will greet you upon your final appearance in the current zone. Again, nothing out of ordinary for TES series, yet still.- Autoleveling (absence of it). Okay, the TES4 was disliked by many for this, but TES5 used autoleveling to its advantage - if you go into a cave at Level 50, be prepared to meet bandits in glass armour or Draugr deathlords. In TES:Online if you go to, say, Glenumbra, to do some quests you missed, while you are already past Level 20, you'll find it extremely easy. In fact, many do miss the 'Bad man hallows' public dungeon, and when they return from the next zone to complete it, players just molest everyone inside. Another example: you completed every available group dungeon and played a few evenings in PvP zone. Then you return to usual questing and discover, that you are 5-6 levels above than the quest enemies/rewards. This means you get little to no items/experience for your activity, and basically robbed yourself of potentially good items, as they don't drop if you're more than 5 levels above your victims. The last update did fix some of the leveling issues, mainly with solo/group-only content."
Positive,"Been waiting a long time to purchase the game via steam FOR MY STEAM DECK when it's on sale. I own it already as standalone from the original website so I wanted to make sure it's not totally wasted money if it doesn't work for my steam deck.It does work perfectly for the steam deck even though it's not verified. Linked my standalone account with my steam account which leaves out the annoying logging in at the beginning of the game. It's the complete same game and save like it was standalone meaning nothing I purchased or looted is missing or what so ever. Had no issues jet and much fun already. For everyone who is considering to buy teso for their steam deck and is searching for an answer if the game actually works, or is afraid of loosing his game progress when buying the game a second time. Because you can not find any useful information about it:TESO = STEAM DECK VERIFIED"
Positive,"I don't get the negativity surrounding this game (other than a few issues that people have been having). The game is an absolute blast, and it's the BEST MMO I've ever played in my life. Hell, might even be the best Elder Scrolls game I've ever played.Just the base game ITSELF (which often goes for like $10) gets you around 600 hours of PvE content and that's if you only do quests and PvE events such as delves or world bosses. If you get into dungeons and trials that's probably another 200-500 hours right there depending on how much you like it. If you get into crafting, you're probably looking at another 500 hours (seriously, it's insane).If you get into PvP that's a whole other story, you can probably spend thousands of hours on PvP. The main PvP mode in this game essentially drops you into an entire continent with hundreds of other players that's filled with forts, villages, elder scrolls, and towns controlled by each faction. Think of Skyrim but every town and fort and village are capture points for the multiplayer mode. That's how big this mode is. And all of this is without DLC.Seriously, if you're a fan of Elder Scrolls or MMOs or even questing in RPGs, you need to play this game. I've never seen a game more packed with content than ESO."
Positive,"It is unfair to write a negative review for this game. I am 2700 hours in, still stumbling into new delves, finding new skyshards, travelling to new locales, doing crazy quests, getting new builds, trying new characters and classes.As for learning the slightly complicated mechanics of the game (Combat, CP system, builds, armour sets, motifs, Antiquity system, Crafting system), I highly suggest watching the Youtube channels ""Hack The Minotaur"", ""Skinny Cheeks"" and ""Lucky Ghost"" for new and veteran players alike!**Review Update 1/11/23**Endless Archive - This is a concept I am very familiar with as I did 3-6 hour endless runs regularly in Warframe. I do not like how it is executed in ESO. A) The difficulty progression is too steep. It could've been good without the Tho'at Replicanum levels. It doesn't feel ""Endless"" at all. I was expecting a less steep progression of enemies.B) The progression of rewards in relation to the difficulty, I don't know, its non-existent. I got 400 gold for doing few hours. It should've been 50K-100K atleast!!! After slaying hundreds of Trial minions and tens of DLC Dungeon bosses, Endless Archive Master Malkhest rewarded me with Saltwater bait, Empty Soul Gem and like 400 Gold and some buffs to be used in this mode. Its unreal how bad the rewards are. Who gives empty soul gems as the reward for their endgame mode!?The amount of effort put in was worth 50K Gold, Repair Kits, Filled soul gems, 1 Gold upgrading material, gold motifs, purple food, gold recipes etc etc etc. the reward pool is so bad. C) The traders in the Archive Index have the worst inventory ever. Again, for an endgame mode, the store has items that don't even make sense to me. Anyway, I wont write it all out, I just wont play such a tedious grind for saltwater bait, empty soul gems, 400 gold, and memento parts from traders, utterly disappointed."
Positive,"Let me preface this by saying I am really hard-pressed to enjoy a RPG for any significant length of time, as I typically prefer shooters. I am also someone who loses interest extremely easily. That being said...I have had this game installed for two weeks and have five and a half days of active, in-game playtime (215 hours is because I forget to close the launcher & tend to leave it up even when I'm not playing). Aside from some issues when I first started playing that resulted in the servers being down (they had just released the new expansion when I stated), I have had an absolute blast and my interest is not waning in the slightest.For me, ESO is wonderful because I'm partial to MMOs, be they shooters or otherwise - I have a great preference for playing with other people. The community in ESO is friendlier than I have encountered in other RPGs (and everyone knows shooter communities are cancer) and I've always been able to find someone willing to help or give me pointers in the event I can't find something online. However, I also really enjoy ESO's solo-play. It's engaging and I have actually found myself curious about the lore and storyline where I have never had an interest in any Elder Scrolls game before.Graphically the game is beautiful, even on the lower graphic settings, and I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the system requirements for the game are as low as they are (I had expected them to be much higher). I also really enjoy the fact that I was able to play comfortably without all the DLC.If I had to point out a few negatives, I'd say the servers could be better - the random loading screens get really annoying, and the length of time for maintenance leaves quite a bit to be desired.Overall I'd give the game a 7/10 and would highly recommend the game."
Positive,"After 1600h Iam still enjoying this game. I love the vast majority of landscapes, the good interaction with other players and the Dungeons are fun too. Both in terms of PvP and PvE this game excells in my opinion and I always have a great time playing it."
Positive,"The best MMO since early WoW days.I can't remember having this much enjoyment in an MMO since early WoW.  Let me just briefly describe why in point form...1)  The world of Tamriel is huge, and between the 3 factions (each having their own areas, but eventually you can cross over) there is plenty of questing, exploration, dungeons, and other secrets/goodies to find.2)  Every single NPC is voice acted, with mostly interesting narrative that plays into a bigger plot line for your faction.  This means the days of kill this, collect that are over.  While questing is relatively similar to most MMOs in that you do need to still kill or collect something, it's done so in a way that falls into a bigger quest-line with a background story.3)  The UI is simple, and doesn't get in the way of your adventures, yet includes most of the functionality you need.  If you want more, there are add-ons for those end-game enthusiasts who need every stat and percentage displayed for them.4)  The classes and skill system play out in a way where any class can wear whatever armor they want and wield any weapon they want, but have class-specific skills to complement it.  Want a 2H heavy armor sorcerer with storm magic or the same 2H heavy armor Orc Dragonknight with draconic powers and defense mechanicsms?  This makes the combos limitless.5)  Progression.  This game feeds on your eagerness to progress in so many ways.  Great for completionists or those looking for more challenge.6)  Crafting.  This is the first MMO in a while that made crafting fun and rewarding.  I won't go into specifics, but if interested, look into how cool the crafting is in this game, and the rewards sought after by many players, even end-game.7)  The world and exploration.  One thing that awed me when WoW first released back in 2004, was the world everyone loved had come to life, and you can find things that made fall in love with it even more.  Well in ESO, the exploration of hidden tombs, locations of interest, delves, dungeons, towns, etc. has the same effect.  Not to mention the amount of lore, books, notes, and scrolls that come with the other elder scrolls games.8)  Combat.  The combat is pretty close to that of Guild Wars, but enhanced in the art of blocking, dodging, and prioritizing the use of your magicka/stamina in battles.  Gone are the days of auto-atk and standing in one spot mashing buttons, yet this game also eliminated all the boringness of mashing hotkeys while running in circles like other modern MMOs.9)  Social aspects.  You can belong to 5 guilds for multiple purposes like socializing, trading with guild auctioneers, PvE, PvP etc.  Given the amount of guilds you can belong to, and one giant clustered server housing all players, there is enough social activity during most times while playing.  You can literally play in a group or solo and still feel like you are just a part of the bigger picture in the world around you."
Positive,"Probably the best MMORPG i have ever played. World is really well made, almost all game mechanics are pretty solid.Pros:- great graphic, probably best of all MMORPG´s and the world is good stylized- dynamic and action combat system, more like in singleplayer than a MMO, you can cover, roll, make counter-attacks and strong attacks- great quests, every quest is dubbed, there are choices and various interesting quest instances- a lot of combat and non combat skills, combat skills are leveling as you use themCons:- only five active skills + ultimate skill ( but changing weapon adds another 5 skills )- there are not base stats like strenght, intelligence etc- number of stats on equip are quite a low"
Positive,"Dragons! In your own homeland! What are you going to do?I've put about 800 hours into this game on Xbox, and despite moving to PC and losing all my progress, I'm still excited to continue playing. (And honestly, very excited to start over again.)For ex-Xbox Players thinking of making the switch: (copy+pasted from reply to a comment)ESO is, basically, the same game on Xbox and PC. The biggest difference is that any progress you made is not transferred over. The upside is that PC has access to add-ons, which are extremely helpful (and honestly the biggest reason I switched over.) There are pros and cons to switching or staying, but it really comes down to if you'd be okay with beginning all over again, with the added bonus of access to a lot of Quality of Life add-ons.I will say, though, that switching to PC from a base Xbox One, this game looks absolutely gorgeous. Again, just a little addition to everything else we get."
Positive,"So let's travel back in time to when the Elder Scrolls Online had a monthly subscription. At that time I REALLY wanted the game just because I adore the Elder Scrolls series, but the monthly subscription kept me from buying it straight away. So I waited...And waited. Eventually The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited was released, and the monthy subscription had been cancelled. I'm now a proud owner of this magnificent game.Graphics are beautiful!Gameplay is interesting (Aldmeri quest line is my favourite so far)And overall the community is really friendly.Buy this game, you won't regret it."
Positive,"One of the best Fantasy MMO's ever made (probably the best)! You won't find better quality in a MMO out there, but after all depends on taste."
Positive,"Ignore the release-era criticism. It's so fun. I'm obsessed with it and see myself playing it for years. Really the only MMORPG I've enjoyed like this. For me, a perfect blend of Skyrim and multiplayer. And you can always play it your way."
Positive,I would DEFFINITLY recommend this game to anyone who plays mmorpg . it is a huge open world with LOTS todo and the graphics are amazing . gameplay just keeps geting better the quest lines you can follow and spend up words of 300 HOURS on the quests alone the PVP is one of the best pvp games a game has ever done i love how you can actualy break into the castles and you have to deffend its really somthing unique . and it still really feeels like you are playing an elder scrolls game which was my first worry about geting a mutiplayer elder scrolls game but they accomplished it all!
Positive,"Awasome game! The game was not so good in it's first days but today is totally better. Good artwork, exciting PvP, lots of dungeons to explore, lots of things you can do, very good story and the crafting system is, in my opinion, the best compared to the games of this gender. The problem is that the new update ""One Tamriel"" got the storyboard kinda messed up. Since you can go wherever you want in Tamriel, and you're, like, IN THE MIDDLE OF A WORLD WAR. :v"
Positive,"It's not exactly what I was hoping for, but this game is still a hell of a lot of fun. I didn't want to buy it in the past because I was expecting it to be dissapointing but it's rather enjoyable.You want the short answer:If you like Elder Scrolls and you want to play a fun game with other people, get the game. They're removing the monthly $15 fee on March 17th so you'll only have to pay $60 to play forever, or during a sale you could get it for cheaper (I got it for $20 during the Winter Sale). All in all the game is very enjoyable.You want the long answer:Keep in mind that this is not ""omg it must be liek skyrem 2 butt onlien!!!"", this game is not exactly like Skyrim. Every TES game is different from the last, ESO is just as different in comparison but it's MMO nature changes the game a little more. A lot of the bad shit you heard about the game in the past has been fixed and the game is worth the money now considering you don't need to pay a lot. They fixed a lot of the bugs and the game has all in all been improved a lot.They haven't introduced as many new zones recently as I had hoped for, but these things take time of course. The province of High Rock is almost to be fully completed with the Wrothgar (Orsinium) zone planned for release. The only other province in all of Tamriel (the world in every tes game) to be fully completed is Valenwood. The game is also larger than any previous TES game, excluding Daggerfall and Arena which were mostly randomly generated. It's an MMO, every MMO still adds on to it's world.The graphics are great actually. Auridon is beautiful to see and the game isn't very hard on computers. I don't have the highest specs (2.3 Ghz, 16 GB RAM) but I can run this game at a steady 45 FPS on high/ultra settings. Don't get me wrong, it takes like 50 GB space for files considering it's huge size. Cyrodiil is said to be pretty laggy, as it's a PvP dedicated zone. Tons of battles cause some lag, but for the most part the rest of the world is fine. Game mechanics are easy to adjust, there's a button for everything and it's very user friendly.It's not moddable. What the fuck did you expect? It's an MMO. Don't get your hopes up, you can get addons. You can just visit ESO UI, download the file and put it in the addons folder, simple as that. Zenimax (the game devs) made it super easy to get addons. When your run your game there's even a built in options menu for addons and you can just toggle them on and off in game, really easy to use. Addons can also enhance graphics as much as you want if you have a high end PC.From what I've experienced, the whole player interaction thing isn't the best. Everyone is always at a different point in a quest unless you're doing a team dungeon. Still, you fight the same monsters at the same exact time so no matter where you are, the enemy is the same. You also have to walk up to a player and click a button to interact with them; this can get a bit tricky if they're moving around a lot. Trading is decent, guild stores everywhere, addons to help you find prices, people selling stuff in the chat but not spamming it, nice community.Extra features are nice to have. Sure, there's no player housing or appearance changing (after you've made your character of course) yet, but they're working on it. Fishing is great, other games had it where you fucking had to walk into a river and swim to find your enemies. Now you can get easily acquirable fishing bait and reel in some nice catches and it's not even a loss if you get something bad. Dyeing system (no, not dying system) is also great. You can die your armor fabolous pink or an odd shade of yellow in multiple places per piece, and it's pretty fun. You can't buy more colours and you can only get more by unlocking achievements, which is a pretty good system. The variety of crafting is amazing, from food to potions to woodworking to blacksmithing, you can do everything.The combat system is better than any other Elder Scrolls game. Arena, Daggerfall, Redguard and Morrowind's combat systems sucked. Oblivion and Skyrim's were much better, but by far ESO is the best. The abilities and hotkeys are easy to use and user friendly, it's a much needed improvement we've finally gotten.The developers are also amazing. They'll answer questions in videos, blogs, or even AMAs. Sometimes they play with people in game too. They keep the fans updated and give them news via twitter/blogs. They even have a PTS (Public Test Server) which can be used to test new content, and it's completely free and availible to all players.I'll just try to list down some pros and cons now.Pros:Going F2P soon on March 17th, all you'd need to do is buy the game onceFun game, you don't get boredNice useful/fun features you can use (armor dyeing, crafting, fishing, etc.)It's MMO nature doesn't bring it downHuge world to exploreNot harsh on computers and easy to runEasy integration of addonsBest combat system out of any Elder Scrolls gameGreat communtiyMegaservers instead of a bunch of small servers, meaning you can meet your friends anytime anywhere.King Kurog has a nice buttCons:The PvP zones can be laggy.Immersion is an issue considering everyone is said to be the special ""hero"" and NPCs will act like they know you even if you haven't done the previous questNo mods/singleplayer modeNo Australian/Asian/South American megaservers, limited to just North America and Europe.If you're a fan of the TES series or just a regular RPG fan, I recommend getting this game, though you're better off waiting for the Spring/Summer sale for it to lower it's price."
Positive,"Feels like I am ready to throw my review in here already, haven't seen all the content in the game though. So, first of allm this MMO is not a typical MMO which you used to know. I truly believe that there is no point in comparing this game with WoW, Guild Wars 2 or some other MMORPG games, cause this one is more like a fan message to all Elder Scrolls fan in general first of all. For me, this game is like a next Elder Scrolls game, first of all and online is just like a bonus for it. I can't even imagine someone playing it, without knowledge of the original games. So, basically, this game is a must buy for all Elder Scrolls fans first of all.Speaking about game itself - I really like the whole mechanics of the games, especially leveling part. I had a lot of fun leveling my Nightblade, the main trick in this game that you don't have zone restrictions, based on your level or gear score, or whatever bullshit you have in another MMORPG games, you can do wahtever and whenever you like, solo or with your friends, beginners or veterans and its a major plus. You can join your friends anytime you want without any need in wasting tons of hours leveling your character. And its awesome, I believe. Cons of this game.I would like to say about grind. But once again - if you enjoy elder scrolls - you will never feel like grinding in the game, you will enjoy it. Plus, its MMORPG, can you name a single MMORPG game without any need in grinding? I can't. So, it's not a con tbh. Another con is graphics which is really outdated, so if you are really one of those kids, who put graphics in game more than anything else - you should move on, ESO is definitely not about the graphics.    The whole conclusion of my review is that if you are a big fan of Elder Scrolls series and used to spend thousands of ours exploring Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim in your childhood - grab it with no doubts and prepare to explore and spend even more!"
Positive,"This game is absolutely stunning. I never played prior to the update, but that doesn't matter. Elder Scrolls Online gives you a fairly unique MMORPG experience. I, having played Runescape for the past 8 years, can not get enough of this title. The fighting is fun and upbeat, the quests are very diverse (I believe there are 3 entirely unique storylines) , and crafting is a very useful little game of it's own, requiring you to hunt, gather, craft and enchant. Leveling up is by no mean easy or quick, and there are 50 levels availible in the PvE mode. I myself have not messed with PvP, but it looks absolutely incredible. The reigon of battle is about 10 square miles and battles go on for hours, games for weeks. The game itself is unbelievably immersive as you will find exploring deserts, jungles, etc. It is also fairly easy to run, being able to run on most low end PCs with relative ease. Be careful, though; MMORPGs are not by any means for everyone. Patience is very important as is knowing what's going on, and in this game it also requires signifigant attention as opposed to something like Runescape. There are seldom bugs from what I have seen, though my game crashes very, very occasionally. There are some things missing that they need to add, like Group Members on the compass or Dragons, but the game has extraordinary potential and will be recieving a lot of DLC to come. It is also important to note that with the huge game itself, the server is huge too, and the game is likely >100GB at the moment. Overall, I give this game a 9.5/10. I find myself very attracted to this game, although someone like my brother would give a 6/10 as he dislikes MMORPGs. If you have enjoyed any games like Runescape, WoW, RotMG or even another Elder Scrolls game, I can't recommend this enough. Good luck in Tamriel."
Positive,"After hearing some horrid things about this game I came in with very low expectations, but even so, I was tremendously surprised of how excellent this game is.+ Absolutely not your standard WoW carbon copy, it goes its own way+ Exploration is ingenious. Don't except to find a quest hub with 20 quests.. Go out and explore instead!+ Great and varied combat system+ Immersing quests and atmosphere+ Excellent graphics+ Excellent sound and music- Even though the ""Elder Scrolls compass"" works ok I'd really like a minimap out of the box (there are addons though)- The limited action bars might feel a bit clunky at first glance- Hard to keep track of your outgoing and incoming damage (no scrolling combat texts)With no subscription fee, this game is a must for anyone who likes mmos or anyone who likes games like Skyrm."
Positive,"I am a big fan of World of Warcraft, and I enjoyed Skyrim for the short time I played it, but the game did not hook me. This game feels like the perfect blend of both. It is an expansive feeling MMO with plenty of people running around the world and fun quests to complete, but what stood out to me was the combat. This is the most fun I have ever had fighting in an MMO. It's incredibly dynamic with the ability to dodge, block, interrupt, and fight back in a way that feels incredibly involved and not just clicking out a rotation. The game itself looks beautiful and have so many gorgeous landscapes and cities. The voice acting has some great members on the cast. I never finished Skyrim and while I own Oblivion and Morrowwind, I have yet to start them, but this game got me excited about the Lore and I now really want to dive back into Skyrim and the earlier games because I care about this world after seeing more of the history of it. I strongly recommend this game."
Positive,This review is based on the free weekend experience. 11/6/2019 updated+Music+Launcher is beautiful+Worth 10 dollars+Voice cast+Jennifer Hale for president+No area with enemy levels (explore at will)+Controls are great+Does not seem buggy most of the time+Beautiful locations+Not a lot of internet lag+Fun community+Respawn+Map+/- Solo missions can be a pain in the a.ss- Lack of inventory space-No way to remote sell items or spawn a trader-Respawn at a shrine. Very far away from objective-A.I. cheats-Compass is a bit useless-Most game plots are lame-87Gb steam download / (60+GB download from launcher - game patches)-Huge download size-A time suck-Weapons barely do damage -Magic does more damage than weapons-In game ads for buying clothes and other items when logging back in
Positive,"I have over a thousand hours and have min maxed multiple characters, yet as a player I am still constantly unaware of what is going on. 10/10 good game"
Positive,"I've been an TES fan ever since oblivion and hearing that Zenimax online was making a Elder scrolls game online, I lost my sh*t! However, after seeing the bad reviews for the game I decided to wait a year, so the game could improve. I was so glad I bought the game in 2015! Great PvP, an amazing community with game-devs constantly keeping people updated, PvE questing with groups actually works now, and public/private dungeons are really fun! If you guys are interested in buying this game, make sure to have a friend tag along to! It makes the experience 10x better"
Positive,"If you are into grinding and the usual MMO mechanics, this game is definitely for you. If you are like me and absolutely hate grinding and repeating the same thing over and over, but like lore and story telling you might still have fun in this game.I know I certainly do!"
Positive,"I love the game world, even though it is such a mess sometimes and content locking (Kinda pushing you to buy a subscription after a certain point, whether its for new DLC zones or Crafting bag...) is awful.  I think there are things that should just be universal like upgrading mounts. If you upgrade a mount type or that specific mount it should be accountwide.  PERIOD.  I don't see why you should be forced at a ultimatum of 60+ days to upgrade one single stat to max for mounts, or pay 6k (I believe) to get to 60 on one stat.  It's incredibly predatory, though they have given away smaller DLCs and other content I still abhor that stance, using a slow mount vs your fast mount on your main for example is incredibly jarring and honestly downright awful.  Some stories are better than others but thats to be expected.  Just be aware of the marketing I guess, Since this was a monthly sub it sorta makes sense but it still suffers alot when something like SWTOR hands you old content for your sub and maintains a quite large playerbase, or other mmos which are making mounts universal or speed something that you can get ahold of a bit easier (case in point for WoW, which has lowered its cap for mounts by a INSANE amount and flight aswell to some degree.)  I understand there isn't flying in ESO and thats fine I just wish getting around didnt feel so sluggish.I only say I'd recommend this because you can seriously get lost in it, after all I do have quite a lot of hours and am returning after a few years to once again get lost in it."
Positive,"I love the Elder Scrolls. I have countless hours logged in Oblivion and Skyrim. Is ESO Skyrim Multiplayer? No. ESO is a generic fantasy MMORPG in Elder Scrolls paint, but it's a very good generic fantasy MMORPG in Elder Scrolls paint.ESO is going to look a lot like an Elder Scrolls game. In some ways, it feels like one, too. It's full of all sorts of Elder Scrolls stories and lore. If you like MMORPGs and you like Elder Scrolls, you're going to love ESO, absolutely.But, it has its drawbacks like any other MMORPG. Nobody can produce an ongoing MMO game with a Pay Once model. We pretend it can be done, but it can't. So there is of course a Plus Membership which will be highly incentivized and ESO does this by making the base game very tedious and limited without ESO Plus. Rather than just giving you benefits as a Plus Member; which they absolutely do give Plus Members cool benefits, they penalize base gamers in a few ways:1.) As you play any MMORPG you will typically collect Loot. Loot can include gear, consumables, collectibles, etc. And in my MMORPGs, you will have a crafting system for making your own items. ESO has a MASSIVE CRAFTING SYSTEM which is very easy to learn and enjoy. However, that comes with A LOT of Crafting Materials! A WHOLE LOT! And without ESO Plus, all of those tiny, weightless, limited-stack-size, items that you don't know what you need them for, but you know you need them eventually.... well they all count against your very limited player item capacity.So, ESO has an awesome crafting system in the base game, but without ESO Plus you will be drowning in the loot interface as you sort out all the crafting materials to keep your inventory usable. But, if you upgrade to ESO Plus all of those items will be automatically moved to an Unlimited Storage Bag, making the game experience enjoyable and simple.(Minor Gripe: the Inventory Screen has a ""New Item"" badge that will appear every time you have a new item and haven't viewed it yet, and this helpful badge applies to the unlimited storage bag whether you want it to or not, making badge clearing extremely annoying if you're the type who feels compelled to clear badges. They really need the option to disable badging for the Crafting Bag or a button to quickly clear all badges in the Crafting Bag, IMHO.)2.) And this is debatable as ""a penalty"": with ESO's extensive map chock-full of ever-expanding DLC Zones, new stories, and new content, there is WAY MORE to do and see if you buy each DLC (very expensive now that so many exist). You can also get them in a very affordable way by buying a Chapter DLC package. Or, ESO Plus provides access to all of these areas. None of this feels like a penalty to me, just added value for your added money. But I just started playing ESO again and got excited about a new limited-time Public Event, and the quests and quest starters are all in DLC-restricted zones....so, I can't participate in limited-time community events as a Base Game player? It seems so.XBOX GAME PASS ANNOYANCES?:Unrelated to ESO Plus frustration, but something that may affect a lot of us PC players worth mentioning: I play games on Xbox and PC (mostly PC nowadays) and I maintain an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership which gives me loads of benefits on both platforms. If I play ESO on my Xbox, the Base Game is INCLUDED with my membership AND I have access to more game content than the PC Base Game (I'm pretty sure Game Pass gives me most of the minor DLCs for free on Xbox). Now that Microsoft owns Bethesda and Zenimax, I am surprised I can't access ESO through Game Pass or take advantage of any of my Game Pass Benefits, or play with my Xbox friends.I completely understand that this game was released for PC via Steam way before Microsoft/Xbox purchased Bethesda/Zenimax and I definitely understand not removing this game from Steam players. Absolutely, it should be here. But why don't I get my Xbox Game Pass benefits when I link my Xbox, Steam, Zenimax, and Bethesda accounts? And why must PC/Mac servers be separated from console servers, especially Windows and Xbox players? Is that really such a hurdle at this point with so many games being crossplayable?My PC is better than my Xbox One. The game runs and looks better on my PC. I feel like it's a better experience for me. But basically, all my friends are on Xboxes and I get far more value from my Game Pass Ultimate subscription on Xbox One.I still think this game is worth playing, and I keep coming back to it, but after I upgraded my PC instead of buying another new Xbox, I'm feeling a little annoyed."
Positive,"I accepted the game from the second attempt. Not only did I accept her, but I also fell in love with her, she became a part of me and my life. When I tried it for the first time, a friend told me that I need to farm as much as possible and to install add-ons which will help me with farming and all this in order to have a strong character. And he was right, but I didn't like that playstyle, I just felt like I was working for the game, so I uninstalled it . After a while I decided to give her a second chance and to play on my way and without add-ons, as it was created. I played it slowly, enjoying the quests, discovering the story and the beautiful landscapes of the eso world. Sometimes I spend the whole day just fishing on the rivers, lakes and seas of the eso world , sometimes I just ride a horse through unexplored beautiful worlds, and sometimes I just listen the street musicians in the town squares and how they magically touching my heart with musical notes. This game is no longer a game for me. This is my magical world in which I really exist thanks to my imagination. The Elder Scrolls gave me freedom. 10/10"
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online starts off in the 2nd era (thousands of years before Skyrim) and you're saved from coldharbour to defeat Mannimarco and Molag Bal from the planemeld, a daedric invasion that's taken hold of the entire universe.PROS:~The game setting is absolutely gorgeous, some of the sets and scales of the cities, the locations, the dungeons and the overall world often has me just standing in place and looking around.~Some of the questlines and characters intertwine with eachother and can make them even more memorable. The game might reference a previous questline or have the character go ""Oh, you again!"".~The people, from my personal experience, are very friendly and willing to help newcomers with some basics, including how to get money and what types of builds you should go for, so on and so forth. I think in my entire time playing, I've come across only one or two people that have been annoying or needlessly mean.~There is a ton you can do outside of even quests. You can go fishing, woodchopping, mining, harvesting, cooking, alchemy, enchanting, weapon and armor making, furniture crafting, thieving, jewelry making, explore dungeons, fight world bosses, even dance! I can spend sometimes spend 3 hours doing absolutely no quests, only exploring, harvesting, deconstructing, and selling recipes~Furniture and housing is quite fun. While there's a few unachievable houses that only exist in the crown store or on certain stuff, if you grind enough and get lucky, you can buy a decent amount of the modest houses, and apartment rooms provide a permanent free place to teleport in most big cities.~Outfits! You can build certain weapons and armor if you get the style pages, and at an outfit station, you can add them for gold.~The music overall is pretty good, especially the bard songs, there are the very occasional droning song, but they're often only temporaryCONS:~The PVP is just poorly implemented. There are three versions of PVP, battlegrounds, cyrodiil, and the imperial city. Battlegrounds is the only one that feels even remotely fair most of the time, Imperial city is pretty unfair feeling for most normal players, but I've only had one fun time in cyrodiil. Sometimes you come across players dozens of levels ahead of you that just eliminate you (Or if you're in the champion levels, hundreds or even over a thousand levels ahead of you) and you just die within 10 seconds. From what I've seen online, you have to build a SPECIFIC character and build for PVP, but even then it's unfair. In Cyrodiil especially, the daggerfall covenant is always the smallest and had maybe 2 forts maximum, the Ebonheart Pact is always struggling and often losing between daggerfall covenant snipers and the aldmeri dominion, and the Aldmeri Dominion almost always has at least 50% of the map no matter what. I might just be ""my build wasn't good enough"" but I feel like there should be servers after the under LV 50 mark that are just more segmented (50-500, 501-1000, etc.) ~Some of the items on the crown store stuff just feels inferior to some of the things you can get just from the game an seal endeavors or just feels overpriced. It isn't a surprise nobody really likes the crown store, but at the very least you can get the DLC there that can often be at a really good deal. My problem, namely, is the houses and some of the change tokens. To give an example, to buy an extra outfit slot so you can have another cosmetic look costs 1500 crowns, or about $15, the equivalent of a few of the dungeon DLC,  a couple of crates, or multiple pieces of furniture and clothing. I will say some of the DLC deals are a steal of a deal, but sometimes they're overly expensive for what you're getting~The game can fluctuate in difficulty, some bosses are insanely easy while some normal enemies can be a bit challenging. It's especially easy if you have friends.~I've had a few graphical glitches and such, but none that completely ruined the game or made something completely unfair.OVERALL RATING: 8.5/10I definitely wouldn't get it at $20, at least the base game. However, it feels like the game is constantly on sale for $6, or about $16 for all the big DLC included (except for the newest one usually), so when it's on sale, I would definitely get the one with all the big DLC, and if you feel like you're going to get hooked for a few months, I would get the membership for a month or so, it opens up ALL the DLC locations."
Positive,Elder Scrolls flavor in full effect!
Positive,"Since I bought this game, I don't have enough time to do anything else anymore. Best MMO right now to me. Good story quests, scaling system, stealing/killing citizens,...omg I can't list it all."
Positive,Pretty good game I guess.
Positive,"Good, entertaining game.......glad to see it's getting some positive reviews.   :)"
Positive,Worst Elder Scrolls game.
Positive,"I likes to steal stuffs. Would highly recommend to other dirty, stinky, criminals."
Positive,"И все-таки TES Online — это, безусловно, удача и успех. Она органично сочетает и увлекательную исследовательскую RPG, и масштабные онлайновые сражения «стенка на стенку». И при этом не сваливается в пошлый «фритуплей»: здесь не нужно платить за каждый чих, игра использует классическую систему подписки и предоставляет своим пользователям равные возможности. Ну а тем, кто безмерно критикует проект за отступление от канонов серии, стоит напомнить — вы все-таки купили игру, у которой в названии нет цифры «VI», зато есть слово «online». Делайте выводы и будьте адекватными!Моя оценка: 7.5/10"
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is a solid MMORPG, with content for hundreds of hours and playable with no monthly fees. Ultimately, this Tamriel Unlimited confirms to be the best edition for those who want to delve into the fantasy world created by Bethesda twenty years ago."
Positive,"Every singe quest is story rich with something unique to do in each unlike most mmo's which are filled with fetch quests and other boring crap . Oh and hey, every single quest in the game is completely voice acted by some of the top names in the industry!"
Positive,"I'll be short and straight-to-the-point: this game is the 2nd best Elder Scrolls game out there, with the first place being taken by Skyrim. But why have I decided to spend more hours in this game, rather than keep playing Skyrim? It's simple: because this is the best MMO game out there and I absolutely love it. I definately recommend you to buy (AND VOTE) for this game and if you choose to do so, hit me up if you wanna meet in game and play together!"
Positive,"""Im gonna be Hero who saves the world."" And couple days later i am an Argonian skooma addict."
Positive,I Have completed main story line and explored all the region waiting to complete the game 100 percent
Positive,"Very solid MMO. No subscription, Little things to pay for, whole ton of content."
Positive,"The best casual MMO around. Perfect for solo play and fun with friends, tons of content and just a really chill game to mess around with. Does this replace a proper single-player Elder Scrolls? Probably not, but it comes pretty darn close in my opinion."
Positive,"I think this game gets some undeserved flack. It's immersive, and if you approach more like a theme park and less like a traditional Elder Scrolls game, it does pretty well at being what it is.That said, I get the people who say this isn't for them. If you're looking for next-level depth, I don't think this game really delivers on that. What it does deliver on is activities that feel distinct in some key ways, but ultimately are just that - basic activities.All in all, I'd give this a Recommend because it's fun as a time waster or wanting to feel like you're walking around in an old fantasy town. As far as MMOs go, it's impressive. If you want more story, or something longer and more in-depth when it comes to certain activities, I'd suggest hopping over to FFXIV. I love both for different reasons."
Positive,"If you were expecting Skyrim online you will be disappointed. It's a good game if you like semi-open world exploration and is a great game for killing time. The skills can be a little confusing and you may just wander off into an area where the difficulty is 2x your characters level.This brings me to the second subject: Grinding, you will want to grind levels because the XP earned from sidequests is not enough to boost you into the next level, only problem is it takes forever. Story is pretty generic and the voices are recycled.Questing in this game is generally the same as most MMOs, but feels very different. Everything is voice acted and the quests are fairly easy to follow along. They actually provide a story to the quest and make it feel meaningful, like what you're doing will actually mean something and isn't just a means for you to level up.The fighting is fun and upbeat while crafting is a very useful little game of its own, requiring you to hunt, gather, craft, and enchant.The amount of new content coming towards this game is undescribable, you should all really check up on what's coming."
Positive,"I've played this game when it was fairly new way back when on my PS4 and I didn't like it. I bought this on the Summer Sale out of pure impulse and now i cant stop playing. No joke, this game is now all i think about. Tons of lore, lots of stuff to do.... Not to mention that the game is fricken HUGE! I mean MASSIVE! All of Tamriel is here! You can easily get sucked in. These are words coming from me, a guy who isn't an ESO Plus member. Think about that...."
Positive,"Bought this game after a friend of mine convinced me to. I was skeptical at first, as I'd heard all the bad press around it's launch last year and I didn't know how it had moved on. I did a little bit of research and found the general consensus was ""things have changed for the better try it"" I'm now 15hours or so in and I am thoroughly enjoying it. Of course I bought it for the MMO side, but the ""single player"" RPG style is brilliant. The content I've played so far is well worth the £50 I have spent and what's better is that there's no subscription fee. In my opinion, a must have for Elder Scrolls fans.Pros:-Great story with interesting side quests and detail to characters-All quests and NPCs have audio, the voice acting is actually a lot better than Skyrim and previous TES titles too-Beautiful landscape-Large world, covering the vast continents of Tamriel-Involving and meaningful character progression, each skill point seems to matter-No subscription, so if you need a break, simply put it down-Beautiful soundtrack-Crafting is actually decent throughout, with access to crafting easy enough and crafted armour/weapons better than questCons:-Large disk space. I think it's around 60gb, not too much trouble nowadays but watch out.-Quests seem to be very easy early on-No real scope for group play/levelling with friends in PvE (15hours in) You seem to speed past it even faster-They give you 60 bank space har har! This is a TES game, we are all horders!I would very much reccomend the game based on what I've played so far. I very much look forward to the PvP towards the end game, which I haven't had chance to sample yet. However the PvE questing content so far has been well worth the money.Give it a go!"
Positive,"This is a great MMO if you're looking for an MMO with a twist.  Unlike other MMOs this one has many elements that most others do not focus on.  For instance, like the other ES games, you can steal things.  Furthermore, certain quests allow you to make decisions that may have a different outcome depending on what you choose.  Also, you can make and use any weapons or armor you like, however you must learn to use the weapons (by using them and raising your skill) in order to unlock the weapon abilities.There are 4 classes: Tank, Mage, Healer, Sneak.  (They're not actually called these things, however, I used general terms to make it easier to understand what each of them actually focuses on.)You may be one of the 4 classes with each character you create, and each class has a different set of abilities you can learn.  You do NOT have to focus on class skills if you would rather focus on weapon skills (or you could mix the two), however, one of the biggest benefits of class skills is that you do not have to have a certain weapon equipped to use them, which is nice.Also this game is pretty action based.  Moving around is crucial, especially when facing bosses.  There is a dodge button, as well as block (and the push back block).  The way they set up mounts is also unique compared to other MMOs I've played.  Each actual mount has its own set of skills you can level up once per day for 250gold.  These skills are as follows: Speed, Stamina, and Carry Capacity (allows your character to carry more if that particular mount is assigned).  Each of these skills is maxed out at 60.Also, your bank is actually shared between all your characters.  This makes it easy for one character to give to another without sending something in the mail (which, so you know, you cannot send anything to yourself).  Mail also is shared between characters, as well as the guilds you choose to join.  I believe you may have up to 3 guilds at any given time.Selling items to players is only obtainable through guilds.  The guildmaster may buy a space at any of the guild trading zones, and all players of that guild may sell their items there.  You can access the auction house at the bank, but only, of course, if you're in a guild with that option.Of course, there's also selling items directly through trading, but that isn't quite as easy to do without ranting about the item in public.  Not exactly my style, but some people apparently like it.It is important to note that this game is not another ""Skyrim"".  If it were a one player game, they could easily make it as customizable as Skyrim, however, being an MMO, it has to be limited, otherwise the customizability would cause the world to become too chaotic...  No one would even want to play.It does have elements in it unique to the MMO genre, but you can't move everything or pick up things and throw them across the room.  You can kill civilians, but of course, they come back to life after a while.  Guards are not currently killable, so don't even try it.  They will ruin you.  If they come after you, RUN and hide as quickly as possible.  You can run into the thieves locations for a quick getaway, so make note of their locations in main cities before you choose to commit crimes.In the end, I really like this game myself.  For an MMO, it's definitely one I enjoy playing.  I look forward to seeing what they will choose to bring into the game next, and I give this game a thumbs up."
Positive,If you are new and using Nvidia there is an issue at the moment with current Nvidia drivers that wont allow game installation after the Java prompt.  Easy fix:  http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4378This issue drove me insane yesterday and a simple hotfix driver in the link above fixed those issues.
Positive,"Got that bethesda jank and really falls off with gameplay, but sweet jesus the community is hilarious and the amount of tomfoolery you can perform is beautiful. Expect rabies upon purchase, highly recommend."
Positive,This game makes me feel like I'm in Log Horizon  *_*
Positive,"Things you should know:1. Never played any Elder Scrolls game except ESO2. I am a total noob to any kind of MMORPG (ESO is my first)3. CPU: Intel i5 3570    GPU: MSI 760I love games where I can explore and follow a path individualized to my personality as a person, there are endless options to choose from as far as leveling up, choosing a race, abilities, alliances, armor, crafting and so forth to be what you want to be in this game.  So If you love adventuring, exploring, leveling up, and easy on the eye graphics you will enjoy this game. Take a look at my screen shots and see what you think, they are taken from live game play.  So far with 80.97 hours on game I have not encountered any kind of glitching except sometimes rarely my sword hits don't register. And my friend had to redo a Dungeon but in the end everything turned out alright and we just leveled up more anyways.  Overall if you are the same as me and are new to this experience take a breath and just enjoy the ride..."
Positive,"One of my favorite MMORPGs, endless content, constantly updated, and a really pretty game! the only thing I'd change is that you can't queue with friends for PVP."
Positive,Ive only put in a few hours compared to other people but this is what i have experienced.-Reached lvl 50 still no clue what im doing-Received sick ass lightning staff-Tested out lightning staff but hit civillian on accident-7 Guards surround me-I fight back and then realize they are 10x stronger than me-I accept my fate and let them slaughter me 12/10 Would zap civliian again
Positive,"An excellent representative of the MMORPG genre, I tried to start alone during Elsweyr, but it was not so interesting, but as soon as a couple of people joined me, the game was transformed at times. That is why I recommend starting to play with someone, otherwise there is a chance to throw the game. There are many activities, such as world bosses in some regions and mopping up waves of opponents in others, but it's not so easy to do it alone, but the online game is big and it's easy to find people for various events. The graphics are not of the level of modern AAA products, but at a fairly high level."
Positive,"I feel that i have played for long enough to be able to write a justified review for this now, and perhaps also explain some things that i wish i had understood when i purchased the game.When starting out it does feel a little odd, as it is different to what you would expect, but when you overcome that the game is incredible, the map is huge, and npc characters and quests are great, there are so many of them to keep you going, and it is so difficult to not get sidetracked in the middle of a quest, and go and explore the world. The community is great, something i fear may be destroyed if this game ever went free to play, which i really hope it doesn't, i am happy to pay for it.However, one thing i wish i had realised when starting was that you are limited to where you can go by the starting alliance you choose, so for example i started in the dagerfall covenant, so i am unable to go to Skyrim or Morrowind yet, however, when you reach Rank 50, or veteran rank, then you are able to unlock another area, so as i am in the daggerfall covenant, the next area i unlock is the aldmeri dominion, and then later on i can unlock the ebonheart pact. This is not a major issue, but it does perhaps try and make you rush so you can get into new areas. There really are no limitations as to how you want to play, for example, i am a sorceror, however there is nothing stopping me equipping heavy armour, and running around with a giant axe. or i could choose to try and be stealthy with a bow, something that if i wanted to do on another MMO, say WOW, i would have to create a new character.PVP is something i have attempted to do, however i feel i will have to become a much higher level before being able to make a real impact.Dungeons are great, and working as part of a team is extremely fun, also all loot is random so there is no loot stealing, as each player gets a different loot. The graphics are astonishing, and run really well. One issue could perhaps be that of distance, not view but attacking enemies, if an enemy is too far away, you will not be able to hit them, or if you draw an enemy too far away from where they originally were, even if you have almost defeated them, they could suddenly have all there health back and run off. Joining and creating guilds, with so many different people is great, and people are so helpful as well. I am finding it a little difficult to say how i feel about this without sounding extremely biased towards it, but thats the point im trying to make, so many people told me not to bother with this, others told me to play WOW or another MMO, but i ignored them, i tried WOW, and chose this instead. But seriously, just try it, even if not from steam and you buy the key somewhere else that is cheaper, grab it, and give it a go. After playing the beta i decided to wait a while before purchasing this, and during the beta we were provided with the opportunity to play as those who would purchase the imperial edition, so we had access to the imperial class, and a horse.If you are trying to decide whether to spend the extra cash and purchase the imperial edition, then what you get is a class that is more suitable for the role of a tank, specialising in sword and shield, with heavy armour. You will also recieve a mudcrab vanity pet, which serves no purpose other than to follow you round. Also you recieve a horse which is equivalent to the 15,000 horse in game, so the cheapest one, however it is white. Finally you have the choice to play as any race in any alliance, which could be good, but i prefer to play in the factions that are meant to be played by each race. Personally, i knew i wanted to be a Breton sorceror, specialising in conjuration, so i did not buy the imperial edition. But yeah, i love this game and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the elder scrolls."
Positive,"This game is AMAZING:+ enormous map+ superb views+ tons of mounts+ tons of pets (exotic, daedric, domestic)+ tons of skills, races, weapons, armors, classes+ build your character as you completely desire + tons of game content, tons added constantly as it seems, tons of dungeons, solo or group, arenas, public events + unexpected things happening as you walk by + super immersive and interactive world + npcs with amazing emotional stories that will reach you + stunning soundtrack++ vampire / werewolf+ huge ammont of players, made a lot of friends over the internet that I'm still in touch with via facebook, whatsapp+ beautiful mechanincs, physics, graphics, game runs absolutely smooth, can be played on lower end pcs, which is good+ pvp gives you a huge sense of achievement, massive amount of things to do+ it's a TES game - addictive - wouldn't really put this as a con, but you need research if you want to be good in pvp mostly and to complete an arena, you need to spend some time checking out build combinations of other players with more experience, but lastly, you need to experiment by yourself and find what suits you. Otherwise, if you just put skills on the skill bar which you think are good, and a cool looking armour with some decent stats, that might actually get you killed in less than 5 seconds in pvp as a let's say level 40, depending also on your opponent. There are tons and tons of combinations you can make, using traits, armour sets, enchantments, skill points and attribute points distribution, so many factors that some players master, some don't, which can make the game seem too difficult at times for someone relatively new to it. BUT DON'T GIVE UP ! Use the internet to see the possibilities you have, like I did, try builds that others made and tested, see how they work for you, make one for you, or more. - juggling with the two skills bars takes time to get used to, so that you can make the most of your build, but that's any mmorpg for you I guess- it will eat your wallet if you decide to spend on visual items, it's not really worth it, if you have the money and want to advance quicker go for it, otherwise teh game isn't p2w, you can get everything if you just play for longer than someone who paid"
Positive,"Love this game. Great graphics, awesome customisation of the character too. Its fun to wander around the amazing scenery on route to your next quest. Still have a lot to learn, but that's also part of the fun journey of levelling up. Am glad I watched a tutorial with beginner tips to help understand the basics."
Positive,">>Quests and Exploration>QuestsWhat I love the most about ESO, what no other MMO could've done so far.It's the story of the quests. Most side quests and the Main quest are just so interesting. All the conflicts in Tamriel and you are part of it. >ExplorationI really liked exploring the world in Guild Wars 2. ESO also has an exploration system and many Mini Events / Achievements etc. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->>Settings>Customizable The game lets you install addons very easily. This is an other feature that I never encountered so far in an MMO. You would like a Minimap besides your ESO compass? No problem, insert Minimap addon into the addon folder, done.>Video SettingI can play ESO with nice looking settings on my Main PC, while I'm also able to play it on my Low-Mid Tier laptop with no problems. The settings range from very low to very beautiful. So don't be afraid if you got a mid-tier PC / Laptop.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->Amazing solution for Micro Transaction / SubscriptionI've also never encountered an MMO with such an awesome solution about Payment. You buy the base game for a reasonable price. Ofc way better than the subcription system before. But they still got the Sub system. Subscribe and you get all DLC's playable for free while being a member, and get the same amount of ingame cash, like you would pay for the money. So while you pay 12$ per month for like 3 months, you can enjoy all DLC content, and as an extra reward, you would have enough money to buy the actual DLC for ever. This is amazing."
Positive,This game is as good as busting a nut.
Positive,every lizard-man has en erect spine
Positive,"The game is good, but... I'm not sure if it's because a lot of players are already at the late game and I just started out, but for as long as I play it, it feels like a single-player game to me. I don't see a lot of other players, and the ones I see either don't understand English or just plain refuse to communicate.Get it if you want another Skyrim and are not expecting to group with random people. It would be a plus if you get a bunch of friends to game together though."
Positive,"I played this back in beta and was not impressed at all. I thought there were so many bugs and that the game just wasn't very good.  That was beta at the time, but I had the impression that maybe it just wasn't to be as good as I wanted it to be. Skip ahead a year later, I got the sudden urge to try out ESO so I decided I would buy it, I needed a new game to play and become interested in. I'm so glad I went for it.  It's not often I find myself interested in a game and wanting to always play it. Most games I play for a few hours and come back to them a month or two later. But here I am, one month after purchasing it with over 200 hours. Any bugs I encountered during beta have all been fixed. Things I wanted to see get added to the game were added or recently implemented. No subscription also means I don't have to feel obligated to play this game and get my $15 a month out of it so I have the freedom to enjoy it whenever.  The world is huge, simple side quests are fun and enjoyable to do each with their own fully voice-acted stories.  The graphics are amazing, especially for utilization of the Hero Engine (WoW engine).  The crafting is unlike anything I've seen and has become one of my favorite things to do in the game. The amount of content there is in this game, race/class combinations, etc. have me wanting to play this game for a long time. I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface.My only complaint is that group-questing with friends could be improved. It seems like you have to constantly check with your friends and ask ""did you do this part yet? lol"" because I feel that if you're in a close proximity, if someone does something, it should register for everyone in group. There are few quests that follow this, and it is present in dungeons, but I'd like to see this for every quest in game as it would make the whole ""MMO"" experience a bit more fluid. Let's Bang OK/11"
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) is an absolute masterpiece that has captivated me from the moment I stepped foot into the vast and enchanting world of Tamriel. As a long-time fan of the Elder Scrolls series, I was initially skeptical about the transition to an online format, but ESO has exceeded all my expectations.The first thing that struck me was the incredible attention to detail in the game world. Tamriel feels alive and vibrant, with each region boasting its unique atmosphere and lore. Whether you're exploring the bustling streets of Daggerfall, delving into the mysterious ruins of Morrowind, or navigating the dense forests of Valenwood, every corner of the continent tells a story waiting to be discovered.The character customization and progression system are robust and offer a staggering amount of flexibility. From choosing your race and class to customizing your skills and abilities, ESO allows you to create a truly unique character that suits your preferred playstyle. The freedom to mix and match different abilities from various skill lines adds a layer of depth to character development that keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting.The community in ESO is one of the friendliest I've encountered in any MMO. Whether you're a seasoned adventurer or a newcomer just starting your journey, there's always someone willing to lend a hand or share an epic adventure. The cooperative gameplay elements, including dungeons, trials, and PvP, provide ample opportunities for camaraderie and teamwork.The continuous updates and expansions released by the developers demonstrate a commitment to keeping the game dynamic and engaging. From new storylines and zones to fresh gameplay mechanics and quality of life improvements, it's evident that the team behind ESO is dedicated to providing players with a constantly evolving and enriching experience.In summary, The Elder Scrolls Online is a triumph in the realm of MMORPGs. Whether you're a fan of the Elder Scrolls universe or a newcomer to online gaming, ESO offers an immersive and expansive world filled with epic quests, diverse landscapes, and a welcoming community. Don your armor, sharpen your blade, and embark on an unforgettable journey across Tamriel – adventure awaits!"
Positive,"Did you ever play WoW and wished it wouldn't be so boring levelling up? Welcome to the Elder Scrolls Online. It plays very differently from traditional MMOs in the sense that there are not quest hubs. This means that it is up to you to find and explore and by doing so level up. The combat is fantastic, there are no cool down timers. It is up to you to dodge, block, interrupt, cast, heal. It's very hectic and very fun, but also true to the Elder Scrolls Combat formula. Being able to play in first person adds immersion. The graphics are fantastic. All quest texts are voiced. The list goes on and on, in short I couldn't be happier with this game"
Positive,"I played the beta, and I found this game pretty boring. But almost a year after the beta, I thought ""why the hell not? it was just the beta, it was meant to be shit"", and I'm glad I came to that conclusion, because I do not regret buying this game. The Elder Scrolls Online is an awesome game, very thrilling and fun. Recommended."
Positive,"This game is so live, and it is one of the best mmorpgs i have ever played. Gearing up and questing is very enjoyable and pvp content is super fun. Pve is where I think the game shines, the raids and dungeons are very well made."
Positive,"Compare this MMO to others, I could say that this one has more content for solo/duo activities then others. A lot of activities are available, both solo and in group, here I could separate it in 2 categories:1. Sandbox, here you can do anything even solo: quests, story, guilds, pvp, exploring the world, dungeons, collecting components for crafts, discovering all collectables and doing achivements. 2. Advanced activities, here you will require a group to participate in it and they contain the most part of end game content: group dungeons, trials, arenas, etc.Some blame TESO for lack of PvP and high level activities, maybe they true, but for me this game succeed in other fields:+ Interesting story in quests, even smaller ones.+ Fun skill tree, that evolves in higher levels.+ A lot of casual content, especially if you are looking for a game where you can relax and just enjoy the process.+ Awesome and beautiful location to visit, including world of daedra.+ Movement here feels better then in other MMOs of such genre.+ Decent graphics for MMORPG.+ A lot of content for solo/duo.+ Interesting lore and universe, that tracks it roots from classic TES games, and only improve it.+ Auto leveling of mobs, you never find yourself too weak or too strong in any region.+ Support of custom modifications aka mods, includes custom interface, data on dps, etc.+ Each chapter includes some significant change to the game (jewelry, companions, vampires, werewolves, archeology, and much more).+ Events. There are many of them, and they are happen really often.+ Possibility to play either in 3rd person or 1st person.+ Pleasant music.Of course I must also list the disadvantages that I noticed, a lot of which can be applied to most MMOs, and ESO is no exception to them:- A lot of donate, some of those content you could get for ingame money, but it requires a lot of grind. - Some activities require a big group to complete, for example trials require 12 players in group.- Sometimes severs could lagg, I play in Europe, it happens rarely, but I saw people having a lot of problem with it, especially those, who play PvP.- Playing some quests with friend or a group could bug sometimes, it happens rarely but it is there- Small bugs, that just annoys sometimes.Many friends did not recommend this game to me (they are big fans of MMORPGs), but despite it I gave it a try, and I liked it. This game is different compare to other MMORPGs, so some could find this one really boring or lacking some of gameplay mechanics, that makes best game for them, while other could see in ESO the MMORPG that they seek for. This is purely my opinion, hope my review will help you to decide whether you want to give ESO a try or not."
Positive,"This game is great! Read more below. (1000+ hrs)Overall, great game. First of all, I don't like mmorpg, but this got me hooked. Best to play with friends! Solo = Not too badFriends = ExcellentStory = For me i didnt really follow it. But voice acting is good.Combat = Not too badCrafting = ExcellentGraphics = Not too badContents = BEYOND EXPECTATIONS"
Positive,"I have only started playing this game a couple of years ago, yet despite the time I have put into it, I still haven't gotten tired of it. I love this game! I am addicted to it!ESO Plus, their subscription, is not necessary to have to play the game, but will be essential to have if you want to do ALL of the crafting. Bag space is rather limited considering all the items you can get, though you can get more bag space by spending gold or crowns (which are basically micro-transactions). Now I normally hate games with micro-transactions, but I love this one. And its the only one I care for. It likely helps that most micro-transaction stuff is for looks. All necessary things like upgrading mounts, getting mounts, upgrading bag and bank space, you have the option to use in-game currency without being too ridiculously expensive as I have seen with some others. Graphics are pretty good, but it can look a lot better if you tweak them a bit with Nvidia. You will see a noticeable difference, particularly with color and that without the filter, the game's graphics can appear flat if you have played with the filter for awhile. (Not sure if you can tweak graphics with other graphic cards as I have only ever used Nvidia.)A great game to play solo or with friends. There are a few bugs, particularly at peak busy times such as during an event on a weekend night, but it is usually not bad and can generally be fixed by reloading UI or leaving the game and going back in.There are a ton of stories and quests, but if you decide to have more than one character, gameplay can be a bit repetitive. I definitely recommend it for fans of the Elder Scrolls and other Bethesda games as well as anyone who likes MMOs.(Side Note: I only play PvE, not PvP. From what I hear from others, you will either love the PvP or hate it.)"
Positive,"This game is great, i bought the imperial edition and dont regret it, it is really fun and has a good story"
Positive,"if WoW and Dark Age of Camelot had a baby, and that baby was adopted by The Elder Scrolls."
Positive,Love this game to death. Would recommend even if youre a solo player.  i dont know what else to say. i need coffee :2018bestcoffee:
Positive,"Good game, has never-ending quests. Definitely worth it."
Positive,goats are innocent.
Positive,"I love how the game can run at 100 fps for an entry level gaming PC. Story is great, although it kinda forces you to buy more DLCs in order for you to enjoy the whole game. Not a lot of explanation given in where to get materials to create stuff that you need. Overall, I'd give it 4/5."
Positive,"Huge fan of MMOs, fan of Skyrim and Oblivion - this is a game I binge every couple months.  The quests are engaging, the combat is entertaining, it is by no means the best MMO I've ever played but well worth the cost.  I like the direction development is going and look forward to watching this game grow."
Positive,"love most things about this game, awesome graphic/music/gameplay helpful community. The main  quests are awesome ,theres  the usual smattering of fetch and carry quests(they are in all rpgs) My main gripe is with the mapping system, it sux trying to find specific places in an area especially for new players. and of course there is the usual bunch of 12 year old dicks in the chat"
Positive,"First of all, don't believe all those people that say this game is P2W, because it isn't.This game is B2P meaning that you buy it once, and all the content is available to you. There are DLCs and an optional subscrisption, but those are OPTIONAL. This game has a ton of content for you if you simply want to just play the Base Game.Also, the cash shop is purely cosmetic; don't let anyone tell you otherwise.This game is definitely worth the cost."
Positive,"After giving a break for some time, game has been quite changed and gotta say new DLCs and mechanics are quite nice.Felt like complete different game than on release."
Positive,If you like elder scrolls i recommend
Positive,"A great MMORPG in general, fans of TES would love the lore and vast amount of content that this game offers. The game takes place during 2E 582, around the time when Tiber Septim arised and unified Tamriel. Remember that this isn't a singleplayer masterpiece, so don't expect the zones/areas to be massive or bigger like other TES games.Pros>Beautiful textures for an MMO>Godly music>Decent DLC content>Decent characters>Micro-transactions are mostly cosmetic>No monthly subscription needed anymore>There is always something to do>Amazing lore, especially for TES fansCons-Takes up more than 80GB of storage-Inventory space feels very limited at first-PvP basically isn't an option at the beginning, you'll get murdered-RNG based loot-Has a ""learning curve"" when it comes to the whole scheme of the game. This is because of (unfortunately) obscured gameplay mechanics and (fortunately) rich combinations of skills and gear.Preferably, buy this game when it's on sale. DON'T commit the mistake of buying everything on regular price like some others have done (this is why I bought the game for $10).Also, it kinda makes you feel some similar vibes to ""Overlord"", the anime. Topkek, but it is still a nice little bonus if you've seen it.7.7/10 - would join a 420 guild again"
Positive,"I think I need to put this as a preface. I began playing this game right after ""Tamriel Unlimited"".Lets start with the good.     Action Combat      its an elder scrolls game     deep lore to explore     never before explored worlds in previous elder scrolls games     fully voice acted     housing system!     freeform class system (classes are a guideline, and not a box)     quests aren't a chore.      crafting that feels good     soft level cap (sorta)     Massive PvP (in guilds, coordinated movements feel really good when executed well)     Interesting Dailies unlike most MMOs on the market.     open world events.     unlevelled zones!!!     Amazing cosmetic system!!!     supports completionist playstylesNow, it definitely has some bads, but personally i feel they are outweighed by the positives...     buy to play + optional subcription model + cash shop.     Servers occasionally will go haywire when new content is released (player density)     animation cancelling and synergy (combo abilities) are often janky. (this should be fixed by the end of febuary)     If not doing any form of questing and are only grinding for gear, you will get burnt out.in summary, i feel this game is worth at least giving it a go. After all most of the cost in this game is in the dlc at this point! Get the base game on sale to try it, if you like it, there are plenty of cheap ways of getting you up to speed DLC wise with package deals."
Positive,"Been my favourite mmo since 2014, can’t see that changing."
Positive,"What little I did manage to play of ESO seemed quite fun, I can't comment on the graphics as I had to run it on low settings and the textures were very blocky and unbecoming, but the gameplay and movement itself was smooth and comfortable to control.The reason I don't recommend it, as I have endless problems with the launcher. Every time the game updates it fails to properly update and I have to reinstall the game in its entirety before it will work as it just descends into an endless cycle of 3mb of download remaining before ""completing"" and then recycling itself to do the entire download again.It makes playing the game nearly impossible.UPDATE 2023: There are still launcher issues, and the game seems to struggle when there is increased server demand. But the questing is great. Many quests overlap regionally, and are well integrated, quest design is decently varied with some relying more on political intrigue but there is a strong reliance on spelunking. Character development is forgiving and allows for the development of a variety of playstyles, though I can't comment yet on endgame meta. Public dungeons Iv'e played so far feel a little too focused on boss rush rather than more complex mechanics though I suspect that I might see more puzzle based elements later.Changing this from a negative to a recommended in 2023."
Positive,"I will not discuss the pros and cons against each other in this review. I will just speak my opinion on what my experience of the game is. I can with most certainty recommend this game! I started playing it one week before they opened it to be a B2P game, and the first feeling i got was very similar to the one I got when I first played Skyrim, which was ""WOW! this game is going to be epic!"". With its amazing soundtrack, voice acting and endless distractions it will take you on a journey that may never end. The graphical experience is not as sharp as in the modded Skyrim, but it is still an amazing experience. I have yet to discover the guild system and have not yet played any extended time in groups but I still find it amazing. Just loving the many opportunities the game offers. For me MMORPG is not a genre that offers that much in game experience, I have tried many of the offers out there and never felt the epicness the fans of the genre is talking about. But I start to understand it with this game.When I heard the sweet voices of Michael Gambon and John Cleese there were some goosebumps of nostalgic love. There's no doubt about it that the game needs more work, and this is a big fan of the ES series talking, but this adventure is one I do not want to miss.You're welcome to hate my opinion if you like, but it is just that... An opinion."
Positive,"ESO is a solid MMO with an incredibly consistent update cadence, it gets a major update every 3 months pretty much without fail. It has some fairly interesting worldbuilding and quests, really robust and in-depth RPG systems, including fantastic build diversity, as well as tons of well-designed and brutally challenging group content."
Positive,"After around 300 hours of playing the game, I thought it was about time to right up a review about the game. I'm going to do my best not to spoil it, but I can't make any promises. Let's start off with the things I didn't like about the game...(Please note I am a mac user, so any software/hardware bugs I report are mac only, or local only.)• Lots of loading screens, and some can take 30-60 seconds. (recently fixed and shortened for windows and mac users)• Changes to character skins and armour dyes can take a while to take effect, making character customization rather annoying.• HUGE FILE DOWNLOAD, I'm afraid if your internet is not good, it'll be a while before you can play the game, although I do recommend learning a bit about the game in that time. Now onto the great things about the game...• Amazing Quest storyline, especially in the Orsinium/Wrothgar DLC• Once you progress with Dolmens, the bosses can be dragons, so.. YES YES YES YES YES! (Not actually too sure how the dolmen system works, but I have fought a dragon with a huge group of players.)• Extremely friendly community, scared you won't fit in with the masters of Tamriel? Wrong. While just like every community there's a toxic player or... dozens... Elder Scrolls Online isn't so. I have yet to see a disrespectful player within the game, nor have I ever been scammed. Also growing as a player zone chat was always there for me, and the nice players behind it!• Beautiful graphics and world design. • Entertaining Dungeons and Group Activities.• Not buy to win, there's hardly anything in the ""Crown Store"" that can be buy to win, so if you don't feel like spending your money to win, then you're in luck!• Great character customization, and build options.Could go on, but I have to go take care of my guild! Please rate up the review if you found it entertaining, or helpful! Thank you! Great job Bethesda and friends!"
Positive,"Started building my charactor it took about 4h, when me and my friend started playing we spend 15h crafting armor and trying to kill overpowerd bosses at our level so is the game good?? YES its amazing! if you have a friend who loves the elder scrolls play it. It has amazing graphics awesome voice acted quest and a lot of beautifull areas to explore and enjoy.So is it worth the 80€ that i paid for it.. yes I plan to play the shiz out of this game and do everything i can read every book, kill every boss, make myself look like a badass.. So what are you doing here reading reviews go find a friend and start playing!"
Positive,Absoulutely the best rpg game i've ever played
Positive,"It was quite janky. It's now much better, though not perfect. Best find a nice guild or play with friends for the most amount of fun."
Positive,This game is fun now.
Positive,"Becomes my only Game that i play, its truly best MMORPG. It takes time to develop your character but its a beautiful journey!Recommend to Go Grab It!"
Positive,"A lot of bad reviews have been written for this game and all the negativity from the community i think is unreasonable. The game offers good quests (well written, balanced), awesome dungeons, THE PERFECT crafting system and many beautiful locations to explore."
Positive,I've heard some bad things before buying this game but I decided to give it a try. It turned out to be one of the best MMORPG I've ever played. A ton of fun things to do. Friendly community. Recommended for the Elder Scrolls fans.
Positive,"This game has definately increased in quality from when it was first released. As a huge lore nut myself, I absolutely love this game! It's got some of the best graphics for an MMO and gameplay is smooth. Sure, there are a few glitches here and there, but it's nothing serious. I really recommend this game to anyone who loves lore and basically an extension to the series. But do keep in mind, it is an MMO, and not a Skyrim 2.Furthermore the community is really nice and humble. You'd have an easy time finding friends to play together. I hope I have convinced you in playing this game :)9/10"

Positive,"MMORPG’s live and die based on two primary factors: the combat and the quantity of content. It says a lot then as to the quality of the Elder Scrolls Online that it is mediocre in both of those departments while still being an enticing and fun game. Without the customs inherent to many MMOs or the fully immersive and living feeling of a single player Elder Scrolls game, The Elder Scrolls Online delicately balances the systems required in a multiplayer game, while putting a focus on writing, voice acting and open world group content. The Elder Scrolls Online is a mediocre MMO, and a mediocre Elder Scrolls game, but when combined, it triumphs as an engaging, fun and social experience.Elder Scrolls Online’s combat feels a lot like Skyrim, in that the weapon connections don’t really feel as solid as they should and the skills don’t always have the sense of impact that they ought to. Likewise, it doesn’t have the snappiness of action bar MMO combat. However, after playing for around 30 hours, I began to realize the nuance and skill it required. The dodging and movement actually lend themselves to very important positional play, and when not utilized, make the combat harder than you’d ever imagine. Trying to play ESO in a static way like one would in most MMOs will result in death, and mobility and awareness are very important. It’s hard to notice the skill required to play ESO well until one participates in one of the many group dungeons ESO offers. ESO has hundreds of public dungeons called Delves that can be played with a group or solo, as well as tradition instanced dungeons for 4 players. The dungeons and delves are very good, with varied environments, enemies and encounters. The dungeon content (including the low level dungeons) is significantly harder than most MMOs and require coordination akin to a positional shooter such as Counter Strike. The complexity of the PvE content overshadows the poor combat feel, making ESO feel like a focused strategy and positional game over a visceral 3rd person action game. Much like Guild Wars 1, ESO allows a limited number of skills (5). The skill system is diverse and interesting, allowing any class to use any weapon or armour. Want to play a heavy armour, great sword wielding mage? Well you can. The restricted skill system makes it feel like there are plentiful build possibilities, and in an MMO, feeling like you actually have the potential to create a unique build that is viable without just googling the most optimal way to play is liberating, and extremely fun. The skill system provides the sense of customization and creativity that an MMO should.The questing in ESO is full voiced. While the writing isn’t as strong as many single player RPGs, the quest writing tends be relatively strong in comparison to most multiplayer games. There are few throw away quests where a villager needs multiples of a mundane item, such as the hides of 10 boars, and the game generally stays away from kill and collect quests. While the gameplay when questing tends not to be very interesting, there is usually enough of a narrative hook to make even the monotonous quest design interesting. As someone who plays a lot of MMOs, this is the first game in years I did not listen to podcasts the entire time while playing, as I actually opted to listen to the voice acting or read the quest text. Unfortunately, the voice acting is weak, with a very small cast and you will notice repeating actors, often even in the same quest chain. The writing is good though, often presenting shades of gray when moral choices are presented, allowing for interesting resolutions to quests, and the characters are a good mix of likeable and hateable. In the base game, the main story quests follow a pretty generic plot, and are predictable and boring, if not fun in a campy way. However, the two Guilds in the base game, the Fighters Guild and the Mages Guild pick up where the main plot fails. With interesting quests and instanced missions, the Guild quests actually allow for unique and interesting gameplay. The nature of ESO as an MMO cause the impacts of the questing on the world to be relegated to voice lines from the villagers, but the instanced Guild missions allow for more feedback from the world and characters as to the actions of the player. The writing in the Guild storylines is also much stronger than both the main quests and the side content. This leads me into another downfall of ESO - The Elder Scrolls universe just isn’t very interesting. Sure, it has a detailed history, and traditionally has character relationships and interactions that are complex and emotional, but it lacks the flash and outlandishness of other MMOs. Warcraft has a cast of ridiculous caricatures that make the world silly, yet fun and charming. Elder Scrolls is high fantasy in the most boring way. The Mages Guild deals with this problem by having frequent interactions with the Daedric Prince of Madness who pranks and jokes with the player, and I think it comes as no surprise that this is easily the best PvE content that the game has to offer. The generic fantasy of the world significantly reduces the amount I could care about the main quest or side content. I know that eventually the baddie will die, somebody important will die, and all of the faction will put aside our differences to take down the monster that is a threat to us all. The side content suffers from boring-universe-itis too, as the world doesn’t really allow for crazy stories to emerge. Sure there is some interesting moral decisions to be made, but still confined within the dull parameters of generic fantasy. All in all, it takes about 100 hours to hit the level cap, and there are not all that many alternate zones per factions, leading to a fun, well developed but relatively short content play through.Cyrodil, the continent that Oblivion was set in, is currently not controlled by a faction, and as such serves as the 1v1v1 PvP continent of ESO. Despite problems with performance, long travel times, and some issues with the systems of capturing keeps, Cyrodil offers massive, exciting battles while remaining manageable. Despite my limited experience playing PvP in ESO, the massive battles over castles and keeps tend to feel more controlled than similar games such as Guild Wars 2. It felt like the massive swarm of people eventually dissolved into multiple small team fights and 1v1s. As I was engaged in combat in the stairwell, similar fights surrounded me throughout the entire castle, which made it less overwhelming for me to parse what was going on, while maintaining the feeling of a massive battle. The action combat lent itself to making me feel at fault for my deaths, rather than gear/skills/bad luck losing me fights. The siege weapons are fun to use, and have smart and accessible system to acquire, allowing them to feel fair but still powerful. The games strong visuals and soundtrack help to enhance the scale of the battles, making it feel truly heroic. I think that Cyrodil has potential to be the best open world PvP. A means to allow for small group play (with 3-4 friends for example) in a viable way, perhaps by adding small outposts or villages would really escalate the PvP content to greatness.Modern MMOs have removed so much of the challenge from trading and social interaction, that it feels less significant to succeed. Back in old school Runescape, sitting in a bank for 3 hours trying to buy a piece of gear wasn’t fun, but when you finally got it, it sure was exciting. ESO straddles the line between player to player trading and modern auction houses with Guild Stores. There are just under one hundred player Guild controlled stores that only sell items at the singular location of each unique store. This limits resources in a way that most MMOs don’t, but also provides an outlet for easy trading in large cities. This all said, chat bubbles are TERRIBLE, as is the group finder."
Positive,"Rating: 8/10Pros: A clean UI MMO with good skills and skill trees. I enjoyed this alongside similarly set up games like Guild Wars 2 and Wildstar where you don't have a huge amount of skills to worry about and can switch weapons easily.Oh, coloring is a pro. Provided you've completed achievements you get account-wide colors to use for free.Combat Mechanics. I love being able to interrupt with a simple bash.Recent changes to scaling. I really liked their recent change to make it so that every enemy you come up against - even if you're in a party with various levels of people - is scaled and you can deal damage if at low levels.Add-on support. Having these add-ons reminds me a lot of modding regular Skyrim, and I did enjoy that feeling. Can't live without my research assistant. ;DCons: No cosmetic armor system where you can slot armors you liked over your equipped armor - which is one of my favorite features of games like Wildstar and Lord of the Rings Online.No Minimap. Yes, you can easily load add-ons for it and I do - it just creates an excessive amount of lag since the minimap isn't a regular feature.Now I'm going to get a lil hate for this, but I'm going to have to say ""Skyrim Grunge"". I like Skyrim and all, but it has always felt dark and dirty. I have mods to make people look better in Skyrim, but in ESO there isn't a huge selection of facial styles like I would have preferred.All-in-all though I love this game, esp now that I have the DLCs and can easily steal and shank people at will, haha. Way easier to make small cash than the original Skyrim, and while it's not quite comparable to a Single Player game, I like it about as much. :)"
Positive,"Not the same as Skyrim, but it's lore rich."
Positive,"one of the only mmorpgs with the best housing system, you get to own houses in game and KEEP THEM FOREVER!!THIS PLEASES ME AS A HOUSING FANoh and beautiful landscapes, tons of exploring i love"
Positive,"I think playing for over 6000 hours says it all for this MMORPG.  However here goes a mixed bag of thoughts on the game.  There's much more, but it would take me days to write a full review of this amazing game. If you love any of the single player Elder Scrolls games and you consider yourself a solo player, then despite this being a massive multiplayer online game,  a lot of the game, especially the main quests and  side quests as well as  all the crafting side of the game   still plays like a single player game.  There are  specific multiplayer areas where you do play against other players i.e. pvp; in fact there are  two pvp  modes,  Battlefields and  the Alliance wars (there are three alliances,  The Daggerfall Covenant, The Aldermeri Dominion and the Ebonheart Pact),  In both modes you   tend to play with a large  group of  players on your side either against two other alliances , so  it still feels  almost SP like, though if you  find yourself cut off from others of your alliance,   you'll probably not survive in    the parts of the  world where the other alliances  hold sway.  The alliance wars are fought in Cyrodil, which  covers  much of the area that  the old Oblivion   world   covered, with the central area, the Imperial city being the main focus.  (to play the Imperial City you do require one of the first dlc's released unless you buy the Deluxe version, which I think includes the Imperial DLC (I may be wrong on this now) .I've been playing this game since the Beta was released back in 2013 and have still to explore a large part of the world  fully.   As with all Elder Scroll Games,  this game starts with a linear   chapter, where you have to complete various tasks before entering the main game.  Every elder Scrolls since the first (called Arena) have included  an initial  linear element. This usually takes no more than an hour or less to complete.   Once you enter the main open world game apart from the  main quest line,  there are literally thousands of  smaller side quests as well as  hundreds of ways to create your character.  (I've been playing now for six years if you count the beta time and still haven't completed the main quest as I easily get  side-tracked in the  smaller quests as well as the many daily quests that you can repeat every day.  These are useful experience and  in game gold earners, so are worth  repeating. There are several  for each daily quest,  so you don't repeat the same quest  for each one  every day, otherwise you'd soon bore of them.  I do rotate  between the different  daily quests as it is almost impossible to complete every daily quest there is in a day as some can take upwards of an hour or more to complete.  The quickest to complete are the crafting  quests so long as you have the appropriate materials on hand (these are usually obtained  via grinding or via  spending  skill points in certain ways so that you have  NPC helpers who  find  them for you, or by completing the    daily writs as these always give you   some gold, materials and experience.  For example I have  literally hundreds of each type of material required, including some of the rarest (that can cost upwards of 20 000 gold  via the guilds).  Once you have all your materials, the actual crafting for all seven  disciplines  only takes about 15 minutes at the most and can be even quicker if you  install various add ons that  automate the process of crafting for you.There are  ten main races in the Elder Scrolls Online, High Elf (Altmer), Dark Elf (Dunmer), Argonian, Khajiit, Redguard, Orc, Nord, Breton and Imperial.  Each race has particular racial  passives  for example  Bretons  focus mainly on Magicka abilities, with an increased spell resistance to others magic. They also use Magicka  more often as it costs less.  The Redguard make great tanks because of their  main passive is sustained  stamina,  and they are more proficient at martial training that reduces the cost of weapon  abilities.    I could go on  for    hours talking about this, but there are many great tutorials available via the ESO dedicated sites that I advise you check out .  There are so many ways you can play this game, for example as a lone wolf I tend mainly to     concentrate on completing the main quests, solo dungeons and  crafting as well as improving my skill lines. you have   the potential to create eight different characters, plus you can purchase  more slots to extend these if you wish.   Each character can  increase their level to CP 810  (that's 50 to reach veteran status plus another  810 levels in champion mode), though you can go beyond that, but  any increase in level above 810  does not bring any  extra   benefits apart from Kudos.  continued below in sections due to character limitation exceeding over 9000 characters"
Positive,my only complaint...ITS TO DANG ADDICTING
Positive,this is way better on pc
Positive,"Played intially when it released in 2014.  It was horrible.  Combat and animation were clunky.  Graphics were decent only.  I played a few hours only before calling quits and left hugely disapointed.  Fast forward 2 years and this is like a totally new game now.  Just like how final fantasy 14 was revamp and now has become sucessful.  I feel the same for ESO online right now.  Its like they reworked the combat system because it feels great.  Combat can be entirely played in 3rd person view and I can tell a lot of work was put into it unlike Skyrim.  The graphics looks Amazing at 4K with everything MAX and I get 90+FPS w/ 1080gtx.  Again I don't remember it looked this good 2 years ago.  I'm glad for the free weekend because I got a chance for a second look.  To me it is pretty much Skyrim but online which is amazing.  The game does have a cash shop but it is not P2W.  Mostly cosmetics, awesome mounts,  and few buffs but negligible."
Positive,"game is far better than it once was, you can play as you like and how you like 100s of hours of gameplay and there are still things to do.there is 5 clases to choose from if you have the morrowing expansion.Nightblades: mostly used for stealth and mid-high  DPS. in PVE they focus on dealing high damage to single and multiple enemies, and have the abilty to use debufs such as reducing armour etc. and  in PVP they are mixed of damage and stealth scouting enemy players and sneaking around to ambush and burn seige weaponsSorcorers: are a high damaging class with abilitys to heal. most players complain like hell over a healing sorc though so these are more to the ""damage"" Sellcasters than healing.Dragon knights: are the ""tanks"" of eso while being able to deal some high damage they are mostly used to be a tank  ( I very minimal experience in the class)Templars: while templars can be high damagers too they was/are the healers of ESO using many buffs/debuffs and healing abilitys. vetren dungeons and trials need templars as their healers as their healing is better than sorcs. ( i have little experiance as a templar)Wardens (morrowing expansion) again i have near no experience with this class. but from seeing others they are similar to sorcorers a mix of damage and healingi have over 800 hours gameplay with lots of that being just messing around, random group dungeons and PVP there are over 1000 quests easily in the game so if you enjoy lore and some questing well you are in for many hours of gameplaythe PVP resolves around capturing castles in a large area going against 3 factions all battling in constant never ending warfare. where you need to use trebuches balistas and battering rams to bring down the castles walls/doors to break inside kill any defenders and take it for your allience while defending your own from the other 2 Alliences with catapults balistas and flaming oil. the campains run for 7 days and 30 days and once the time is up the allience with the most points wins and the players recive items such as gold and PVP items/armours/weaponry TESO also holds avivarsary events and special events every few months giving bonus xp and rare/special rewards RNG of course.. they also host very special events like their current 10millions storys where 1 lucky player gets so many rewards + they get to be made as a NPC in the game. WHO WOULDNT WANT THAT!their eso plus (members) gets snuffed at but its so worth the money giving you double bank/invent space double housing  space. access to ALL DLC while your plus is active a crafting bag to store al your crafting materials in saving you upto 200 inventory/bank sapce and crowns (ingame store currency to buy unique mounts houses etc)all in all just buy the damn game it is so worth it despite what people say yes it can be a grind fest. but look at the hours some palyers have and they still having 100% done everything"
Positive,"If you are the sort who will be dissapointed because you were expecting ""Skyrim Online"",  don't bother with this game. It is the same universe, but a totally different game. That being said, this is IMHO, the best MMO going. If you played it within the first year and quit -give it another chance. It has undergone MASSIVE improvements. This game has it all - deep and immersive lore (if you, like me, started this series with Skyrim, you'll be amused at some of the cross-over locations and stories - the game even features some of the same books), Crafting, PVE, a thriving PVP community/map, Dungeons, arenas, dueling, Guilds, and now - housing!This game can most definitely be played solo, but many of the dungeons are meant to be played in groups, and frankly, the best loot comes from the group dungeons/areas. The game does not require a subscription - though an optional one is available. The subscription is wortn it if for no other reason than the ""crafting bag"" it provides: a no limit inventory for raw materials. (without the subscription your inventory is capped - *including* any crafting materials you find in game. This can be frustrating when you find that piece of weaponry or armor you need, but you can't pick it up because you have too much iron ore, foods, or woodworking materials etc.) The subscription also gives you access to all the DLC for as long as you have an active subscription. (the upcomind ""Morrowind"" expansion is not included)The cons about this game? The learning curve is relatively steep. If you haven't had any experience in MMO's, it doesn't do a very good job of telling you how to advance. There are some tutorials in game, but they are mainly to teach you the mechanics. There are also many tutorials online outside the game (YouTube, etc.) to get you up to speed if you need them though. It also is pretty strict about how you want to play, I.e. in Skyrim you could start as a hack & slasher, but become a mage and go back and forth as needed. Here you are required to select a class - and your advancement is partially limited to strengthening the abilities of that class. Well worth it IMO, and constantly expanding. At three years and counting it's only getting better."
Positive,This games tight
Positive,"Elder scrolls Online has been having a free weekend that has lasted a little over a week at this point (so not really a weekend lol). In this time, I’ve managed to clock in about 40 hours of game time, getting my character to level 36. Regardless of anything else, id say that 10 bucks (the asking price of the base game) is easily worth 40 hours of enjoyment. Its just fun to run around, explore with friends, do quests, do dungeons, level up, and collect gear. And I feel like I’ve barley scratched the surface of the base game.One of my favourite things is that every thing seems to scale to your level. this means it doesn't matter if friends play without you and get high levels, you can still all play together and not feel super underpoweredHowever, the game certainly isn’t perfect. You start off with 60 inventory space, and 60 bank space; both of which can be upgraded for in game gold, or real money crowns. This is ridiculously low. Up until I had about 90 in each, I was constantly struggling with inventory management. I strongly think you should start with 100 of each, and upgrade from there.In addition, the game is on steam, yet it still needs its own launcher. The game seems to download via steam, which is great, but the launcher must be manually closed every time, separately from the game, which gets annoying, and means its easy to forget and accidentally accumulate playtime hours on steam. it would be great if they added an option to auto close the launcher. Sort of related to this, the game has achievements, but none of them are steam achievements. It would be great if they could port the achievements to steam.Like most MMOs and live service games, this game does have microtransactions, both cosmetics, and non-cosmetics (and an optimal monthly subscription), but so far, I haven’t found the need to buy any of them. The most annoying thing about this is they use the annoying system where you can’t just buy what you want. They use that system where you need to spend money on coins (or in this case crowns) and then use crowns to buy the stuff you want. Its setup so you always have leftovers in your account. It would be great if they could allow you to just purchase the stuff you want, in whatever currency you use, and get rid of all the p2w stuff (although since the game is mostly pve, p2w doesn’t really matter too much)Overall though, I’ve really enjoyed the game so far, and my plan is to purchase they Greymoor bundle, which is only ~10 dollars more and includes all currently released expansions (so not the upcoming blackwood, and not the regular dlc), in a few days when the free “weekend” ends."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Offline, nothing more to add. At the moment just don't buy it on Steam.EDIT: They Fixed most of the issues"
Positive,"I'm probably not qualified enough to write a thorough review as I only have 50 or so hours invested into this game, but I wanted to talk about some expectations it delivers and doen't deliver as a controversial game as a warning to potential buyers. First off, for what it's worth, I found this game extremely enjoyable. Admittedly I've only played a few mmorpgs, but this game was the most entertaining mmorpg I have ever played, allow me to elaborate. The storyline is very well polished, and avoids traditional mmo storyline cliches, at least the dominion storyline does. It lost me at times, but is rather easy to catch up on even if you find yourself lost. Haven't finished the storyline, but so far so good. Everybody is fully voice acted, which I know is now not as rare in games published by big studios, but the voice acting in ESO is very well executed and adds to overall immersion. The dialogue texts were easy to read, and for some reason doesn't make you want to kill yourself reading it like many other MMOs I've played. The graphics are good, not like your call of duty or far cry 4 good, but good for a MMORPG. I was very content playing eso on my 2012 macbook pro with only 4 gigs of ram and a crappy graphics card (running the game at medium). Either way, MMOs don't advertise their graphics as much as other aspects they deliver better than non MMOs such as coop play.The player community in ESO is not bad. For coop dungeons (if you don't have friends or they cant affor the game), you can always find a bunch of players camped outside the dungeons. Most of they aren't assholes and are easily approachable via text or mic. Sidequests are a joy to play, though tedious if you don't read the dialogue. What I found extremely annoying was how my friend was able to reach level 7 in 2 hours, which it took me like 2 days, as I went around my area and did every possible side quest and he just rode up on his imperial pony and hopped from main quest to main quest. The skill tree system is something i've heard people bitch about, but the skill trees are very elaborate and allow for lots of merging, giving you hundreds, maybe thousands of combinations to choose your best playstyle. I will complain that there are few builds that lead to success and it is likely your first character will end up a failure, but reading on builds online is boring and game breaking. My guess is that this is zenimax tricking players into replaying the game, which can be tedious, but hey, there are 3 storylines and 4 classes. Combat can be repetetive, but how you customize your class abilities can heavily affect your enjoyment in combat. There is some degree of tactics in combat, but usually you just end up going back to hit and run, hit and heal, or just hit and continue hitting cause your a dragonknight tactic. For those who said this game isn't skyrim online, I agree, and I also think its a stupid statement because the game literally isn't called skyrim online, it's not even marketed as an adaptation to the wildly successful es5, so I don't even know why that's a concern. However, this game still does what skyrim does best, it gives players the freedom to explore, and not only that encourages players to explore with sidequests scattered, this time around tamriel. Also something I find important, it gives players choice in pretty armors so you can look fabulous. I will remark some final and dissapointments this game has given me. If playing alone in the game, It almost does feel like skyrim, or just a solid rpg. However, when you're along, you tend to forget you're not the only one in this game, and though reveiewers have mentioned this game makes you feel like a piece of the bigger puzzle, at times it does treat you as the ""chosen one"", or at least a lone savier of a burning village. When you see ten people standing around the person asking for help to save his village, you get kind of pissed off. This is nullified when playing with friends, when you're always aware that you aren't the only one, leading to no dissapointment at all. The price tag is pretty high, got it at full price and I don't regret any part of my purchase. However, this makes the game kind of unaccessable to potential customers, which kind of blocks out the spammers and assholes. So I guess this isn't really a complaint once you muster the guts to make this investment. The game is huge, for a good reason. Took me like 3 days just to download it with my crappy router. You thought you were done just downloading it from steam, here's a 40 gigabyte patch for you to enjoy in game. Overall very enjoyable game, a few nitpicks here and there. I'm not qualified enough to comment on coop an pvp or the full storyline, for that I apologize, I will be updating this review once I get some more hours into it and more importantly in the mood to do a review. Buy this game, you won't reget it. (If you do I'm not responsible.)"
Positive,"Do you like the lore in Elder Scrolls? Have you played every single game? Great, because you don't need any of those things to play this game and get into it. For myself, I only casually have played Oblivion and Skyrim- so I came into ESO with piratically no background other then there were cool playable races.Compared to other current generation MMOs out on the market this game is beautiful, interactive, lore and story drive, and has great solo/group play opprotuntiies. The mechnices of the game make sense for the setting and tie in nicely together without leaving a player fustrated at figuring out how to gear or craft.Th only down side to this game compared to other MMOs is the lack of a classic PVP sense. Supposedly that will change this year in content patches, but for now the only PVP is an open world constant pvp system much like World vs World vs World in GW2. Only its just one big server, against itself in three factions. At that, there is one bloated faction with some slight map advantage, then two weenie factions. So until they can get that straight, PVP in this game is a resounding 'meh' for those players like myself that like quick fast past small match team based games (looking at you with heart eyes  SWTOR). The costuming system is great, the game is mod friendly. The graphics are beautiful (2023 edit note: looks better with a shader on them). The community is active and vibrate for all sorts of play styles and needs. But most importantly the devs are actually doing stuff to add content to the game. Already in the middle of 2016 and it's had two drops that have added SO MUCH to the game (Thieves Guild, Assassins Guild), and before that it's had other content drops/quality of life pers since it went free to play.New players, returning players- I strongly recommend to give this game a good long hard look and enjoy it. EDIT 2023:We now have battle grounds for PVP- which is classic quick play objective PVP- and its the right amount of PVP for me (think Crucible from Destiny 2 or WoW PVP). However, for PVP- other then the battle ground maps- they have not added much other then a leader board for types of pvp matches, and sometime extra pvp rewards on some weekends. So if PVP is your main game draw, its there- just limited.Also despite how funny it sounds, the leader-boards for Tales of Tribute (the card game)- is pretty competitive and hot- people push for end of season scores if you're into some friendly competition. It's a smaller pool of players, but its there for people who like turn base PVP and want to get a little sweaty at it.ZOS previously did year long storytelling release cycles, which was fun- and often had hype events for free rewards (including free DLC or houses). Now they are on a new big drop, trickle drop cycle- so I'll edit once we see how that works (New pattern: Q1: Dungeons, Q2: Chapter release (has a land/strory, 12man raid + new system), Q3: QoL, Q4: New System).This game is very hard to play if you want to buy everything, so ESO+ is a cheaper option if you don't plan on playing it for long. Purchase of DLC is optional in this sense because ESO+ gets you everything plus craft bag (all previous chapters become part of ESO+ when a new chapter is released). But its not as free to play friendly as other MMOs, so that's a huge con I feel (it would improve if they added better bundle options for purchase that made sense, instead of bundles that have already free DLC in them; ie the bundle that comes with imperial city sewers + other guild stuff). They did make Vvardenfell and Imperial City for free (in game, just go to the crown store and purchase for free)- so thats more content you can get out of a base-game feeling. (This gives you access to a total of 4 trials, 26 dungeons, 19 unique places to explore for the base game.)The crafting is robust, and provides both equal parts functionality and fashion as you gain more styles unlocked (think transmog from WoW but account wide and unlimited). And is a huge component for load-outs in end game for players (if you want to min-max your weapons and armor)End game does not start till post-level 50 at champion point 160 in all honesty. So it might be to much of a time sink for some folks (like Destiny 2 players)- but you can still enjoy the journey and do dungeons to level all the way up, or even PVP in battleground to level instead of questing if you don't like questing."
Positive,Best game ever since I figured out how to play it. Now I'm addicted to it. So much content and realistic graphics. What more could you ask?
Positive,"Fantastic game in most aspects. Gameplay is fun and exciting, Story is engaging and unlike other MMORPG's i dont have to collect 20 mushrooms just to progress the main questline only to get yet another mission to collect 20 flowers. The crafting system is hard work but makes you feel accomplished when you actually make solid progress and the character progression is linear and requires skill to command.Overall one of the best MMORPG's out there and would highly recommend."
Positive,"I've seen a lot of negative reviews for The Elder Scrolls online, so I've decided to give my 2 cents. I'm going to go over as many aspects of the game that I can, and talk about what I like and dislike.Combat: First I'm going to go over combat, as it's one of the most important factors in the game. Combat in the game is alright, I wouldn't say it's amazing or terrible. I enjoy the fast-paced action, and having to aim and dodge and whatnot, and as fun as that can be, the system itself feels clunky. Trying to fight in first person mode can be quite difficult, especially because you can't see the enemies AoE attacks, so you end up standing in things that are usually avoidable. Also if you run out of stamina, it becomes incredibly difficult to avoid damage because you can't roll dodge, block or get out of stuns. I do love the number of abilities available to me though, and it feels good to kill something despite how clunky the system is. (6.5/10)World: The world of Tamriel is huge and there is plenty to explore. One of my favorite aspects of the world is that you are rewarded for exploring. You can find hidden quests, Lorebooks, Treasure chests and skyshards to name a few things. Everything in the world also seems alive. Each part of every zone serves a purpose, and sometimes you have to discover what that purpose is. Also I love the public and solo dungeons scattered about, as they usually provide an interesting reward or quest. (8/10)Quests: Questing in this game is awesome. Although they function similar to generic ""kill X collect Y"" quests, they add a lot of depth. Every quest giver is voice acted, and sometimes you grow really attached to certain NPC's. Some quests will have you saving a town from werewolf curses, to playing the games of a deadric prince. They really make me feel like what I'm doing matters, and they usually provide a decent reward of gold and a cool item. (9/10)Skills: I love the skill system, there are just so many to choose from. When you start, you pick a class and each class has 3 skills trees. You can't access the skill trees of any other class, but you CAN access the other 2 dozen skills trees regardless. There are lots of weapon skills, crafting skills, and armor skills to choose from. There are skill trees based on the guilds of tamriel, and some on the alliance war. I really felt like I could create my character my way, and choose whatever abilities and weapons I wanted regardless of what my class is. You can be a plate wearing, bow wielding mage if you really wanted. (9/10)Crafting: Alright crafting is literally the greatest thing about this game. It can take a little getting used to, but once you figure it out you'll know that it is the best crafting system in any game. You can make any armor or weapons you want, choose 1 of 14 different styles for it to use, choose the traits AND improve an items quality. Not only that, but items can even have set bonuses based on where you craft them, as long you've researched enough traits for each type of item. Researching takes a fair bit of time, so only the best and most dedicated crafters have access to the best set bonuses. If you wanted to be the best blacksmith and dedicate your time to learning all the skills and traits, you could make thousands of gold easily. (10/10)PvP: honestly I really haven't gotten around to pvp yet, I've done a little and from that little bit I can say I've enjoyed it. Like this one time me and 6 other people ambushed a bunch of dominion players at their gate, and it was an awesome skirmish and it felt great! Laying siege to enemy keeps can be pretty crazy, and of course the clunky combat can be pretty annoying. Also the PvP zone cyrodiil itself is massive, and it has LOTS of PvE content to enjoy as well, like little towns and settlements, dungeons and skyshards. (8/10)Story: personally I enjoy the story, I won't reveal spoilers but I did grow attached to certain major lore characters, from the main story and from smaller stories along the way. I loved characters like High King Emeric, Abnur Tharn and Cadwell. The story itself is a generic ""we have to save the world"" sorta thing, but regardless I found it enjoyable. (7.5/10)UI: The UI is ok, I had to download a few addons to make it how I like, and the default keybindings were annoying so I changed them to something more similar to Skyrim. Once I made all the changes I could, there was nothing left for me to complain about. I hate the third-person camera though, It's always over the shoulder, and that can get annoying for combat. They should add options to have it centered at any zoom level, or even have it over the other shoulder. I like how you have the freedom to change the UI to however you like through addons, some games don't have that so good job zenimax. (7.5/10)Graphics/Sound: The graphics are pretty good. Though individual textures are lacking, the game has incredible particle and lighting effects. Some textures are too shiny, like when the ground is wet or something. Water looks amazing and the sky looks good as well. Some animations could use some touch ups though, they feel very static, and don't feel like they are actually interacting with anything. Sound in the game is great, lots of ambient sounds help keep the player immersed. Music changes depending on the situation you might be in, and the voice acting is great, although they had to use the same voice actors for everything, so it can be annoying talking to two different people who sound the exact same. (8/10)Overall: I feel like elder scrolls is a great game, unfortunatly many people wanted it to be the next skyrim and it certainly isn't. It is its own game and it is incredibly immersive and fun. There's always lots to do, from crafting, fighting, exploring, roleplaying, questing, reading and dungeons. My character feels truely unique in how he looks and in his abilities. This game does require a bit of time dedication and that may turn a lot of people off. If you hate MMO's you won't like this game, but if you like MMO's then you'll probably enjoy it a lot! (8.5/10)"

Positive,Really nice game amazing world with a lot of short and long quests very nice group trials and dungeons some of the trials and dungeons are really challenging and amazing you can do it with your friends and enjoy a lot the only things that hurt me in this game its ZOS potato servers they are trash. after all i really recommend to try this game this game its so nice you gonna love it.
Positive,So where do i start... I mainly bought this game to play it with my friend!We started playing the game more and more.. hes at 2000 hours while im only at 140 xdI could not play the game as much cus my pc was way to bad and i was at 9 fps in trials etc...Now when i have a new pc tho i can say THIS GAME is my absolute favorite game and its so fun to meet new people and do trials/veteran dungeons with them :D!I think this game is worth every penny and thats why i recently bought Summerset and Elswyr!I have never really been into MMORPGs and this game is a great way to start your MMORPG adventure of!Sure there are some flaws... but the amount of fun you will have will overcome any problem with the game to be honest!8/10 - One of my favorite games at the moment!
Positive,"I'll be honest. This is a good game. Unfortunately for me, I have leporiphobia. That is the fear of rabbits. I can't get past the first village without walking within 20 feet of a rabbit. I almost muster the courage to just shut my eyes and sprint for it, but, every time the freaking thing just hops in a random direction for absoutely no reason and I freak and Alt+F4. Not the game's fault, so I am still recommending it.edit: a few of you thought it would be funny to PM me pictures of rabbits. I'll have you know I have reported your links to Steam Support for racist/hateful comments. One of you even had the guile to send me a Youtube link of the rabbit scene from Monty Python. I'll have you know there is a special place for revolting, disgusting vermin like you.. in hell."
Positive,"This can't be a game, playing this game like a reading book. But this book not same with the others, you're inside this book and living every moments with the historical characters. There are actually a historical origin of all the races, also there is a deep meaning of every words. This game have the best story I have ever seen and the most realistic war and city life  system. Each spent 10 hours in this game you will be as a finished a book and I played approximately 100 hours and I saw only 10% of map, therefore this game contains almost unlimited books. Last week, I realized that the money I gave this game is under that deserves much and this thing was disturbed me. Therefore, I decided to buy something from Crown Store although I don't need. Maybe this story can tell what I feel :)"
Positive,The only Elder Scrolls game without a nudity mod.
Positive,"Bought this for a friend said it unlocks all, Includes the base game, all previous Chapters and High Isle Chapter. yet more than half of the game is still locked... If it has all previous chapters why is areas still locked"
Positive,"I played the Beta and it was horrible. The game was unoptimized and the story felt uninspiring. It didn't quite feel like Elder Scrolls nor did it feel like a meaningful MMO.I played the release and it was horrible. Many of the bugs that plagued the Beta were still present. Not only that, but there was a monthly fee attached to the game which coerced me into rushing through content in hopes of reaching the maximum level.And now, we have the buy-to-play version; Tamriel Unlimited. It seems like Zenimax have found the right balance. I don't feel rushed into completing stories anymore. Anyways, onto the review.I can't believe how great the game has become. Zenimax introduced a new justice system that allows you to kill non-story NPC's, rob their homes and pickpocket people. They introduced a bounty system along with that. In first person mode, it really feels like an Elder Scrolls game now. Wandering the in-game world also gives off that ES vibe.Wherever you choose to go in the game world, there are books and events that will continue to keep you entertained, just like the singleplayer experience. If you play the game with an open mind for an MMO, you will fall in love with it (and I'm an MMO veteran). There is a lot of content here; there are 3 factions and each faction has their own storyline and maps that you can explore. Each map is the size of, say, 3 zones in Guild Wars 2. This game has made me reminiscent of Runescape back in the day. There are a bunch of skills you can level up and you can go about your business in any way you choose. Feel like harvesting wood and building things today? Have at it. Feel like fishing and selling your wares in town? Go for it. There are no set paths and you can pick up and complete any quest you choose. You don't feel pushed to do quests like in other MMO's. Levelling doesn't really feel like levelling if you're looking to take your time with the game.As a Star Wars the Old Republic fan, I will say that the in-game stories aren't as detailed as the aforementioned. The stories are on-par with that of Skyrim, however. They're simple but interesting.Now time for the flaws with this MMO. Like any other MMO, there is always a flaw with the game. I personally didn't experience any bugs whatsoever and I'm 10 hours in. The game itself DOES feel like an MMO; it doesn't have that personal touch that singleplayer ES games give you. If you save a town, people will cheer you on - however talking to individual NPC's won't net you any rewards. I remember some guy saying he'd buy the person who saved the King some ale but when I spoke to him, he just said, ""Yeah?"" Needless to say, I killed him.This new version of the game gets a solid 8/10. Zenimax seems to only profit from expansions now which is fine by me; as long as they keep the same quality as the vanilla version, I'd happily purchase them. The Elder Scrolls Online is now a great MMO with even more content than Guild Wars 2. I highly doubt they're done with it yet."
Positive,"Okay..Time to make some reviews after playing a long timeeFirst of all i really loved The Elder Scroll franchise even just as casual so if u are like me u gonna like this gamePVE : quite tough if you are casually playing but you can bear the weight because this game is not punishing you to do something like grind or buy this or that, because there's always an alternative to clearing PVE content.so far for endgame content like Trials (Raid) needs to take some approach regarding build and strategy but community is good so you will not be alone trust me. Champion points aka  the powerfull passive buff maybe mandatory at first but your skill in playing your class and undarstanding how the game works is more important. most people following builds in order to be effectively playing but hey, as long you are in normal mode area, you can build however you want even making a hybrid character just for questing or normal mode dungeon daily.PVP : well tbh im quite not liking pvp cuz im bad at it, but ill give some reviews from my friend and community. there's 3 mode to pvp : dueling, world pvp aka cyrodill server, and batteground and most people who doing pvp are endgame player theres almost maybe few meta builds on pvp but, ESO is good at sandboxing regarding equipment because the cost of grind is not high and theres always many combination to try it out. there's 1 big problem because when the busy hour especially when PVP event or satnight the lag is really worse especially for medium rig cuz it will made u rage trust me, but alas u can play battleground for some quick beatdownJOB and CLASSESwell job is always standart : Tanking / healing / hitting / crafting / gathering / roleplaying / fashioning / afking (this one is rarely tho cz zos will kick u out from the game if doing afk) like others mmo but the crafting is somewhat unique other than mmo bcuz u can upgrade, make, and modify your own equipment, rng is still there but u can set it to 100% chance so is about taste and for fashion well fashion is the true endgame for some people soo it maybe cost a lot but really worth a tryas for class : well zos made 4 classes to begin with which is mostly can be all roles as long u follow some build but creativity can be good sometimes you know. as for warden and necromancers these two are jack all trades classes but they also having lack at some point. sadly u can swap class like in FF14 but making many toon can be a big money produce right?Communitylast but not least is the community. having fun with your friend in this game is really worth a time, and the community also is kind and helpful, well toxicity is always exist at some point (PVP) but they more like do and forget, so dont take it seriously maybe there's some drama tho in high tier player community but even elitist is helping people soo is good right?zos is sometimes made a weird decision and yes i do sometimes have to hate for it, but i just plan this on my mind ""adapt it or dont care about it"" soo i understand this is MMO not everyone likes this and not everyone hate this soo its a win win As the final result i give the game with 85/100 score, i hope theres a reborn patch someday"
Positive,"Amazing game, i had written a huge review but steam crashed and the whole review got erased...I really love this game and im only lvl 40, i play it as a single player game with a daily dungeon in which i party up with other 4 random ppl.It is a lot of fun and i must say the side quests in this game are by far the best in any game, mmo or single player.Side quest Spoiler: A random nord asked me for help cause the giants where attacking his village, i obviously agreed since i am the hero of the whole realm, Long story short the mofo was actually chopping the giants and feeding them to his comrades in an attempt to acquire their strength and rule their place... No wonder those giants were mad and attacking...On Another side quest (SPOILER) We were being attacked by some coventant so a friend thought it would be smart for her to get captured and try to get some info from them,,, the covenant was alligned with some witches who ate human eyes... long story short my friend got her eyes fed to a witch and lost her sight forever, Sure i rescued her and killed the witches but her sight is forever lost.And that is just a side quest but they are all like that, fully voiced, well acted and amazing stories.Its really a master piece of a game story wise.I literally think im doing a main quest several times because i think NO WAY THIS IS JUST A SIDEQUEST, but it is...I really feel like: what kind of adventure will this game provide me next with some random side quest and off course i still have the 4 main quests, from the guilds, and the main main quest.So it really has a LOT of content and i honestly dont think i will every finish it since i already have aound 100 hours and i literally am just a noob who only knows like 6 dungeons so far.Just take your time with this game, it will be slow at start, specially without a mount, but once you get that and reach around lvl 15 the game really shines.I played WoW, Swtor, ffxiv, tera, GW2, NVW and lots of other MMOs and this one is honestly the richest story wise and immersion, i really LOVE about 90% of the side quests, and i dont say all of them cause there are still some old side quests which are just crap but so far, 90% of them are like a mini main story, its incredible.Combat is pretty good, i really feel like im swinging my 2h sword in the enemies bodies but i cant say much more cause i am still a noob who doesnt know what im doing but so far so good.It does have some bugs but so far nothing big.About the store i honestly didnt even check it out so far cause i dont need anything other than what the game brings.And thats it so far, back to my adventures, atm i have to kill an ancient Vampire so wish me LUCK!!!!"
Positive,"An engaging MMORPG, very fun combat, loads of customizing your character in looks as well as a unique build if you want to go for something not cookie cutter. Great graphics, loads of story and voice acted NPCs throughout the game. Nice crafting, housing, seems like a very good game overall. Has a lot to do and an interesting world. It is for sure an Elder Scrolls  game even if it is a little different you can really see the style and ways of former ES games has been used to create this MMO version. I don't see a better MMORPG to be playing in 2017.I have been playing this game more lately to end the year, and it is by far trhe best MMORPG that is out and I will be playing it for a long time to come as it keeps on improving and adding great content. Your character keeps gorwing and evolving the more you play even far into your champion level which is LVL 50. There are over 500 levels past that where your character levels up and receives points to distribute to his stats and make him/her more powerful.The community in this game is also the best of any MMORPG I have played in the past 20 years. Very friendly, helpful, always ready to share quests, and go on adventures even with strangers and they will fight through a wipe and keep on going with you until you beat the content or at least try  very hard to. If a person drops from a PUG for example in a 4 man dungeon due to him having to go or any reason, there is always somebody that joins up with the group within 5 mins and is happy to finish an already started dungeon, that is not common in any other game I have played."
Positive,"One of the best single-player MMOs out there, Elder Scrolls Online defies the boundaries of logic by following its own-all MMOs formula while adding cons to counter-balance the pros.If the previous paragraph almost gave you a stroke, you are one step closer. You play as the Chosen1, the only person (apart from the other 5 players hopping around you) to be able to bring the Sacred Crystal2 to the Holy NPC3 and save the Great City4 from the terrible menace of Evil6. Rinse and repeat. For the most part ESO is truly a single player game, with other players around just to ruin the imersion.The attributes and overall UI is pretty much like Skyrim's. The skills are quite different: 1 racial skill tree, 1 per guild and 1 per armor/weapon type. Each class has 1 DPS, 1 Tank and 1 Healer tree and resetting your points is cheap. Max Level is 50, but after you get Champion Levels (max 3600) and 9 Champion Trees. Level scaling is blissful curse: the difference ""in power"" between lvl 1 and 250 was pretty tenuous (specially if your character sucks, like mine), since enemies level up with you. Crafting materials take 90% of your inventory slots unless you have Plus Membership. Luckily, you don't ***need*** to craft. You can just choose to suck instead. The world is HUGE. The maps show some points of interest but not how to reach them; in the end, no matter where you're coming from/going to, THE ENTRANCE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE. I'm all in for realism, but I demand to be able to pay a shepherd to bring me places.You'll need to team up for (random) Public Dungeons but there you will have to pass the plot because DoD (diarrhea of death) strike all players as soon as the Dungeon starts (a.k.a. they have to rush and finish it ASAP). I felt useless most of the time in those.All jokes aside, ESO might lack real team-play, but not shoving PvP down your throat is a gargantuan plus. The world is beautiful and feature-rich. The game engine is solid and smooth. They voice-acted everything, showing some devotion. The game is kinda generic and forgettable, but they never strike the wrong nerve. ""Price vs. content""-wise, it is good game.Played on Linux via Proton - smooth as a baby's bottom on 4K. No Steam cheevos (thanks God, 'cause there are thousands of in-game achievements)."
Positive,"I will begin this review by saying that I had heard nothing but bad things about ESO prior to the March 17th release of Tamriel Unlimited. Further more Angry Joe's review showed that the game did not live up to the franchise name Elder Scrolls that this game was released under.A couple days ago I finally bit the bullet and purchased the game. This game is AMAZING! Do not make the mistake of expecting it to be exactly like Skyrim with a multiplayer option like I did. It feels like a MMO in some ways, and in others you can clearly see influences from great titles like the above mentioned Skyrim. A great example of this is in my adventures I came across a chicken, of course we all know what to do with a chicken in an Elder Scrolls game. I proceeded to kill the chicken. because of that action immediately afterwards I was killed by the guards. That is proof of a true Elder Scrolls game right there! This game has benefited greatly from the build up of fantastic game mechanics and lore with everything else that has made the Elder Scrolls series winGame of the Year awards many times.We have covered where the game came from and where it is today. What about game mechanics? How does the game play? The answer is it plays surprisingly smooth. The regions your character travels through are huge! The land well populated with quest givers of all sorts, a great variety of different kinds of quests. The quests vary from serious to hilarious, at one moment you will be saving the world and at the next you are looking for a pig named Glutton in to settle a dispute between two business owners. I could keep on going about everything this game does right.What about the Cons? What does this game do wrong? There are no perfect games, they all have problems. My primary complaint with ESO is everything you buy in the game whether from the Crown Store or purchasing items from merchants is ridiculously expensive. You earn gold very slowly, the majority coming from quest rewards. Things like this are more than slightly in your face saying buy the Imperial Edition, Buy Gold, Buy Crowns, all with real money. I completely understand having mounts and outfits for sale in a store for real money. That is what MMOs do. But the merchant prices as well? That is over the top. In my 8.5 hours of game play I have earned 1,500.00 gold from selling items, killing creatures and the majority from quest rewards. An example of how much items cost is a basic bow is going run you about 1,100.00 gold, a basic horse is 10,000.00 gold. You do have the option to purchase a horse form the Crown Store for 900 Crowns, you are given 500 Crowns at the beginning of the game.And of course Crowns cost real money.Everything included like the other reviewers are saying the positives far out way the negatives. In my mind this title is a must buy.-GhillieBear"
Positive,Great game with lots of content to enjoy.
Positive,"I mostly play FPS games, but when i saw this on sale i just bought it. So this is my first ever MMORPG game, i didnt really see how these kind of games could be fun, because all you ever do is grind to get better gear and get stronger. But when i entered my first 2 hours or so i got hooked, now i cant stop playing this game. I love it!"
Positive,"I love this game! I just wish it was easier to change your appearance, hair and all that ""girly"" stuff. My mind changes from day to day. Other than that..  this is my first MMO and I love it. I am a NB Wood Elf Archer.  It is so much fun. I have it for the pc and use my keyboard. It took some getting used to but now Im a pro. IT is nice to  do things solo but then also have the chance to make friends and beat those bad bosses. I have the Gold Edition and I think that is the best way to go. I dont have a subscription but I love that that is not required."
Positive,"A slew of customisation to create a character that looks just like you or to create a creature so repulsive you'll wonder why everyone doesnt attack you on sight, thats just for starters plenty of classes to pick from and dozens of ways to make coin this game provides an almost endless supply of tasks and things to do whether that takes you to exploring ancient Dwemer ruins or taking an axe to your enemy on Cyrodiils frontlines, you will never want for beautiful scenery, breathtaking vistas and mysterious locales. Although this is labelled as an MMORPG you can happily adventure solo as I myself have happily done or join other players with little more than a push of a button to take on group delves where the risks are great but the rewards are greater."
Positive,"I've been playing TES games for maybe a bit over a decade, and I just started on ESO March 2015, right after they implemented thieving and whatnot into the game. So obviously I got into it a good while after they had time to fix it, and honestly, when I got it, I had a few friends warn me against it, since they played at the very beginning. They called it clunky, slow, disconnected, and not what they would consider an Elder Scrolls game.After putting in some good time into the game, I have to say it must have SIGNIFICANTLY improved since my friends have played. The game does not lag or give off a clunky feel, and reminds me greatly of Oblivion as far as the questing goes. Things change in the games as you quest on, NPCs recognize you by your deeds, the graphics are fantastic, the animations are good, I could go on. Basically, it's a good game. If you are a die-hard TES fan, keep in mind there is only so much they can do in keeping it TES. It does feel like Tamriel, but there is a bit of disconnect that I think they can and will improve over time. The thieving just came out, so I'm hoping for a full blown thieves guild quest line in the future, but who knows. tl;dr, at least try the game out. Expect good quests, expect a good mmo, don't hold it up to your normal TES standards, though. Take it at face value and you'll not be disappointed."
Positive,"Loving this game more and more all the time. I bought it about a year after launch, around the time it went buy-to-play and it went on sale via steam. People will tell you it is easy. They are not entirely  incorrect. There are times I feel like I'm just a solo wrecking crew toppling group after group, while other times  I get repeatedly chewed up and spit out. Repeatedly. Even at Champion rank 200 I find myself occasionally having to walk away from a fight to find friends and strangers to aid me.It's  seem that it's begining to feel like a proper elder scrolls game every day. Maybe I'm just crazy.The biggest difference is the implementation of hotkeys (1-5, R)  which I personally like better than the classic Elder Scrolls Magic-Combat-pausing-menu-swaps. It always felt clunky. Seriously though the scenery is beautiful, the ambience is truly fantastic. Bard's singing tales at the tavern, merchants telling anyone who will listen to buy their wares. Not only is it effectively immersive and truly beautiful to look at But the dungeons are on point. With a good, well-geared and appropriately leveled group even a random PUG should take no more than 15 minutes.  Many of whose bosses are difficult, mechanics-driven encounters.The only drawback in my opinion is the *HEAVY* focus on the crown store. With each DLC they get ballsier and ballsier and ballsier reffering to Crown-store content as ""Base Game Patch"" content; Meaning that you can access it without the dlc as it becomes a component of the core game; ""oh but wait it costs cash~|""But most of what you find in the crown store are things like wedding suits and gowns, mounts (obviously the cool mounts, all in-game-currency purchased mounts are plain and smiple horses,) pets. There are some things which effect the game in a more than visual way; Horse training, inventory purchases, mobile banker/mobile merchant.. all of these objects can be bought for cash. The field merchant and banker each run about $40 cash from the banker. Most mounts ~1800 Crowns (or roughly 18 dollars.. 1500 crowns=$15)"
Positive,"This game has issues. BIG issues. If you don´t have a friend or three that will join you in a random dungeon it can take over an hour to get a place but luckily the game is not only dungeons. There are so many fantastic storys that provide you REALLY much entertainment for hours. Some will make you smile, some will make you cry. The constant addition of DLCs that you need to buy is exhausting but most of the time they are worth their money."
Positive,"Избавлен мир от мерзкой скверны, и некроманты прочь бежали, Забыв забрать во тьму с собой червя, проклятые творенья, Что с той поры нашли покой под магов строгим наблюденьем. С тех пор не меркнет яркий свет, что магией зажжен: Хотя прошло немало лет, почил Галерион, Но память о его деяньях хранят истории скрижали.(с)"
Positive,The game is fun but do not buy or play through Steam. They offer zero value and support in the event you have an issue.However the game is outstanding to play. By far the best MMO I have ever played
Positive,Cool but repetitive and somehow boring if u play without friends and just fast travel along the map.
Positive,Played it for a while. It's k.
Positive,"""Like Skyrim with guns without guns"" - IGN"
Positive,"If you are expecting the next Elder Scrolls game, you will be disappointed. If you want a good MMO with an Elder Scrolls paint job, this is the game for you. Decent character creation, reliable staple combat, fun and interesting crafting system. With a friendly community and plenty of lore scattered throughout the world, this game allows one to easily immerse themselves in the Elder Scrolls universe. Along with continued support and new DLC, there are plenty of reasons to keep coming back."
Positive,"It's like Skyrim, but kind of like a fast-paced first/third-person MMOMost of the time I'm playing, the game still feels like a singleplayer game, but it does have some multiplayer elements which are quite fun, especially with your friendsA lot of the content is behind a paywall, so while the base game is fun, it won't even get close to giving you the full experience"
Positive,"It bring back my memories about playin ES III Morrowind, Tribunal, Bloodmoon.And the Almighty Skyrim FUSRODAH (I didnt see Skyrim Province here yet).ES always been my favorite RPG.No doubt.But i dont like crown store, its too much to spend for buyin DLCs like Dark Brotherhood, Thief Guild, Imperial Race, etc.Hope someday we can just buyin DLCs directly from STEAM. Not from Crown Store."
Positive,"One of the better MMO out there. Normally I'm not much into MMO, but I am much into action RPG games. Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls and many other games series I love alot.This MMO however does everything right for me. Combat, story, crafting, dungeons and coop, bosses and world bosses with all their mechanics. And you can even buy and decorate a house if you feel like doing so.The game gets alot of new content on yearly base, which is great and other MMO should do as well."
Positive,"I had written a review for this perhaps a year and a half ago, and I feel that it deserves to be rewritten.Back when subscriptions were dropped as a mandatory thing to play, there were hardly any DLC, no incentives to pay for the membership, and mechanics in the game that needed improvement- the veteran rank system for one. Since then, there is a lot of DLC available, great incentives to pay for Plus, and a still-strong community in the game. I myself recently paid for 3 months' membership, and I'm thoroughly surprised how beneficial it was to purchase it. It gives access to all the DLC content without having to directly purchase it, and a scale of crowns along with it, 1500 per month subsribed. This considered, someone could purchase three months of membership and pay an additional few bucks for crowns on the side, and be able to purchase access to the DLC areas without really having to pay a whole lot for them, as the pack for those is 5500 crowns. You don't NEED the DLC to get a great time out of the game either, as I had 200 hours in it before paying for Plus, and I wasn't even halfway done with everything available to me.In short, if you have any worries about buying this, it's on crazy sale right now, and you'd be surprised to find how great it is for the price. There is also a DLC coming soon, which is Morrowind recreated in the game. This all makes the game more than worth a simple 18 USD."
Positive,"Having played Morrowind, Redguard, Tribunal, Bloodmoon, Oblivion, Oblivion mini DLCs, Knights of the nine, Shivering Isles and Skyrim, i can truely say that this is a worthy followup to the games in the series.What i like about it: Its a free roam, open world exploration game, where you can set off in any direction and discover a living world filled with quests and things to find. Fighters guild and Mages guild are in, like a Main quest for you to finish, which takes you to Oblivion and back. Just like the earlier games. There is crafting now (unline in Oblivion and earlier games), since it is standard in MMOs. The combat is as it was in Oblivion and Skyrim: Dependend on how well YOU fight - there is no buttonmashing-autowin like in WoW or Everquest.So, if you have good abilities - but suck at combat, you die. You can multiclass, like in the original games, the ONLY other game that lets you do this was Horisons. (When i played Horizons long ago, all the players talked about was how much they wanted an elderscrolls MMO.) ESO also support GUI mods, which helps out alot. There is already a minimap and a ""harvester"" like mod that helps you find resources, as well as several total GUI overhaul mods. - check out ESOUI.COM for more info on those. There is also less grind and more content to do.What i do not like about it: I have unfortunately run into a few zones with invisible walls. This i refer to as Bad game Design. There is some lag issues that one of my guild friend also have and some other people as well (they stop moving when i do, and go on when i get unstuck), there isn't ONE auctionhouse or broker, there are PLENTY of them, which makes finding a specific item very hard since you have to go to town to town and talk to 5-6 vendor in each town, and you have to input the same search parameters EVERY TIME you talk to a new NPC vendor.You also have to join a guild to sell items, if the guild cannot afford to offer and win an vendor in a town for a week, you cannot sell any of your hard earned loot to other players - except the people in your guild who then are the only ones who can access the guild store. Unlocking storage (your backpack) and bank space is cheap for the first 10-30 slots, but then it gets expensive. Some quests are annoying and just a variation on a theme, you walk for 2 minutes and run into a NPC that want you to help save his/her village, you walk another 2 minutes and find a similar NPC whos town is attacked and needs saving.Overall: Definitly one of the better MMOs out there, and if you are an elderscrolls geek - click the Buy button now!"
Positive,"Sons of Tamriel, I am Jack Nevermind! Return to Molog's Ball! And tell everyone that the Ebonharts, the Aldmer Dominionists and the Daggerfall Covenanters in Tamriel are now free! And that Tamriel is no longer yours! We are all going to die. The only question is how and why.I am Jack Nevermind! Your lion is the least important, your commitment is important. And I see a whole army of like-minded people who have decided to fight the rot! You have come to fight as a free people! You are! Without freedom, you are nothing! Will you fight?Fight and you may die. Run away and live. For a while. And after many hours on side quests, dying with a fishing rod in your hand or dying in the bed of your home, you will be ready to give it all! For the ability to move quickly on the battlefield. Quickly move here and tell the evil spirits that they can take our lives from us, BUT NEVER TAKE OUR FREEDOM!GIVEN TO US BY THE DEVINTS!"
Positive,An MMO that gives a lot of freedom and has lots of content that isn't boring.
Positive,"I was skeptical on purchasing this game because I never was really a bit MMO fan. I really did like Skyrim, and heard this wasn't exactly the same, but similar.I am pleasently suprised. Great combat system. You got the whole hack and slash like Skyrim then hot keys for your spells. Makes you feel like a battle mage. I always hated how much you had to switch your equoment around in Skyrim and this game fixes that issue I had.You still get the same feel of doing what you want and leveling up for it instead of just spending points on skills for leveling. Really gives you an option to try new things. For each class there is a few routes you can take for it, and you can use whatever weapon you want for it. Basically you get to play the character you want to play instead of feeling stuck into a role. You also get rewarded for playing your hand to hand combat skills which I like. It's not just a bunch of clicking on hot keys.The quests are nice and comparable to Skyrim as well. There is stories that fit into the lore, and avoid doing the whole collect this many or kill this many creatures.Graphics are pretty nice as well. You'll notice it is a lot less ""cluteered"" than Skymin, but I kind of expected that from a MMO.Can't wait to play more.Thumbs up."
Positive,"OMG.... I was and still am a huge fan of Skyrim which i played 3 times 230 h for each game .... Now ESO.... i played 200 hours so far and i bought the basic pack game for 9.99$ and i can't see the end of the quests yet, neither have i finish to explore most countries... Lordy lord o.O ... Loading each landscapes is way faster than with the old Skyrim ( do you remember how doors seems like an endless pit of doom ???... The waiting time in between loads was insufferable... Now it' s not...), the graphics in ESO are magnificent like in Skyrim with upgrades, so is the aesthetic ( a full region of carnivorous plants landscapes hell yes -- drools---). Others players are kind and can randomly help, harassment is so far for me close to zero. No misogynist comment. I don' t have friend request neither just by been around, never been insulted, never seen obscene players neither po*n or crude nudity. I do help others around too if i feel like it. Even if you help, you don' t lose your treasure, it's just doubled. Both get the bling at the end ...Except for outside natural resources like plants, random treasure chests, mining spots, glyphes and woods logs. Once someone takes it, it's gone for a few but there's plenty around and it does come back.  You can' t hear others players talk in the open, it's all a chat written communication system. Mouth noises are to be read only unless you are with friends on another platform ( Skype/ Discord/ Steam)!! Been a newbie doesn't feel like you have a red target on your back ( i am not a WOW Fan for that reason).Tho, big change in the character story.... I don t get so far if i'm a dovahkiin ( of dragon origin partially something like in Skyrim) maybe it will be brought up later...???...but never i interacted with a Dragon so far, might be in another world extension i don' t own yet. I don't know. I have released dragons in one of the ESO main quest...was a beautiful sight. and it seems it's a ""bad thing "" in the quest.... i don t know why ?? because i enjoy dragons, killing them made me sad especially in Skyrim and i do miss Paarthurnax's meditations and dragons friendly folks ...Big mystery so far about the dragons existence in ESO they are shining by absence ...Combats are more difficult but doable without cringing you are your own no share what ever group fight . You represent your own self even if you create a group with others players. When the creature to fight has a real name it's a sign you' ll have to be patient and focus and heal actively lol. Otherwise if you get the feels it's unbeatable, it's because you need more than just you to achieve it.  Otherwise i think ( ???) the game adapt the monsters to your level or to a suitable level. Don' t worry at first, you have sooo much options and having an inventory is 1% of hidden panels you have to manage in this game. After level 50 you are also introduced to the more complex constellations of skills advancement like in Skyrim.You can be a solitary player, you don t need ppl. You can also join a guild which i haven't tried yet. I usually stay away from ppl especially hew-mons. I do often try alone what is for ""groups aka many dungeons or group zone"" and i do die very frequently .... resurrecting over and over getting further down in the zone ....slowly like the persistent b*stard i do am.... Yes, you can totally fast run the dungeons cowardly till .....a door requires the minimal last monsters around to fight you for you to been allowed to escape with the treasure you soooooo strongly unfought for..... Make sure you make your own soul gems, it cost less and you' ll live 4 ever without that draining you financially ( gold pieces in game, not real money). Buy the empty soul gems at the mage guild or from a mystic store for 50 gp most merchants sell it for 150 gp it' s a scam lol  I do ""mage"" my way out like any healer low level is expected to do in those circumstances lol Group area alone ? Yeahhh  Done. Don't expect to kill bosses tho... Been a fierce headless chicken dungeoneer is an subtle art.I am totally happy with Eso. I don t feel like i need to spend a dime more in it, no monthly fee, no need to buy crowns in order to do essential quests, and unless you wanna look super-duper faaaaabulous or very peculiar eccentric, you don't need to put more than the 10$ basic game to Insure hoursss of game play....It' s a great investment in making sure you kill what is left of your social life.I m devouring it. And thank god it feels infinite...Precious ......My precious.....o.OPS: the game is huge in term of space it requires. Think more like 100 GB, not 80, there's updates downloads too and shut downs of server for maintenance ( not often and quite late/ early 4 am like for several hours. The void can be unsettling in those catastrophic times lol)... Enjoy !UPDATE: i'm a sorcerer level 230 and i'm not done with the quests, this is HUUUGE !!!UPDATE: I'm still a sorcerer level 780 and STILL not done questing XD so worth it !!"
Positive,"I really do enjoy this game. I'm by no means a serious gamer, I've only played 45-46 hours total and I've just recently reached level 17. Up to this point I've really enjoyed nearly every aspect of this game.Pros: -Great Graphics. The graphics are beautiful. Especially for an MMO. -Atmosphere. On multiple occasions I've found myself just sitting and enjoying the environment.-Crafting. Love the crafting, multiple styles, various traits, enchantment!-Very Large world to explore. Although divided into many zones. It takes quite a bit of time and effort to fully explore each zone. With bandit camps to raid, or caves to explore there is plenty of things to do.-Side quests. Numerous side quests to are fairly rewarding. -Character creation is pretty in depth. I'm happy that they didn't give players too much freedom. It ruins the immersion when a 9-ft tall Wood elf with an abnormally large head runs by.-Guilds. With the potential to be in up to 5 guilds gives you great options for socializing and other fun stuff.Cons-Mounts are bit tedious. After saving for a week and dropping 10K (which is quite a bit for low levels) you can get the starting mount only to find it isn't any faster than you are. (That is what is feels to me) It's more convenient to just buy some in-game currency and buy a mount to begin with.-Side Quests, although numerous can sometimes be pretty repetitive. Notice that nearly every area in each faction has a town in peril and you need to put out fires using a water bucket and save villagers. (But, I'm willing to save as many villages as needed if there is an reward at stake)-Voice acting. A bit dull in some cases, not to mention you can hear the same voice actor over and over again.There are other things I haven't experienced yet in the game such as alliance war and grouping for dungeons. The game is solid. Looks brilliant, plays brilliant, and has many new content to come. It's a great MMO"
Positive,1.bought the game2.realize there is no SEA server3.give up on being DPS because of lags4.play as a tank5. ???6. profit
Positive,"Best Mmorpg I've ever played. Between, Wow, perfect world, Allods, Swtor, guild wars, warframe, dragon's nest 1/2, and diablo series, if dark souls 3 counted, even that, and a few others. Bring in a smooth shapeshifting class and a few things wow has had going for it, and It will save me from ever paying for the next wow expansion. It's smooth, engaging.. feels like the Elder scrolls world. It looks great with a decent graphics card, has intense stories and pvp. The questing is better than any mmo i've played. The stories are interesting enough to be worth listening and enjoying your first playthrough. It feels almost like oblivion/skyrim (especially with the very worthwhile expansions like darkbrotherhood so you can kill npcs). Buy those, and it's free to play with those included forever. Were it not for mobs occasionally respawning within your time there and running into a good amount of players it would feel just like a single player game feels. But many people are friendly and help you in your adventures if you introduce yourself. World boss events and pve realm invasions happen, and you can easily help an adventurer that has gotten in a tight spot with one, and make a friend. The quests often change things, like enemies vs neutral or peaceful, or even who npc wise is visible/essentially existing. This makes for Amazing immersion. And they can be quite epic sometimes, between you getting kidnapped, betrayed, rewarded or knighted, serving the divines or many other adventures. You'll want to get the intimidate and persuade skills as soon as you can, fighter's guild and mage guild skills respectively. You might just want to be catching up to other friends playing the game, but you don't really need to. The ""leveling"" in the game pertains to the gear you can wear and how many skill points you have etc, but the base stats are the same at level 1 and everything is scaled enough that you'll be at least 1/3rd as powerful as your average max level friend.Which means even if he's carrying you, you won't get shredded on the battlefield and you should be able to help.This game now supports addons. I use skylike for better interactions with npcs, and center my character with combatcamera (some tinkering off and on until it works). A few others are nice too like the skyshard finder so you can power up the alts faster. The crafting addons are great for the crafters, and since crafting is so fun it's nice to make friends very powerful sets, and even level them to legendary with enough time spent.All around amazing game. There is so much to do. So many fun guilds, including mine now. The Houses in the game can be huge and have tons of customization options, including building extra buildings with structural materials. I recommend checking out ESO cribs on youtube to see all the amazing things people have made with there custom homes from scratch. These are frequently used for guild halls and have tons of options for craftings stations and all the essentials in one spot now, if someone invested the time and money. Guilds are fun for this reason, and you can cast an astral spell at any time to teleport to a friend or guild member. As you become more and more powerful, and decide to go competitive, you'll find there's around 1 million builds you could make. A true rpger's dream come true. I recommend checking out youtubers eso blob,  zombie prodigy, Deltia gaming, and Woeler, as these guys are the most professional, fun, efficient, competitive guide streamers I know of.Good luck, and welcome to the many realms of the Elder Scrolls."
Positive,"Great game, the amount of customization you can make from your armor colour to your house furniture, that's amazing.I bought the original Imperial Edition back when the game was just released and I was very dissapointed, after 1 month I was sure the game is going to die within 1 year, but I'm glad to see they made huge changes, new content, new combat system, much more co operating instead of single player, dungeons, I can't stop playing this game now :)"
Positive,"This game is good RPG, but this is not The Elder Scrolls.Pros:1. The map is large.2. Multiplayer, PVP, PVE.3. Clans, guilds, groups.4. Large selection of armor, weapons, races, мounts, pets, houses.5 Alliances.6. A lot of quests.7. Not pay to win.Minuses:1. Big price of game and add-ons.2. The plot is weak.3. Optimization is bad.4. The world is not as alive as in Skyrim.I recommend to play this game if you like to play with friends."
Positive,You really have to see this as a standalone MMO; rather than another Elder Scrolls installment.Amazing graphics & soundtrack.
Positive,My first mmorpg and i like mmorpgs after the elder Scrolls online
Positive,"My favourite MMO.This game has a great lore as well as an exciting and rewarding quest line. I bought this game upon release and have spent many hours questing, raiding, playing with friends and PvP-ing. Honestly PvP system is fantastic, this game is extremely popular and has a great commuity as well as a very active one. If you are questioning whether to get this game I would say yes, it is worth it."
Positive,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
Positive,"This game definitely wasn't a disapointment for me.I was running out of interesting quests at ES Skyrim when I finished the main story and Dawnguard & Dragonborn DLC stories. (Not to mention even those hundreds side quests I also finished.)Meanwhile I've been waiting for the next Elders Scrolls game, ES Online Tamriel Unlimited have been like a new drug for me. I could play it for hours and I keep finding a lot interesting stuff in-game.The game works very well as a solo player, but if you ever wished you could  be able to play Elders Scrolls games with friends, now it's completely possible. You are able to make a group with other players and go to the adventure together, go to play PvE at dungeons or fight against other players as PvP. Also you are able to join in 5 guilds as maximum.Did you ever want to become an emperor of Tamriel? In Elders Scrolls Online that's completely possible if you fight very hard for it. ;)"
Positive,"Buy it,if you have that extra money lying around and wanna become a mastercrafter and make this you're main MMORPG get the plus membership too(unlocks all dlcs,an infinite crafting bag perfect for mastercrafters plus increased xp gain and more),It'll be worth you're money promise! ;)Also one of the nicest communities out there always looking to help newcomers and guide them through eso's sometimes complex features.Some Tips;. Join a trading guild ASAP,perfect for making money like real bussiness(watch blobeso   youtube channel videos for the detailed tips!).. Install minion addon manager,and then get Master merchant(esstential for 1st tip),skyshards-   lorebooks-destinations(or map pins) addons atleast.. And don't pay for vampire(good for magic build) or werewolf(good for stamina build) bite,they're free and when you become one bite for free too ;) .Finally,there is no BEST way to play this game,play it like a story based elder scrolls game with descent campaign or go full on tryhard pvp player or both! Your choice.Enjoy!Edit:for autum nomination some years have passed but still this game amazes with it's world and artistic envirements <3"
Positive,"The most unique MMO I have ever seen in my life. This is one of those games where you really feel the world around you. This title is recommended not only to fans of the Elder Scrolls series, but mainly to players who are looking for challenges and a more arcade fight. :)Quests           7/10Dungeons      9/10Trials (raids)   6/10Battlegrounds 6/10Cyrodiil           8/10 (would be 9 or even 10, but servers are terrible).World             9/10 Music/Sound  8/10"
Positive,"At the time of writing this I am roughly around 180 hours in the game.When I first got into Elder Scrolls it was with Skyrim. Playing only that and none of the other previous games I was blown away with how detailed that game was. When I heard that a MMORPG was made with the same title I was very enthusastic. When I got Elder Scrolls Online, I was told it would not be ""Skyrim Online"", and to an extent, those whom mentioned it were correct. However my thoughts and feelings on that statement have changed quite a bit.After playing for as long as I have, which in comparison to many others, I have found this to be right at home with my previous experience with Skyrim. I absolutley love this game. I feel that it is totally worth the $60 price tag and I invite other open minded players to give this game a shot. There are many differences from the Single Player version of Elder Scrolls but all of the reasons I loved Skyrim are placed in this game.The ability to customize my character in any way I see fit, the endless caves, areas and places of interest to see. Fully voiced NPC's and endless hours of lore and other content for players to experience. Not to mention that NPC's reconize your heroic feats as you walk by them, often singing your praises and sometimes even questioning some of your actions that you have made in the game. In fact, there are many circumstances where I have had to make a tough decision and have spent much time dwelling after the fact if I made the right call. Should I have helped fight at the docks or was defending the fort the better call? The result might be the same but the fact that I even had to contemplate the lives of fictional NPC's that I would never meet again shows how enriching the plot can be.The PvP in my opinion is very hard, but very fun. I die often, but its not frustrating. Being able to team togeather with random strangers, plan an attack and take a fort seems like it would be difficult to do but everyone is on board and ready to play the game. They want to succeed as much as you and I found the community helpful and enriching, not to mention being able to use seige weapons is so much fun and adds a level of excitment I didn't realize was part of the game.In the non PvP side, I found most players to be felpful, friendly and very outgoing. I found a guild almost right away and in that guild was open minded Veteren players who wanted to help grow and encourage newer players. Often investing a lot of time and energy explaining various parts of the game such as Armor, Weapons, Skill's, ect. Even non guild members and complete strangers are often pretty nice. I can recall looking for a Werewolf Bite and after a few bad players asking me for a ton of gold and crafting materials in order to give me a bite, one player simple messaged me and say ""don't pay them anything, I will give it to you for free."" Not only that but he also gave me tips on how to complete the Werewolf single player quest.I plan on sticking with this MMORPG for a very long time. Its fun, its first person, its 3rd person and its live action. It has its faults, all games do, but if you can take things with an open mind and a grain of salt you will find much love for this awesome game. It wont ever be ""Skyrim Online"" but in many ways I really feel it is. A great story, great community of players, a big wide open world to explore with choices that are unique to your character. Seems pretty close in my opinion."
Positive,"A fantasy book in the format of an MMORPG. As a long time fan of the genre (games, books and films like LOTR, The Witcher, The Name of the Wind...) I'm really loving it!BTW you can play to the last level even with only the base game, the expansions (or chapters as they're called in ESO) are only more stories to live."
Positive,i give it 10/10 for money gouging.... prepare your credit card for battle..
Positive,big helmet skyrim
Positive,"One day, in the cold winter, I met an old man on my way. He told me about the big world of Skyrim, about deep forests, magical lakes and mighty mountains. My adventure began with the knowledge of pain, help and unknown monsters that reigned around me. Everyone I met talked about the legendary dragon! Having met him, my story did not end. For many, the world of The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim has become home!The Elder Scrolls Online A Huge World with Huge Opportunities! I am happy that the story of my journey continues, and now not alone, but with my faithful and beloved sorcerer wife. She will always show you the way and open up new corners of the world! The Elder Scrolls Online gives you the unique opportunity to travel together, grow together, craft together, and always have each other's back on the battlefield or in the dungeons.The Elder Scrolls Online conveys a wonderful world, how beautiful and rich it is, and at the same time, how dangerous it is for its inhabitants. The graphics convey a unique reality and at the same time make you believe in a miracle, meet an unidentified creature, fight it and get an artifact. Waterfalls, rivers and lakes will not leave anyone indifferent, and if you love fishing, then you will be happy to stop near the sea and enjoy fishing to the pleasant music of the location, and perhaps for your diligence it will reward you with caviar, which is not very cheap)))))The Elder Scrolls Online gives you the opportunity to be a thief) If you want to be a famous thief in the area, please! Level up the thieves' quests, gain their trust and you can easily steal a wallet from a cute townswoman and sell it for a pretty good amount of money ^_~The Elder Scrolls Online is a great way to craft! Alchemy, Jewelcrafting, Weapon and Armor Forging, Cooking and the most interesting are the back runes, thanks to which you gain additional strength or healing by inserting them into the weapon. This is unusual for me, as a fan of MMO games, this is the first time I’ve seen this in a game and it’s cool!The Elder Scrolls Online warms you with its warmth and comfort, welcoming you into any home you wish. Each house is unique in this game, diverse in its own way, it doesn’t matter if you have a small house or a big one, the important thing is that you have your own home in this game and people. who surround you!The Elder Scrolls Online is a unique game with another unique feature - Archaeology! This is an amazing profession, a skill through which you can get rich and at the same time find unique things for your home that you won’t find anywhere else, even with the best traders of the guild! Seize the moment and luck will definitely overtake you!The Elder Scrolls Online deserves a lot of praise! The game does not stand still, it is developing and delights all the inhabitants and people of this world with its new opportunities!I bet 10,000 Scrolls out of 10,000"
Positive,please play this game. i need more friend from malaysia. i hv no friend playing this game. im alone. :steamsad:
Positive,"Great game, lots to do, will keep you busy for a very long time. So much fun with friends or just solo the scenery and get those quests done ;)New Chapter's awesome.Play now!"
Positive,"This MMORPG stands out as one of the finest I've experienced. To further enhance your gameplay, consider using the Minion app, which offers a selection of fantastic legal addons (believe me you would need that). Additionally, don't miss the opportunity to join up to 5 guilds simultaneously, as the community is incredibly welcoming and always ready to lend a helping hand when needed.The game can be confusing at first but you will enjoy it :D"
Positive,"It's delivers a game that feels like a bigger elder scrolls game with a new and interesting take on Tamerial with a beautiful and vibrant countryside for you too explore. With in depth quests that can really surprise you with the way things pan out. The lore is really enjoyable and really immerses you into the game. The pvp is Arcadey and almost feels like a third person shooter which I prefer even though it isn't one. The pve on higher difficultly is challenging and has strategy's for you to understand, There are even puzzles and they are actually quite hard before you learn how to complete them. The game offers a ton of character customisation with good graphics in comparison to most other MMO's. So in my shared opinion this game is worth your time."
Positive,"Over 1200 hours i highly recommend this game, i met a lot of new and great friends but dont think its just like a massive multiplayer game 60% of my time im running alone doing alone dungeons and world bosses what made for groups if you want u can play trough this game from 0 to 100 all alone or co op with your best buddy im 100% sure you will have a great time in this game but its not like Skyrim you can be a hero, savior of Tamriel but you have to work for it not just running around and mommy will hold your hands and finish the game in 6 hours, i have all the dlc-s and chapters, all of them worth it, all the base game and chapter main quests is great some of them funny af, when you launch a dragon into outer space, beating MolagBal in SSJ2, and the top of that a tons of side quest im still not finished them all, you can learn a tons of skills can master a lot of different weapons even magic, the content is so much sometimes will give a headache for you :D when it does and need a bit of help just drop a msg or add me i will help. This game is one of the few whats never late to start,if you find this 5yrs later you still not late and the community is great, worth to keep this game in your library."
Positive,"I've spent hundreds of hours playing this game. It is a bit intimidating at first, especially getting into a guild and trying out vetern trials and dungeons, but overall a great mmo and a great tes game. I would highly recommend playing with friends, playing the game solo is fine I guess, but honestly just messing around doing emotes have been some of the best hours spent in game."
Positive,"Tried the beta and hated it. Gave it another go in the sales,  found everything i wanted in an mmo. 500 hours in and still finding new things to do.Great game"
Positive,Still level 10
Positive,"Arguably the best MMORPG game out there. Everything in this game is just amazing. It contains tons of content and you never get tired of it (can easily spent 8 consecutive hours on it). Even if you aren't into group content game provides you with vast variety of quests, zones that will alone take you 1500 plus hours to complete them all. What differs this game from other MMORPG is that in order to do quests you first have to dig in and explore its beautiful world and find them.Game also features in depth crafting and leveling system. The best thing about gameplay is that picking a certain class doesn't lock out gameplay possibilities. Each class can play each role (Tank, Healer, DPS)Would strongly recommended to anyone who liked past Elder Scrolls Tittles and/or is interested in MMORPG genre.Note: Throughout all my playtime I have been subscribed to ESO+ and thus your experience may be different."
Positive,"A big reason to why this game gets negative reviews is because people get this game expecting it to be something it's not.This is not Skyrim online. This is developed by Zenimax. This is NOT like the previous Elder Scrolls games. This is an MMO.But this is the best MMO. It's one of the best games I know. It is amazing, it has so much content. It has hundreds of quests. It has so much land to explore. At the moment I have over 800 hours of recorded play time, but I'm not even close to being done. And for the price they give us, that's an incredible deal.Don't buy this because you think it's gonna be Skyrim. It's like ordering a lasagna at a restaurant, and then when you eat it you're like ""Aw man, this doesn't taste like cake at all!"". Because it's not cake. It's lasagna. And lasagna is really good too, it's just not the same thing."
Positive,"im rewriting my review since alot has changed since the last time i wrote my review. Two DLCs have been added in the last 6 months, and have changed the game drastically for better. thieving around gives rewards, and there is an actual need to kill people in the game. Now for the overall game i have had a fun time playing and the commmunity is very friendly and helpful. I have found my self helping tons of ""newbies"" after a big sale on the game. This is probably the most ""RPG"" game i have ever played. Its not a pay to win unbalanced game like some games out there on the internet. This is the type of game where you can wear heavy armor and look like a knight while being a sorcerer. I hope you like the review have a good day :D"
Positive,Game ini sangat menghiburkan. /clap
Positive,1.6k hours?? by talos this can't be happening
Positive,"If you are a Skyrim fan then I need not tell you how this game is but for the rest this game is amazing, at first I was hesitant to get it because when it launched it was subscription based and that is the one thing I hate about games however, once they had released it to be free to play I then in a heartbeat bought it.It might be a bit pricy but it promises a lot of in game content in vast verities you can even imagine.8/10No harm in trying, one downfall so far is their patcher that is real slow when updating the game, other than that just give it a shot."
Positive,"I love the game, content in BASE game is worth the price of the game. ESO:TU does not require STEAM to play. go to ESO website and buy and play through ESO not steam = headaches. I put 5,097 hours into SKYRIM = WAS addicted, then along came a little BETA called THE ELDER SCROLLS ON LINE, DOWNLOADED IT and was impressed with what i did in the beta. I didn't buy the launched game until just before the really big update, i started Jan/29/2015 and i'm lovin' it, doing it my way more or less. My main character is now VR 2, still got 14 level-ups to go. ( August ??, 2015 - Veteran Ranks go up by 2 to VR 16) I Highly RECOMMEND this game. i'm even an ESO plus member = 180 day pack gets my 9,000 crowns to use in the crown store=very handy to have. i also get a 10% increase to XP gained + gold + IP + something else. PLUS i get the 1st DLC to launch in August 2015 for the price of my ESO plus membership. BUY the game = IT'S ALL ELDER SCROLLS TO ME.   remember BUY and PLAY through ESO and not steam."
Positive,Imagine if The Elder Scrolls series had a child with Runescape. The child would grow up to be TES:Online..
Positive,I'm having fun. It's a a vast improvement over how it was when I playtested it. Lots of stuff to see and do and kill in Tamriel.
Positive,My boyfriend got me addicted and now I have more hours than him already
Positive,its good. :D

Positive,I love the online game of The Elder Scrolls.Yes it was expencive but i've always hat a crush on the Elder Scrolls.If u are a fan of the old games u have to buy these... Ok at first I was confused about those other players fighting with me but its all clear nowxoxo
Positive,ESO is the best MMORPG game I ever played. Spend too many hours on it and playing it for years! Too much memories and still loving it until today!! Bought most DLCs from this game and definitely worth it! <3 <3 P/S: This one suggests you keep your eyes on your coin purse. The wood elves aren't to be trusted.███████╗░██████╗░█████╗░██╔════╝██╔════╝██╔══██╗█████╗░░╚█████╗░██║░░██║██╔══╝░░░╚═══██╗██║░░██║███████╗██████╔╝╚█████╔╝╚══════╝╚═════╝░░╚════╝░
Positive,"***MOST NEGATIVE REVIEWS WERE BEFORE TAMRIEL UNLIMITED*** (read this)I am a huge fan of The Elder Scrolls serial, every sequel offered months (noth hours) of fun and every next release offered something new but still very dedicated to original lore and basic game principles. After release of latest ""The Elder Scrolls Online"" i knew something is different. First of all, it became an MMO with consistent and ever changing world even more alive than before. That's a good thing but they also introduced the monthly subscription. You could not buy the game and enjoy it for ages, you had to pay for every month being in Tamriel (yes, the whole Tamriel, huge continent with all regions from the previous titles). Many players were complaining and i was refusing to even try it. After little more than a year my lost hope and lost love is back again. Zenimax and Bethesda presented Elder Scrolls Online - Unlimited edition with all that amazing stuff available withouth monthly subscription, until now they released 6 major updates that improves almost every aspect of the game. Trust me guys the price of 55eur is nothing compared what this game can offer. As a sidenote, all races are split in 3 different factions and each faction have it's own starting area and different story main quest. Crafting looks complicated in begining but you will understand it really fast if you give it a try. There is Enchanting, Blacksmithing, Woodworking, Clothing, Alchemy and Provisioning. Every type of crafting have it's own skill line so you should level up only what you really need if you don't wanna miss combat skills. Every weapon and armour, beside enchantment, can have an extra trait that will buff your character so with all of that crafting becomes really important part of the game.I could spend few hours writing about every aspect of the game so if you have some extra cash and a lot of free time to spare, buy it and try it. You won't be sorry for sure."

Positive,"Lovely MMO - visually stunning!I have always been a huge elder scrolls fan, back from the Daggerfall days, so I may be somewhat biased :PThe quest based system is classic Elder Srolls. The crafting system is such that you always have something to do - again it can get grindy but its an MMO come one guys :)All the classic elements of Elder Scolls combined with the social aspect of an MMO - its just perfect! I have spent many hours in game already and look forward to many many more."
Positive,"Awesome game, but DON'T BUY THIS ON STEAM. Login issues are happening very frequently, making it impossible for Steam users to play this game. Buy it on the ESO website."
Positive,this is a video game
Positive,"If you like mmo's and you like the elder scrolls universe you will most likely like this game. however, an eso plus membership is highly recommended for access to all of the games dlc's and expansions."
Positive,Do you Like the Elder Scrolls Universe?Do you like MMOs?if you can get past the weird combat this game is perfect for youmy Favorite MMO.
Positive,One of the most immersive and expansive game in Elder Scrolls for sure. Choices at the end of quests can really leave you thinking and there r just so many of them. P.S Log in issue on steam has been resolved so buying from here now should be ok.
Positive,"i wasnt a elder scrolls fan , in fact i didnt liked the skyrim frist time i played it (dont kill me i love it now ) but this one has many things that in my opinion was wrong with skyrim and what i really wanted from a mmo after i played world of warcraft of 3 years. it has better graphics , freedom , u can learn and finish the main story without needing 24 players for a 2 h raid and the side quests are again in my opinion better than wow but there are some things that missed from skyrim but they are developing the game and releasing new dlcs and making things right . i personaly recommend it <3 8/10."
Positive,"Rating: 8/10This is just an overview about the negatives of this game, some people might have wrong presumptions about this game so I wanted to clear them out first. In short this is very incredible mashup of several MMO related stuff which people enjoy, it has great story quests, big open world, pvp, raiding.First of all i want to make this clear this game is not comparable to WoW reasons being the raiding is not as polished. The endgame consists of interesting trials with varying difficulties which are essentially very fun however they are very limited in numbers. The other negative is the balancing of classes, abilities in this game which vary from patch to patch a lot, a lot of endgame players have been complaining stamina builds of DK, sorcs, templars pretty much play the same, there is nothing remarkable to distinguish them however if you like nightblade then you're gonna enjoy its stamina build which is completely different. The third negative would be the paywall which comes with the release of new content, with every DLC release the meta changes and the best items ""may"" drop from the new DLC however that is actually limited to players who want to play this game casually and still want to be in the meta. However ESO gets away with this, reason being not every meta gear drops from DLC or expansion, and its not important that all classes' best gear would drop from new expansion."
Positive,"This game is good and has a good dynamic playstylethe story is good and if u r a elder scrolls fan its going to give u so much entertianment and there is no difficult grind u can phase ur self and enjoy the game. It has so much stuff that if u get tried of one thing u can get totally get hooked with other thingslike crafting, dungeons, trials and pvp and pvp raids Imperial city pvp and so onAND!They found the absolutely BEST way to ruin it all and that is with their servers Steam players have so many login issues with their every update and it getting worse and we dont even get a response if the problem is with the steam side or their sideThis is only half of the issue and if u r playing in the EU server(they only have 2 servers NA and EU) u get the worst treatment. The EU server has maintainance around the peak time of the players and they do maintainance once a week. The EU server problems dont get treated until they get serious (like players continuous disconnects). FINALLY!! BUY FROM THEIR WEBSITEIf u like the game and want to play and can afford to buy from their website then go ahead and buy there. As i said here they dont even check the steam forumsDont worry about having to install a launcher it worth it to buy from their website.and another thingThe game downloads 80gb in steam and another 10-20 gb from their launcher before u could play the game. So be prepared when u r downloading.HOPE THIS REVIEW HELPS!!!Update:Positives: Graphics are good Excellent Soundtrack Fully Voiced Rich lore filled stories Gigantic map with lots of interesting quests Good Dungeons Raids are good Buy to Pay modelNegatives: Worst Performance Servers in the Industry with random ping spikes and de-syncs Clunky Combat which requires animation cancelling to do required DPS DPS is heavily dependent on the Ping(<50 ping is needed for optimal DPS rotations) All zones in the maps feel the same way => No innovative game-play => Go through the World Bosses, Delves, Public Dungeons => No WOW moments(even world bosses don't feel threatening) => New Zones are re-skinned versions No centralised Trading System => Guilds have to bid their gold into oblivion to win a trading spot Option to buy DLCs with in-game gold => There is only GIFT system in the Crown Store => No system to make the Crowns to in-game gold possible => Easy to get scammed  Optional Subscription System breaks the whole Trading game => Gives Craft bag and access to DLCs => Craft bag is a must for the number of materials in the game Unbalanced and core problems with Battlegrounds(PvP), Imperial City(better PvP but has the same problems) and Cyrodil(Large scale PVP) Necromancer can't have summons => No pets but Sorcerer gets pets => They can't code a good pet system so gave up on pets for Necromancer If you are from the Asian Sub Continent and Oceanic. Don't bother with the game even with VPNs. I have already tested with all the VPNs and you can find a lot more information in the forums.Finally, I only recommend this game for lore and quests if you can bother with the occasional ping spikes and de-syncsWarning with story, there is some stuff different from the The Elder Scrolls Single-player games"
Positive,"Leveling isn't very fun. Graphics are absolutely excellent for an MMO, so is the gameplay. Storylines are pretty bad, but some of them (Summerset, mainly) are actually pretty good. Overall the story isn't SWTOR good but it's also not FFXIV bad. Endgame is incredibly challenging, beyond that of any MMO I've ever played. But it's still clearable with hard work. The endgame is the best part of the game in my opinion.Hit me up if you're interested - I feel like the only way that someone wouldn't like this game is if they are introduced to it the wrong way."
Positive,"Best MMO out there in my opinion. I am a fan of story and the amount of content for this game is ridiculous. I will admit the environments are grand but the character models, weapons and armor are aesthetically lacking. The main way to distinguish yourself via armor and weapons is buying crowns. To be honest, it feels like all the new MMO's are subscribing to this model."
Positive,"It was the long-awaited game, and she did not disappoint my expectations ..."
Positive,Great game but it's take a lot of time...!
Positive,"If you like Elder Scrolls you must have ESO Tamriel Unlimited(just do not expect it Skyrim online :)). Interesting storyline and a long, side q is also interesting,many group dungeons and trials.Cyrodiil very large map with lots of castles for those who love the massive PVP. Nice graphics and music. Only to buy the DLC, or any additions, it is quite expensive. After more than 1,200 hours in the game, I can say that the game is very addictive, with very friendly players community.Highly recommend :)"
Positive,"I first played this game after it's Beta and I have to say, they made great changes. At this moment, ESO is the most player-friendly, story rich, exciting game that you can enjoy both as an mmo AND a solo adventure. The game won't make you a slave of it where you become a mindless zombie doing the same things everyday and still feeling forced to get online. On the contrary, ESO is full of different content and different ways to do them. They add a lot more to story every year with a big expansion and 3 new DLCs. Also, ESO+ is a big opportunity to catch on everything past as it delivers all DLCs and old expansions too."
Positive,"One of my all-time favorite games.  With its ever expanding, massive world--paired with great voice acting, top notch lore, and one of the friendliest, least-toxic communities in the genre, ESO is objectively one of, if not THE best MMORPG on the market.  Welcome to Tamriel in the Sixth Century of the 2nd Era-- a time before Septims.  All I can say is pick this up on a free-weekend and try it out.  Only advice I have to give is to bring a friend if you can, or make new ones in game if not!    P.S.  WoW players may be turned-off by the combat system in ESO which requires you to be actively engaged in the battle, reacting to the enemies around you, and not just munching on Doritos while your PC auto-attacks for you.  Cartmans of the world, you have been warned!"
Positive,"I've clocked in over 500 hours since the game launched in April, I've only one VR14 toon and a handful of lower level alts. I've recently bought the game on Steam to add it to my Steam collection.The game isn't without it's flaws, from launch it was beset with issues such as bugged quests, gold selling spam - all the usual fare for an mmo. Add to that the fact that the product (rightly or wrongly) didn't meet the inflated expectation of rabid Elder Scrolls fans, missing key aspects like crime, justice, open exploration and even sitting in chairs, and a lot of people were disappointed.However, this is not Skyrim 2. It's an mmo.I've been playing mmos for many years now, I've experience in subscription, B2P and F2P models. I've played sandbox, theme park, action mmo and a few other more obscure ones too. In my opinion, this ranks as one of the best mmos on the market today, period.Why? It's gorgeous for a start. The quests and story are engaging (more so if you turn off the NPC chat text using an addon I have installed - really helps you focus). Crafting is intricate and actually means something - some of the best gear in game is crafted, it goes toe-to-toe with world drops. Trading is a lot of fun, the absence of a global auction house, favouring instead a segmented guild store system means you have to think about the best markets open to you, it's a mini-game all of its own. The combat is okay, I like the action style and the minimal hotbar. They're also bringing in combat updates with the next patch to improve combat animations and a lot of the skills.The most important thing for me however, is how accessible the dev team are. I recently spent time playing Archeage, one of the most poorly managed western releases I've ever had the displeasure of playing. Devs were unreachable, community managers were silent or hateful - it was a complete mess. Here though, ZOS do everything they can to manage expectations, respond to concerns and are refreshingly open about the future of the game. Add to this that they've responded excellently to fan suggestions and it's a great mmo to play in.A lot of the updates over the past eight months have brought the game a long way - added guild kiosks to make items publicly available for purchase, a dye system, dungeon scaling, and the upcoming crime/justice system are just a few of the additions which make this mmo far superior to any of it's themepark peers.Yes there are still issues, but an mmo is always a work in progress. This game has come a long way since release, and the road ahead will bring further improvements and a lot of exciting new mechanics to the world of Tamriel.Looking forward to 2015 - can't wait to see what comes next!"
Positive,I find this game to be extremly addictive and fun but needs to have lots of time invested into to get anywere in the story or world. Despite me living in Australia and playing on North American servers i have little to no latency issues and i get 150 KB/S download speed on my internet. so in short would recommend.

Positive,"One of the best mmos with a ton of content, especially if you’re a new player.  I’m over 600 hours into the game and still have numerous expansions/dlc to go through! There is also a numerous amount of quests that are all fully voiced, making me less likely to skip through unlike other mmos with walls of text. To experience most of the game, I would recommend waiting until Gold Road comes out, which would give you all previous expansions."
Positive,"a player from asia here , if u have new to this game and u are from asia , pick EU server than NA , because EU has better ping than NA server for us, is about 100 ping lower.."
Positive,"I Love this game! Great MMO! and the best of all is Siege battles!They removed the subscription, which made the game so much better."
Positive,Spent many hours of fun in here
Positive,"Very good game, lot of to do, if u have team who will be there constantly, its really good"
Positive,eons of entertainment
Positive,"Issue FIXED via ESO Store. Thank you Bethesda. For the amazing game and the awesome community. 😁🙏""hi, I just tried to purchase the 79.99$ Bundle that Includes Base Game, Morrowind, Summerset + Elseweyr pre-purchase. ... It says I'm not eligible , probably cause i have Base Game? Is this a Joke?... so as a new player you get all for 79.99 and as a returning player i have to buy everything separately or with crowns, ending up to be 124.96$ .... I dont get it. Is this a mistake? or u guys did this on purpose? This is first game to do this: Disadvantage returning players!!!Please help and fix. Thanks"""
Positive,"First off let me start by saying this is not skyrim, Think of it as an Elder Scroll MMO! :)As you can tell with my hours spent on the game and have leveled 4 toons to level 40+ atleast I can't get enough of it!This game is amazing! I've played World of Warcraft for almost 4 years (yikes) then finally had enough of it (about time) and stumbled apon this game in march when it became B2P (Buy to Play model)after putting in nearly 400hours I've yet to come across a quest i do not find intrest in! EVERY NPC WILL TALK TO YOU. and you can actually make desicions in the game!  - one quest i forgot the area but the objective was to retrive this scroll for a mage so she could unlock the keep door where the mayor of the town or what ever was hiding. The point is i couldn't obtain this scroll due to some maniac casting lightning at me so i ran up to him and after hearing why he was going nuts with his new found power i had a choice to calm him down (he lives) or push him off the edge.. (he dies) I pushed him and lol'ed for an hour XDThe game is great, the quests never become a bore, your class is barly restricting, (my main is a woodelf archer who likes to smack you with a two hander and sometimes heal in dungeons) ha! and there are updates every month the game went from buggy as shit. To something that is stabeling out and regrowing it's player base!Welp there is my two cents!"
Positive,"Preamble: My Steam account shows 89 hours and last played on Aug. 10th. Not so. I cant say whether it was a patch or the launch of Win10 since they happened within a couple days of each other but many people suddenly had an issue with the launcher being stuck in an endless loop of wanting to repair itself. It took three rounds with customer service (who responded the same day each time) and was able to fix the problem but the .exe icon on my desktop was seperated from Steam. Not a big deal to me personally.On with the review:As many have said, this isnt Skyrim, its an MMO. If your looking for a stand-alone experience and the depth of immersion that comes with it, then opt for Skyrim. That being said, as someone who`s mmo history began shortly after the release of EQ1, Im having a great time with this one having only reach the tender age of level 26.Different people have different ideas of whats fun in an MMO and ESO allows for this (within its reative sphere). You can run solo or find a group. Im playing solo and the few time Ive run into a situation where I needed help all I had to do was chill for 10 minutes and someone comes along and we both tackle the baddie and go our seperate ways with no more than a wave. ESO is set up where you can get acheivement credit for a boss as long as you do some damage during the fight. No need to group if you`d rather not. *I think I read early on that with the main bosses you have to do a certain % of damage to get any loot, but I`d need to revisit the forums to verify that.You can run the quests or grind to veteran rank asap. Ive been doing all the main and side quests and can say Im thoroughly enjoying the journey. Ive found them well written (some really so), engaging and never so long that the feeling of moving along is broken. The rewards offer xp and loot, and have provided me with all the armor and weapon upgrades the PvE enviroment needs.Every character can equip any weapon or armor but choices matter..and your personal playstyle matters, and can be pretty well accounted for.  Speaking of choices, the character development system is pretty darn ok imo. You aquire points along the way that are applied to both traits and skills. Its easy enough to quickly grasp and deep enough that you will catch yourself chewing your lip over just where to drop that point into. There`s never enough to go around (thats a good thing) so what you choose WILL effect how your toon grows. That being said, the system is forgiving enough that you discover you messed up you can bring things back around within a couple levels usually and if youve completly dropped the whole basket of eggs you can pay in-game gold to reset it all and reapply the points all over again.There are loads of character build guides available and lots of people use them. Personally, I looked at them just long enough to understand the principles and havent looked back. I want my own character (with all its strengths and faults), not another clone.The crafting system is robust enough to hold its own imo. Ive been plugging away at all it offers and am only now getting that ""ahh, ok. I get this"" understanding about what it takes to make the armor sets.Blacksmithing, alchemy, enchanting, woodworking, clothing, cooking. There`s enough to keep you going and some of this stuff has actual in-game relevance *gasp*.The download times for the patches and initial purchase can be a bit brutal, so dont buy this thinking to start playing in a couple hours. The game itself took me a solid 24 hours to DL.Its an mmo and not a single player, so the graphics are geared for an mmo. They arnt the photo realistic quality some people now demand but ya know, my PC is over 5yrs old now so Im running on low settings and it still looks darn purdy."
Positive,"Well, here I go again making another review. This time for The Elder Scrolls Online.Well, As freakish fan of the saga I have to say, I was afraid that a MMO experience would ruin a TES game. But fortunately, this is not the case. However, there are a few displeasing details, like some combat physics and such. But they are not really important.Well, they did it. They actually managed to unite TES and MMO in one single game, with a good result and with a good balance in the components. It feels that way to meRewarding exploration, delving dungeons, blacksmithing, enchanting, sneak upon your mobs, block the enemy attacks with your shield, jump over the mountains without following a single road, Public and group instances, Lots and lots of Skill trees, Guilds, PvP, sieges. Main quest and LOTS of side quests. You mention it, ESO has all the ingredients of both TES and MMO games to offer. And you can play it the way you want. However, there are some dissapointing features such as no horseback combat (Which was avaliable even in TES II: Daggerfall and TES V: Skyrim). I think not allowing PK or PVP other players outside Cyrodiil is a total success for the experience of the game, specially in early game. However, as a newbie I personally wouldn't mind the possibility to challenge or be challenged by other players to a duel (Always voluntarily via request of course.)The lore has been respected as a whole, more or less. And there are new additions and easter eggs. Sometimes I forget that this is the 2nd era whatsoever. Some of the alliances doesn't make a lot of sense. But is the only way to have 3 solid blocks towards the center of Tamriel. Rather suspicious we can't go to Elsweyr or Alinor (That sure gives a hint to Elder Scrolls VI)I don't have a very good PC and my Internet connection is not that good either, in fact, I play this on a I3 intel processor laptop and it goes fairly good. They did a good job with thatThe crafting system on the other hand is absorbing and very demanding, but also very rewarding both on a personal and ingame scale. It requires a lot of commitment and investment (Skill points you could use to develop your combat skills). Perhaps you'd rather make another character to deal with your crafting issues. Since you can share ALL your objects among them. Also, there ir a e-mail ingame system to send objects to your friends without the needing of make your characters meet and trade.The soundtrack was created by Jeremy Soule as well, is good and alll. But I guess it lacks that special something to me, it doesn't sound very ""TES"", it sounds more like a generic MMO, but whatever.And that's all for now, I'm just a level 12 templar in the Daggerfall covenant, but I'm sure as hell that I want to commit to this game. I totally recommend it."
Positive,"After playing for 26 hours of the game, I can definitely say I've already gotten 9.90 worth of entertainment, so I bought the game. If you like mmo's and don't have a stick up your butt, you probably will enjoy the game."
Positive,The devs are so nice  :)10/10 would ban people on the offical streams for complaining about PvP and server issues again
Positive,if your sense of pathfinding is weak (like me) you'll spend hours running around on the map
Positive,they best buy to play mmos out their no pay to win features. as you can tell from my hours i love this game it had a rocky start buy was able to overcome it and have a special place in my heart.
Positive,wasting my life away slowly over time. 10/10
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls® Online: Tamriel Unlimited™This is a good game shortly. It is not like any other MMO game. Subscriptions, they do not effect the gameplay and many mmos have them.. Cartel Coins, you wont have as much fun and wont have cool stuff. I have played this game without a subscription and it is still the same, but you get to do more stuff without them. This game needs a lot, I mean a lot of space, that is small bad thing. Overall it is a good game, you should try it if you like mmo games even a little. You will have many and many good time plying this.Grade for this as mmo game: 9/10"
Positive,"Simply put: it's a good game and it's worth the money.For months I was in doubt wether to buy this game or not due to the negative reviews. When it went on sale for 21 euros, I got it and it is magnificent. It would have been worth it even at full price. I say this will be enjoyed by someone who has played the series since the days of Daggerfall, and has had a great time on World of Warcraft.ESO has the depth of Daggefall (circa), the gameplay of Morrowind, and the graphics somewhere between Skyrim and Oblivion. The small issues are, by far, outshun by the depth of this game. The list of things to do is endless.I can't stand that this game still suffers from the inital negative reviews that no longer represent the quality of the product: Yes, It's worth your money, don't be afraid. Go get it."
Positive,"Don't be fooled by the game time on Steam, this is my second ESO account since I picked it up on sale, I usually play via a Bethesda account only.Premise:I'm sure I don't have to introduce anyone here to Bethesda or the Elder Scrolls franchise. However, from the perspective of someone who hasn't finished a single Elder Scrolls game before hitting up their MMO offering and tried most MMOs from Europe to China (I am talking about the ones that aren't translated at all, too) and was always looking for an MMORPG to hold his interest (since starting Nostale when I was 12 years old, I was hooked on the concept), I can say that this is an absolute gem and no other exclusively online title has ever took me in so much.Visuals: While this game is not too demanding hardware-wise, it looks totally stunning. From the sun rays to the textures, from the mounts to the small items that exist solely to be stolen, the graphic quality never fails to amaze me. This game does a lot with a little and while some quirks exist here and there, in general it's a sight to behold. Audio design: Booming and semi-realistic. I consider this one of the strongest sound designs in any MMO. There is simply nothing that seems out of place. It makes me put on my headphones to truly enjoy it and neither me nor my guildmates listen to music instead of the ingame sound, which is rare.Controls: This is what makes or breaks an MMO for me. Implement tab-targeting combat and I may get bored easily, depending on how dynamic combat feels. I dislike standing around and mashing my rotation. Luckily, you get none of that in The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited. You have a free targeting system that soft locks when you face the enemy. You have a little margin of error, which makes some maneauvers easier - which is probably what was intended in order to implement the game on consoles. And here we come to the one big problem I see - the amount of skill slots. I would feel extremely limited if this game would work like other MMOs do. But fortunately, it does not. The amount of procs via passives, armor pieces or even pets (in the widest sense) provide you with a lot of flexibility.PvE: Extremely rewarding and challening at times, while being very fair. There is very little RNG to speak of that would make the game more about luck than skill and equipment. A lot of the dungeon bosses have mechanics in place that require coordination which makes the combat feel even nicer.PvP: A masterpiece when it comes to Cyrodiil, simply because it feels so epic. You have to attack or defend the strongholds currently held by your faction (Aldmeri Dominion/Ebonheart Pact/Daggerfall Covenant) and can use all kinds of siege engines to accomplish this. From pouring hot tar down the stairs to bashing the gates in, you will surely not be disappointed - unless you have a weak machine, that is. Cyrodiil is rather demanding and tends to be a lagfest, which can be combated up to a point using plugins.Final verdict: It's on sale right now! BUY IT.Even for the regular price it is absolutely worth it's money. However, you might find yourself wanting to buy the Gold Edition or subscribe to ESO Plus - both very viable options. Especially considering you get 1500 crowns/month of ESO Plus, this is a pretty clever move to get access to all of the DLC as long as your membership lasts.This review written by a curator for Canis Majoris"
Positive,"EDIT: Over additional years that I've played this game the ESO-Steam link has improved, so we don't get additional downtime anymore. I've decided to change my review to ""recommended"". If you're into MMOs, definitely give ESO a go when you have a chance and it's discounted. However, be mindful that any serious crafting is very challenging to do without having an unlimited material storage that only comes with ESO+. If you're looking for a casual experience, then you can totally ignore this point. In addition, I would still recommend getting the game through the official website rather than Steam if you don't want to deal with additional hassle. Happy gaming!The amount of hours I've put into this game tells I like it quite a lot in general. In fact, this installment of ES did not dissapoint me game, world and story-wise. The positive sides are many.-> The world is vast and beautiful, there are numerous zones and each has its beauty-> The graphics are very good for an MMO (if you play on high, medium settings are too blurry and can hurt your eyes if you have a big screen)-> The story content is exciting and rich-> The character creation is easy and versatile and allows you to create exactly the type of a character you want-> The additions like outfit and house system are a nice touch and cater to the players who like to spend their time not only on warfare and tradingHowever, there is a huge BUT. The technical side of ESO is a complete mess.Even if we don't mention the game's numerous bugs, we see that every tiny update and almost every event completely breaks the game for Steam users, at least for PC EU server. Players can't login for days, not even hours. And since many of us buy ESO+, I find it impossible to rate the game positively until maintenance takes days."
Positive,"ESO is great and all and I love the PvE but It gets tiring after a while with the game constantly crashing.Character Creation? Crash. Enter a Dungeon? Crash. Epic fight? Crash. I've tried a few of the recommended ideas online to help with the crashes but unfortunately it hasn't really helped me. I think when the game becomes more bug free and more stable, I'll definitely be coming back to play it. (I've been playing it a lot longer than the 2.8 hours it says on Steam.)"
Positive,"Best MMO out there that doesnt look like a cartoon like WOW, lot of things to do end game and challenging Veteran trifecta and Trial. After 2182hrs i have all the skyshard on my main and still have some maps to finish and a lot of achievements for dungeons, trial and arena to complete."
Positive,"My favorite thing to do! Where I'm coming from: huge TES fan, not a big MMO fan, I love it but can see where people that don't are coming from. IMO it does some things worse and some things better than main series TES games (much likes other TES games).Strong points:- Exploration is top-notch, the world is packed full of interesting places, probably more ""unique"" places to find than most TES games. There are lots of hidden little things and you're well-rewarded with new abilities by finding all of them. And the world is giant, probably 5 times the size of Skyrim.- Melee combat feels great. It's visceral, fast-based, and the addition of weapon skills gives a melee character a lot more tools.- The world feels like Tamriel, and the atmosphere (a few flubs aside) is generally excellent. Especially in the newer content--Orsinium and Hew's Bane (Thieve's Guild) were on par with anything Bethesda has done IMO. They nailed the music throughout.- Quests are better than Skyrim, probably about as good as Oblivion. Lots of variety from dungeon-crawling quests to town-focused mystery-solving quests. They're intricate, multi-part, and lots have good stories. Relatively few ""collect 10 X"" quests, almost all of which can be skipped without missing anything.- The crafting system is much better than other TES. Tons of different styles, traits, and special set bonuses obtained by crafting at certain locations in the world.- The lore is the best since Morrowind.- They're better at writing unique/interesting characters than Bethesda.- The 4-man dungeons, special stealth-based Thieve's Guild ""heists"", and Cyrodiil PvP are great and feel epic. The multiplayer content is where the game really shines.- They're pumping out a lot of content really fast.Weak points:- Immersion is good for an MMO but not as good as a normal TES. Especially for the crimes system, which has a number of exploits and is more gold-grinding oriented.- Magic and spell diversity is much more limited (hotbar gameplay).- Way too many storylines focused on evil cultists, and a decent amount of the main story falls into familiar tropes and retreads Oblivion. Newer content is better at this, but there's still a lot of quests where you're like ""Oh... really? They turned out to be cultists again?""- Not much sandbox-style gameplay, or FPS gameplay with hitboxes. Bows feel floaty and like they don't have much impact.- I play PC, but Xbox is supposed to be pretty much unplayable right now due to memory leak issues when they upgraded the game to DirectX11... So, they may be exceeding their development capabilities with their quarterly DLC schedule.My verdict: definitely worth trying if you're a big TES fan or a moderate TES fan who likes MMOs. Probably worth waiting for One Tamriel & Gold Edition, the new DLCs are excellent"
Positive,is good but no one is going to read this anyways
Positive,good MMO its legit just skyrim but online with different classes to pick from and different play styles kina dark soul ish with the bosses because youl need friends or other online players to defeat them hehehe
Positive,"Nice game, really brings back memories of Elder Scrolls 3"
Positive,"Before I played this i had a big penis, two girlfriends and a lot of will to live. None of these things have changed, so I have no idea if this game is good."
Positive,"I'd say, pretty good MMOPRG. Easy to play, hard to master. Content is plentiful, but sometimes can feel a little bit tedious. Especially quests, yeah. Writing is... good? I guess. Voice acting is top notch tho. No pay to win, but loads of pricey DLC with new areas. It's completely optional, so, not a big deal for me. Worth the time and money, IMO."
Positive,"How I feel about this game: For those of you wanting to buy this game, heres what I will say to youIf you love MMO's and want to start a new MMO to waste your life on (like me) Don't do it, you will be fairly dissappointedIf you love the Elder Scrolls series as much as I do (Played every one of them) Why are you still reading this? Buy it now.This game as an MMO is decent, however it's grindy, and if you like grindy MMO's like Tera, you'll love this MMO, however I could be caught up all the way to a quest where I fight level 15 enemies and only be level 9... Dear christ why...As and Elder Scrolls game it's beautiful! I love how they put together to where all the story lines from every elder scrolls game (except Skyrim) make more sense than before. Pros:-Fun-Smooth-problems it had in beta are gone-Good Graphics-Pretty Interesting questlinesCons:-Needs Cross Platform (Future Patch I hope)-Grindy as all hell8/10Good Job Zenimax/Bethesda (PS for you people who are like ""ITS NOT ELDER SCROLLS BETHESDA DIDNT MAKE IT"" ZeniMax is a company owned by Bethesda you neanderthals.)(PSS: You will want to get MODS for the game, UI mods and mods telling you the buffs and debuffs you have. I have put a link to the website I got my mods in http://www.esoui.com/addons.php and I also got mods here http://www.curse.com/teso-addons/teso ) Enjoy! ^~^"
Positive,"I was really on the fence about wasting money on this game........ so many opinions... heres mine in a nutshell:Ok so this game is not Skyrim, not as in depth for role playing ( no housing or sitting at benches, lots of static clutter etc) and the fighting is a little less ummm ..... more auto aim and button smashing. but it is not as bad as I thought it would be, blocking and timing seem to still be important and feels fun in its own way. Unfortunately my favorite weapon (the bow)has been turned into a long range spell cast sort of, a major turn off for me, just my opinion.So those are my immediate takes on this game so far, I am not a power leveling person, nor am I the ultimate build sort of player, I am the type of player that aimlessly wanders around looking for shiny things and seeing how far I can wander and what I can find. I just sort of play a character, and dont necissarily have an end goal. So far I am really enjoying this game, so it is not as immersive or as deep as the single player E.S. titles and as far as rating it as an mmo I dont play mmo so wouldnt know how bad this one is..... What I did notice right away is that although this game is not as deep as a typical es game there are some nice touches that I noticed right away and really liked, things like other players milling through a pack while looking at there inventory, or looking at a map when .... well looking at there map. Also the little animations when doing things like harvesting, or opening a container or auto unequiping weapons first... those are all things I have modded into skyrim! So those little details are nice.. Oh and footprints in the snow thats nice too. I have found books to read bugs to catch potions to brew, meals to prepare that do have some usefulness ( at least at this early stage) fishing, and of course what i feel is a nice ( compared to skyrim) expansion of crafting. I hear alot of people complain about how long it takes to get from one point to another, so they are upset the world is too big? Well for my personal taste i dont use fast travel in Skyrim so walking everywhere is no big deal to me I like to explore every nook and see every tree along the way collecting stuff between quests, and when my character deserves it or can afford it I will buy a horse.  Any way thats my take on this game so far, I wont lie I only bought it because it was on sale, and hopefully it will remain entertaining through the upper levels.........Oh and I guess I should say so far I really like the look of the game too, not over the top but very nice ! and being able to hide the hud is nice too...... i guess its the little things."
Positive,"play it if you are not an Elder Scrolls fanThis game is growing on me now. I disliked it at first bc the playstyle is completely different compared to the other singleplayer TES games', limited and repetitive. I hate the fact that eso plus aka crafting bag is still a must-buy if you really want to get into this game. BUT...other than that, the game is actually quite good. You can almost solo the whole game, treat it like singleplayer. I wasn't expecting much from story bc it's just a mmo but after months of playing it I have to say, the story and dialogue writing of this game is way way better than most modern singleplayer rpgs. The lore is intriguing and I absolutely enjoy every bit of it. I only made one character bc i liked to pretend that's me. I just immerse myself and enjoy the zones without rushing through them.After experiencing enough modern video game story-writing, this game gave me such a relief. Even the most boring stories and characters are above 2024 average. I'd pick boring characters over cringey, annoying, unlikeable characters any day."
Positive,"This game is amazing. Despite what the majority of reviews say during the time I am writing this, this game is still great.A new update has come out recently that made it even more fun, you can now go anywhere is the game right off the bat.People say the support in the game isn't that great, though as long as you try not to do anything stupid you will not need support. At the time of writing this I have 300 hours in steam alone, I have not once needed to ask for support.The PVP works fine, although it is kind of difficult because some people are really good.The download is rather large, and the Steam download is not very helpful. You should download the launcher from the actual ESO website and download it there. Yes, the game is large, but people who complain about download time don't realize everyones has different internet speeds.AnywaysYou start by creating a character, you can choose from one of 3 factions, each with 3 races, and 4 classes.The game takes place in the world of Nirn, the continent of Tamriel. Tamriel has 3 factions, The Ebonhart Pact, The Dagerfall Covenant, and the Aldemeri Dominion.This leads into PVP where these three factions fight for their alliance leader for the center, Cyrodil.There is so many thing you can do in this game. I know it feels overwhelming in the beginning, we have all been there.NOTE: This game is NOT like traditional Bethesda games, one thing to keep in mind is this is a MMO.Update for Autumn sale"
Positive,Love the game and quite addictive! Steam version really isn't as bad as people claim.
Positive,My favorite RPG game :)

Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is one of the few MMOs I've played where I find myself coming back after completing the main quest lines. Where other MMOs are grindy and have basic lame quests, ESO shines because when you make a new character the main quest and location changes slightly to fit the lore of that race. ESO is also one of the only MMOs I bother making a second character to just play as something else, instead of others where you just sink all your hours into one OP character. ESO's champion point system is also what makes me come back and make new characters."
Positive,"I haven't played an MMO since World of Warcraft, but decided to give this one a try.  For the steam sale price it was a good deal and I don't have to pay subscription fees.  There is a lot to do in the game and it doesn't feel like grinding because the quests are pretty unique.  Best of all, you have the Elder Scrolls story and environment, first person view option, and excellent voice acting for NPCs.  Overall I think they have done a good job with this one.The one issue I did have was with the DirectX 11 rendering, so I had to change the config file to use DirectX 9 rendering.  After that I no longer had black screen issues caused by the driver crashing.  Other than that it feels like a pretty solid game."
Positive,"100% Recommend the game. I personally haven't been having log in issues like many are complaining about, but I did link an older account of mine to steam so that's probably the reason behind that. If you are worried about that, simply buy the game from the website and if you still want it through steam, buy it here when its dirt cheap and link the accounts. Either way, this MMO is great. Has flaws like everything else out there, but plenty of good things going for it to override the bad. Love the game and love playing with friends. The community is a very friendly one as well. Willing to help in almost any situation."
Positive,I only played for a bit but it seems alright.
Positive,16 hours of playtime: I fell asleep with the launcher open while it was taking forever to get all the patches installed. Haven't actually played yet. Would recommend if you love downloading things.
Positive,"10/10 but would be pretty cool if they didn't drop the servers for maintenance at night when everyone is playing ._,"
Positive,"Very good game indeed, I would highly recommend it."
Positive,> Be me peasant with no armour> Steals armour> Guards takes armour and leaves me fully nakedWell this game isn't very friendly to the homeless
Positive,"I would realy like to have a Turkish support on this game me and my Turkish friends realy liked this game but sadly most of us did not understand the story lead or anything other then the basics in all honesty. If needed I would like to be involved in any translation progress to help this game language support for Turkey. Beside that game is realy good but it would be perfect if we could co op main story missions, that is something we realy wanted to happen. 8/10"
Positive,"Amazing RP Community and overall world design. The quests are always so fun to read and do. Crafting is good, but personally I find it a bit confusing. Grouped questing is getting fixed within the near future. PvP seigeing is so much fun to do with others, setting up quickly ad rolling through, I have to say I recommend this to anybody that loves to RP, PvP, or create their own character."
Positive,"ok, this is the first time I've played an MMO for more than 5 minutes, just not my thing. so I was apprehensive about jumping into this one. but as a fan of the Elder Scrolls going back a few years I was curious to see this vision of Tamriel. now I did wait for a free weekend to make that jump but jump I did. sadly so did half of the free world. it was amusing to frustrating getting around with all these freebies all doing the same quests at the same time. comical even. so I quit. then a few hours later I was back. I got enough play time to see that I wanted to see more of Tameriel, despite the crowd. I finally figured that once the freebies were gone it might be ok to jump back in...and it was. don't know where this will all lead as I still don't like MMO's, I still want to explore Tamriel and I will. hopefully a lot less populated ESO."
Positive,"An excellent entry in the Elder Scrolls saga, with special emphasis on its well made scenaries, fantastic questlines and overall fun and entertaining combat system!A mandatory title for those in love with Elder Scrolls lore!10/10"
Positive,The Elder Scrolls Offline: Story Of The EU Server
Positive,telvanni lesbians 100/10
Positive,This game is amazing especially those interested in the lore of the Elder Scrolls series. You are able to watch history from before all the other TES games be made right before your eyes.
Positive,This game is Awesome if you have some Friends
Positive,I only regret about 4 hours of this game. The other 1297 were great. .
Positive,"As a game that begun clearly on the wrong foot, it has made huge advancements compared to it's release version. As far as I can tell ZeniMax and Bethesda have fixed 90% of the original bugs and in many ways improved the all round enjoyment of the game.If you are looking for a way to compare TESO:TU to another game, from my experience I would describe it as a mixture of World of Warcraft and Skyrim, obviously with it's own unique twist.. but that's the most accurate comparison I can provide.To keep the review short, I'll end saying that The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited is without doubt worth it's price, at least for someone such as myself. If you aren't 100% sure this is the right game for you, even are a little 'research' I'd suggest waiting for a sale or search for one privately to acquire it cheaper."
Positive,"A very polished MMO that I would highly suggest picking up now that the biggest hurdle of monthly payments has been completely eliminated from the game. The gameplay vaguely feels like the Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim-esque combat you'd be used to, but when you pay more attention to it, you'll definitely notice some differences. However, don't let this statement phase you, the game itself is really well designed. The combat is still very enjoyable and feels distinctly different from a lot of other MMOs out there, the environments as well as the things that live in them feel very colorful and vibrant, a staple trait of the Elder Scrolls series, and the story is honestly pretty interesting, which isn't a statement I use often regarding the stories that most MMOs have to offer. In conclusion, definitely pick up this game if you're a big fan of the Elder Scrolls series, an MMO fanatic, or just someone looking for a new experience. I don't think you'll regret it.EDIT 10/12/2016: I suggest picking up this game much more now than I did when I first wrote my review! With the release of the One Tamriel update, ESO is now even more reminiscent of the other single player Elder Scrolls games with the addition of enemy levels scaling in the world based on your player level, meaning that you can now explore anywhere on the map at any time with no drawbacks!"
Positive,"(Don't take interest of how long I've been playing, my Steam isn't connected to my ESOTU account)Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited [Review Thus Far]I have to say, this is by far one of the most beautiful, immersive and overall,one of the most fun MMOs I've ever played.MMORPGs and just RPGs in general have been my go-to games for the past 8 years, and I think I've just about played all of them, but this one takes the cake.Gameplay: A lot of questing, but questing isn't all that matters.  I honestly don't mind the mass amounts of questing you have to do, as all of the quests have voice acting which makes that much more immersive.  Aside from the quests, the other things you can do, such as the boss-camps, delves and just exploring in general, makes this game just that much more exciting to play.  And if that's not enough, there can always be surprise random events that can happen while in the open world.  I've been playing this game with my brother for the first 14 levels so far, and if playing the game isn't fun enough, playing with another person makes it all the better.Graphics: Oh my God, this game is beautiful.  If you can play this game on Ultra settings, you may need to put your eyes in a wheel chair.  As I said before, this is by far, the most beautiful game I've ever played.  Every province is something special, and the regions and zones inside of that province are a sight to see.  I've played mostly on the Pact, but I have given AD and DC a try, and all three factions are graphically promising and are all beautiful in one way or another.  The makers of this game did an amazingly stunning job with the graphics.  I've played maybe 20-25 hours so far (again, ignore what Steam says I've played), and I can't help but appreciate all the places I've gone through.Combat/Battle Mechanics: Very well done.  The use of dodging and actually having to move around while fighting makes this game a very good seller.  The mechanics for combat can make some very intense battles when fighting the bosses in Group Instances.Classes/Roles: One thing that's to be specified.  YOUR CLASS DOESN'T DETERMINE YOUR ROLE.  And that's perfectly fine with me.  You don't have to be a Dragon Knight to be Tank, or a Templar to be a Healer.  You can be a Sorcerer Tank or Nightblade Healer if you want.  You can use any weapon and any armor in this game!  Yep, Dragon Knights can use Destruction or Restoration Staves if they want to.  There is many many variations in this game.  You can be Nord Werewolf Templar with a Bow in Light Armor if you honestly want to do that.  Hey!  You can really be any class and not fight, and all you do is just make food and/or craft items!  It's all up to you!  Miscellaneous: Crafting system is complex, but fair and makes sense after a while.  Cooking and Alchemy are a thing and are important to the gameplay.  There is a Justice System where you could become a fugitive (pick-pocket, murder, assault).  There is a lot of things I've covered but probably forgotten.  Don't stand in the fire!At this point in time I haven't tried out the PvP yet, but I can only imagine it's fun as Hell.Overall Pros:Buy-to-Play: $60-80 Price Tag ($23.99 for the Christmas Sale!!, however there is an in game store for buying mounts and such.)Graphically StunningExtremely ImmersiveFun to play with friendsGood Combat SystemGraphically StunningMain Storyline is compelling and very interestingA very rewarding gameCrafting System is goodJustice System makes the game very diverse and fun.Roleplayer friendlyDialogue and voice acting are great!Did I forget to mention the graphics?Extremely large gameNothing in this game really pisses me offOverall Cons:It's definitely not your typical Elder Scrolls GameOverall Overalls:Again, not your typical Elder Scrolls Game, but that doesn't bother me at all.  Definitely not bragging, but being a player of this series for 5 years now, TES games definitely leave a mark in the RPG world and are definitely unique to other games.  Although Bethesda and Zenimax had to take ESOTU a slightly different direction, this game is still fun as Hell.  I definitely see myself playing this for a long time, and maybe making another review.  And if it really matters, I've never made a review for any game before (Please ignore the amount of games I have too, I was sharing a Steam account for the longest time before branching out to games like ESO), but I have to say, with the 20-25 hours I've spent so far, I really just had to get this review out there.Lastly, I highly recommend this game to everyone.  I believe that TES players will enjoy this alot, and MMO players will enjoy it as well.  Get it before the sale ends!Thanks for reading!"
Positive,"Bought this years ago on sale, had a ton of fun. Has the nice Elder Scrolls feeling of turning it on and going to whack dudes for a while. Important information: If you want to buy a bundle of all the expansions, just go onto their main website and buy the newest one for your account there.  This isn't stated anywhere easily visible, but purchasing the latest standard edition of an expansion FROM THEIR SITE rather than Steam gives you all of them at once, rather than having to shell out obnoxious amounts of money for them."
Positive,"It's an excellant MMORPG, but be warned, it is not Skyrim2 online like some expected, it is an MMORPG, in the Elder Scrolls world. Has the best Storylines in the quests of any MMORPG i have ever played, in that respect, it is pure Elder Scrolls. i would say 8/10"
Positive,"Judging by the amount of time I've logged on this game, I think it's safe to say it is one of my favorite games of all time.I won't deny it has its share of bugs features, but if you can look past that and focus on the engaging storylines, the characters you can become attached to, the awesome opportunities to play ""dress-up"" and decorate a house (or many) of your very own...well, you'll understand why it's my favorite.If you plan to play for any serious amount of time, the devs have handily made it so you can barely get by without upgrading to a Plus subscription. I subbed, and I am not going back. I just want to give fair warning to those who have not: either get out now, or get Plus. My suggestion would be the latter.The in-game economy is almost as bad as the real-life one. And you will want to figure out how to mute Zone chats as quickly as possible—you'll see why."
Positive,Great game have had a blast!
Positive,"It's basically like playing Skyrim except if you want to play it with someone else you can, but you don't have to."
Positive,Definitely one of the best MMORPG games I've ever played!
Positive,game made my balls drop
Positive,"I only review the single player PVE game play, but it has so far been enjoyable. Good voice acticing and engaging game play. They story line I've been following has made ESO feel a bit like Oblivion and Skyrim as far as game play. I haven't felt like I've been bogged down with grinding for gear and money"
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited is a very fun game, and I love how it allows the player to view more of Tamriel. However the game had many changed twards Skyrim and Oblivion, Magic is changed and combat has also changed. However armour and weapons have been HEAVILY upgraded. There are so many types of armour and sword sets to choose from. But one of the biggest changed in the game is the fact that the game is a MMO. However it was executed suprisingly well. I suggest that you buy the game! :D"
Positive,"Upd: All price fixed, waiting when ZOS will change price for ESO plus!Fat dislike from Ukraine to Bethesda due to prices at Steam! Greymoor price is 1399 uah (it's 45€) for country with average salary 370€  ! Go ♥♥♥♥ your game.But supports says:  ""We have looked into the matter and it is the correct pricing for this area."" For supports is all correct, even that fact, that ESO Plust cost 2€ in Argentina - that normal too!Bethesda you so greedy!"
Positive,"I haven't played for long but i can you some ideas of why you should buy this game especially now with the Autumn sale.So at first i never thought i'd be enjoying this game due to the combat looking weird since it's kinda different than other MMO's but when i played it wasn't bad at all of course i had to get used to it but after a few hours i thought to myself 'this game isn't bad at all'. Here are a few things i like about this game although i'm still in the early stages of the game ill try to talk about the things i've already experienced. Also i'm probably gonna forget to cover alot and my English isn't the best.Skill lines:Alright, when you start your adventure you will see 1 skill unlockable for each ''line/tree'' or whatever you may call it.Basically when you unlock that skill you will level it. So the higher the level of that specific skill line the more abilities you will unlock. Now every skill line consists of about 5 active skills an ultimate ability and a few passives, when leveling i do recommend getting 1 skill of each skill line to level it up so you can use more abilities later on in the game and don't worry you can reset your skill line but it will cost some gold  which isn't that much but will depent on how many skill points you've used.Attribute points:-Magicka-Health-StaminaWell this is pretty straight forward you put a point in magicka and your magicka and same with Health and stamina now there's a bit more the cover about this but i'm not going to however i just go full stamina on my Nightblade and Templar.Crafting:-Alchemy-Blacksmithing-Clothing-Enchanting -Provisioning-WoodworkingI only trained blacksmithing, clothing and woodworking so i will only cover a bit about these crafting skills.When training these 3 skills i recommend leveling all of them since they're all very important all together.You can either find ores in the open or just deconstruct weapons/armour you find OR steal which i recommend since you level up a lot faster by stealing gear and deconstructing them, by deconstructing gear you get materials so let's say if you deconstruct a sword you get ingots and some other stuff i don't know much about. Now there's 1 important thing to crafting called traits basically it's an effect on your armour (which i'm not 100% sure about FeelsBadMan) but you can learn these which will take a few hours but you will be able to craft better gear with certain effects. (Alright i'm not too sure if i explained this well enough, but if you do buy eso just lookup a guide by kevduit which explains it in depth and it's also fun to watch.)Well, this was my first ever review and since i'm not english i still struggle with . and , but i hope you atleast learned something about the game although this isn't really a very good review, it's just that i like this game alot and hope more people will start playing."
Positive,"I have this game from the ESO store, so the game time it shows here is incorrect. I've been playing for over 2 years every day.The good:-great lore-fun game play-flexible skill system-you can play with your low level friends without them being at a disadvantageThe bad:-only one server per region (na/eu)-sometimes laggy-long down time/maintenance during events-devs dont listen to player feedback"
Positive,Much better than it was at launch. Worth a second look if you loved the idea of what it could be.
Positive,"It is not Skyrim Online. Don't buy this if you want to play ""Skyrim Online."" Get over it! I really like this game, it has been a while that I could not find a MMORPG that has destroyed my life like this one has done. 10/10"
Positive,I really critized this game after playing the open beta long ago but now i can stop playing. But i don't reccomend it if you think your gonna like it just because you liked skyrim its not very simular.
Positive,Loading Simulator 2017
Positive,"Once upon a time, an evil necromancer gave you the death penalty for jaywalking in the Imperial City.  After all, you could've killed yourself!  His Worm Cultists however are reaping the downsides of that little plan - the extradimensional prison he stuck you in, sans your soul, couldn't hold your badassery for too long.The Elder Scrolls Online is an action-MMORPG that is a sort of half-way point between the action-driven Elder Scrolls RPG series, and WoW-esque hotbar-heavy MMORPGs.  It's an interesting game, because it's one that no one really wanted - people wanted Skyrim with multiplayer, not yet another MMORPG.I do recommend this game, as it's come a long ways in two years, even though it still has quite a ways to go.What WorksFirst, the freedom in character builds is staggering.  While you're restricted to a character class (Sorcerer, Templar, Dragon Knight, and Nightblade) that biases you towards particular play styles, it's actually possible to do more or less anything as any class.  This has downsides I'll get to in the What Doesn't Work section, but ultimately you can have a lot of fun just discovering your own play style.Exploration in this game is really well done, as is typical for Elder Scrolls titles.  There's a loading screen tip, ""Sometimes, pick a direction and just run.""  Do that, it usually works out well.  There's incentives like exploration XP, Skyshards, of which every third gives you a skill point to spend on an ability or passive, treasure chests, myriad sidequests...it's quite an expansive game, and not in the 'big and empty' way that you see so commonly when someone boasts about that big game they've just written.PvP is a huge plus.  If you're a PvP lover, skip WoW and FFXIV; this is probably the game for you.  Cyrodiil is a huge 100v100v100 region with full-on sieges, the ability to be crowned Emperor (for a short time), and yet more quests and explora-goodies.  The PvP community is also generally good and friendly, unlike some games where it degenerates into discussions of private anatomy.  That kind of hijinks usually only happens in Glenumbra.I also like the crafting system.  I admit, I'm a sucker for item crafting, but this game even imbues boring tasks like blacksmithing and alchemy with the need to explore and find new goodies to use in your own creations.  It takes a while (and skill points) to be a master of a certain type of crafting, but it can be so worth it.  Brew potions that restore your resources?  Can do.  Craft weapons and armor that make you OP?  Doable.What Doesn't WorkESO has its fair share of problems, despite the many good parts of the game.  First, a ""minor"" thing - I can only assume it was down in Zenimax Online Studios' contract that they had to get on their knees and grovel to Skyrim, because in nearly every area, you can expect no fewer than ten references to Skyrim (it's a game you might not have heard of...it's supposed to be really good or something) usually done in a way that comes off as fawning.  Yes, Skyrim was good.  ESO, stand on your own merits, you're a good game, you don't need to grovel to a best-seller.The combat in ESO is at best...unclear.  That's the best way to describe it.  It's hard to figure out what's going on until you've played for a while and know what to look for.  Identifying another player's build is a matter of memorizing what certain abilities look like, and even then, you can't possibly beat everything.  To call this game 'not newbie-friendly' is a bit of an understatement, but if you stick with it, you've got a good game beyond that.Worse, this game is really open-ended as far as what you can do.  I praised this, but it comes at a cost: when every option is a valid one, no option is really valid.  This game is empowered by, and suffers from, this very situation.  The 'best' builds shift from patch-to-patch, ZOS fixes bugs to break 10 other builds, most often in spectacular ways.  You'll probably gimp your character, and not even know it.Next, the writing is as bad as you'd expect from Bethesda.  Quests are memorable for rewards, not so much their content.  Glenumbra has some hot druid-chicks, bandits, werewolves, and a necromancer pulling the strings.  I don't remember the details, because they're not important.  Worse, other gamers agree, but for mechanical reasons.  In ESO, it's a better idea to grind than to quest, though doing so requires buying DLC...Speaking of.  The worst thing I can say about a game is that it's pay-to-win, but ESO has pay-to-win elements through DLC.  There are sets that can only be obtained in DLC regions that are objectively superior to anything in the game that you can just buy.  Normally, this wouldn't be a 'thumbs-downable' offense, except that PvP competitive balance is hard, and ZOS causes as many balance issues as they fix.  The game's design can help mitigate this, but the imbalance is palpable, particularly in PvP.Lastly, the freedom thing isn't as free as you'd think.  There's no unarmed skill line, the magic weapons are hilariously underwhelming (why can't I shove a fireball up that Werewolf's behind!?!?), and I often find myself sitting on Skill Points because I've ran out of interesting abilities to invest in, and there's only so many passives to skill into.  The abilities in the game need to be reworked, because they just don't feel good.The TL;DRI feel this game is imperfect, but is horribly underappreciated, sort of like Final Fantasy XII.  It's got plenty of great and good moments, and a fair bit of disappointment too.  In the end, however, the good outweighs the bad in my opinion, I give this game the up-thumb, and encourage you to enjoy it, if you can."
Positive,"It's a fun game, though the subscription fee was a put off. However now that it's going B2P/F2P it's worth it in my opinion."
Positive,"great game, fantastic story lines and graphics"
Positive,"I honestly think that this game is fantastic.  It is a great MMO that has great servers.  I have little to no connectivity problems.  The level system is similar to Skyrim without feeling like the same game.  The thing that you need to remember is that, this is a MMO first, then a Elder Scrolls game second.  It will do whatever it can to keep true to the ES series but sometimes falls off to keep that MMO style.  In late game you level up slowly, but with the mass amount of quest, you will easily level up.  It does a great job at not throwing you into a level 20 quest while you are level 8.  You can still do high level quest with some skill.  Even though there are just four classes.  That will not stop you from making that build into any ES build in any game.  I honesly love this game and plan to continue to play."
Positive,"Extremely fun! This game is very easy to get into if you are a TES fan, and even if your not a fan or just haven't played the previous games....it's fun to play by yourself and especially with friends. PVE is fun and can keep you attention for long enough, but i think where the game truely shines is PVP. The playstyle is very similar too Guildwars 2 and I highly recommend it for any Elder Scrolls fans and for anyone else to at least give it a chance, also since many of the bugs from the beginning launch have been patched."
Positive,"Still downloading, praise Australian internet."
Positive,It's better than WoW.
Positive,I am super addicted to this game in my opinion it is worth the buy
Positive,After being told a few bad comments myself i thought it was finally time to check out the game. I love this game its intresting loads to do in the game great rpg and very fun to play.
Positive,Updates have really changed this game for the better. The combat is very well done and requires some skill. Many of the negative reviews are just looking for an online skyrim. This is no online skyrim :). great replay ability with pvp and different alliances.
Positive,"This is the first MMORPG with made me feel like a real Rogue and Thief and that's impressive. Loved the stealth system and how it worked in PvE. Also, they translated the levelling system of usual TES games to this format very well - I recommend!"
Positive,"First few hours I thought its not to bad this, 3 days later im lost in an awsome story learning everything i can and I have to say that the content will keep me going for a very long time, As a fan of skyrim I was put off thinking im 3 years behind on this game ( can not belive I have never heard of it before!) but there are many people on the same level as me. Imho I think this beats skyrim, graphics are superb, lots of exploring to be done,  the mechanics are great and there are many ways to play, I never thought I was pushed in one direction or the other. I love this game so far and im not even close to the dlc yet. big thumbs up for me!As soon as I figure out how to craft a gun I will fall in love with this game even more!"
Positive,"Meh... I don't really have the time to play it... and it's kinda hard to enjoy I guessPros:• Really fun and easy early on• Progressive difficulty• Quests don't feel super grindy (even tho they kinda are)• Skyrim controls, pretty easy to get used to• Very customizable characters (take note, Square Enix)• AI is good and has voice acting(!)Cons:• Gets boring after a while• For me, easy to lose my attention and become uninteresting• Takes time to get used to• Low FOV by default. Even if you upscale it in settings, it still feels really zoomed inSummary: All in all said I really would love to get into this game but I just don't have the free time in my schedule to play it :("
Positive,"Literally can't stop. I have to prise my hands off the keyboard. I am loving every minute of this game (bar those waiting for other players at world bosses). There is so much to do, I've already racked up over 100 hours and have done just 4 quests, and I have no intention of doing them until I learn how to craft items! Vast majority of the other players are very friendly, and seem more than willing to share out their wisdom to newbie players such as I.*Update*Almost a year on and still loving every aspect of the game, from 100 hours on my first review, to 4100+ now and I still can't stop, still have to prise hands off the keyboard.Main character has completed 100% of all base and DLC quests, and has completed 75% of all achievements. That's over 4000 hours worth of gameplay, not too bad imo. I have 9 characters now, allowing me to diversify to keep game feeling fresh and exciting. I recommend this game more than I did in my original review!*Update 2* This one is mainly for the 2018 Nomination Badge, but 7400 hours, and I'm still enjoying the game, only jsut running out of things to do! Still issues with Steam client, so do buy direct from ESO website."
Positive,"Definitely one of the best games I've played in a very long time. If you like Skyrim, Dragon Age, Fallout, World of Warcraft, etc, there is a good chance you should try this game.+ Character customization+ Level scaling+ Exploration+ Graphics+ Justice System+ Add-ons+ Story and quests+ Generous subscription option+ Crafting System+ Resource gathering, farming, and economy+ Day/Night cycles and weather systems+ Audio, music, ambiance+ Voice acting+ Player Housing+ CombatAbove are some of the things that I really like about the game. Character customization is amazing. Nearly on par with Skyrim and the likes. Level scaling is something not everyone likes, but so far I really love it. I just reached level 50 and barely made it through three entire zones. There is so much left for me to do and explore at this point, I don't see being done for several thousand hours. Exploration is rewarding with chests, skyshards (skill points) and lore books. Always something stuck in odd nooks and crannies. The graphics are phenomenal and remind me of Skyrim and Fallout series alot. The justice system is not very realistic, but interesting enough to make it fun. The consequences are light, but can be fairly expensive if you aren't careful. Add-ons are great. While a few that I use seem like they should have been in the game to begin with, such as a minimap, it's nice to have the option to modify the game. The crafting system is quite deep and engaging, much moreso than most other games I have played, ever. Add to this the hunting and gathering economy and if you like to farm, this game makes that very rewarding. The stories and quests are top-notch with very colorful writing and voice acting. I recognized many of the voices from other games and television series. Some of the best ever. The music is light and entrancing. Very moody and some thought was put into which music to play for which zone. I really love the audio in this game, as well as the ambiance and immersion of the day/night cycles and weather patterns. While the game is buy to play, the sub gives you infinite crafting bag space and access to every DLC past and future as well as a 1500 crown stipend to use in the cash store where you can buy mounts, costumes, and loads of other uncecessary things. But if you like that sort of thing, this game has quite a lot to offer, even if it is mostly overpriced outside of sales and the monthly stipend, in my opnion.I haven't gotten much into the player housing, but the fact that the game has it says something, because many do not. And from what I can tell, the system is very robust, with most if not all items being craftable. This makes for a very lucrative market as well as a nice gold dump for the economy. The one big drawback is that players are limited to the number of items they can have in each house.The combat is good overall. Its fun and engaging and there are so many options it is pretty overwhelming at first. The classes are fun and unique and I like how there are cross-combinations depending on what weapon and armor the character is using. Gear sets make statistics junkies right at home. Although the combat is fairly fluid, it can become predictable after a time due to only having 5 skill slots available during combat. I feel like some ablities and combos are more powerful, which kind of pigeonholes some classes beyond the ""magicka or stamina"" decision. - No Global Auction House- Terrible search function/guild trader interface- Drab looking gear- Limited skill slots- Year old UI bugsSome things about the game I do not like as much, such as the guild trader system. There are things I like about it and things I don't. It's a little too cumbersome for my personal taste, but I do genuinely like what it's trying to do/be. Maybe in time it will get better. Thankfully there are add-ons that make this part of the game palatable for those that enjoy it. Joining and leaving guilds is very simple and it wasn't hard for me to find several that I enjoy. The problem is with a 500 player limit in each guild, one may feel forced into joining 5 just to be able to trade all their goods every week. That doesn't leave a lot of room for the non-trading guilds that I would otherwise enjoy as well. The reason for this is because the guild traders have designated areas to sell, so each guild has to bid on those spots every week. If a guild you are in doesn't win a bid, you can't trade with a guild trader in that guild for that week. And many of the guilds that are able to stay in good areas consistently charge very high dues/minimum sales. Its kind of supply and demand, and I get that, but for new players, it can be difficult when just starting out and trying to offload your trash for some upgrades or potions/food. The gear is rather drab looking for the most part, at least at the lower levels. There are dye stations around towns to help spice it up, but you have to unlock the colors with achievements and some of the better ones are locked behind difficult or lengthy objectives. While I don't mind earning them (or not), it would be nice to not have to wear a costume all the time when my gear sets don't match.The number of hotbar actions allowed is 5 plus 1 ultimate. At level 15 you get a second bar (both based on weapon type) with 5 more slots and another ultimate slot. This is good for some players and bad for others. Personally, I like games where I have access to all my abilities at all times and get to decide on the fly which one I use. I do appreciate the strategy involved with limited skills, but being that every skill had to be leveled up and morphed individually through using it, while very cool in itself, makes combat and skill levling more convoluted than I am used to or prefer. I've run into a bug that shows one or more of the guilds I am in has no guild trader when they, in fact, do have one. Apparently this bug has been around since Morrowind released, a year ago. Some of the other UI are kinda janky as well, like when you are looking at your listed items for one guild, and you switch to another guild, and it shows no listings, so you have to click ""sell"" and then back to ""listings"" to be able to see the items. Annoying."
Positive,Well worth the price.Unlimited quests.Can solo game or group with friends.
Positive,Probably the best MMO I've played.
Positive,70% of everyone's hours in the game are from downloading.
Positive,Probably my favorite MMO in years. They have taken great aspects of The Elder Scrolls series and combined it with some decent MMO mechanics and have created a great singleplayer and multiplayer experience.
Positive,"I play TESO as a single-player open-world RPG that just happens to be online and have some online features. Group content is really not my focus, though I'll do it once in a while for the sake of variety.And as a open-world RPG, this game shines. It has a huge game world, full of lore, dungeons (""delves"") and quest-chains with interesting characters. The level scaling lets you focus on the story, exploration and lore and not really worry about grinding or something like that.Some of the areas have really high quality quest chains that would feel right at home in a standard TES game."
Positive,this is pretty simple game to review if your looking for online skyrim - don't buy it if your looking for a mmo with a solid lore / interesting mechanics / and more about character builds and player skill then classes then buy it.
Positive,"I hated this game back when it was in beta and I was fully prepared to forget about it and wait for the Elder Scrolls 6. However I came back when the game went on sale and found the game has improved massively. It has one of the best pvp experiences of any MMO that I have played thus far.The biggest question which most people want to know is, is this an Elder Scrolls game? Is it like Skyrim? The most common criticism is that ESO is not an Elder Scrolls game because it's not like Skyrim, this position rather bugs me considering that Skyrim is just one entry in the series and most people that hold this position haven't taken the time to experience other entries of the series which have major differences to Skyrim. In fact I would have agreed that ESO is not an Elder Scrolls game back when the game came out. On launch your character was restricted in a typical mmo fashion, Can't go to this zone until you reach this level, can't do this until you complete this, can't go here with X, can't do Y without Z. ESO used to be a typical on rails MMO experience until they overhauled the game, made everything scale to the player's level and opened up the game to allow the player to go wherever they want. This was one of the big features which made me come back to the game. Having an mmo where you can progress wherever and however you want is almost unheard of for an MMO. This is the freedom you'd expect from an Elder Scrolls  where you can pick a random spot on the map and explore. In fact unlike in most MMOs you DON'T need to quests to progress, in fact it's probably the only MMO that I'd recommend against questing which in my opinion is one of the most tedious, mind breakingly boring parts of mmos. You can level up at faster pace simply by exploring and doing the stuff you feel like doing instead of the stuff you're made to like a typical mmo.Combat in ESO is a massive step up from the typical WoW clone formula. IE Tab target an enemy and press the number keys in a sequence over and over until the enemies are dead. In ESO you have to aim your weapon, block attacks and roll out of the way from incoming dangers. Unlike an MMO where you have about 150 abilities that you all bind to seperate keys and tap them one after another in a sequence, in this game you have 6 abilities which you combine with your weapon attacks to do damage to an enemy. You might for instance charge up a heavy attack and then throw a fireball right after for a massive burst of damage. Combat is not simply about doing your abilities in sequence but using the right abilility in right situation. You can hold two weapons with two sets of abilities for a total of 12, so switching between your weapons is an important part of combat. I would actually argue that the combat in ESO has more depth than any Elder Scrolls game to date. Even in Skyrim the combat boiled down to spamming the enemy with the same attack over and over until they died. In ESO you have to make much more tactical decisions while managing your stamina and magicka. None of the artificial difficulty of Skyrim, such as playing as a mage and getting one shotted by an iron arrow suddenly from 100 yards away because robes don't give any armour points.On the topic of Combat ESO supports first person view and third person. However unlike in the main Elder Scrolls series where the game plays best in the first person view, this game pretty much requires you to play in third person as you need to be able to see everything around you at all times, especially in pvp. The fact that ESO is primarily a third person game will put many people off, but I personally enjoy the game in third person.There ARE classes in this game. However unlike in a mmo where all your characters abilities come from your class and class skill trees, ESO has something quite different. In the game there are various skill lines. For example the two handed skil line, as you use your two handed weapon you will unlock new skills from that skill line. It's entirely possible to create a character build that doesn't use any class abilities at all, such as a vampire hunter build which is hilarious for trolling edgy werewolf and vampire characters in pvp. You essentially make a completely custom class from the various types of skills you can master. Your initial class choice is still important choice and you are locked into that class choice, also don't expect your warrior to be able to do massive damage with spells if you haven't specialized in magicka. The fact that you can encounter an enemy player with a completely custom array of abilities makes pvp encounters extremely interesting.PVP is the biggest selling point of this game. Cyrodil isn't the peaceful woodland from Oblivion that you go around picking flowers in, there is a literal war going on there between players. Players fight for territory in Cyrodil by assaulting enemy resources such as farms and mines, but the main goal is to capture the enemy fortifications. Players fight for enemy keeps and outposts by assaulting them with siege weapons. Fights can break out between dozens and sometimes even hundreds of players at a single time. It's a truly epic moment when you see rows trebutchets and ballistas start destroying the enemies walls while masses of players clash together in a huge fight. It's brilliant chaos, particularly when you fire a flaming ballista into a group of 5 unsuspecting players and watch them panic. cyrodil isn't a simple 10 minute battleground but a massive zone dedicated to pvp. When one faction controls all of the keeps around the imperial city, the best player from that faction actually becomes the Emperor of Tamriel. When a player becomes emperor they essentially become Sauron in pvp. The emperor is like a world boss in cyrodil only a player in controlling them.The best part about PVP and Cyrodil is that you can get massive amounts of xp from it as well as amazing gear as you level up. there are many guides out there that say you can't level up effictively in Cyrodil but this is completely false. You can get Xp from joining the large battles in Cyrodil and contributing, even as a low level. But there is also a place in Cyrodil dedicated to pve, the imperial city. The pve is a huge dungeon with many different zones, it is filled with monsters and bosses and there is also a sewer area ontop of the city. You can take on the Imperial city solo or join a group and go after the bosses too. Players from the enemy factions are also in this area looking for loot so pvp can break out at any moment you're in there. You can mug other players for their money (tel var stones) in this area so the stakes are high. Sometimes a group running a boss will unexpectedly run into another group and a massive fight will break out. You can pretty much level up exclusively in this area or in Cyrodil without having to do boring quests.In conclusion. This game has an amazing pvp experience, the combat has much more depth and is far more satisfying than any typical MMO. However the skill floor for the game is somewhat high which may leave a casual Skyrim player overwhelmed. Questing in ESO is dull like pretty much any MMO (Although not nearly as dull as FFXIV), but the the game allows players to level up through exploration instead of tedious quests. This isn't a sequel to Skyrim but it is most definitely an Elder Scrolls game. Things such as stealing, murdering random people in towns and finding items in the enviroment are all in the game, but remember that this is an mmo with thousands of people playing at once so don't expect stuff like Radiant AI or a physics engine. Buy the game mainly for the pvp and social experience."
Positive,"Overall Rating: 4.2/5Gameplay: 4.5/5 The Elder Scrolls: Online is essentially what it says on the tin: an Elder Scrolls Title adapted to fit the MMO genre. At the beginning you design your character (pick their race, alliance, class etc.), and then you're essentially free to do as you like. There are numerous different regions to visit throughout Tamriel Western Skyrim is a personal favourite of mine , each with their own associated storylines, missions and world events. Quests are similar in nature to previous Elder Scrolls games, involving killing enemies, stealing items, clearing out dungeons etc. The game can be mostly completed on your own, or you can play with friends. You'll encounter lots of other players on the way, although you're not actually required to interact with them.The locations, quests, combat and customisation is all varied enough to stay interesting hours into the game.The UI can be initially very confusing, as there's a lot of information to take in as a new player, and unfortunately the game does not do a great job of explaining things. So it might be helpful to look up a guide or two, or watch gameplay online before delving in.Graphics and Atmosphere: 4/5The visuals are good, and each region of Tamriel has a distinct feel. Some are familiar, having been visited in previous games and others are brand new - although I've found all of them enjoyable so far. The soundtrack and ambience is excellent though, and really makes it feel as though the cities, forests, mountains etc. are alive and real. Overall the immersion is good.Performance: 4/5Performance is good and the servers have been reliable from my experiences. I have encountered the odd buggy quest here and there but simply restarting the game fixed things up.Recommendation: If you're a fan of TES franchise and looking for an MMO to play, ESO is a great option to consider."
Positive,"Although the title contains ""The Elder Scrolls,"" don't treat this game as an Elder Scrolls game.  If you expect a game that is similar to Skyrim or Oblivion, then don't get the game.  This game is an MMO, so the experience is not like an Elder Scrolls game.  The game isn't even designed by Bethesda Game Studios, either so I wouldn't expect too much of it to be like Skyrim.  Overall though, it's a decent game. 7/10 not IGN"
Positive,"Best MMORPG with true story and consequences out there...  You basically shape the world, and do some awesome stuff... Classes are balanced, if you want to PvP, story is great, if you want to do some questing, and community is the least toxic of any MMO game i've played... but do switch off global chat at starting location..."
Positive,pretty decent love the game needs some more fan base so it doesnt die
Positive,Best game ever Created. Absolutely my Favorite! :) <3 Only gets better over time
Positive,I was under the impression that this game was terrible.I'm a werewolf named StealthyMcSteal now.10/10 The MMO we needed in our lives.
Positive,I didn't expect that the plot and crafting aspects are dragged out that much. Huge thanks to the quest makers. The sources of inspiration and game world immersion are implemented perfectly.P.S.: Special thanks for the bards' songs )
Positive,"I recommend this game, but only because I looked at it as a game within the universe of Elder Scrolls without being a true Elder Scrolls game.The ProsInteresting quest lines outside of the main quest and dialogues (if you read them, which you don't have to most of the time)Outrageously fun dungeons, and AI that has some pretty clever ways of screwing you overVast and aesthetically pleasing world. It's well designed and quite varied from one region to another. You never get the feeling like you've been in the same place forever if you do any exploringGreat customization options for building characters, and skill/attribute sets. One can spend a tremendous amount of time trying out new builds and characters that feel VASTLY different within the first 10 levels.If you're an RPer (which I am not), there a bajillion different guys online willing to do it with you for any number of different roles. Of course, there's really an easy community for any type of player and ESO players have, in my experience, been some of the most helpful and friendly gamers I've dealt with on PC or consoles.Free to play and play is free. Once you've bought the game, it's now free which is definitely nice. Once you're in the game, you can do whatever you'd like. There is no hard line that says where and when you have to go do anything. The ConsGrouping is semi-difficult and allows for some serious wackiness (dungeon lvl 10, but all non-leader party members are lvl 40. Waat?)Lack of some of the epic feel of previous ES titles. One's world isn't that heavily shaped by the decisions he makes in the game.PvP is outrageous imo. Spamming AoEs seems to be the main strategy, so many sieges tend to look like straight Biblical disasters with similar carnage, but no real skill. Lots of people and lots of ranged firey effects.The Crown Store. I find paying for cosmetic enhancements frustrating and ridiculous.No dueling options. This was one of the only features I loved about WoW. You could challenge your friends who played ""on the same team"". There are ""dueling guilds"" but they practice dueling within a PvP zone that is based on huge group combats. It's cumbersome.Wait for a sale, but this game is definitely worth playing."
Positive,"MMORPG version of Elder Scrolls. Its not Multiplayer Skyrim, but its not just another MMORPG either. It's probably the least MMO-like MMO that I know of, in a good way. Attributes of other Elder Scrolls games are present in this one: Sneaking, Stealing, Pickpocketing npcs, Killing npcs, running from the law, character customization (both gameplay flexibility and aesthetics), Insane attention to detail, lore-packed, readable books everywhere, crafting, incredible amount of content and loads of good quests, many of which have moral dilemmas. Your effectiveness in battle will always be scaled to your current location regardless of your level, so you can pick a direction, explore and run into things to do.In my opinion, the largest difference from other Elder Scrolls games is the combat. In addition to basic attacks (light attacks and heavy attacks), you have skills. You can slot 12 skills (including 2 ultimate skills) at one time spread across two skill bars that you can switch between. Every skill has a half second cooldown (except for ultimates); optimal use of skills still includes a rotation but that is not mechanically forced upon you. Every skill is available to every character, except for class-specific skills. Also, vampire skills cannot be acquired if you are currently a werewolf, and vice versa.Even if you're only looking to explore and quest, you will still get more than your money's worth for the amount of content in the game. If this is what you want to do, it offers as much character build flexibility as any other Elder Scrolls game.Every class is able to do every role: Magic DPS, Physical DPS, Tank, or Healer. However, the higher into the more difficult group content you go, such as veteran dungeons or trials, the less effective a non-meta build is going to be. Normal dungeons for sure can be completed in whatever role regardless of class with no problem at all. I have not played higher level content such as veteran dungeons but I've heard they can mostly work there as well. But for trials onward, I've heard that tanks need to be Dragonknights and healers need to be Templars. Any form of DPS is viable for any content as long as you're minmaxed.PVP takes place in the massive zone of Cyrodiil, where any player from an opposing alliance can attack you. Some people prefer to run around and get into small 1v1, 1v2, 2v2 fights. Others prefer to join the main army force and take part in the war between alliances, fighting in huge battles. This war is fought for control of forts and keeps; taking all the keeps around the Imperial City will crown a member of your alliance Emporer, depending on who has the highest alliance score. You can also push deep into enemy territory and steal an Elder Scroll owned by that alliance, which gives your alliance additional buffs for as long as you hold that Elder Scroll within your territory.Buy to play, no subscription needed (but is offered). The Crown Store (microtransaction shop) just offers cosmetics and stuff, it offers nothing that makes you more effective than other players, you will never need to touch it unless you want to look extra spiffy. The developers constantly have new content in the works, whether they're planning the next DLC, or new feature, or even just new cosmetics available for purchase. For example, player housing is the next thing about to come out.Subjectively, this game scratches every itch I have regarding mmos and fantasy adventure/exploration. Instantly recommended. I never played the beta, I heard that it was awful and many people dismissed this game because of it. But I've also heard that it has significantly improved since then, and I can at least attest to the game's current quality."
Positive,"Great  MMORPG, I have been having a fun time playing it and still play it today.  The servers are good and the PvP is being refined. The story line s are good and not boring. It also has the fun MMO grind.Overall I rate this game 8/10"
Positive,"I've never been into MMO before, but I love the Elder Scrolls franchise and thought ""why not?"". The game fits perfectly with the rest of series, the quests story lines are great (with some very funny characters too) and the voice acting is pretty good, as it always is. Found myself actually wanting to spend my time fishing virtual fish and running around woods looking for plants, which I never really got into in other games.All in all my only regret is downloading the game before my finals. Damn my grades to Oblivion."
Positive,"If you liked Skyrim, you will get some fun out of ESO.My wife an I played through one of the story threads (which takes you up to max level in the game). All in all it felt much like any Elder Scrolls game for all the good and the funky that comes with that.What is missing is some of the open world feel and a strong sense of agency, but they do as well a job of this as can be expected in an MMO. You do have some story impact and you can rattle around inside each zone as your whim strikes you, but its not your world and you can feel that.Combat is good for an MMO but not exceptional. Crafting is a standout success in that its a nice casual system where your crafting is actually useful without arduous grinding and it advances as you play the rest of the game so long as you make a small effort at maintaining it. Better than most MMOs I've played in this reguard. Character building options are decent and especially flexible.After about 6 weeks of play I felt like I'd about enjoyed it as much as I was going to, but I did feel I got my money's worth and that the devs did a good job crafting the game."
Positive,"Honestly, I'm not the best person to review this game, I am still fairly new.  My in game hours are partially from patching the game on a slow connection, and leaving the launcher open, but I love it.  At first I didn't.  Its a strange game. I'm not a big MMO fan, the only one I've played for longer than a few months was the first Guild Wars.  They just haven't been my cup of tea.I've loved the Elderscrolls series, starting with Morrowind, Oblivion, then Skyrim, and while this game does not play or feel quite the same as those, it is certainly familiar in an exciting, yet calming way.  The combat is not all hitting number keys, but it is still the hp shaving combat of an MMO vs the comparatively more real time combat of the single player iterations.  More or less, I play this like a single player game.  That is not really by choice, I haven't found a group of like minded players to guild up with yet, but a couple friends and the occasional stranger will party up with me to tackle some dungeons or difficult bosses.  I like this.  I am not forced to be part of a community to enjoy the game, but being part of a community certainly enhances the experience.  IMO this is exactly what a good online game should be. For now I am content to wander Tamriel, learning as many crafts as I am able in order to better my own equipment, forging alliances, completing quests, and I hope to find a group of guild mates because that, I believe, will be the thing to keep me coming back regularly.  Come have an adventure.  Especially for the recent sale price, it's a fantastic bang for your buck."
Positive,one of the first big free-roaming first-person RPGs ever made (along with Lands of Lore 2)
Positive,You get to hear John Cleese say 'foppery'
Positive,Эта игра хороша
Positive,"A really fun MMO. I started alone, played with a few friends and they stopped. but I didnt. It's def not skyrim online, but it is a engrossing MMO. it has all the trapping of a MMO, grinding, crafting, some fetch quest and stuff. But it is fun if this is what you are looking for."
Positive,"Pretty much the best RPG I've played but sadly it takes up so much space! My computer got error 209 and all the ""fixes"" on the forum couldn't help me. I had to redownload the game twice and it took me 22 hours to complete   one download  , 44 hours in total."
Positive,"Elder Scrolls + MMORPGWhat's not to love? For me, a lot of things. Perhaps it's my age and lack of time to be able to appropriately dedicate time to any MMORPG to enjoy it at the level it was intended. That aside, I just couldn't get over the feeling that I had no impact on the world at large. Sure, that is par for the course with any MMORPG, but for the Elder Scrolls - it greatly diminishes my feeling of progression. I beat all the baddies, rid the area of whatever is ailing the local populace aaaaand - it all just respawns and continues on. I can't get immersed in this given how different Skyrim, Oblivion, and Morrowind play. I do like the feeling of being able to deeply explore with the high risk that I could be annihilated by mobs that are at a much higher level than myself. I also think the level at which a person can explore the world and lore of Elder Scrolls is unparalleled. Still not enough for me to sink the time in.If I had the time like I did back in my high school or college days (like when I played WoW) this game would probably consume a HUGE portion of my time. I've got love for the Elder Scrolls, just not the Elder Scrolls Online. That being said - I think that has more to do with me, and less to do with the game. Can't ding them there. If you like MMORPGs, and like Skyrim, and have the time to dedicate - this game is definitely worth checking out."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online. The title itself should be reason enough to buy this game. Now into the more serious reasonings: The game feels and flows like skyrim with better graphics and it does not really strangle your computer either. The UI and skillbar is very adaptable for your playstyle and preferences, so is also character creation and shaping (lvl up system), there are so many good points about this game I can't list them all due to space limitations. Now, let's talk about Crown store and what you can buy in the game. First of all, there is no pay to win model at work here, it is all vanity items with one exception, the EXP scroll which very marginally boosts xp gain, for a whopping 10%. This is not enough to warrant constantly buying them. Still, you do get some crowns to spend if you buy the game nontheless, and quite a good sum if you got the gold edition (700 crowns, enough to buy a good looking mount!). Still, there are certain important things to know of in this game.The community is helpful, RP players don't need to worry much, most people just ride along and enjoy the fun with you in public (which is rare!). There are also guilds with functionality for flavour, but since you can join up to five guilds, the special feeling of beloning to a guild could be ruined. Still, if you do join a roleplaying guild, there are a lot of fun PVE and PVP content to ride along with your friends. Massive trading guilds with 400+ members are always a option if you want to find certain items for your lategame gear, with no need to leave your RP'ing guild. Just take what you can with the options available to you! If you don't like the roleplaying guilds, there are even more options for you. This game is a blast, you can enjoy it solo and/or with friends in the way you prefer to do it. Dungeon finder will demand multiplayer but you could simply ignore those and walk the lonely path of solo quests instead if you wish. Elder scrolls can be what you want it to be. An open mind with a happy attitude will most likely find many friends here.Angry gamers with no tolerance for RNG and who has high demands on everything they do, won't enjoy this game as much. Especially if they are going to buy crown crates and expect to win the lottery, take it for what it is, sometimes the ticket will win you a cool mount. Most often you shall not win one...  - It's optional and wont bring any kind of advantages over any other player. I highly recommend this game. I am a guildmaster for a small and personal roleplaying guild called The Shadow Society in the Ebonheart pact. I love this game."
Positive,"Hesitant on buying the game?Read this: I'm from the Philippines and the game works perfect. NO LAG, NorthAmerica Megaserver.1 year ago, I believed Francis and Angry Joe's rage video and the monthly subscription is not worth it.Now that it's Buy2Play and after 1 year of Beta testing (thanks to those early players who bought the game and can't wait.)I bought it out of frustration of another game...I rate this game 9.9/10 (not perfect for the 2 minor bug I found, and I want housing + pirateship feature)If you played Skyrim that's 7/10 for meTESO > SkyrimYou can check the release notes. and the game is being improved every 2 weeks.the game has a lot of potential.. Very addicting... Fair PVP and not pay to win..  Archery experience is the best!!! Shot them on first person view. Best PVP experience ever... even Angry Joe shouts ""Ride!!!!"" on his rage video (BETA - if you watched the video). Buy now! I even regret buying Diablo 3.. This my friend is a game worth a monthly subscription... but I'm not rich! NOTE: game is not Steam dependent (even u bought it from Steam).. Hours of gameplay is inaccurate."
Positive,"--- Rating: 7/10 would play moreBuy once, play forever. ESO Plus for perks.This is not a pay to win game, but it does have a cash shop! try it out next time it's on sale._____________________Pros: Personally I like the voice acting for every NPC! its a nice touch I'd like to see in other games.i also like the combat, open world etc.Cons: Animations and Visuals haven't aged well.Mount system & char creation could be better. --- Frame of reference: Final Fantasy XIVWorld of WarcraftGuild War 2Teraand many more..."
Positive,This is Great in every spec
Positive,I have a library full of games that I haven't played. Elder Scrolls Online is the reason why.
Positive,iz gud game.  play wit frens.  many funs.
Positive,You can sink a good few Hours into this game [;
Positive,"the map is so big, pvp system is scale based on server, so its not p2wbut dev really need to erase the crown store system. its ruining pve gameplayoverall 8/10"
Positive,"As far as the game itself, easily one of the best MMOs I've played in recent years. You're not forced into one size fits all class customization. There are no ""dead zones"", everywhere you go there are players active in it completing group objectives. There's never nothing to do, I don't find myself logging in just to be idle and bored. If you want to be immersed, then this is the game for you. Each DLC is very unique and adds an element to the game that I really enjoy."
Positive,"TLDR:  Absolutely great game and I would recommend this to any fan of The Elder Scrolls, any MMO, RPG or Open-World lover, or really just anyone. If your debating on buying it, I highly suggest you do, you most likely will not regret it.So the last time I played ESO it was still in closed beta, and I was one of the lucky ones that was able to play during the closed beta, and let me tell you I thought it was just alright back then. And nowadays I love this game! So things have changed drastically!!! In my opinion every change that they have made to the game has been for the better! (With the exception of the Crown Store and really just Crowns in general.) So I would most definitely recommend this game to anyone debating on buying it, and MMO lover, any RPG lover, any Open-World lover, honestly I'd probably recommend this game to just about anybody!And so now I have a little over 200 hours played at the time of this review, and I still have SO MUCH content I have yet to even touch in the game! Whether you buy the Gold Edition, the Morrowind Pre-order, or just regular ESO: TU, I believe it is more than worth it as the base-game itself has SO MUCH content you will not regret it.Oh and by the way; If you want a Pros and Cons listing, read the other Positive Reviews as they are pretty on point with them.Edit: Almost 3,000 hours later and I still feel the same."
Positive,"This game is honestly the greatest MMO RPG I have ever played, and may even be the single greatest game in general I have ever played. Everything is such a vast upgrade from when I first started playing the online beta in 2013. It's been quite amazing to see this game develop into the masterpiece it is considered today. After countless updates, Zenimax has turned there brainchild into a benchmark that sets the standards for all true MMO RPG's. Even after considering the mechanics of the game, one can still conclude that the Lore in Elder Scrolls Online is superior to any other game series out there today. There just simply ins't a game out there that makes the player so emotional attached to the events surrounding your character. I in particular found myself reading through countless Lore wiki pages and subreddits just out of pure interest and joy. Even the game forums were filled with equally thrilled enthusiasts trying to get answers from company workers."
Positive,"This game is great for solo players fho love good story, animated and voiced (with lipsync) npc, and dont really social.Pros:* 30 skill panels with 5 active, 5 passive and 1 ultimate on almost each of them (no restrictions, class affects only 3 starter groups)* open world with hundreds of secrets and lore locations* u can play from first person view for full immersionCons:* 20 paid dlc with new locations and dungeons (however you can get them with ingame gold easily)* Hard to learn, easy to master* Not really much social activities"
Positive,an amazing game to play solo or play with friends
Positive,"Awesome game, I had a Skyrim craving but played until I was bored to tears. Bought this gem and voilla, back to having fun with a new game that will last me for some time. Best game money ever spent!"
Positive,No P2W 9/10
Positive,"the massive file size is warranted- there is so much depth to this game. every location is culturally unique, there are countless questlines, and frequent events. Easily my favourite multiplayer game."
Positive,"<3 luv it. Stable game, big content, pvp, battlgrounds, easy and fun crafting system. One of the best. not another asian style s!@$t"
Positive,"This game is great. if you try to listen to the story it feels alive just like any other elder scrolls, if you dont it will be the same like any other mmo. the crafting is so fun and is actualy useful. stealing is addictive :P and feels worth the while unlike any other elder scrolls game."
Positive,"An amazing MMORPG, and the best I've played so far (I played WoW, Metin2 and Neverwinter). There is a lot to do, a lot to explore, you can make new friends in guilds, it has a varied Crown Store (although a bit overpriced, opening Crown Crates is kinda addictive), the ESO Plus is also good, there are Guild Markets to buy stuff for gold, mains and side quests are amazing, World Bosses and Dungeons are fun, there are always daily rewards. I just wish Cyrodill had a PvE mode because I'm not really into PvP."
Positive,"After having put in around 8000 hrs into this game, I have to give this game a positive review. It is definitely engaging with enough storyline and things to do to keep a player occupied for years. The artwork is absolutely stunning. The game play is simple yet challenging. Finding groups to run with can be difficult, but a bit easier now that there's the group finder working again. Once you have at least 3 friends to play with the game becomes much more enjoyable since you won't have to pug stuff as much. There's also the fact that you can join 5 guilds, so it makes it easier to find friends to run with. Gold is earned easily on the game so fighting to earn what you want or just buying what you want are easily done.The only downside is that the community can be a bit toxic sometimes, especially with the endgame players having a sort of 'hardcore mentality' where they aren't willing to help people just starting. PvP is a lot of fun; however, with the 'One Tamriel' coming out and making cross faction a big thing, pvp has become quite lame due to people swapping factions on their toons just to join the winning side of a campaign.  Also the people who like to leech off of your kills when you're out killing stuff.With the introduction of ESO plus, it gives the craft bag. To be honest, I don't know how I played the game so many years without it because it's literally a game changer. Totally worth the ESO plus fees every month."
Positive,"A lil getting used to is needed, but love the overall transitions and landscapes. I am 60 yrs old and this game makes feel like a kid all over again . Keep up the good work and thank you.                                                                           The Real Grimlance                                                                               AKA Henry S."
Positive,"Great game. it looks beautiful, it looks like its from oblivion and the npc chat is great. Stealing and killing is quite fun if you want to be an outlaw. Really needs a player housing system like WoW but it took WoW 10 years to do that. 10/10 better than guild wars"
Positive,"Was part of the Beta back in March time (2014). I had big expectations and hopes which the game did not meet - I didn't bother with it since. It gained my attention again when the news about it going 'Buy to Play' got announced and I wanted to give it a go.... Easily the best decision I have made this year.The game has come a long way since beta and I am completely speechless at the sheer size of it (According to some sources online it would take 8-9hours to walk from one side to the other). The world is beautiful, the gameplay is brilliant and the content is awesome!My only regret is I didn't try it again earlier... I paid £100 for everything (including extra membership) I feel like I got my moneys worth within 24 hours of gameplay!"
Positive,"This is my new addiction. I am loving this game, although I have quite a few hours in I still feel like I haven't yet touched the surface, everywhere you look there are more and more quest, some you need to complete before you complete others. I understand that there are so many games out there that are similar to this, but I can highly recommend this one.I understand that some people have had issues connecting to the server when they have bought this game through steam and I will admit I have had occasions when I have had to wait, usually only seconds, before being able to connect and only once have I had major issues when I was not able to connect at all, this was just after they had done a server restart.So whether you get this game through steam, or direct from Bethesda, you will not be disappointed. :D"
Positive,I have played this game since the beta and loved it ever since. Now that they dropped the subscription fee this is the best time to buy this game.
Positive,"Played just few hours, but seems like a good game.PS. 4 years later I don't know where the fu*ck I am. Pls send help!!!"
Positive,Nice online especially with some stylish/fancy addons And events!!
Positive,been playing wow alot in wotlk/cata days and finally found a mmo that can compete with it
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Themed MMO. It is really good coming from someone who has gotten 3 characters in Skyrim to at least level 60, combat could be more fluid, but since I've played mmos I'm used to that. It just doesn't seem ""Elder Scrolls"" like in combat alone, and really that's it... Realistically, if you want a game that is completely like Skyrim and you're thinking of buying this one, don't... This game is a great elder scrolls installment that you can play with friends. 89/100"
Positive,"A fun RPGMMO.A mediocre Elder Scrolls.ESO should be taken for what it is. It isn't 'A Skyrim MMO'. It's an MMO in the Elder Scrolls universe, and for what it is, I had a good time. Worth picking up on sale."
Positive,"Well, I recently purchased this game since it has been released as a buy to play model. I am going to keep this short and sweet.I followed this game for the year that it was out and decided against it. The reason's I chose to not get the game were due to the terrible reviews and supposedly they veered away from the original Elder Scrolls gameplay. (No stealing, pick pocketing, killing villagers. The stuff you play Elder Scrolls for.)This caused me to not think about the game for a good six months.Two major new systems have been implemented in this update: The Justice System and The Champion System. With Justice, crime has come to the once-friendly streets of Tamriel's cities. You can now become a wanted criminal, sneaking, stealing, and even murdering your way through the world. But be careful—the guards can and will seek to punish you if your crimes are witnessed.The Champion System gives players with Veteran characters a new way to gain power. Once you have a Veteran Rank character on your account, you'll start earning Champion Points, which you can invest in a variety of new passive abilities. That's not all Update 6 has to offer! they've completely overhauled provisioning. You'll notice new recipes and much more inventory space as a result of our updating and streamlining. There's also a new way to keep track of your mounts, pets, and costumes: the Collections Window because you can access everything you've earned through the new UI at any time. That basically covers the biggest changes since the buy to play change. Since all the updates it genuinely feels like its single-player predecessors rather than a cookie cutter MMO, and that in itself is enough to draw me back into the game for many, many more hours!10/10, this game is a must buy now!"
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind       The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion      The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim                     The Elder Scrolls Online                            The Elder Scrolls VI""Even Gods dislike the absolute, for it stinks of something larger than themselves.""―Sotha Sil""Даже боги не любят абсолют, потому что оно воняет чем-то большим, чем они сами.""―Сота Сил"
Positive,"Okay, so I write this review coming from the single-player Elder Scrolls games. I have to admit. I had pretty dismal hopes for this game. ""An Elder Scrolls MMO? Ugh..."" was my attitude going into this and I had heard a lot of negative things about the game.And yes, I do have my gripes with this game, but overall, I genuinely have enjoyed the game so far. If I had to list my complaints... For one, the combat feels a little awkward in comparison to the single player games, but it's not horrible, two, the fact that races are limited to only a handful of classes which kind of limits you role-playing potential, where role-playing is my favorite thing about The Elder Scrolls. Also, I don't know if this is a glitch or not, but sometimes, I'll have an enemy's health refill at random and they'll run away in the middle of a fight. And my final complaint is that you can't loot all enemies that you kill like in the single-player games.Now for the positives...1) The character customization is actually pretty damn good. Not only do you get quite a bit of freedom in character building in the initial character creation, but the sheer amount  of customization you can do in game is pretty impressive, so my kudos to Zenimax on that.2) While the class selection is a bit limited, you still have the ability to customize your character to the way you want them, which is nice. My Khajiit as of writing this review is a Nightblade, but I'm trying to make archery her main ability, since that's my main playstyle in the series.3) I like how you can't get awesome armor right off the bat.4) Soloing the game is possible and the game accomodates that, so it's nice to be able to play the game as a single-player game.If I had to say one final note... It's... okay as an Elder Scrolls game, but a great MMO."
Positive,Even though the story is not super connected to the Elder Scrolls universe it is a good game.It has a lot of content. The PVE is great I have not tried the PVP yet but I hear its interesting.
Positive,After 1497 hours of trying this game out I can say I think I like it.
Positive,This game is amazing!  I am a non-suscribed user and the fact that I can play in effect multi-player Skyrim is just fantastic.  Once you buy a dlc with the in game crowns it is yours for good.  So you can add as much or as little as you like.  Also the depth of play for crafting is just fantastic.  This is honestly a great game and I recommend it to anyone that played any Elder Scrolls game and wished it was multi-player.  Seriously everyone get this; you will not be wasting your money.Best new game I've bought so far this year 4.3/5.0 rating.  Enjoy everyone!
Positive,"UPDATE:Many of the other positive updates treat it fairly and exhaustively, so rather than echo them I prefer to mention the things that are more special to me.One of the most remarkable aspects of ESO is how it continually improves. Beyond that, it seems that each wave of improvements is of a greater magnitude than the last. This game had a very rough launch, and rough early life.Most recently I got back online after a prolonged hiatus brought on by performance issues surrounding running the Morrowind content on my Sony Potato. Returning I've seen a drastic number of 'Quality of Life' improvements. Also, their work under the hood is obvious since the game performs better now than ever before.Their monetization model is still among the fairest and cleanest I've seen. I've never encountered a time where I've felt frustrated by not having purchased some DLC or item. The Crown Store is restricted plainly to cosmetic and convenience. As for the ESO Plus subscription, beyond a couple niceties it allows, it also grants more than its value in Crown currency. I recommend an ESO Plus subscription simply to support the continued good will development of ESO.Thankfully ESO still boasts of an excellent community with very low toxicity. Granted, this is somewhat expected for 'gated community' buy-to-play games. Nonetheless, even with drastically rising popularity (partially due to lower price for the base game) I have not observed but the tiniest rise in behaviors that could be deemed toxic. Though some bemoan the instanced housing system, I've played games that haven't been instanced and am glad to be free of the mess. Instancing is superior for retaining the value to all players and not degrading the quality of the shared world. I'm not crazy about housing, but I do appreciate feeling like my character has its own slice of life carved into the world."
Positive,"About the saga: If you played older scrolls games you know the interactions/quests was way more complex for example ""go to a far away cave to the north east and look for a key someone and talk to someone at some city that have a unique type of trees"", yes it makes you get really into the game and be part of it, but times have changed, also this isn't another elder scrolls game, it's an MMO and it works like it.when i started i wanted it to be TES6, and i didnt enjoyed seeying how fast the game goes and too many people everywhere, but it was all my fault for making the game be what i want and not what it is.After even my friends stop playing the game i came back to it and just played the game, started to understand how things work and could enjoy it for the first time, the base game itself its really worth it, there is a lot of content and IF you dont feel like spending any more money you can stick with it.About the subscription:its really worth it, the subscription gives you full access to all DLCs, that means infinity of dungeons, quests, new zones, clans, craft bag (something like a doraemon pocked where you can store all craft items and it will not count for your backpack storage, many people think that just this alone its worth the sub), and it also gives you CROWNS! with those crowns you can actualy buy the DLCs that you like and they will be yours forever, even after your  subscription ends, i did sub for a while and endup buying a lot of DLCs and still have crowns to buy more if that caught my attention in the future without having to sub, or also i can buy cosmetics with it if i feel like to.so yeah, the game is worth it, really just give it a try with the base game, and you can spend a LOT of hours on it without paying for anything else."
Positive,"Edit: I will leave my old review at the bottom for clarity.  Current opinion: Not my cup of tea. However I haven't really played the game either. I have so many games in my library. Someday I'll get to this one too. Just don't go into this game expecting everything to be like ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"".  I must say I am impressed with what the developers were going for. The result should be taken with a grain of salt though. To me it was very hard to get into the game, understand it's mechanics and general storyline. THere just seems to be too much to do and too much to learn for it to be enjoyable. You have to put a alot of time into the game to enjoy it. Also everythings feels very repetitive. There's no real challenge, just doing the same thing over and over again...Graphics are great, however if your PC isn't the greatest it might not handle certain settings well.I must say, I was kinda dissapointed in the game and would only reccomend it to those who are REALLY into MMOs."
Positive,"Like others have said, This is not Skyrim Online. However, if you enjoy TES Lore and questing with friends (Sorta like borderlands/ diablo) then this game is worth it (If you usually dont like PvP). It usually goes on sale so wait if you want.Zenimax has been improving this game since its underwhelming launch and it continues to get better. I'm personally not a huge MMO fan but I love playing ESO from time to time. PS: Yes the game is heavily populated and is currently the most active it has ever been."
Positive,"I've honestly had some of my favourite gaming memories on this game, I previously played this on PS4 and I can assure you that it's worth every penny especially if you're a fan of The Elder Scrolls series.There is plenty to do and daily challenges keep you active, but I do suggest playing with friends, I just hope one day this can be cross-play so then I can join back with my old clan on PlayStation."
Positive,i got bit by some extremely hairy dude and got turned into a furry.
Positive,I prefer it to real life
Positive,"I took advantage of that free weekend promotion to play 15h (almost straight, barely slept)The game is awesome! No regrets!I decided to not buy it because i have stuff to do and knowing myself it could get in the way, but now i'm not doing them because i can't stop thiking about it, and i want to play it, but i don't have it and it's not affordable anymore. out of reach. that's my only regret.. but doesn't concern gameplay so...oh, about gameplay, i'm bit sad about having to choose between diferent classes limiting my skillset, but i could live with thatFarewell, Tamriel"
Positive,"Coming from many hours of the mess that was Tera, I really like this mmo. Less grind-y until you get to end game when you have a gear set planned out as you can solo group dungeons for the same loot drops with varied stats each time you run them. Added benefit of the game having lore most people are already familiar with. Crafting can be difficult unless you save up enough gold or pay with real cash for more inventory slots as there's so much you can craft and resources are obtained very easily but some are rare and worth a lot in the guild stores. A lot of the items in the Crown store can be still obtained by just playing the game itself very easily and don't even really need to be there in the first place so there isn't a need to feel restricted by micro-transactions. Most PVE guilds are amazing and super friendly and willing to help you if you need to! This game is heavy on character customization and you can spend gold to make costumes and dye them. You earn permanent style dyes by completing quests or achievements and the ones in the crown store are temporary and lame. Its worth paying for the + subscription instead of buying the dlcs outright as some are not even available to purchase anymore and there's way more to explore. As long you don't fall to the temptations of the loot boxes, this game really doesn't feel like a money pit by comparison!"
Positive,"First of all ,why the game review score is mixed? it should be very positive!I just finished the main quest today,defeating Molag Bal and started the adventures on new lands,kinda exciting.When I first played the eso was on the CB test when they wanted to make a record of players online in any CB MMO the zones were full of ppls loadin screens took hours and others bad things, but now I must say I'm playing it from the end of the december last year and I enjoy it very much ,when I stept into Shadowfen and I saw those Ayeld ruins reminded me of my favorit TES game from the serie , Oblivion.And yes the story is not very closer to the TES series but let's be fair this is a mmo after all not next TES:6 game. And the players who always complain about the bugs WTF? I only encountered like very few unnoticed by most of the players and one time I felt beneath the map hehe but that's all .Let's be serious there where ever created a game and launched without bugs? NO ,that's why are updates/patches. And why most of stupid ppls tend to complain about the story when they never understand the real story behind tes games and only played like Skyrim ..so after all I've been trough as a Ebonheart Pact I really loved the feeling all the dialogue and all the awesome scripts I've been trough, and can't wait to see what's expecting me on the others zones I'll have to play next...And 1 more thing about the 17 march when they will make the game B2P I just they won't ruin the game making it P2W,have a wonderful time playing this greate game and see you in Cyrodiil !"
Positive,The release of Tamriel Unlimited update and current patches makes this game well worth a play.
Positive,Yeah I only play a little bit
Positive,Very good game. High addiction potential! 10/10
Positive,"Well uhm.. If anyone's thinking it's Skyrim 2 - it isn't. It is NOTHING like Skyrim. The game's kinda annoying sometimes, hard to learn, but if you mainly play MMORPGs then the game's for you. I didn't play any MMORPGs before so it was super hard for me to get in this game especially when I bought it because I thought it was Skyrim 2. It isn't. Pretty cool game overall. Also pretty big in roleplay, so if you like roleplay, go ahead, it's cool."
Positive,"Ohh eh heyoh!The game is amazingly refreshing from our typical MMOs..  No more  hovering over a spell Icon to cast. Though the taste of having only 5 spells active 1-5 is quite nice. Each class can be an abled magicka user with staff or stamina build with weapons. Finding the perfect fit is fun for a newbie and I enjoy it a lot. So much content, and all the content and even leaves and placement of trees etc etc seems so articulate of a mighty hand.. The terrain looks and feels actual.. The zones are so beautiful..The quests are full of depth and if you don't spam accept and take the time to read them, the immersion increases and you then become a warrior poet in the heat of battle youself! much funThere are some minor things that I am not a big fan of personally.. But for reals, get over it.. Again, its refreshing and fun.. Action packed, surprises everywhere.I cant think of a logical reason why anyone if one , would decide to give this game a negative score.. Because It simply does not deserve one.It might not be right for some etc etc, but doth not make it a bag game.. It excels.As I have returned from launch I learned that all creatures Scale to your level, Just like in skyrim.. Ive played many MMOs and have never seen this.. Tis why refreshing aye? *drinks*Though one thing I am big on with mmo games is that support and community relations is #1.. They listen to their players and get things done.. only time will tell if they make it easy or dumbed down. You know we all know *spills drink* dangit..Anywho.. Buy the game on steam. Get the Auction Addons Via Minion. and run around.. Good timesHey Peter! Check out channel Nine!~~Wow"

Positive,"The storylines are interesting, and there's a ton of quests to keep you busy. It feels like an Elder Scrolls game with all the lore and epic quests. Sometimes the MMO format can make the story feel a bit less personal, but there's still a lot to enjoy.You get that classic Elder Scrolls freedom to explore, and that's awesome. There are hidden spots and dungeons all over the place. It feels like a real adventure, and you can go at your own pace.Combat is a mix of what you love about Elder Scrolls and MMOs. It's dynamic, and the special abilities add a new layer. It takes some getting used to, especially if you're used to the old single-player style, but it's still fun.Playing with others is a blast. Teaming up for quests or taking on dungeons with friends adds a whole new dimension. The social aspect is cool, and there's always something happening in the world.They keep adding stuff, which is great. New quests, areas, and features keep the game fresh. It's nice to know they're committed to keeping players interested with regular updates.The player community is active and friendly. Developers are engaged and listen to feedback. It feels like you're part of something, especially if you join a guild.If you're an Elder Scrolls fan and want to explore Tamriel with friends or other players, ESO is a good time. The graphics are stunning, the stories are engaging, and there's a lot to discover. It's not the same as the old games, but it's a fun way to experience the Elder Scrolls universe in a new light. Definitely worth a shot, especially if you're into MMOs and group adventures.Negatives:Some players find that the combat doesn't have the same weight and impact as in the single-player Elder Scrolls games. The animations might feel a bit floaty for those used to the more grounded combat of the series.When starting the game, some players feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of quests and activities available in the initial zones. It can be a bit confusing for new players trying to figure out where to start.While not necessary to enjoy the game, some players dislike the optional subscription model (ESO Plus) that provides various benefits. Some feel that certain features, like the crafting bag for unlimited crafting material storage, are almost essential and should be available to all players without a subscription. (I think it's definitely worth buying if you're playing it and contributing to the developers.)ESO has a learning curve, especially for players new to MMOs. The game introduces various mechanics, systems, and terminology that might be overwhelming for those unfamiliar with the genre.Balancing issues in Player vs. Player (PvP) combat has been a point of contention. Some players feel that certain classes or abilities are overpowered, leading to frustration in PvP scenarios.While the game generally runs well, some players experience performance issues, particularly in densely populated areas or during large-scale PvP battles. This can lead to frame rate drops and occasional lag.But over the years they have offered very good performance improvements in this regard.While player housing is a feature, the customization options are somewhat limited compared to standalone housing games. Players looking for an in-depth housing experience may find ESO's system lacking.The presence of a Crown Store (in-game cash shop) for purchasing cosmetic items, mounts, and other conveniences can be a turn-off for players who prefer a more traditional approach to acquiring in-game items. But you can compensate for these shortcomings with the many events and monthly rewards they offer you. You can also purchase these cosmetics from players in exchange for in-game money.Of course, these positive and negative thoughts vary from individual to individual. I just wanted to share my individual comments and experiences. It is one of the most valuable games I can recommend."
Positive,"buy this game if you:a) are a lore nerd and another re-reading of 36 lessons/yet another biography of barenziah/forum discussion titled ""are people who play as khajiits all secretly furries"" (locked by a moderator after 5k posts) just isn't doing it for you anymoreb) have never played any mmorpg beforec) enjoy having broken servers every major in-game event (also just hate yourself in general)d) want to try to play without eso-plus but give up and purchase it anywaysi give this game ""i can't believe WoW is fukking dead"" out of ""still better lgbt rep than overwatch will ever have"""
Positive,"I've played this game for well over 2 years, and there have been moments where I've gotten bored of it, but I always came back. It's not some insanely fun game or totally amazing, but it's pretty calming if you're just questing. If you're slow and more patient, then you'll love questing and doing group dungeons with friends. If you're more competitive, you can compete against other players and get a spot on the leaderboards. I've been in the end game area and I've loved every minute of it; I've also just decided to go for a slow pace and quest to my hearts content.There will be times where you're annoyed at how slow it can be sometimes, and how some things may not go your way, but it's a little impossible to put down (for me and others anyways). One last thing, I love how they've implemented ""Level up Rewards from 1-50"", as well as ""Daily Rewards"", it really allows people who don't want to use their money on cosmetic items to get a chance at obtaining them! All in all a solid ""5/7"" xD (8/10)"
Positive,"Update! In 2020 the game is only getting better, with all the recent performance upgrades things are looking bright :) OK, so first of all the game is amazing, and recent negative reviews are completely silly and only point out that steam is buggy, but that has nothing to do with the game itself. Also the bugs have been offically fixed so theres no reason to worry, The Game is fantastic and so full of content that as both an MMO and Elder Scrolls lover I feel spoiled! theres just so much to do! Its a blast! Easily the greatest game out right now! I;m not just saying that, Theres also huge 2000 man battles agaist other players on the map that takes an hour to cross if thats your sort of thing ;) Previous Review:Once upon a time there was a man named micah and he began to play a game called elder scrolls.As he played the game he kept dying over and over due to being such a noob.A fairy princess appeared before my dead lifeless body and spoke these words, ""ahen des ramina"" Which meant in the fairneese language, ""you will die tomorrow at midnight if you don't repost this message and send it to 10 of your friends. If you send this post to 20 friends your crush will send you a text saying they love you.""Needless to say this game is great! Cheers. P.S this is a great game and I recommend it #BestElderScrollsGame #BestMMO"
Positive,"ESO may not be the game for you if you come to expect a lore driven game like skyrim. Remember, this is an MMO catering to everyone at the same time - so it certainly won't be a personal experience.Pros:-All characters are voiced, although it may get annoying at times-Controls are simplistic and the HUD is not confusing-Scenery is nice if you have a powerful enough computer-You can install addons if you do not like the UI-Continues to have active guilds that progress through endgame PvE contentCons:-very laggy if your computer cannot handle so many users (Same for any MMO really)-Storyline is a grind, if you don't do it the game is going to keep telling you to do it over and over again in the cities-Can get boring without friends. (Same with any MMO)-Dying PvP scene"
Positive,"Killed 100 NPCs and took their sh*t. Now, no npc wants to talk to me, so I'll have to wait 4 to 7 days offline, while my bounty will decrease. 100 dead savants out of 10."
Positive,This game after the relaunch is great and i encourage everyone to try it if your hesitating!
Positive,"Played all of the Elder Scrolls Games and They are all different and this one is no different.Nothing Like SkyrimNothing Like OblivionNothing Like MorrowindIts a MMORPG and the best one going10/10 Best Elder Scrolls Game by FARHowever, i got this on release and since then all prices have gone down. Got a rubbish dog for 500 crowns. Now you can get Horse,Dog,Potions,Repairs,Armour for the same price but still10/10"
Positive,"I totally recommend this game. It's totally fantastic, it's an MMORPG but not your common and boring grinding mmorpg with poor story. The game involves you with it's story, it's graphics, the ambient, with the mood. I'm not going to rate each characteristic of the game because everything is really perfect and I would rate 10 every single thing.If you love single player RPG, buy it, the feeling is the same or better. If you got bored of all those MMORPG there, then buy it too, it will surely make you addicted."
Positive,"Alright, let's get into some back-story. So I am a HUGE Elder's Scrolls fan, and when ESO was announced, I was psyched.......Until they announced that you needed to pay to play, even on the PC. Since then, I pretty much avoided everything related to the game. Recently, I had to move to another country. My best friend and I wanted a game that we could both, and maybe a few more people, play. Around the same time, Zenimax announced that in a few months, the game would  be subscription-free. We decided on ESO:TU, and I must say, I am not disappointed. I have roughly 65 hours under my belt right now, level 9, and probably still considered a ""noob."" There are HUNDREDS of hours of gameplay. The game has it's own story-line, which I won't divulge too much into ('cause, you know, spoilers.) I must admit, me and the other 3 people I am playing with have swayed quite a bit aways from the main story line, and instead have done loads of side-quests, each of which has it's own seperate lore. Each city in the game also has it's own story, so don't worry about having nothing to do. Every week or so, there is also an update adding new quests and other locations. Soon, the game will have all the locations of Tamriel, the continent in which all of the Elder's Scrolls games (so far) have taken place in. All in all, this is an amazing game, and I would recommend this to any friend in a heartbeat."
Positive,"DO NOT.. buy this game. I've played one time for an hour, the 2nd time I tried to get on it crashed after hitting play on the launcher. I've installed, reinstalled, etc and yet have been able to play. Waste of 60 bucks.EDIT: So after 4 months of not being able to play, Support came through and we figured this out. Been playing two days and I had a loading issue but gave it a Google real quick and fixed that issue. So with a combination of adding and deleting files that are and aren't supposed to be in my install, I got it going. Now that it is I have changed to recommended because the game is simply beautiful and I have no issues now!"
Positive,"This game is a lot of fun!  In the description it states you can play the way you want to, well it's true.  You can make a sorcerer and wear heavy armor, or a warrior and wear light armor and use a stave.  On top of that you can choose to join groups such as the mages guild or warriors guild and more which also have there own skill line.After a certain level you gain a second ability bar and use of a secondary set of weapon(s).  So one second your a sorcerer summoning daedric pets and shooting fireballs, the next second your dual wielding knives and mowing down highly confused enemies.Armor is not even set in stone.  You can craft in all of the races armor styles!  Then you can even change its color.  Colors are unlocked through achievments.  To add even more custom options you choose different cloth types to craft in changing the gears look even more.Example:  My chracter is a High Elf sorcerer, vampire, thief, wearing heavy armor wielding a staff and will sometimes suddenly use a sword and shield."
Positive,"Update: group queuing is back again. Thank you very much for hearing your community. Lots of love, NekoI really liked Eso. Until they killed Pvp for me regarding queue system for battlegrounds.Before the change you could play along with 3 other friends in short pvp games like capture the flag, death match and so on.. Now you only can do it alone with 3 other randoms.What is the sense for a mmo if i cannot play it together with friends? Battlegrounds was super cool for casual pvp if you had no time for alliance war (mostly playable with big group/guild, so only when the guild has time, mostly 2h+, no public community). I played battlegrounds with only 1 friend (so 2 randoms in the group) and yes we also had problems with super good premade groups of 4 players. But it wasnt so often that it was an issue for us.Changing to only allow randoms playing together is not fair for the other half of the community too. I hope they will find another way to solve this issue.All in all Eso is dead for me with this change. Like i said i loved battlegrounds and doing some casual pvp here and pve there WITH friends.If i just want to play really good pve i will restart WoW.....Nevertheless Eso is a good game.Love the graphics and style. Love the classes and opportunities to play each of them.If you are looking for a game where you have to invest massive amounts of hours to play pvp, eso will be your choice.If you are looking for casual pvp/pve with friends i would not recommend it as it is now."
Positive,"UPDATE AFTER ESO MORROWIND (5/22/2017)I had an opportunity to participate in the ESO Morrowind beta test and played around 30 hours. The developers did an amazing job with the environments, artwork and quests in this zone. Surprisingly, it felt a lot more like the single player TES games compared to other zones. The battlegrounds game mode was so much fun that I will probably be doing this most of the time from now on. I especially liked Team Deathmatch mode and my favorite map is the Foyada Quarry. Strongly recommend this expansion for anyone who is a fan of Elder Scrolls games or anyone who enjoys Deathmatch and Capture the Flag PVP.I have two main concerns with ESO Morrowind. First the world of Vvardenfell feels so much like a single player TES game that I suspect many new players will try to play the same way I did, wandering around exploring instead of doing quests in a specific order like other MMOs. As a result, I ran into some areas that were locked off or missing NPC dialogue because I had not done some other quest X, Y or Z. These quests would benefit from an alternate quest giver added for players who like to explore. It's frustrating to wander into some really cool environment, but none of the NPCs will talk to you because you didn't do some other quest.Second concern is the battlegrounds are fun, but need an improved queuing system and they should provide much more experience and alliance points. People who love the battlegrounds will want to spend most of their time just doing this and unfortunately you don't earn enough XP or AP to level up new characters or buy monster helms each weekend. I was only earning about 9k - 12k AP/hr compared to avg 25k/hr in Cyrodiil. And I didn't earn hardly any XP at all.The battlegrounds queuing system also needs to allow players to queue up for battlegrounds and just stay in the queue all evening instead of exiting the map and requeuing each time. If they become popular I hope the devs will add a way to queue for specific maps and specific game mode. There is also a bug with premade group queue for BG as of 5/22.GAME BALANCE AFTER ESO MORROWINDBalance is never going to be perfect, but they are continually working on this and it has improved tremendously since launch. You can make a viable character from any of the five classes and your choice of stamina or magicka focus, light, med or heavy armor.Based on experience in battlegrounds (with no champion points) I'd say heavy armor is still a little too strong compared to light or medium, and sorc class stands out with high tankiness and high damage output compared to other classes thanks to ranged execute, great mobility and very large shields that scale off the offensive damage stat (max magicka). Hopefully they will buff light and medium armor passives a bit to bring them in line with heavy armor.Warden is a strong class and quite versatile to play as healer, tank or damage dealer, but it is not any sort of ""I win"" button. If you play Warden you are still going to die a lot like any other class.OVERALL GAME EXPERIENCEPlayed ESO a ton of hours. Starting in 2013, I participated in the Psijic Order testing group on the long term public test server (PTS), and since launch I've leveled up several characters to max, lot of time in PVP.It's a lot more polished now than it was at launch but still not perfect - there are still some bugs and glitches, and three years later the game is still undergoing adjustments to the balance. Regardless, I highly recommend Elder Scrolls Online. Feel free to message me through Steam or in-game @IcyDeadPeople if I can help answer any questions you have about the game.ESO is not exactly a role playing game or co-op sequel to TES single player games. When you enter Cyrodiil, it feels like a medieval siege warfare sandbox game in Elder Scrolls setting. When you enter the battlegrounds it is a fast paced PVP deathmatch game with a fun combat system. When you enter a group dungeon or trial, it is a fun co-op adventure with some tough boss fights where you need to figure out some interesting mechanics. Then there is the meta game aspect of learning how to amass a pile of gold and a rather deep and engaging crafting system. The housing system is still new, but I think it has potential for player generated content, such as hopefully someday designing and sharing your own battlegrounds map etcThis is the first MMO I've tried that I really enjoyed and continued playing for more than a couple days. Tried WoW for two days and quickly got bored of it. Tried SWTOR weekend beta which had interesting narrative cutscenes, but the gameplay was not appealing. I came into this as a fan of the Elder Scrolls games, not a fan of MMOs. Played many hours of Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim, and created mods for the last two.When I started during the 2013 beta, I approached ESO like Skyrim with co-op mode, focused on exploring the world, getting into the narrative and doing quests together with friends. You can sort of play the game like this (especially in Vvardenfell zone), but eventually you will probably be more interested in PVP or endgame dungeons.PVP IS FUNIf you are looking for the open world sandbox environment, it is here. Every day when you log on to Cyrodiil, there is a different narrative going on. There could be a new guild visiting from a different campaign to help your friend become an Emperor, or the enemy factions might be teaming up in some epic three way siege battle that lasts several hours, etc.You make up your own quests playing together with friends in Cyrodiil, and they are more fun than the PVE quests in my view.  One day your quest might be to sneak past a host of enemy players to set up a camp for your guildmates, or say, playing the roll of a bridge troll, hiding and killing people who try to cross another day you are helping a friend get revenge on a dude who keeps killing him in Bruma etc.Even if you have never played MMOs before, or were mainly into PVE, the PVP combat system is a lot of fun and anyone can learn how to become proficient at killing other players.PVE IS DIFFERENT FROM SKYRIMIt is possible to approach ESO like the single player TES games, wandering off in any direction in the PVE areas and doing your own thing, talking to NPCs here and there or just exploring. There are some compelling stories and strong voice acting in some of the quests. However, like other MMOs, the enemies keep respawning and just stand around in spots waiting for players, etc.By necessity, the PVE combat encounters in ESO can't compare to the living world experience in Skyrim, where NPC enemies have more complex AI behaviors. The AI is different because it must handle multiple players in the same area at once. The story, environments and artwork in the new expansion ESO MORROWIND come closest to recreating some aspects of this experience.The pinnacle of ESO's PVE experience is learning how to beat the toughest bosses in group dungeons and trials. If you really want to excel at this, at some point you need to make friends with other players who can teach you the mechanics and perhaps join a guild. You also need to figure out a build, choose armor sets and abilities.CHARACTER PROGRESSION IS DEEPThere are so many different ways to customize your character. Just as with the previous TES games, any class can use any weapon. A large part of the fun of this game is researching and coming up with your own build ideas, customizing your abilities with various armor sets and choosing which weapons to specialize in. Any of the five classes can be a healer, melee warrior, destruction mage or archer, based on your weapon choices.When you progress in crafting you can make amazing potions, food, weapons, armor, enchantments that are incredibly useful - even furniture and materials for building a house. You can sell these items to other players and earn lots of gold."
Positive,"Sometimes I forget I'm playing an MMOrpg and that's a good thing.Rather than break down the specifics of the game which are already well documented, the most notable thing I've found isn't in what it does well but rather what it simply does differently. ESO scales every character up or down as if they were level 50. Take that in for a second. Rather than following a winding path carefully laid out for you and fine tuned to ease you from tutorial to end game you can simply go nearly anywhere and do almost anything whenever it pleases you to do so. New DLC came out but you're not max level yet? It doesn't matter, you can hop right in. They manage this without ever stopping the feeling of character progression as you're constantly allocating points into tangible benefits. What this does is it puts emphasis on each quest line being its own self contained adventure with proper pacing leading to some often decent writing and an abundance of scripted events.Good game."
Positive,"game is good, but to ff14. not so much"
Positive,If you love mmorpg's and Skyrim then you will love this.
Positive,"I decided to change my review after more than 2,000 hours of ESO playing.Well, this is my first MMORPG game. I bought it because I read good reviews, and I was willing to try it for a long time. And I really like it. It's simply fantastic, and the game's number of quests, tales, characters, legends, literature, etc are really astonishing. The ESO community are very friendly (with few obvious idiots), kind and helpful.I recommend you to buy it (preferable during a sale). ESO has a subscriptiom called ESO+. At first I resist to buy it. But eventually I did. Despite the fact that I still disagree with ESO+ system, I.must admit it is quite useful IF you are interested to a more immersive experience.But be aware: if you are thinking of buying ESO just for curiosity, DON'T DO THAT! This is a complex game, and in order to play it with its fullness you must spend money and time. A lot.If you othewise are really interested in to know more about MMORPG games, I think ESO is an amazing experience.Sorry my bad english."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls® Online is one of those games where i should ""eat my hat"" for critising it. When the game first launched in 2014 had lots of cons (subscription fee 15 €/month, gameplay had wierd feeling and many more). Now in 2017 this game looks like total different one.Pros:+no sub fee any more (only if you want to)+awesome quests+huge map+they've designed the server in a very pioneer way and what i mean by that? For those who wanna go on PVPing there is Cyrodill, for those who wanna go on PVEing there's the rest of Tamriel.+PVEing is awesome+great and very helpful community+beatiful graphics+astonishing enviroment+UI is better than Skyrim+great story so far+crafting might also be better than Skyrim+low specs required. The only thing it asks is 80gb but that amount is normal for a MMO+leveling it's better than Skyrim+historically i think the game goes before Oblivion cause i recall killing Mannimarco in it, while in this one Mannimarco lives+no lagCons:No cons so farBethesda/Zenimax thank you for turning around this game; You've done a great job here.

Otherwise, I'd recommend sticking to the base Elder Scrolls Game for about 10$ when it is on sale. I'd also recommend staying away from the plus membership since it does not seem worth it overall (at least if you're not spending anymore money for crowns)."
Positive,"*Disclaimer: I played TES from Daggerfall to Skyrim, so I may be biased a little.Like:- Big area, with enough space and opportunity for everyone - Realtime collision-based combat, unlike so many other MMO which use auto-attack or random dice mechanics- Character customization is quite thorough, even body shape is customizable. Want a potbelly? No problem- Very high freedom of character development, it's likely you won't see 10 people with same builds in the same room- What you do makes you .. level up. - Stable economy with not so much emphasis on goldly wealth. - PvP of epic proportion- Most importantly, not pay to win; almost all Crown Store stuffs are for aesthetic prettiness onlyDislike:- Big area sometimes makes you wonder if you are actually playing a single-player game instead of an MMO- Face and body feature customization could use more choices. My hero's chest is not hairy enough.- Realtime collision-based combat also means the slower and less agile among us would be disadvantaged- IMO all Class skill lines should also be open to everyone. Dragonknight+Sorcerer would be awesome- Lack of chat bubbles or dialog subtitles make towns somewhat ... quiet (Chat bubbles feature is on the way though)- What? No skill lines for Fist weapons?- *update* No Asian server. I'm from Asia and I find the lag caused by the high ping to US server a big disadvantage for my in PvPSummary:I've played many MMOs before, but TESO is a breath of fresh air to me. Sure, it has bad reviews during the Beta, but exposing the rough edges IS the whole point of beta-testing anyway. Also, remember that this is an MMORPG, not a single player game, so of course it will not be 100% like Skyrim. Or TES6 : Elsweyr, if you believe that rumor.So, yes, if you want to try something new, I recommend TESO."
Positive,"Now if you're looking for a MMO, I highly reccomend ESO.I'd like to start off by saying, yes the game has many bugs and flaws in it. That is not something that can be ignored, however despite the bugs the community, gameplay, and story are really solid. Questing in ESO can take quite a few hours, and if you join a few good guilds you will never run out of things to do. There's so much creativity in the dueling and pvp, and the raids are unique and memorable. Even if you don't pvp or aren't into it, ESO's pve has many different options for you to explore from raids, quests, bosses, dungeons, delves, arenas, etc.My hours on steam aren't accurate to the amount I've played, as I've just recently started using steam again and purchased the steam version after a long steam hiatus. Still, this is probaly one of my favorite games as it currently stands, and I really reccomend trying it!"
Positive,"""The best MMORPG I've ever played - by far""ESO is an excellent MMORPG. The story is very good and even mundane side quests have interesting dialogue and characters. The combat is by far the best I've ever seen in an MMO. It's a bit grindy at times, but if you play it over a long time it's really not that bad. All quests are fully voice acted which is unique for an MMO of this scale. Graphics are great and it's obvious a lot of love and care was put into the game. I'd recommend the game any day."
Positive,Changed my mind. This game is great.You get to fix internal strife stricken family issues as a complete stranger.
Positive,"After playing WoW, GW2 and LOTRO this MMO is absolutely the best"
Positive,"50 hours of playing, 250 hours of patching."
Positive,I have 600+ hours through their own launcher and I bought the game through steam so i could upload my screenshots of the game. Feel free to figure out from that if I recommend this game or not! lol
Positive,Still good :D
Positive,Hi... I have a problem... before i bought that game... I played between 3-4 games every day... now I bought the game... and it is the only game that i played the last 2 weeks... This game is sooo good...  my recommendation... BUY IT!!! NOW!!! JUST DO IT!!!! DONT LET YOURE DREAMS BE DREAMS!!! JUST PLAY TESO!!!The game is better than Skyrim 6/5
Positive,"If you've played the previous Elder Scrolls titles, you'll feel right at home in this one. This time the world is just filled with other people. Offers tons of content and the world is filled with quests. Some of them can be quite generic ""kill x and bring back y"" -type of quests. But the main quest is quite interesting and The DLC's offer better stories, so the gold edition is worth considering. The community is friendly and you can easily find active guilds to play with.For more hardcore players there's PVP and harder group dungeons if you're into those."
Positive,"I loved this game, it's awesome and really interesting, however it's awful that it has thousands of microtransactions. I played it alone and replayed it with some friends, the base game is awesome, but it feels incomplete when you access the crownstore. As an experience I reccommend this game, if you see it on a free weekend and you want to try a new game, then make some space in your disk, cuz last time i played it, I needed 100GB for this game and I dont regret downloading that ammout in something like 24 hours, tho I bought the game after that cuz i had already downloaded the game, yeah that's another con, nobody wants 0.1TB occupied by a 2014 game. I'd say it's a solid 8/10"
Positive,"Definitely not as ""horrible"" as people make the game out to be. Due to my previous experience in MMO games, I genuinely enjoy playing this game. It keeps that nostalgic feel of Skyrim and mixes it in pefectly with the MMO style. 100% recommend this game!"
Positive,"Believe the other positive reviews, this game is purely amazing. Go into this with an open mind and you'll have a blast, go into this thinking it is Skyrim Online, and you probably won't enjoy it all that much. That is all that I can say about this, as while I have only a couple of hours, have developed enough of a basis to recommend this game."
Positive,"I've play a good number of MMORPGs from Ultima Online and WoW to some that I can't even remember the names of. Every one that I've ever played left me with a long of list of things I'd change to make the perfect game. Elder Scrolls Online comes the closest to that list of any game I've played. Ever. I've also been a big fan of The Elder Scrolls series from way back with Arena and Daggerfall. Skyrim is one of my all-time favorite games, and I'd wanted that same feel in an MMO game since it first came out. Some of the things I LOVE about  ESO:     Enormous open world.    Balanced PVP system where you don't have to worry about greifers ganking you endlessly at every turn.     Rich narrative with hundreds (thousands?) of stories and fully voiced interactions.    A resource and economic system that encourages trading and participation, rather than hording, grinding, and taking advantage of each other.     A guild system that reflects the cooperative economic system.     Simple but effective skill/leveling system.    Free-to-play, but with plenty of DLC so you'll never run out of things to do.     Free-to-play, but not pay to win. Crown store items might help you look cool or go up in level faster, but they won't help you win a fight. ;)  I seriously can't say enough good things about this game, the world it's created, and the people who play it."
Positive,Too many great games to play. Too little time.
Positive,its fun. i supposeStill pretty fun

Positive,I don't know if I played enough to recommend this game ...
Positive,"10 years and ~3500 hours later, I guess I am qualified to leave a review.It's pretty good."
Positive,"Because of the large scale, it's not as packed with content as skyrim. But it's definetly worth the play if you're an elder scrolls fan, the solo experience feels great, because you can explore so much of tamriel.If you're an mmorpg player, this might also be something for you. The PvE part, dungeons etc, is fun with some friends and it's nice that the loot is not only beneficial for your next dungeon. But you can also use it to lead your alliance to victory in PvP."
Positive,"A bit of background. I purchased this game a while back when it was on half price, around $35AUD at the time. Back then they had just started releasing DLC, and the game, for lack of a better word felt 'empty'. Not of content, not of story, but of people. The game had just purged itself of its old system, and has since then gradually been crawling its way out of the abyss. Additionally, my game time shown by steam isn't a very good gauge of my time playing the game, I think at this stage it should be around 300hrs. This is primarily because I started opening the game via the direct launcher shortcut that I keep on my taskbar, rather than through steam. It's a lot faster and saves having to wait for steam to do it's thing, only to open the launcher anyway. I hear they may have changed it lately, but I'll probably still stick with my taskbar.Anyway, on with my thoughts.In it's story, it fulfils it purpose and earns the Elder Scrolls name. The story is rich an interesting, and has a nice amount of intrigue peppered with the elder scrolls signature emotive flair that is snuck in. Even if it's a lonely skeleton in a desert it has a purpose, and there's a lot you miss from not hearing out the npc's. Of course the story varies through each area, from the constant tragedy of the early Ebonheart Pact, to the wonder that is Rivinspire in the Daggerfall Covenent and the constant political intrigue of the Aldmeri Dominion. And lets not forget the wonderful characters that guide you throughout each story: The comically self-aware Razum-Dar, Sir Darien Gautier of the make both love and war, and the sultry tease that is Naryu Virian. It's the characters that make the story, and in that way it truly does live up to the elder scrolls name.The game mechanics and combat system come next. Now this seems to be the part with which the game receives the most flak. So let's be clear here. This is not Skyrim. It is an MMO made utilising the elder scrolls lore as base. It's combat system is not turn based like WoW and such, and I've seen it likened to Guild Wars, particularly the PvP side of things. It runs on cooldowns and the like, with two main distinctions setting them apart. The abiltities and the spammables. The abiltites have the cooldowns, and the spammables are just that. My main criticism of the combat however, is the lack of weight that comes with it. When you hit someone, there's rarely an animation to show that. You feel like your blows are doing nothing but making the red bar above the enemies head move from full to empty. For big bosses that's fine, but when you're fighting a lone enemy or a small group, you expect for your blows to have a sense of impact and cause a reaction, and as I said earlier, this is rare. I personally enjoy the skill system, it has a lot of opportunities from the get go and doesn't force you in any particular direction. Each class has three skill trees, and you can pick and choose the weapon and armour skill trees to focus on, as well as the helpful guild ones. With the recent inclusion of weapon based ultimate abilities, this opportunity has increased further. Over all of that you can focus on three things; magicka, stamina or both, and although from patch to patch the meta around it changes, my personal belief is that if you're following the meta then you're not playing the game to its full potential (I'm looking at all of you peeps who look up the 'best' builds). My favourite thing about the skills and classes however, is that any class can fulfil any job. I'll use some of the most stark contrasts as examples. Sorcerer's and nightblades, the traditional dps classes, can tank. Even more fasinating is the fact you can run a sorcerer with a stamina build. Just think about that for a minute. It's something fresh that has really allowed me to enjoy the game, expecially considering that with in game gold you can pay to have your skills reset, and completely remake your entire character.Finally we reach the last part, the community. When I first started, I barely saw 10 people around the main cities, and rarely saw anyone out in the wilds, although this could be chalked up to me living in Australia and having an odd timezone, it was still somewhat disheartening. So as I do, I played through the games story by myself. It was difficult at times, and I thought it would be really great to get to a boss and have help, or for someone to show me around and help me out. The real fun began when I noticed the chat for the first time. Ahhhhh, the zone chat, home of shenanigans, memes and random bouts of text based song. Of course you have the usually wtb and wts posts just like any other mmo, but the community really does just have fun. The community itself is probably one of my favourite ones in any MMO. When I first jumped in, everyone was friendly and willing to help and give advice, hell, people gave me free stuff, or offered to craft for me. I had upwards of 10 pm's in the first couple of minutes of asking people to help me out getting into the game. Looking back on the earlier month in particular, this was no more clear than during the Halloween event. This was probably one of the greatest things I've seen in the game, there were so many people, and everyone was willing to trade, or even give away duplicates of the special halloween loot. Whole groups would camp dungeons, and chat about random things while they waited for the bosses to respawn, whether it be daily life, movies, the game, progress on the halloween achievement, or just random acts of song and dance via emotes. Some of these interactions have become my most cherished memories of the game as a whole, and I hope ZOS continues these wonderful events.Of course it has some toxicity. As anyone knows, some people are just terrible people, and as in all PvP people can get salty and hate-fueled, but that's something no MMO can claim to have avoided. Let's not mention that random game support. To be honest, the support for this game is bad, although I've never had to deal with them myself other than posting bugs on the forums. From what I've heard they have a tendency to ignore tickets, but then I also see plenty of people praising some of their solutions to particular problems, such as exploiters and loss of items. If you're playing the game right and aren't incredibly unlucky, I don't thing you'll need to worry about support. I run the game on a terrible old laptop and I've never had any performance issues that I can't chalk down to my own pile of junk laptop, with the exception of PvP lag, but when there are 60 people throwing aoe's everywhere in a small space like the forts in the PvP areas, you can't expect perfect frame-rates.That's my thoughts anway, I hope I helped."
Positive,"Dear MMO & Elder Scrolls fans,I fell in love with The Elder Scrolls from the beginning I started playing. My first Elder Scrolls game was Skyrim. I played it for hours and hours. When I heard about Elder Scrolls Online, I immediately wanted to buy the game, but a lot of very bad reviews made me decide not to buy the game. But even though I read about all those bad reviews, I still kept following news about ESO through Steam, Facebook, and the official ESO website. As soon as I learned ESO got a mayor upgrade and became ESO - Tamriel Unlimited, I also noticed the bad reviews becomming less and more and more good reviews started to appear. A few weeks ago I could not longer hold my curiosity about the game in check and just bought it anyways. Now, I regret that I did not buy it a lot sooner, because the game is INCREDEBLY COOL :)Everything is great about the game, from the graphics, to the storyline, to the easyness of the UI and controlls. This game is very exciting even when playing as a single player, just following quest after quest and getting completely lost in its vast storyline. But also the Massive Multiplayer fights are super cool.--------------------My Positives:--------------------++++ Storyline (singleplayer is superb, but also grouping and playing with friends in quests is excellent)++++ Graphics (I play at ultra high and my screen becomes a dream where I control everyting)++++ Crafting (you really have to craft and use the crafts to get better at it)+++ Character Creation (lots of ways to create diffrent races and looks)++ Gear painting  (not many colours to paint your armour, or maybe I just did not unlock enough colours yet)++++ MMO (in Cyrodil you can fight in massive multiplayer fights for your allegiance)++++ Guilds (easy to create your own guild and extend your guild from a few ranks to a real lot of ranks. You can even give your own names to diffrent ranks)--------------------My Negatives:--------------------* There are NO negatives to find in this game :P------------------------------------------------------------ESO versus Skyrim and the previous Elder Scrolls Games------------------------------------------------------------For those Elder Scrolls fans who stated that ESO has not the feeling Skyrim has and who said that it did not play as good as Skyrim did, you are very wrong! At least after the big upgrade and ESO became ESOTU. This game has a lot more then Skyrim had. ESOTU is a finetuned version of Skyrim where all the good things from Skyrim became better. In Skyrim I never played with a sword and never invested my skillpoints in stamina. But now in ESOTU you can use both magic and stamina based weapons and spells at the same time :) So now I have to invest in EVERYTHING :pSo my dear review readers, I hope my review made you convince to buy this game and become as fascinated by ESOTU as I am. Yours Truly,Tommy"
Positive,"By far the most unique MMO i have ever played. The questing is not boring, The combat is solid and dosnt seem to take a lot to run this game. Though this is indeed an MMORPG, this game has to be treated more like an elder scrolls game and less than a grind fest to late game."
Positive,I started playing ESO in 2021 I haven't played any MMORPG game before so eso was my first game ! but wow the game is so addictive I haven't stop playing it ever since ! 8/10 would recommend !
Positive,"Amazing!Reminds me a lot of Skyrim, and it's an amazing game to play with friends."
Positive,no bugs like skyrim smhhhh

Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.STEP 2Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.STEP 3Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).STEP 4Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.STEP 5Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.STEP 6Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.STEP 7Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.STEP 8Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.STEP 9Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture."
Positive,"At this time of writing, I have 4,752 hours logged INTO CHARACTERS playing on the non-steam version, seen with the /played command.I would highly recommend this game, but it also depends what your goals are in playing it. I raid in the end-game, in Veteran Hardmode content, and my fellow community of HM raiders is constantly getting slapped across the face by Zeni.If you don't plan on taking the game too seriously, in PvE or PvP, chances are you will have a pretty damn good time.Zenimax has written better story lines and lore than Bethesda has done with their mainline games. They have done justice on that front. They have done justice for the casual players. They have done justice bringing new zones and stories to Tamriel. They have done justice in many ways. But if you plan on being a hardcore player, prepare to be BACK HANDED across the face every 3 months or so. Prepare for your guilds to shut down, your raid and PvP teams to stop playing, and for gargantuan amounts of (valid) complaining from the player-base every single patch.It is true, that this issue is something you encounter in most MMO's. I've played more than I can even recall. But in ESO, it feels different. The character level cap does not change, it has always been 50 and it always will be. The gear cap does not change, it has been CP 160 and it always will be. So imagine a game where you don't need to worry about leveling up your character and re-gearing every single expansion. That's pretty cool right? Well, at the end of the day it doesn't matter, because they will destroy your favorite skills and rotations. They will take sledgehammers to your favorite sets. They will shove red hot, iron rods down your esophagus as they leave your favorite class in the dust for the third year in a row.Can you handle that? Then come play."
Positive,"I probably found seventh infinity stone - the stone of ESO, infinity game. After 20 hours of playing im´s still surprised rookie tourist in Tamriel. There are thousands things that you can do. Thousands places, thousands interesting people. And If you manually change contrast (we are not in 50 shades of grey Bethesda), you can find fairytale place with amazing music and life inside. So buy it, it pays off."
Positive,"It plays a lot differently from MMOs that I'm used to and I like it, being a FFXIV main and being heavily into WoW back during Vanilla and Burning Crusade. My addiction levels have been rising and soon I will need to learn how to use a pee jar.If you've never played an MMO, don't start. Save yourself. If you have, I recommend trying this one out without a sub and see how you like it (The sub adds a ton more stuff, including most of the expansions and DLC quests/dungeons)."
Positive,Meridia die in a hole. Also my house now has a corner named the Nocturnal naughty corner because we're having a falling out.I have no life anymore.
Positive,"I really enjoying to play this game so far , quests and story are very interesting . Recommended to everyone that loves old style MMOs"
Positive,"It's not Oblivion, but it will do."
Positive,Sehr gut. I like it a lot. Would recommend. Good progression system and stuff... is nice to level up.
Positive,"Interesting quests, pretty good graphics, good system of leveling, but sometimes i could be litle bit boring.8/10"
Positive,"Fun MMO for sure, great lore, but holy is it riddled with bugs. You can tell the developers really care more about the $ and loot crates in game. This is the only game in my entire library that will bug out, freeze my computer, crash it, or force restart it out of nowhere. Very mixed feelings.Edit: Took a break and came back - the game is still full of irritating bugs and is lacking a lot of overall QOL."
Positive,"I'm writing this from a perspective of an Elder Scrolls fan, who never played MMORPGs before and bought this for the loreiThe world is awesome. I'd say it's better than Skyrim, especially the later added expansions. There's so much things to do in every single zone, and every zone tells you a different story. It just feels alive in the way that Skyrim never did. Once you immerse into the world, you'll be doing 6 hour sessions without ever noticing. Graphics are okay, not state-of-the-art by any means, but they're fine. Overall, I'll give it an 8.8 out of 10 for the world, mainly because some zones feel way too cramped, and points of interest are next to one another.I do recommend getting as much DLC as you can, at least buy all the chapters to start things offQuests are amazingly done, and so far they didn't get repetitive. Again, it just feels alive again, as NPCs will sometimes actually help advance towards the final goal, so it's not you being the allmighty hero that saves the day. Side events are also intriguing because they explore the lore of the world and the zone you're in. The only downside is that the game spawns you in the latest chapter you have, so new players (like I did) end up doing story arc in the wrong order and meeting certain characters at the wrong time. 9.3/10.It can get tedious, but nothing special. Gear scales with your level, forcing you to change it frequently until you max your character out, which I found both a blessing and a curse. Crafting on the other hand does feel overwhelming for new players, and I was confused at first. Fortunately there's guides everywhere so it's easy to overcome. Once you learn it it's pretty straightforward so I have no complaints there, but those who like to craft a lot might find inventory space too small, which I'll cover in a second. I give it a 9.2/10.It's not necessary. BUT, if you feel like you're playing this game a lot, and you feel like organising inventory is too much hassle, it's definitely worth it. You also get access to every DLC (except the latest chapter - Greymoor at the time of writing this) and free mothly crowns. The whole pack is definitely worth its price if you're playing over 20 hours a week. Less than that, and you don't really need it.The community is a perfect 10. There's always people willing to help you if you're stuck somewhere. There's loads of guilds that cover everything that you can do in the game. Trading? Sure. PVP? Yes. Roleplay? We got you covered. Community is definitely one of the best aspects of this game.Yes. Servers. They're still bad. They're better with the latest update, but some people still experience disconnects; I myself experience occasional lag that makes hits don't register and it can be frustrating, especially in PVP. Which brings me to PVP. Some people like it, some hate it, I'm not a fan of it. I just do what I have to in PVP zone and then get lost. Deducting 4 points here.It's a really addicting game, and if you can look over the occasional connection issues, there's thousands of hours in front of you.33/40"
Positive,"I like MMOs as much as the next guy, this one was always pretty fun and has great graphics. Don't come in expecting a solo Elder Scrolls though. But, really, everything changed with this game when I learned you can action cancel to do some high skill damage. Look up how to do it and practice, it changes the whole game."
Positive,Great game. The adventure seems to be unending as the quests in game keep on progressing as you journey within the game. One of the best games so far. I hope the Greymoor will be as good as this or it will be better.
Positive,Love this game

Positive,its a great game if u like MMO RPGs and loved the elder scrolls as a whole u will like this game brings things from both worlds
Positive,V E R Y   N I C E
Positive,"I have been playing this a lot to relax after university. Wonderful game, although sometimes it can get a little grind-heavy, which is not for everyone."
Positive,"ESO continues to be one of the best MMORPG of the time, right along side WOW. Tons of content in an amazingly crafted world that will not disappoint."
Positive,"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!  The game was not bad at launch back in 2014, but got a little bland after a while...   Now however its just amazing!  SOOO much to do, mechanics is great, the game management is great...  really enjoying it...    the game is alive with players."
Positive,I couldn't play with my friend because 80GB of download is too much for him ... (crappy net problem)But still an enjoyable game even alone (y).
Positive,"I love ESO, its a good mmo :D"
Positive,"Stream Grand Prix: ☐ Review a game Me: Ah shiELD, here we go again. I played a few different MMORPGs, so my opinion could be sceptical.This game is fun if:You like MMORPG genreYou have friends to play withYou like the whole Elder Scrolls seriesYou want to explore Elder Scrolls loreIn my opinion this game has a good variety of PVE action - quest, dungeons and world encounters are all well designed. As for PVP unfortunately I havent touched it a lot but the things I tried were fun. Skills looked poorly at first but it turned out I was missing a lot - the more I played the more skills I was getting, including lategame champion leveling system. There are 7 crafting professions I believe, which aims on armor/weapon crafting, potions and furnishing.  Are housings common thing for MMORPGs?  I really like how they implemented lore into quests, books and some other stuff spreadede arounf the world, so thet ""Lore Hunter"" type of players should like this game. There are several cons that I want to mention but it seems like that appears in other MMORPGs. Purcasing DLCs forces you to spend money if you want to access new location. You can play without DLCs but thats not the whole experience mentioning the fact that locations always look gorgeous. Cosmetic items cost a lot, so be ready spend some money if you want to look cool.Overall I like this game it has some interesting stuff but you can become bored with it really fast as some of my friend did. So as the main game is a one-time purchase I recommend getting it on a sale because it will give a lot for that price.Hope this will help someone.🗹 Review a game"
Positive,good game x2
Positive,bst game ever seenskyrim and es onlin
Positive,Games fun.Please make more servers as im lagging like fking d0g in NA server my fking LATENCY IS 200~300 FOR FUCK SAKE I LIVE IN NASA
Positive,"I am hooked, though I will admit it took me a while to get into this one.There's a lot of things in this game that I didn't expect, and there's quite a learning curve when you start out - however it still has the comfortable familiarity of every other elder scrolls game and it fully encourages you to explore every nook and cranny of the world.It's a lot of fun, it is infinite, and the community for the most part is very warm and welcoming. Definitely recommend picking it up if you've been thinking about it."
Positive,"The storytelling in this game is amazing. I love the character designs and scenery. It's definitely a great game to play with friends. When you're not busy taking on dungeons, you can just go on a stealing spree for fun or have a relaxing time fishing. This game has a lot to offer. There is so much content that it can sometimes be overwhelming to a new player. It's hard to decide what to do first. lol"
Positive,"This game got a lot better with recent expansions like Summerset and Morrowind. I also thoroughly enjoy Orsinium, the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild. I don’t really mind that it’s more MMORPG than people wanted for the series because I think they combined MMO with the universe and still kept a lot of what’s enjoyable in the series. The game still has great atmosphere and the mechanics are fun. I still prefer playing this over the rest of the Elder Scrolls series because I’m more of a social person and feel lonely without other players. Most people I’ve met that don’t like MMORPGs, don’t like this game very much, but it’s gotten more enjoyable to play alone with recent expansions, so I recommend trying it out."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online MMO is one of my favorite games of all time. I get so lost in this game for the a few reasons, half the time I dont remember what I am doing. I really love the game's graphics and the Role-Playing side of the game. I have played most of the Elder Scrolls Games, most recently, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. I don't think I would go against this game at all. I really love The Elder Scrolls Franchise. I have had no many problems. I do love all the games, that join together into one! <3"
Positive,Love it! 100% Bethesda/Zenimax supporter all the way :D
Positive,Kinda stinks of shit but it's okay
Positive,"I only played it briefly, but it seems to be quite good/Hab es nur kurz angespielt, aber scheint ganz gut zu sein"
Positive,"MMO-RPG stands for gay, and i am an osu! Enjoyer!"
Positive,Best game ever! <╬3
Positive,"The game has come a far way since I've played it in Beta years ago.I wish the dungeons were instanced for parties, as I find it awkward to be strolling through a dungeon with a storyline and have people, who are not involved, doing something in there that's ahead of the said story. It really takes away from the experience that should be happening.Other than that, I enjoyed the time I got during the free period."
Positive,"I've played a lot of mmos, and this is by far is probably the best. It's so easy to lose yourself with all the lore and beautiful scenes. Yes, crown shop is a little overpriced, but it's not like you need any of that stuff to have fun in game. There's always a new adventure waiting for you! <3"
Positive,"A great entry-level mmo for those who are new to the genre, but it's simplicity might also be a turn-off for experienced players.The game is polished and well-rounded, with a substantial amount of game lore and content to experience. Graphics are excellent, with many locations in the world of Nirn faithfully recreated in mmo form. The devs have also created a player environment that facilitates many positive social experiences.Gameplay depth and creativity are probably the only weaker aspects of the game. Elder Scrolls Online has the potential to capture a much larger following if it were only a little more sophisticated in its design."
Positive,"My experience: ESO is my first MMORPG game i played, and imediatley loved it, the voise-actors are doing a great job living in their roles. The PvP zone Cyrodiil makes for an amazing experience, its fun killing people with a trebouchet, and the tower-defence concept is great, but the quests in Cyrodiil is boring.Positive things: -Mostly good writen quests-Only having five ability slots really makes you think of what you actually need in what situation-The main quests are fun and unique-The megaservers makes it super-easy to find your friends-As of update 17 you get bonus rewards for leveling up-The scaling system makes enemies equally hard for all playersNegative:-Most DLCs costs way to much compared to what you actually get, so you’re kind of forced to get ESO plus-If you play solo, some missions might seem impossible to do-There are lots of  semi-important characters that shares the same voice actorOverall a great game, but quite different from the other Elder Scrolls games, and the six main stories makes for s good plot"
Positive,"I have been exploring Tamriel for more than a year now, and I still play at least four time a week. This game is beautiful, and with all the diverse players there's always something to look at. Speaking of which, there is always something to do as well. You can explore, quest, mine, craft whatever you feel like doing on a particular day. You aren't binded to anything."
Positive,Coolest MMORPG I played in my life!
Positive,depois de 1 tempo cansa
Positive,good game 1000+ plus hours of adventure at least
Positive,"You got some free time?You are ready to throw your life out the window?You dropped WoW because the new expansion was shit?Then here you are thinking about playing eso, scrolling through reviews and hoping your budget is enough for this game.Or you are the type of player who just completed Skyrim 6 years late and now want to play something alike with your friends.I have an answer for both of you:Buy it!As you may see I invested a fair amount of time in this game (wasn't that much tbh)and in that time I spend countless hours with Quests I actually bothered listening to, while being able to travel to most of the places Tamriel has to offer.So the average Skyrim pug has nothing to miss, Russians spamming zone chats, dungeon bosses getting steamrolled by experienced players, while you are barely able to complete the dungeons with a group with players on your level oh and dont forget the Skyrim-ish experience when you just jump out of the world with your Ferocious Leap cause walls aint stop ya...I mean a great open world, a Story that can compete with Skyrim and characters that you will not forget for the rest of your life of course!So the long running Elder Scrolls Fan, who for whatever reason still didnt at least tried this you have nothing to fear this game is a good choice for you.So now to the actually important part for the MMO player looking to waste enough time to earn 4.2k $, if you were working in China, YES you can play this game long enough to get this far.1st you may ask hows endgame? No worries the Game is at 6 differrent raids at the moment, three of whom you couldn't even dream about completing in your first 1000 hours, each offering a normal and a veterean mode (actually the veterean mode is all people care about).2nd what about PvP?You know Planetside? Somewhat like this without the pay to win part and zergs worse than a 8v8 starcraft match could get.3rd what about endgame progression?There is something called ""champion points"" basically telling you if you can gank the player you are looking at or if you should just run away.Ok actually the system is quite good giving you an option to get stronger in a recognizable way, while not giving you too much so it isnt a must have for high level content.4th what about DLCs?If you are really aiming for the top you wont get around buying them cause there of course is DLC exclusive Loot, raids etc.. So i recommend buying the Gold edition, because there are nearly all important DLCs included, but even without DLCs the game can deliver a satisfying experience.To sum it all up whether you are the Skyrim player that read this for whatever reason to the end or the MMO player wanting to start a new time eating machine, expecially since the One Tamriel update this game can accomplish both."
Positive,ESO:TU Edition is worth a buy if you like the Elder Scrolls games and/or if you're interested in MMO genre. 8.5/10
Positive,Fun But Not Skyrim Be Careful M8
Positive,"Great game if you're looking for an MMO, love the Elder Scrolls lore, and want interesting stories. If you're solely looking for your regular Elder Scrolls experience with a mulitplayer aspect to it though, you'll be disappointed.As far as MMOs go, I really like this game. While the main quest line isn't anything amazing (essentially a remix of the Oblivion main storyline, which is the weakest of recent entries), a lot of the side quests are a lot more thoughtful and well-written. Any more recent content in particular, such as the DLCs and the Morrowind expansion, are particularly good in that area. As an Elder Scrolls fan, I also simply enjoy roaming Tamriel and discovering more of its many aspects.Gameplay wise, this feels like a mix of Guild Wars 2 and Elder Scrolls, which is probably the best mix you could get for an MMO of the likes of this one. It was a bit suckish at launch, but has been massively improved since, although the basic idea is still the same.Overall, would totally recommend. To any friend who'd like to play with me, I just want to warn you that I play on North American servers, not European."
Positive,"Definetely big improvements from the early stages of development. It's quite a nice RPG and if all the dungeons will be free (as they should be) and you won't see that much of a difference between the subscription user and the ""free"" user, I would really, really recomment this game as one of the best MMORPGs out there. But as it is now, for me, a person that bought only the game, with no DLCs and no subscription, it's just an incomplete RPG that has loads of potential but was given to a company that's just milking it. (Why Bethesda, why ?) So, is this game bad ? Not really, but you should keep in mind that you need DLCs to unlock the whole fucking map and one DLC costs around 15 Euros so there's like 75 bucks to unlock the whole map, and all the storylines which feel like they should be ALREADY THERE ! There's a lot of good parts to it as well, like for example the complex combat system which allows each class to be good in their own way. I could go all day about the awesome world and exploration systems but that would just kill my previous point, and I will give this game a positive review even if it needs free DLCs more than anything else."
Positive,"Tamriel is amazing although there are times when it feels like a lot of back and forth with quests. Then again, you can do alot of exploring so all in all its not too bad. Some bugs here and there when playing with a partner. ie the goals of the quest become messed up even though you are doing the exact same thing. My partner cant help me because its like I am in another world. I have enemies all around me and he doesnt I am invisible to him etc.  I was not able to finish a quest as of yet. Overall an enjoyable, addictive game."
Positive,"I remember getting all excited when I was invited to an early closed beta of ESO and then I stopped caring when I realized it was hot garbage. It was hot garbage for a long time, but anyway it's pretty good now I really like it great time dungeons with pals bobby yells DPS DPS DPS when he does doesn't notice me doing my darndestwill you play tooBig Boy Bomba Edition: has mod support, a tru skyrim game"
Positive,Praise Vivec! This is such a good game just get it im sure you wont regret it.
Positive,"It doesn't have what you might want and hope fom the original Elder Scrolls skyrim in terms of being op, but it still has all the basics and it's with other people, so it's worth it."
Positive,ESO BULOOOOOOOOK! HEHEHE
Positive,Just don't ever buy Crown Packs or ESO+ Memberships from Steam. Go to the actual website for ESO and puchase your needs there. It's the luck of the draw if you end up having issues recieveing anything from steam to this game and then when you try to figure out why you don't have ESO+ or the crowns you purchased both steam and ESO support teams point fingers at each other and play the blame game.
Positive,"This game, if played with High graphics settings, looks beautiful. The Elder Scrolls: Online looks and feels (relatively) like an Elder scrolls game. Many of Elder Scroll's signature features         (pick-pocketing, sneaking, lock-picking, etc.) exist in this MMO.However, one of the few things I'm not a huge fan of is being limited to 5 spells/abilities on your castbar. This technially exceeds to 10 upon reaching level 15, where you can switch out an alternate set of weapon(s) and spells. However, despite being limited to 5 spells, the game pulls it off.TESO provides technially no limitations to players who don't subscribe to a monthly fee. While subscribers get all DLC with their game, non-subscribers can easily just purchase each individual DLC, and even purchase bundles of said DLC with some little extra goodies.The microtransactions (Crown Store) are mostly cosmetic, with of course the optional purchase of DLC/Expansions included in the Crown Store, and very few items that actually help with gameplay (Such as purchasing extra bag space for real money, or purchasing experience boosts, and ""Crafting Motifs"" which allow for the skill to craft specific racial armor styles) Some may argue the Crown Store is ridiculous; it's really not. Everything in the Crown Store that is not cosmetic can be earned in-game without real purchase. (Experience boosts being the exception)The game so far has provided plenty of content to satisfy my $60 purchase, and that's just in the first 15 levels of the game in one area of the entire map. There are still plenty more zones and levels and quests to accomplish beyond that, and then there are the expansion packs.This game is not just a generic MMO with Elder Scrolls slapped onto it, and if you're looking for an MMO to get into, I strongly recommend this one."
Positive,"This is as good an RPG as any geek could dream for. Zenimax has realised that Skyrim was too small, and have expanded the Elder Scrolls Universe to include almost every area Lore has refered to.Your range of classes and races, and the multitude of mix n match options to get what you want, is just wonderful. Stealthy thief that kills at range but can disappear instantly when attacked up close? Tick. Combat Medic who can stand in the middle of the fray and absorb damage like a tank? Tick. Standard melee DPS hair streaming wildly swinging a broadsword gashing wild random death amongst her enemies? Tick.I started this game with trepidation, as the first area is horribly bland and dull in colour, but that is part of the storyline. The second you move to the following areas, things get more ""Skyrimmy"". The attention to detail, and the tiny little hidden and special things are tremendously abundant. So much so, that you don't notice initially the copy paste standard dungeon layout we have seen throughout the series. There are a number of unique dungeon layouts, but about 6 are re-used, and honestly, you have to be on the lookout to notice this. They have REALLY taken the time to decorate and give a unique feel to every area.I spend a large amount of my time wandering around just looking at things. My child tells me to go outside as there are real life things to see outside the house, and well, this is better. Deep in the darkness of an eerie mine, sneaking behind some dishevelled misshape creatures, green slimy ooze dribbling out of its mouth, i stumble across a skeleton hidden in a corner away from the evil, a hastily scribbled note to his loved one lies next to him bemoaning his state and ""why did I ever leave you my love, the riches promised down here could never compare to the treasure in your heart"". *flutter*Little conversations amongst random NPCs all over the show adds to the atmosphere and interacting with non quest NPCs is possible, either for a little detail, or comic relief. The talking Skeleton in the Thieves Refuge in Mournhold is one of my favourites. Humour is superb and prolific throughout this game, much of it just silly silliness and the rest some good solidly laid out humour, most of the side quests are funny in one way or another, whereas the main quest line retains a rather serious undertone. Some good balancing there!Voice actors such as John Cleese and that wonderful human from Underworld Bill Nighy along with Kate Beckinsale as well as Michael Gambon and Peter Stormare are just a portion of the MARVELOUS talent and a hint at the story-line you are about to experience. This is all just mesmerising and truly immersive.I stumbled across a petrified completely naked and rather hungover Nord in Deshaan, musclebound as he was, he was in dread fear of his wife and ""the witches who stole my clothes! (hic)"", further conversation with the wife reveals this is a common occurrence, and when i went to fetch his axe, a family heirloom, things got a bit crazy, for there indeed was a witch! Why his clothes disappeared is anybodies guess, but the tongue lashing he was receiving as I rode away on my Horse with the gold his wife had given me was quite inspiring to never get thot frunk. Again...I yearned for Cyrodiil though! And initially i went as far as galloping across two maps to enter The Rift and visit Riften, one of my favourite areas in Skyrim and of course where i was hoping the thieves guild would be! Upon arrival the instant death my level 8 toon received was a bit shocking, turns out areas are designed to feed you along per level, and the rift is about 2/3rds in! So what now! Well, upon hitting level 10, I was invited to join in a bloody campaign. TO WAR! And Cyrodiil!Initially after discovering Cyrodil I did not finish more that 1/5th of the main quest line, as upon entering Cyrodiil, the PvP section and Alliance War area, I discovered it impossible to leave....This battle arena is the entirety of the old TESO IV :Oblivion map. One huge battlezone. Each of the three factions has a section of the map that contains their Home Keeps, and two Elder Scrolls. You spend your days protecting your own, setting up ambushes for incoming marauders or going deep behind enemy lines to steal resources or gank unsuspecting stragglers.The intensity of your Squad of 24 slowly and surely getting into position to Siege an unsuspecting Keep, the sudden call for SIEGES UP!!! Trebuchettes rising out of the ground to begin hurling immense flaming balls of rock at the enemies defences, hurtling overhead these messages of doom explode upon the enemy sundering man, stone and beast alike. They do not take this lightly! INCOMING!!! Oil and rotten meat is getting hurled over the walls at our troops! But its not too late! A breach! 4 of my brethren can take it no longer, the battle lust fills them and they revert into their natural werewolf form! The attack resumes as the enemy try to push us back, we storm through the breach into the inner courtyard, the call is for a battering Ram on the main gate, fiery burning oil is splattering all around us but our Combat Medics are prepared, purging us of this new death they stand steadfast in the middle of the fray.The gate trembles, we are nearly in! A shout from our flanks! DEF DEF DEF! All turn but too late, their reinforcements who we thought were engaged in battle on the other side of the map have heard their comrades calls for assistance, riding hard they arrive to trample our assault, lying broken and dead, only one of our number has managed to escape, he has stealthily hidden himself behind our corpses, hoping to resurrect us when things quieten down, but for now, I suffer the indignity as one of the enemy uses the /pushups emote to playfully copulate with my corpse. The bastard. I'm totally coming back to get him.Buy this game."
Positive,"This game is amazing! It can give you endless amounts of quests and content to do. I play it just like any normal Elder Scrolls game. 80% of my hours spent playing this game were just first person questing, exploring, dungeon delving, lore book reading, fishing, and crafting. I've gotten almost 3,000 hours of entertainment from this game and have countless more in store for my future. This game is worth the purchase and all the DLC without a doubt. The chapter expansions are all beautiful and amazing, and the quests are all beautifully done. The battlegrounds PvP mode, Cyrodil Siege PvP the Imperial city PvPvE modes are excellent as well. It feels great to go head to head with others, and the balance system is great so that if you have skill, you can beat max level characters while being at a low level yourself. There is so much to do in the game that as soon as I start to get bored with one activity, I just start doing something else, and because of the vast freedom to do what you want just like in previous Elder Scrolls games(combined with the massive world size that is continually growing), you will almost never get bored with this game."
Positive,"Definitly a good purchase if you're an Elders Scrolls fans, the community is good ( not thrash like WoW ). Sure it's not a Skyrim though, but since the recent patches we can clearly see that this MMO is going to evoluate alot.Graphics : 8/10 ( PC Master race )Gameplay: 9/10 ( You can grind or quests, so it's perfect for everyone )Story line: 7/10 ( The main quest is not bad, could be a little bit better )PvP: 9.5/10 ( PvP is why I bought this game, the war are just crazy as f*ck )PvE: 8.5/10 ( If you like grinding, you'll sure like this game, just make sure to find the right grinding spot and that's it )"
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online Tamriel Unlimited, Where do I begin. Everything people hated in beta has been fixed majorly and changes have happened for the better. Though people still hate the game because what they expect is a skyrim clone or harbor a grudge against the game due to its beta days. (Which even I will admit were awful)If you enjoy exploring, lore, dungeons, or elder scrolls in general you will most likely enjoy this game. There are several options on how to develop a character as in most non-mmo elder scrolls games. For now I will list some of the pros coming from a mmo aspect. As I have yet to really hate anything I will post cons when I see fit. (You should really check out some youtube videos before buying this to see if its your type of game instead of asking if its a good game or not as opinions are different)Pros- Graphics are amazing and feel nice for immersion while exploring.- Variety making one faction seem like another world when out to explore like it should be.- Siege weapons in this game are interesting as they showcase how they would normally be used.- Reading books is sometimes fun for lore or just for a laugh.- The leveling isn't extremely hard as some mmo's.- Plenty of skills for originality or making a personal character.- More sheogorath jokesCons- Character creation. While there is several options to choose from while making your characters I feel they should've added more hair styles and perhaps more adornments, But its more then some mmo's so I really cant complain on this one much.- Small learning curve. Some things are majorly different from most mmo's and will leave you guessing for a hour or so before you find yourself really catchng on to them."
Positive,"it's eh. Kinda cool. Not my favorite game, or anything.."
Positive,"Покупайте пока есть возможность, глупцы!  (с) Гендальф.Руссификатор есть."
Positive,"Not as good as Skyrim, but not a bad game.  Fun to play with your friends.  Game has gotten better with each update."
Positive,"I don't really have much to say about this game. It's just what I would want, a fantasy world and the quests are pretty fantastic, I find each one incredible enthralling.I'm happy with it."
Positive,Better than Fallout 76
Positive,The ESO experience is one of the most positive ones i've had in a MMO. The scale fits my liking and the flexibility of the 4 classes alowing for subclasses is amazing. The game isnt perfect but theres a lot more right than wrong
Positive,"I can't even get myself getting out of starting zones playing other MMORPGs, but ESO has made me gone from helping a moon sugar farmer getting rid of bugs to uniting an alliance to confronting the God of Schemes himself. It's a huge playground where you can go anywhere with a lot of things to do. Graphics arent the best but it's really pleasant and combined with amazing sounds will make you feel immersed in the world of Tamriel. There's a setback from all of these which is lack of depth in stories and conversations, although I've heard that they're better than most games in the genre. But tbh they're not too bad and they still can get me quite engaged sometimes. 9/10 - One of the best purchase I've ever had"
Positive,"I've played the game since beta and bought the Steam version during this most recent sale. The game is loads of fun with awesome graphics and great music. The game is atypical of standard Elder Scolls games. The game isn't leveled, meaning you can easily get killed by wandering into higher level areas. It is also very grindy in endgame. They have made great strides since the beginning and will have the Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, and Justice System next year."
Positive,Big disclaimer!: It is not your typical Elder Scrolls Experience so don't expect Skyrim 6That out of the way I came to enjoy myself a good 60 hours now and I gotta say I really like the game.It is my first MMO so I'm definetly no expert at those but so far I really enjoyed my time I put into the game. I came (like propably many) expecting something simmilar to the other Elder Scrolls games and have to say was really put off from the melee combat while I did enjoy it in Skyrim and Morrowind (Oblivion was ok) the ranged combat however feels really good and is a lot of fun. Since I experimented a lot at the beginning I'm nowhere near endgame so I can't say much about that except I'm looking forward to it. Chrafting is something I only tuched on the surface but it actually motivates me to log into my character daily to continue the research feature. The daily login-reward is also a motivatin to keep going.Like other MMOs it is some grinding in some situations but the quests are generally increadible written storywhise. Completing those feels standard MMO-like though some dungeons give you some lore while you explore.If you're not interested in this you can also just ignore it which doesn't hinder the fun of the game (in my opinion).I haven't played pvp because I'm not interested in it in this kind of game so look for another review in that regard.I purchased the Elsweyr-Collectors-Edition which comes with the Elsweyr DLC which has together with the maingame enought content for years. How ever I do recommend ESOPlus. It is definetly not a requirement but it helps out a lot with inventory management which is the mainpoint of it.However this is not it's only upside. With the subscription comes access to all DLCs including older chapters then the most recent one.In conclusion I'd say you really should check it out if you're looking for a good MMO.Personaly I would reccomend buying the basegame (on sale) and if it is your piece of cake considering buying the upgrade for the newest chapter.Also consider joining a guild to have people to play with. You can easily solo most content but it is definetly more fun together.
Positive,"I am a big ES fan and love this game.  I have no regrets in purchasing this game at all.  Here's my list of Pros and Cons.  These are based on my opinion.PROS: You move slowly enough through leveling (especially if you love to immerse yourself into the stories & not just speed through to your next quest objective) that it feels like the game could go on for forever, unlike some other MMO's I've played (not going to mention names).  I've played a few different races so far and the main quest lines are the same (mages guild, fighter's guild and main quest line) but all the other quests are totally different, so you don't get bored starting a new character as a different race.  I can really appreciate that since I love to play alts. Yes, every pact has their own starting area as well (there's three in total).If you like crafting you can do all that this game has to offer, you are not limited to choosing what your MO will be.  Your crafting materials can hang in the bank (which is shared between all of your characters) so you don't have to lug that stuff around.I do like the character creation, you can spend some time going through it all and perfecting your look, all very typical of ES games. You can even pick what voice you want your character to have, which is cool (and funny, if you imagine your character in the bathroom while you are picking your voice).  You can dye your armor, too (does not cost you a dime).Your quest rewards are not bound to you, so if they do not fit your character build, you can deposit them into your bank and an alt can pull it out and use it.  In fact, a lot of items you can put on and use are not bound to you unless you dye them.You can wear costumes to hide your armor as well, if you want a different appearance.You can play a lot of the game content solo, which is a big plus IMO.  I hate nagging guild members, complete strangers for help, or waiting till someone can help you before moving on in your quests (GAH!).There is no lag at all in battle sequences.  You hit your #3 button (as an example), your attack assigned to 3 executes as expected.  Some f2p games do not have a great battle response time (lag) but ESO does not.  The button assignments are very similar (almost mirror image) of PC Skyrim.  I really appreciate that.  That also means, battles play out the same, but ESO does have a bit of a 'guidance' system with ranged attacks - specifically bows.  The talk sequences are so cool (and so like other ES games), it really makes this game more immersive.The graphics are awesome!  They will be adding more guilds (thieves guild, etc.) in the future.CONS:Sharing a bank with all your characters CAN be a negative.  You are limited on space, so sometimes you have to make tough decisions on what you want to hoard.  You can buy more bank space, it just gets pricey very quickly.You are limited on how many guilds you can be in (some find that a negative), and all of your alts are in the same guilds your alts are in.  It is confusing.  Essentially, you are limited to being in 5 guilds, so guild chatter shows up in your feed from ALL the guilds you are in, they are just labeled g1, g2, g3, g4, g5 (you can color-code them, too).  At least you won't miss any juicy drama.  *shrugs*I have not joined a guild yet, but I did attempt to start my own guild to see if I could use it as a bank (500 slots, mind you - that is a lot of hoarding), but it requires ten people to unlock and your alts do not count even though they are automatically in your guild.  You can only have 8 characters in total (some find this a negative, that's why I put this here).You cannot change your facial/body appearance after you leave character creation. Mounts are not cheap. Buying additional bag and bank space is expensive (and yet, so necessary).That's all I can really come up with!Overall, I feel this game is well worth the money to purchase and play.  I will be playing this game for many years to come.  The negatives - for me - do not outweigh the positives. The only recommendation I have for those of you considering buying/playing ESO: Unlimited: buy the Imperial Edition if you can throw an extra 20 bones towards it.  I didn't and regret it.  The ability to buy a mount for one gold shortly after you start playing your new character verses thousands of gold pieces and many levels later is a bummer.  Yes, you can still buy that package deal through the crown store (their in-game cash store), but it just makes more sense to buy the edition that already has that built-in, because it is cheaper."
Positive,"Really great game. Playable both solo and in a group, it combines the great MMO elements with fun questing and a good storyline. Would highly recommend."
Positive,I love this game!!!!! Had it for ps4 but I love it so much more on PC
Positive,i really liked this game at first but then it got pretty bad. i haven't played it in a while so hopefully they fixed it. i gave it a thumbs up only because they didn't have anything in between no and yes.
Positive,It's good and I like this game a lot lol
Positive,This was my first ever MMORPG. I bought it when there was a sale on Bethesda games. It sat in my library for a while and my father (who plays on PS4) told me to try it out. I tried it out and I wasn't disappointed. I'm currently level 23 on PS4 and leveling up on PC. This is a great game. My playtime is currently only 3 hours on PC but it's a lot higher on PS4. Everyone says it's very different than Skyrim but the quests are similar in the way they operate and I loved Skyrim. I think the best part about this game is just being able to mess around with your friends while doing quests. Each region of the map is massive and adds so much to discover. This game is just fantastic.
Positive,"Probably has the best dungeons/group instances I've experienced in an MMO, with a close competitor being FFXIV. The new max level system is great, muchbetter than it was before, and the game isn't pay2win. Good community overall, and decent build variance. Worth a buy.Edit: Coming back nearly three years after this was posted-- still a great game, and only getting better. Also, worth noting, they didn't mess the lore up at all. If anything, they've added some really neat touches to TES's overall narrative, and occasionally add stuff from M. Kirkbride's writing. If you're holding back due to concerns over lore errors, don't even worry about that."
Positive,Played Skyrim and loved it. Got ESO to be able to play with others. Love it! Always a game I love to come back to.
Positive,"Do NOT buy ESO via Steam, as much as a good game I think it is, the developers simply do not support the Steam version, leading to the most ridiculous downtimes where dozens of thousands of Steam players are unable to play for one entire day!Buy it on their website. ;)"
Positive,"Not a Bad game ,but The Download is HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE XD Play it if you are into MMO RPG games the download is worth it ."
Positive,"Amazing game! Steam didnt count my time but i had so much time into the game, i did refund it and plan on buying at a later date just because Id like to have some cash incase any ""hidden gems"" come out, but i recommend it to any elder scrolls fan, and mmo fanatic, luckly for me i am both :D. Im not going to waste your time saying millions of pros and cons but here are a few:+ ""active"" combat (not spamming millions of skills, yes you use some but it is about blocking and timing it right)+ Its actually very fun to explore, once i was just wandering through they desert and just came across and random body chained too the ground, i didnt find any loot or anything but it is just fun to explore and find cool stuff!+Its a ton of fun to find random people and just quest with them!Cons:- (This will sound strange but you have to think about it) If you and some random guy (He isnt in your group) both attack the same monster, whoever gets the kill, gets the XP. If anything i would prefer, both people get XP, and whoever did the most damage got the most xp.- This is mostly personal, but i hate people who guard certain points that would allow enjoyment to you, IG - i want to become a werewolf, people kill the certain werewolfs that ""infect you"" (turn you into a werewolf), that only spawn once a week, same deal with vampiers, then they charge money so they can infect you.-Grinding takes forever, so you do quests, i Enjoy questing, but sometimes i just want to idley chat with friends while i hunt down oversized rats.-----------------------There is much more i could explan but the pros heavily takeover the cons, and i recommend it to anybody who wants to waste their life having fun like me :D"
Positive,"It is online but it is also single i never seen quest like those in a mmo good game i hope more expan, packs comin, i want to explore all tamriel :)"
Positive,Reminds me of Club Penguin.
Positive,"This game is fucking incredible, and the fact that I haven't actually tried this game up until recently, speaks volumes to my own stupidity."
Positive,"Absolutely love this game.  I've only played Oblivion and Skyrim form the ES series but love this game.  Great to just smash through dungeons, or do finer things like craft your own weapons and armor; also wonderful when you play with others online.  What I like is you may end up wanting to do one quest and more than likely you'll find someone else also going to do it: you team up, blast through it, and find other quests to do or go your seperate ways, either way its fun!  Highly advise you research the type of character you want and what skills you want them to have when they've leveled up, that way you have clear goal of what path you'll be going when spending skill points and such, otherwise you may have to save up in game money (not real money) to reset your skill points."
Positive,"I would give it some 7.5/10The game is good, even single player content only. It's better to play with friends, but you may always find someone out there to help you in a dungeon. The amount of lore and smaller quests is good, and the main quest and guild quests are large and long. The landscapes are nice to watch and the amount of new lands to discover is amazing. Even bigger than in Witcher 3.PROS:- amount of Elder Scrolls Lore- amount of small quests (majority of them is nicely done)- Long and involving MQ and Guild Quests (very well made)- very large terrain to explore- amount of dungeons often with unique theme and enemies and couple of small fetch or destroy questsCONS:- graphics is not bad but could be better- some small quests may be boring sometimes"
Positive,"Game is very good, I wouldn't recommend purchasing anything unless you're invested into it.Pros: -Long term gameplay, you're very unlikely going to run out of things to do, if you do then there's probably things you don't know about.-Generally a good community.-Abnur Tharn is a good person-Trading Gold (obtained by farming normally) for crowns is allowed by ToS. -Decent story and exploration is rewarding-ish. -Khajiti are superior (I'm not a furry but they add a very good damage and healing value depending on how you build them) Cons: -Very frequent maintenance.-The grind is relatively high so fare warning if you hate grinding, then you can probably do other things like sell crowns for gold and skip the grind sort of. -It can be fairly confusing at the beginning of the game, I'm over 500 hours in (on steam) and I still don't know a lot of things, there's a lot to learn."
Positive,it'a good except the combat dev team.
Positive,"As a Skyrim-type game enjoyer, first things first I want to point out how massive this game is, even without the DLCs and expansions (yes, they are separate things). I have played for over 250 hours and I completed a fraction of all the quests/zones this game has. And every single quest is voice acted, which alone explains the 100GB game size.The game is very solo friendly, there's not too many things that REQUIRE other players to complete.Given all that, on discounts the base game is like 5 euro which is well worth it.The one thing that REALLY sours the experience though, is the monetization of the game. There's over 200 euro worth of DLC that can only be bought using premium currency. That's only the dungeons and new zones/quests. I am not even talking about all the cosmetics and boosters and shit. AND the expansions that are on the store page are a separate thing.Worst of all though, is the ESO+ subscription. You pay a monthly fee, you get access to all DLCs and expansions except for the latest one + premium currency to unlock them permanently or buy whatever in the shop. Alright.But it is also the only to access the crafting bag. The problem with that is that the game has hundreds of crafting material items. HUNDREDS. And your inventory space is capped at 200 unique items, with stack limits, 60 of which are from the daily horse upgrades.So if you want to craft shit (or collect every item/search every container you see) you basically have to buy the sub. Early game is a nightmare for inventory space.The bad:* Thieves guild is a 20 euro DLC, meaning you cannot open certain chests until you buy it. It does not come as part of any expansions listed on the Steam store page. Same goes for Dark Brotherhood guild.* Jewelry crafting/dismantling/research requires an expansion. For some idiotic reason.* NPC Companions require an expansion. For some idiotic reason. Although you keep your companions if you acquired them through the sub, which is not the case for the above.* Inventory size is horrible, crafting ingredients take 95% of inventory space, which can only be solved via ""GIVE ME MONEY, IDIOT"" subscription* Severe texture pop in* 4 separate privacy policy and similar agreements* Crafting skills in this game are kinda obnoxious. They share skillpoints with your combat skills. Why the fuck is that a thing? Even though you get a lot of skill points, you cannot unlock all crafting and have enough for combat skills. And there's no way to easily reset skillpoints per skill. Either you reset everything, or nothing.* Dungeons have story quests, but everyone rushes, and you get auto kicked after beating a dungeon so you can't even explore it.* Quests suffer from a severe ""recap syndrome"", where you are tasked to talk to an NPC in a quest, you do that, and then the NPC immediately has dialog options that recap what was just said* Gear leveling is done in a malicious kinda way. The way it works is that all gear has static damage/defense. (i.e. All blue bows will have exact same damage number on level 1 and level 50. That static value goes down by the difference between item's level and your own level. So that makes it super easy for developers to bump max gear level, which would make all gear instantly garbage, forcing players to regrind it.* Timegated horse upgrades. It would take 6 months of daily logins to fully upgrade your horse. Unless of course you pay up.The good:* Almost everything is properly voice acted (99% of all quests), just like Star Wars: The Old Republic* It's still mostly kinda sorta Skyrim, but MMO* Some quests have mutually exclusive moral choices to make regarding the story, and very few of them are easy* Weather effects are nice* Shit ton of content and systems, even in base game"
Positive,"This game ruined my life.Edit 1,000+ hours in: My life is still ruined.Edit 2,000 + hours in: My life is still being occupied by this game."
Positive,"Just to note a couple things before you  start this game.Scroll past this numbered section for my review.1. Just like other mmo it’s a grind fest and has a monthly subscription to make your life twice as easy if you pay the 15$.2. Pretty much all the dlc you see in the game will not be available to you if you don’t pay up for the monthly free or buy the dlc out right, (most dlc being 1500 crowns=15$ a dlc or even higher).3.Big guilds tend to have everything you need but not enough active members to interact with. Join a small guild if you want to interact with players more for dungeons, questing, pve, etc.4. This game is made to have fun with players, if you’re going into this game for a solo gameplay you’re going to get bored real fast on how some stuff get repetitive which goes into the 5th section.5. The game doesn’t challenge players in the freeroam/overland. Most npcs you fight will be easy and as you level even more. The only thing that would really test yours skills, are dungeons, trials, arenas, and a few other thing I’m missing but beside me that, when you’re roaming Tamriel and want to explore you’re gonna get bored of the npcs real fast due to how fast they die with the little amount of hp and dmg they do which unmotivates some players to see what Tamriel has offer when they know the enemies are exactly the same as the zone they were just in. The story may be great but the enemies get stale seeing them over and over again.My Review:The game was something great that started you off depending what dlc you bought or have (such as Morrowind) the intro would play and each dlc would have its own unique intro to get the feel of the zone you would start your first hours of eso on. But as of recently they changed it to a generic single intro with no introduction of what you should do first, you can start anywhere you want but the introduction you’re met with for each zone is stripped away as of recently. The game teaches the players of how to fight, how to get more skill points, harvest and loot. But what it doesn’t teach players is what they should do first. What ends up happening is a bunch of players all over Tamriel having no idea what to do and end up getting fed up when no one wants to help and the people they ask just say “Go to the starter island”. I get that being able to get wherever you want whenever you want allows your playerbase to start their journey whenever but setting some goals for your players when they get, an inn room, a good amount of gold or a certain that reach would help your players a lot more on the know how on what to do in the game.For example:When a player buys or get an inn room, you can show example of furnishing they could get in the room like a crafting station or a chest to store their stuff, which would then redirect them to the crafting masters so they get introduced to crafting.As for guilds, I think the problem with big guilds is that they have alot of players but no one to join up with. Dependent on what guild you join players may join it thinking the guild does questing, pve and dungeoning, when in reality the guild has no one to offer to help you with such things and only check mark it because they rely on the members that have already joined to do the work for them. I get that big guild leaders have waaay bigger responsibilities than just dungeoning with a random dude but this comes into another complication with eso, that and that’s the 5 guild limit.Being able to join that many guilds can make some guild leaders struggle having to manage being in all those guilds at once or better yet some players may just join it to join and that’s about it, the amount of players I’ve asked that question on how active they are and most of them are only on 1 or guilds at a time the rest of the 3 are just for selling using the trader the guild has to offer.Now for some positives, the game is open to add-ons allowing its playerbase to make edits to the game itself by just downloading them from a site, Zenimax  is open to this idea and have its own add-ons area so you can see what add-ons you already have downloaded. It makes the game better being able to see stuff like, lorebooks, skyshards, and having a mini- map in your screen, being notified when to roll or dodge, all that good stuff and it helps new players out that aren’t familiar with when to times those two things when an enemy attacks.The bad thing I have to say about this is that some of this stuff I’m saying should already be in the game itself, most of the  Add-ons I use are pretty basic and shouldnt be downloaded off from another site. But like all Bethesda based games it’s the players that have to do all the hard lifting while the company sits on their ass drinking their hot cocoaSingleplayer:Great story to each zone, when you complete one place in the zone the game will have npcs reports other areas in the you could go to, to continue your story, I find this a great way to make players venture throughout all of Tamriel, some quests after finishing a zone will bring you to another zone to start there.(Example being Mournhold to clockwork city with the hidden entrance under a waterfall)That being said, if you’re wanting to expand your adventure with other players, good luck finding any, the only people that quest are new players who will quit a day later or people who like questing at first just to stop questing since most people this in game want to get better gear.Mounts:We all use them, matter fact it’s the one thing I use the most in this game, however if you don’t check in at the stable every 20hrs you miss out on increasing your speed, stamina or inventory. Another thing is actually getting a mount, the only to get a different mount  is by paying up with real cash or over the course of half to a full year dedicated to getting tickets (another thing to note, some events may be dlc locked so you won’t be able to participate if you don’t own it meaning a full event of not getting tickets to waste).Now when you think about it, if cosmetics aren’t your thing then no new mount is needed they’re all the same without the cosmetic feature. Getting the upgrades on your mount is all that matters but it’s takes up a lot of time just to get one bar fully upgraded on your mount. There are various ways to get your speed up a bit faster beforehand but the game doesn’t teach you this and you have to find out about it yourself later on from other players. (Took me 8 months)Crown Store: It’s horrendousThere’s more but going to cut it here:While I may have given this review a thumbs up, I did want to express some of the things this game fails at and shouldn’t be bought if you’re looking for a non grindy game, this game will take alot of your free time and you may be spending more crowns than you need to before you find out if you truly like it or not please do just try out the base game if you like it or not before spending any kind of crowns on the game, a lot of the times I hear new players spending crowns on stuff they don’t need and end up regretting it and not touching the game out of spite.If you’ve gotten this far down, well I hope you had a good read of this and take care."
Positive,">> I came to this game with no knowledge of The Elder Scrolls and Tamriel in general. As far as I knew the lore/games itself, didn't exist. With that being said, after many hours in the game, I know quite a bit more! <<A Little About MeI have played a few MMO's and consider myself an 'all round player'; I enjoy all aspects from pve to pvp to crafting! I've been in end-game guilds pushing for the best times and completions of pve content, end-game pvp guilds where rules are strict and team work is most important, trading guilds, and most casual social guilds.The GoodFirstly, the lore is very interesting, and the game manages to immerse you in another world very well. The graphics/design of different regions is very well done. I love that each culture has it's own atmosphere, style, way of life! Some days I really want to run around the snowy environment of Eastmarch, other days I enjoy the more warmer orange tones of Elsweyr - they really did a good job with this.There is plenty to do, and for every type of player! The player base seems to mostly be friendly, of course you get the occasional toxicity and trolling, but plenty of people will help if you ask a question in zone chat.I love that you can be part of 5 guilds at a time. Many games that I have played have only allowed for one. This is great for those who are interested in different game aspects, for example; if you want to trade but also want to complete the end-game trials - you can be in a guild focused on trade, then another that solely focuses on being the best at trials!Events - these happen regularly throughout the year and are free to take part in. Usually you get tickets each day for doing something event related and if you collect enough you can exchanged them for different things. There have been mounts, skins, personalities, and various other things throughout the years.The BadBalancing - a lot of games seem to have trouble with this and ESO is no exception, unfortunately this can mean a skill or stat is great one minute and the worst the next. It's frustrating, annoying and sometimes influences not playing for a few weeks - a shame!My biggest peeve is that they have so many different armour/weapon sets that have some really interesting and great bonuses - but.... if you want to be successful at end-game, only one or two will be viable and most people run a meta build. I wonder why they put so much time into developing new sets when they make so many obsolete and useless. Micro-transactions. I don't mind paying the monthly subscription fee. It's great value for money - you get a bag for all of your crafting items (great for those that like to dabble in crafting) and the crowns that come with your subscription are nice to spend on things they might release in the crown store. Unfortunately, like every other game, the chances of getting something amazing from the crates is very poor (I wouldn't waste your crowns on them to be honest) and they frequently realise nice shiny things that end up catching my eye and I simply must have. $$$Aspects of the GameCrafting - The crafting system is good in my opinion, and with a few questions in zone chat was easy to get the hang of. I have been in a few games where crafting is unaffordable unless you have a million in game currency to start with. With ESO, this simply isn't so and anyone can have a go. One of those things that the more time you put in, the more you get out. I have really enjoyed crafting here.PVE - I have run a lot of the content solo. Most is completely manageable, though now and again some quests take forever or you will be running to and fro between two NPC's. Sometimes you get a totally useless NPC as a quest partner, but hey - that emulates real life - sometimes you get stuck with maybe an unproductive co-worker... it happens. Group PVE is enjoyable, but be weary, there are some people/groups/guilds out there that demand perfection - and are not so friendly for those dabbling in their first trial/vet dungeon. PVP - I'm not so keen on the 'battlegrounds' aspect of pvp in this game, I feel other games did the small team 4 vs 4 vs 4 in this case, better. At least, the match-making seems terrible but this is something they have acknowledged and are hopefully doing something about. The large scale pvp is hit and miss, it used to be enjoyable with high populations in all factions, it then became quite toxic and unfortunately unbalanced in terms of population. Nevertheless, Cyrodiil is a beautiful zone to explore if you don't mind being ganked. Trials/Vet Content - I've had some fun with these, there have been moments of frustration, insane problem-solving, laughter and many other emotions. I find group content fun and as I said previously, as long as you get with a good group of like-minded people, there is plenty to enjoy about this aspect of the game.OverallIt's an MMO that you can keep going back too. There's plenty to see and do solo, but as it's an MMO, the focus is on socialising, making friends and playing with others and I really do think that makes all the difference in enjoyability. It has some beautiful scenery, interesting characters and plenty of stories to investigate. I forgot to mention player housing  - it can make you lose hours of your time, I have really enjoyed this aspect of the game as there is so much you can do!Do I wish they could balance the game and maybe revive certain things - gear options, open world pvp... yes. But all in all, it's worth a look if you like this type of game, and definitely not a bad game to delve into."
Positive,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
Positive,"Got this game (with 3 DLC packs) for less than $20. It's a great hybrid of MMO mechanics and single player RPG mechanics. They really push the subscription membership by making paid DLC ridiculously expensive (i.e. a private banker is $40, more than twice the price of the ENTIRE GAME).The game withholds a lot of quality of life features behind paywalls in order to incentivize you to pony up and pay, but you're effectively paying for conveniences and cosmetics, and the gameplay is solid without it.TL;DR: It's a great game with great mechanics at a great price. There is a TON to do, and you'll definitely get your money's worth. Just be aware that you'll be making more trips to town to sell loot and you'll be inconvenienced unless you want to pay additional money for these quality of life improvements."
Positive,"highly recommended!after thousands of hours of play, more content is still available, as it is expanded regularly. no eso plus required, but it is very convenient to have and gives access to dlc content.Landscapes and music as well as storylines are appropriately and lovingly worked out. The combat system on the player's ability is also convincing. Elder Scrolls Online also has a very friendly and helpful community.since i started it i have been coming back regularly, no matter which other game i played in between."
Positive,"With my 8k plus hours in I would just like to say... the game is meh.No seriously, it is the best mmo out there for those that have the cash. It is expensive, but you can get much of it on sale if you are patient. The monthly membership benefits should just be included with the game, but who am I to complain with this many hours on their servers.PVE is beautiful, the stories are decent (with an disproportionate amount of LGBABC side stories, but it is easy to look over), everything is voice acted and some pretty well. The questing gets repetitive, but I just changed to a different character and the game does feel different. The dungeons are fun and some are necessary for gear so it gives it a purpose. The horse slowness is out of control in the beginning and locked behind a very long (talking months) upgrade wall. And this is started from the beginning with each new character.PvP... this is a sore spot. The PvP in this game maybe more than most is a secret knowledge ground level entry. If you have someone willing to show you their setups and gear (not a yt video) and how to run it, you will be competitive. If you are trying it on your own, you will just be fodder for those that have their secret setups. Make no mistake, this game is about the build. Sure, learning the build is necessary. Yet, when you mitigate 30% more damage, have tons more regen, and can burst with higher damage than the guy in front of you... skill has little to do with it. When two builds are similar, sure skill will be needed more. Just be aware, this is a build oriented game. Cyrodiil takes some getting used to, but with the right type of group the castle sieges become addicting. Just beware of the trolls not trying for any of the objectives lurking with the before mentioned builds looking for unsuspecting targets.I use this game like many use movies, television, or YouTube. If you are planning on using it for a specific thing like pvp, dungeon delving, exploration just keep in mind. It is huge, beautiful, a bit pay to win, but most of all... expensive. Many areas and things are locked behind a pay wall. Just wait for sales and you can get most of it for half the price.If you like crafting, then the monthly is a must with the double bank space and unlimited crafting storage. I used it until all mine were leveled up. Now I just sell everything. Crafted sets aren't really end game usable for the most part.I hope this helps some starting out. Those that are looking for a huge beautiful game this is it, just get the cash ready."
Positive,"im INSANELY happy with the endless archives update! my fps is now a smooth 75 (my monitor's limit) thanks to all the optimizations they performed this update :Oin general, i love questing a ton, dungeons and trials too, sightseeing is my favorite passtime though :)"
Positive,This is one of the most addicting game i have ever played. The only downside is that after your first installation of 55gb. When you open the launcher there is 50gb of updates to be downloaded again.
Positive,"Good game, one of my favorite MMORPGs."
Positive,This is honestly a very fun and one of the few engaging MMOs out there combat wise in my opinion. Tried WoW and other MMOs but they just felt like point and click and then just spam your keyboard. This definitely has some of the best PVP out of any MMO I have played and which is why I still love it.
Positive,"For some weird reason, this game, which is ostensibly an MMORPG, has still managed to capture the core of what makes Elder Scrolls games great. There's tonnes of exploration, the fighting is decent, the quests are some of the best written quests I've ever encountered in an MMO. All in all, a top notch game"
Positive,"ESO is seriously one of the best mmo's i've ever played, the game offers so much for the elder scrolls fans and new players that have never played the franchise before. At the start game gives you simple quests and helps you forward with your gameplay, you can progress at your own pace or complete stuff together with your friend or guildmates. One of the best things I love about ESO is that everything can be everyone, and if you realize that you want to play a different role with (for example) your little khajiit cat, it's simple and it'll still work no matter which class or race you choose.I have spended over 3k hours on Playstation to this game 'til I swapped to PC community and I still find doing the stuff i've already completed on my other character interesting and rewarding.If you wanna play the actually best MMO there is you should try ESO ;;)"
Positive,"Edit: 1700+hours of gameplay now and i can tell you that this is the best thing that i've spent my money on. The detail of the world is beautifully crafted.The quest is logically designed and emotionally engaging.The soundtracks fit the game at its best and it is orchestral soundtracks (my personal favourite)The boss in the game is strategically challenging since every boss has different mechanism to kill them.The community is very positive and friendly.if you enjoy Skyrim, you may enjoy this game more, probably.bethesda did it again, as always. 9.5/10Edit: 1700+hours gameplay now"
Positive,"18:02:35 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time) So, I finally decided to pick up Elder Scrolls Online this sale, since its been on my radar for a while, but due to some Steam review complaints about content and performance, was skeptical at first.At first, I was a little confused by the initial download size (66GB in a single download... yeah, my poor internet took the whole DAY to download it :( ), but when I launched it, was very impressed with the performance. I am currently playing on a laptop with an i7-5500U, 8GB of RAM, and 1 TB HDD, with Intel HD Graphics 5500, and I can run it on Medium settings really smoothly. Granted, the CPU isn't that old, but is definitely not meant to run meaty games. The content was also something I am very impressed with. I love the amount of quests available to you from the start, the fact that you level relatively quickly (am already level 8 with only a few quests really completed and with only 2 days of owning the game). You can acquire very powerful gear really quickly imo, and the dedication to lore detail is really nice.All in all, I say Ill give it a solid 9/10, and its a purchase I definitely don't regret! So if you are on the fence with this one, I highly suggest you give it a shot! :)"
Positive,"I bought this game two years ago or so and I didn't enjoy it so much. I played for two weeks.I reinstalled few days ago and I notice it changed a lot. I am totally loving it!I hope I can get the expansion soon :)Quests, items, crafting, personalization, everything is cool. Fighting is fun too!"
Positive,"If you like MMOs then I suggest you try it. The PVP Zone caters to everyone since the battles are large scale. The leveling is good since everything scales to you. Housing is a neat endgame feature since the nice ones cost a lifetime's savings of gold. The DLC's are good value, especially if you get ESO+ for a month and complete them all at once. Crafting in very deep.  Questing is great since all of them are fully voiced. Since ZOS isn't some korean dev, they actually listen to our feedback. The cash shop is full of cosmetics so there is no pay to win. The community is for the most part friendly, so you will find friends very easily.I say, if you see the game on sale then don't hesitate to try it if you think you might like it."
Positive,"Great game, dont buy on steam though becaue of login issues"
Positive,it is a good game but i don't understand how to play this game
Positive,"I do understand the frustration of many players over this game; the weekly maintenance take ages, weird bugs every now and then but I still enjoy it whenever I play it and I will eagerly wait to see what other features and areas will be available in the future"
Positive,"Forget what you heard about the game. If you are not sure, watch some stream about the game.The atmosphere is great; moreover, story is great too.Everyone says the game is not like Skyrim, but it is actually like Skyrim and more.You will like it ^^."
Positive,"So where to start. I aint got much to say about the game in itself. The graphics are good, Its buggy as hell sometimes, the gameplay is challenging. What i like the most is the freedom you have in the game. Its not because you picked a nightblade you hvae to be a stam dps, hell you can even be a nightblade healer but it might not be the best. I could say alot about this game, but what really shines in this game is the community. Honnestly, one of the most friendly if not the most friendly community in all the gaming community. If you dont talk to the people granted, you'll never find a good experience. But over this year and a half i've met alot of crazy caracter: tothe Rping nyan girls to the try hard of the game and of course all that is in the between. Some of them are now my IRL friend now. For me this game is more about the interaction you have with your guild mates/friends than the game itself . The game is fun sure, but with 12 other people as clueless as you about those dam mechanics, thats where the real fun is. I highly recommend for all you who wants something new from those battle royale or league of legends. So go ahead give it a try get out there and perhpas we will meet in game!"
Positive,"This is my 3rd try at an MMO now. First it was Guild Wars 2 then ArcheAge and now ESO.Unlike the first two this one has an actual story with interesting lore to back it up having the Elder Scrolls name which is a game I grew up playing. Atleast thats what I thought starting out, towards the end of the story I began to realise it was actually really generic and I'd seen this type of ""ultimate evil force from another realm trying to take over our world and all our nations that had fought in the past have to put aside their differences to fight a greater threat"" kinda deal in other MMO's.The combat is pretty good and feels like you are playing an Elder Scrolls game with MMO elements which is a nice combo of the two and makes for a good and non-clunky experience. You don’t have to manually click to target someone you can just mouse over them which makes it super easy to switch targets. I feel like this is the closest experience I will find to what people experienced in WoW which I missed out on back in the day. My issue is right now I'm going through and clearing the first main map area, completing the POI areas such as public dungeons and typical quests which all pretty much boils down to helping someone, a town or pushing back the bad guys (aka generic side quests) but the leveling is so slow I don’t feel like I'm getting anywhere fast and the stat improvements don’t seem all that big, there is no way of knowing what type of armor you want to spec into because looking at raw stats alone medium and heavy armor beats out every time which is not good for the healer/damage class I selected. There are other issues as well such as finding people for group bosses which I can't beat on my own. There is no public auction house, instead they use guild traders which is I guess a different way of doing it but all it seems to do is heavily limit the economy and ability for you to buy the things you want at the price you want which every other MMO has and it works much better in my opinion. Ok it might not make much sense in this type of world because of the other games but it’s an MMO. You can join multiple guilds to increase the amount of guild stores but you have to search each one separately but there isn’t even a search function!? Some of these things you can fix with addons but they are often buggy and sometimes only seem to show some results and you have to keep clicking through empty pages to see more results. There doesn't seem to be any kind of world bosses that require like 50 players to combat, you pretty much only need about 5 players and your good. - Good MMO/RPG hybrid gameplay, Elder Scrolls name but pretty average"
Positive,"It had a terrible start and alot of the problems have been fixed.If you are ready to accept it as an MMORPG with the theme of Elder Scrolls and that it's not what everyone hoped, then this game is actually alot of fun. However if you're looking for a new MMO RPG to play, you can find much better games than this. It's not horrible, it's not fantastic, but it does the job. 6.5/10"
Positive,"So I've played this game for some time now and I've had a great experience! The graphics are amazing (for a MMORPG), the combat works really good as well and the gameplay is just really nice, so are the quests. I must admit that the game had a crappy launch!...I would definitely recommend you to try it out the 17 march, where they remove the subscription!"
Positive,"Hey, you. You’re finally awake."
Positive,Great game that I still play to this day. Would recommend 10/10.
Positive,"What is ESO? its a game that everyone wants, a game that everyone desires. Like skyrim but MMO. However once this game came out it was expensive as sh*t an still is and thats why this game is dead. You need at least 3 people together in this game to have fun, so dont get this unless you have friends that all want to spend $60"
Positive,"I came back to this game a week ago to be prepared to the B2P edition and also try all the new content, and oh man i got to say that its being and incredible experience, i also started since the first version came out but i didn't stay around, and now with all the new improvments, models, animations, justice and champions systems and all of that shit the game is a lot of fun in my opinion, i would totally recomend it for you guys to give a try, its a game that deserves it, hope in the future to see a big playerbase! This game deserves a second chance now that is b2p!"
Positive,"Every year or so I get the urge to play this game.  I re download it, make a character, get hooked on stealing stuff and then stealing stuff becomes my LIFE. I steal stuff for about 3 or 4 weeks, then go play other games. Have never beaten the game, killed any big bosses because I just....can't.....stop....stealing ...stuff. 10/10"
Positive,"The combat is floaty, which I don't like. Also, it just gets repetitive after a while. The skills just don't feel impactful and distinct enough.As for the monetization, don't get me started. It's downright disrespectful to the playerbase. Houses and accessories can run in the hundreds of dollars. This is on top of quarterly DLC and Yearly Expansions along with the optional subscription which gives you access to the coveted craft bag, essentially endless inventory space. If you like collecting stuff, this isn't the game for you. The mounts, costumes, and cool transmog is all locked behind lootboxes or the cash shop. Boring, next!"
Positive,"I think this game is absolutely worth buying! I am a fan of the elder scrolls series. The world of Morrowind , Oblivion and Skyrim is stellar , and this game is a good adventure just like them. Though there are some aspects that deserve criticism, such as the market/auction system and the overwhelming amount of content locked behind dozens of DLCs, the still game manages to feel like an overall well-made time sink. The voice-acting is just amazing , and the fact that they actually did all the quests in the game is simply mind-blowing. There are your typical mmo problems too, like dull quest objectives, a fair amount of grinding, class balance issues, but to be comepletely honest, I'm pretty sure there isn't a single mmo that does not suffer from these issues. In the end it is an above averege mmo with an elder scrolls flare weaved into it. If you enjoy such games, I think this is definetely worth a try."
Positive,"I think I have played this game before. This time with friends.I hit the enemies with my weapons and magic and they go bye bye. Drop experience that I can collect to become stronger? Not sure why picking a lock gives me upgrades in Heavy armor. Heavy powerful lock...I fought a dragon, but it was with an NPC. I think there might be more. One day I will become the Elder Scroll.Look out. I am coming for you."
Positive,"I played for a bit.It was pretty fun.Everything looks good, the guilds you can join are really neat, the Elves are always dominating Cyrodiil as can be canonically expected. Can expect to be grindy, but enjoyable thing to play when you just want to chill and help some Argonian find potatoes for his Swamp Vodka.Oh, did I mention decorating a house in-game?"
Positive,It crashes when I CLOSE the game. It doesn't crash when I'm playing. It crashes when I CLOSE it.
Positive,"Though I have only played for 2 hours it is worthy of the Elder Scrolls name, If you enjoy elder scrolls and you like some mmo elements and friends, buy this."
Positive,Absolutely love this game.
Positive,"Simply Love it!so much content, and so many friendly people :)"
Positive,Played for a few hours - I regret nothing
Positive,"please buy me this video game so i can play with my cute girlfriend, i only played on free weekend :(("
Positive,One of the best games to play a most have for your library.
Positive,"Gameplay is kind of a hybrid between traditional mmos and the classic elder scrolls fighting style and it retains certain features from the elder scrolls franchise such as the stealing and bounty system and oblivion like lockpicking.Also sieges and pvp are tons of fun there are simillarities between eso and guild wars in that regard.Overall I would recommend this game,if you're an elder scrolls fan you'll appreciate the story with the voiceacted quests. It has some flaws and could borrow more from the elder scrolls franchise but I would deffinetly recommend a buy :D"
Positive,"Feels like you're playing an Elder Scrolls game which just so happens to be multiplayer. Super chill and and atmospheric, really easy to immerse yourself in the game. Whether you're playing with friends or by yourself, you'll likely still have a lot of fun in ESO. There's an insane amount of potential for unique builds, due to all of the different skill lines you can spec in, as well as the champion point system which becomes available past level 50. Real nice change of pace from other MMORPGs out there as well--feels less stressul, and the world actually feels somewhat alive and interactable. Highly recommend!"
Positive,"Well after so many hours in this game i have to say im totaly far away from ""i finished the actual content""The community is most of the time realy great and beside some little bugs this game is perfect,Tons of real cool story content, Very interesting raid mechanics, Realy great massiv pvp and also 4v4v4 battleground pvp like capture the flag.i was playing many mmorpgs but not a single one have this amount of content.The game is growing and also the community. Buy it, it wont get boring!Best MMORPG out there!Edit: Still playing still love it"
Positive,"This game is well, astonishing. Ik, big word right? But off topic, this game is worth the £20, or what ever it is converted to us$ and euros ect. The game had a VERY shaky start, barley anyone was on the game, it was nothing like any elder scrolls game, but thats what they wanted. Zenimax took a MMO route instad of online RPG and well, it worked. The game is fluent and there is many hours of discorvering,fighting ect in this game. I have 250+hours and ive not even done half of whats to offer! People with 1k hours on this game are not reccomending it, purley because they have done everything. Dont get me wrong, at one point, you do hit a wall in this game and think ""Im bored"" but wait a couple minutes maybe hours and go back. Theres much more. ESO plus gives your 4DLC questlines and 2 dungeons, thats a massive upgrade to the base game. After that, theres a ton of locations with hundreds of quests. After quests, you can start to do a build. Magicka,Stamina, Tank, damage ect. Do what you want, cause you can on this game. GraphicsThe graphics are amazing in this game. Even on low, the game still looks somewhat good. I only have a 1050 and on ultra get around 60-100 fps on this game. Its just, beautiful.TL:DR This game in NOTHING like any other ES game, and thats what makes it unique. If you like Elder Scrolls, look at someone play this game on YT, you may not like it, but you might. You never know. If you've never played an ES game, try this one, not the best to get hooked in on, but still amazing"
Positive,Best MMORPG out there.

Positive,lol not gay
Positive,"The addiction is real.Yes, I recieved the Steam copy as a gift (from an awesome friend), but I have paid for this game on PS4 twice (digital for my wife and disc for myself) so the free Steam copy doesn't sway my opinion.This game is amazing, it's everything I want in an MMO: interesting story quests with excellent VO.  Progression that doesn't feel like a grind (to me).  Easy to understand interface.  And CONTROLLER SUPPORT!  I have been playing this game nonstop on PS4 for the past 4 months and now I'll be playing it just as much on PC.Expect to see me logged into this game, and nothing else, for the forseeable future."
Positive,"It's... this is going to be one of those reviews... like I was going to do all fancy cons and pros but meh. ESO is a bad game. And a good game. I instantly fell in love, but I also hate it with passion. It's hard to explain... example quests are most all similar and meaningless... but still at the same time the quests are fun and interesting. I can't explain it. The world of ESO is so full yet so simple. It has all the bad things MMO's have: mean people, pressure to gather, archievements that take your soul and life, unhappiness if you're not the best player ever... aaand still you love it. Every miserable minute, every miserable person you struggle challenges through with. Maybe I'm just addicted, I should of known. I think I knew. And while it's not pay to win... it will lure you into using real money. It knows what to offer. You must have it, you must subscribe. I think I'm done sharing my thoughts as that's what it is rather that than a proper review. Buy it at your own risk. Not recommended for people with past MMO addictions. Don't do it if you know yourself.You'll like it until you'll hate it (and still like it.)PS: It's not Skyrim. While in Skyrim you're all alone, it still has more soul. In ESO you're all alone among so many and you'll feel it and you'll also realize there is no soul. And no this isn't a ""oh she has no friends"" case."
Positive,"Dragons? In your own homeland???? 10/10   I didn't grow up playing mmo games and have always been super intimidated by them (and the other players), but this one is easy to get into for any type of gamer. I talked all of my friends into playing with me, some with Elder Scrolls experience, others without, some who have played every mmo, and some who have never played any- and the results are in: Everybody LOVES It!   There's a whole heck of a lot you can do too. You can get super beefy and do pvp! You can go to the battlegrounds and play a variety of group games! You can find treasure maps and go hunting! You can dig for antiques with a fun little mini game! You can become a wolfie boy or a sucky guy! You can go out on your own and let the adventure find you! Or, you can be like me, spending countless hours leveling up your crafting skills and finding every pattern out there so you can build furniture for your house and then host parties for your guild!    On that note. Let me just say...I love The Sims. I love making characters and building their home. Everything about roleplay and customizing things that reflect your individual characters are really exciting and immersive. This game will give you everything you adore about The Sims but with a lot more precision- the possibilities are almost endless. Have a ball, go wild. It's what you actually enjoy about The Sims without the boring, monotonous, and often punishing gameplay. A list of fun things you'll experience:- There's nothing more exciting then facing off with a world boss on your own, realizing you probably made a huge mistake- only to see passerby jumping off their mounts to run to your aid and help you fell the great beast! You sometimes never even speak a word to one another before they take off on their journey again. However- maybe a friend request will pop up-! GASP! Very wholesome.- It's really easy to find and join guilds! More often than not, you're gonna find super chill people who are happy to help you. Though, more serious players can find their circle easily as well! There are even groups just for RP!- Queue up for a random dungeon! You will usually get paired up with very nice folks and you can write in the group chat; 'gg!' and 'tyfg!' when you take down the last boss! It's very cute and nice. Plus, nothing feels better than using a soul gem to bring a party member back to life! We're in this together!- So many fun emotes!!! I like to RP and goof around on occasion, so it adds a lot to your stories when you can play an instrument, dance, vomit, shout, play dead- you name it! You can also just use these things to entertain busy areas in town! I often cheer after beating a boss, to let everyone know we did a good job! I also enjoy sitting on a chair I pull out of nowhere to sit and wait for respawns! We don't have to be super serious here- and I like that!- SO MANY NEAT MOUNTS AND PETS! WHOA! You like dogs? Cats? Badgers? You want to ride a horse? A chubby dino? A big ol' wolf? There are many different pets to collect! You can have em' all! *Professor Oak intensifies* - This game is FULLY voice acted. It's actually amazing. I appreciate all the work that goes into doing this!! Lots of familiar voices too! - You can wear casual costumes or intricate armor builds- whatever you want! You don't have to wear the ugly chunks of armor you find lying on the ground! Cover that stuff up, my dude! You've got to buy most of it in the crown shop, but with Plus, you'll be able to grab something in no time! You can also collect motifs and make your own pieces! Dye your clothes and customize as you see fit! It makes everyone look so unique!- Razum-dar- The events are really fun and you often get exp boosts, seasonal recipes, and themed motifs! (Halloween is my favorite time!)- Your favorite Deadric Princes are there to stir up all kinds of feisty things! If you like the deep and expansive lore of The Elder Scrolls, you'll be really happy with all of the familiar faces and stories!   I could go on and on. This game has brought me hours ( roughly 500- I wasn't on Seam the first few years) of entertainment and has brought my friends and I closer than ever in these odd times. I feel like there is something for absolutely everyone. You won't run out of things to do anytime soon, so get all your buddies together and join us in Tamriel!"
Positive,"A very underrated game in the Elder Scrolls universe, mostly due to false expectations. It has its flaws like any mmo (dense crowds in certain areas, connection errors), but is otherwise very solid and, dare I say, quite fun."
Positive,"ESO satisfies my addiction to TES lore. It allows you to explore pretty much the entirety of Tamriel. The story is rich, especially for an MMO, being fully voiced and interesting. The game is fully soloable (except for, say, veteran dungeons and trials) and can be played as a single-player game for those who don't enjoy multiplayer. PvP is separate to PvE, which is nice.PvE is fun, difficult and engaging. It does require teamwork, so you will need to find a non-pug group via the Guild Finder or Discord. Luckily it is incredibly easy to find groups for all content.The zones are fun to explore, and the graphics are very pretty in my opinion. There are plenty of collectables available in game without resorting to the Crown Store, where you can buy cosmetic items with real money.Negatives:The game is buggy as hell. There are so many bugs which have been in the game for literal years which ZOS have completely ignored to fix.There is so much server downtime compared to other MMOs. Server maintenance is every week and oftentimes gets extended to take up the majority of the day. ZOS also seems to have favouritism for its NA server players, allowing them server downtime during the night whereas EA players, who make up the majority of the player base, receive server downtime during prime gaming hours, and whose servers are run on older hardware whereas the NA servers have been updated and are newer.Did I mention the bugs? So. Many. Bugs."
Positive,~3k hours of the play time only because of all the amazing people I could spend time with during the last years. <3
Positive,"am i addicted? can't tell yet, brb in a few more hours"
Positive,"Great game, helpful tips, incredible gameplay and graphics with never ending quests and expansion packs, love it 11/10!"
Positive,Better than most MMOs
Positive,"This game had a rocky start, but after 6 major updates the game has become great!Everyone who didn't like the game at launch should check it out now with all the changes.Pros:-  No monthly fee ( Buy to Play )- Amazing quests - Best I have seen in an MMO- Full voice acting from every NPC- Unique class system- GraphicsCons:- PvP while good could be much better.- Large download"
Positive,"Better than World of Warcraft and makes me want to play Morrowind Oblivion and Skyrim all over againThis is the best MMO I've ever played but not the best game I've ever played. It's no Masterpiece but it's decent now that they fixed alot of things. Still could be better but for it's current state it's genuinely very impressive and I am speaking as a fan of Bethesda and a seasoned gamer. This review will be structured from my first initial response to the game and any updates as I progressOriginal reviewI give this game a 7/10 in its current stateI would give it a 9/10 if you could betray the Dark Brotherhood. I was making a heroic character for my first playthrough ands the Dark Brotherhood questline ruined this because there's no way to infiltrate and betray them. Big problem really is it leans towards the MMO side more when it's supposed to be Elder Scrolls. But I get it's hard to balance the two because you are trying to appeal to two groups the MMO players and Elder Scrolls fans. Some zones are populated by numerous npcs/creatures/animals that don't make sense for that zoneHundreds of Wasps in Reaper's MarchMammoths in Malabal TorThousands of Saber Tooth Cats in The Rift (That don't look like the Sabre Tooth Cats from Skyrim)Sometimes Vendors are uselessThe Combat can get stale sometimesBut other than that this game is very good for an MMO which has become a niche genreIt's good because it follows the Elder Scrolls Games format and distinguishes itself from other MMOs with its own unique style/gameplay/world/loreAlsoBest character custimzation in the series (I can finally make an attractive female character somethign no other Elder Scrolls Game has accomplished.Best use of Magic Even if classes from the original games are obscured. There are five classes when the original games had many. Schools of magic such as Conjuration Illusion Alteration would be fun to play with and they have Restoration and Destruction magic. Give Conjurers more summons like the Daedroth or Frost Atronach or Ogrim instead of just the stupid Clanfear and Twilight7/10 I look forward to the Fallout MMO being developed in partnership with Obsidian and Zenimax and playing as either a Synth Super Mutant Ghoul Raider or Vault DwellerIf I come across anything while playing Elder Scrolls Online in the future that affects it's score I'll revise this reviewUpdate:As of this part of my review reaching level 30 and having significantly more hours put into the gameI main an Imperial Dragonknight My favorite thing about this game is that as you play it and venture to the various provinces it genuinely feels as if you play an entirely different game in the best way.Skyrim feels like Skyrim. Those with alot of Nostalgia will like this region and those with even more Nostalgia will see how beautifully Morrowind is represented in this game.And I understand why Valenwood and Alik'r Desert should be in the next Elder Scrolls  I spend most of my time in Cyrodiil because Oblivion was my favorite and that pvp game is an animal all to itselfThey took the concept of Alterac Valley from that shitty game World of Wacraft and made it bigger and even more brokenThe vast areas populated with random overabundance of creatures is still a problem but the pvp is completely devoid of creatures which makes no sense because no real combat occurs outside of the actual keepsDo not go into this game if you play MMOs for the pvp experienceThis game revolves heavily on lore, quests, and dungeon crawling like the original games with the addition of having other players joining you. The real reason why the MMO genre works in general is because of the addition of other players to join in your game adding a social aspect. Multiplayer games are rarely not fun. No one would want to play an MMO by themselves unless it is still fun to do solo quests like in this gameThe brilliance of Elder Scrolls Online is it can be played alone or with friends and it's still entertainingHope you're taking notes World of WacraftActually don't take notes just continue to shill GarrisonsI like walking around towns like Wayrest and Vivec City because you can actually get the same feel and vibes of Orgrimmar or Stormwind where everybody is in one place just chilling and hanging outAs I mentioned pvp is very broken so don't go into this game expecting a pvp experience.(This game is primarily about questing character customization and lore) Combat is somewhat underwhelming I mean it's still MMO combat so you click your mouse endlessly and press the 1-5 keys occasionally. Although it is significantly better than other MMO combat because it incorporates some interesting mechanics like the blocking or dodging or the stamina bar or how enemies will sometimes advertise their next attack with red warning signs (similar to my favorite game from 2017 Master X Master before it got cancelled) which can be avoided or blocked by the player. Alot of this game really is about customizing your playable avatar since it is an MMO and while you don't have as much freedom as the main series games you can still craft an avatar to rival all the other decked out avatars you meet. Because this game has the best character creation of all the games in the series (can't be debated your character in Skyrim Oblivion and Morrowind looks ugly unless you use mods) You can make a decent looking avatar no problem. Making a backstory for your character or playing a build or roleplaying the exact obscure lore friendly character you want to play as is not as much an option. For example I wanted to make an Imperial Rouge who uses frost fire and illusion magic maybe having a dagger in one hand and a fire spell in the other like in Skyrim but that's simply not an option. Pick a Nightblade and shut up. Only 5 classes. Regardless you can still dress up your character in numerous armor and outfits and be the envy of all Tamriel"
Positive,"Being quite sceptical at first (2014) I've avoided the game, as I believed TES game could not be made into an online bandwagon. Being easily affected by the TESIII nostalgia, I couldn't resist the temptation and began playing at around the release of ESO: Morrowind (2017).The Elder Scrolls Online presents an immense playground, immaculately built for both new and old admirers of The Elder Scrolls series.Having nearly no desire to indulge in any PvP activity at first, I've been playing ESO solely for the lore and story, and it kept surprising me. The entire game is accurately lore-friendly, and provides extensive benefits and exclusive pleasures to those, who have been in adoration with the world of TES since the release of the main series. Aside from aiding with the exploration of the lore in further depth, ESO provides grand addition to the history of this universe.I mean, we're able to visit The Clockwork City! Last time we were there was to kill Sotha Sil, misled by the overly-sensitive Almalexia.This game will take countless hours (several years, without exaggeration) for you to get even near the overall end. The main and side quests provide an abundance of new information and sensation to savour, different challenges and comparatively similar activities keep you open-ended and trigger your most entertaining, yet compelling urges (such as trading, crafting, collecting, exploring, and more).As I've begun digging PvP activities, I've found that ESO has one of the best communities out there; Loads of helpful guilds and individuals, alongside entertaining conversations and meets. Additionally, ZOS having an active and cooperative customer support makes your overall online experience at ESO enjoyable and pleasant. I've had one of the best laughs and cries in this game. And it does yield great benefits to get into the online activities, since there are many group-oriented objectives and challenges, alongside achievements, which you most certainly want under your all-trait-explored girdle.The combat mechanics will take a separate article to write, yet an overwhelming arsenal of stamina and magicka oriented skills, alongside specific role and set builds, will most certainly allow you to fully customise your gameplay, whether you are roleplaying with your character or not (as some people definitely are OTT not lore-friendly with their gameplay and characters). Yet managing a good damage-dealing, healing or tanking character will take great effort, practice and knowledge, something that I myself avoid, since it is only useful in strict PvP situations.I personally am unsure how suitable is ESO for solo players, such as myself (I've learned to manage myself in an online game), however, something that I cannot stress enough, is that it's a dire recommendation for you to go through the main and most side quests, if you are a TES admirer and enthusiast, since you most certainly shall be missing out on a lot. A lot of punches in the childhood, tear-bringing moments and revelations (alongside heavy easter eggs, sometimes fun, sometimes sad)."
Positive,"One of the most amazing MMO's I've ever played, and mind you I usually dislike MMO'S (so there is no pro-mmo bias here). You can play in one of 3 factions. There are at least 9 races to choose from. There are 4 different classes. (Dragon Knight, Templar, Sorcerer, Nightblade)Choose Stamina (bow) OR Magic build (staff).  Resolution is amazing considering it is an MMO. Nerds with their w.o.w. can't even compare. Many, Many hours spent on this game, and worth it. Try it and see for yourself."
Positive,"Despite you have to pay another dollars to unlock things, this game is fun. Worst installer, but worthed. I mean, after finish downloading 80GB, you have to provide another 80GB free just to install launcher so that you can play via steam. Really, Bethesda??Anyway, as much as I want to recommend this game to you, I would recommend to grab this game on sales. Yea, there are still contents to be unlocked, so save your money everyone."
Positive,Best game on earth
Positive,I just love Tamriel.

Positive,"Highly Recommend!I'n my personal opinion this is the best fantasy MMO RPG game I have ever experienced. The whole game is an adventure for yourself and your friends. Massive potential and endless capabilities are in store, you don't even have to feel lazy about leveling your character. Yes their is something called a crown store for you to buy your game perks, helpful in some ways but dont let it ruin your game experience. The whole environment is worth exploring, best yet almost everyone is doing their purpose and is glad to help another player, as well for a challenge their is Pvp battles and quests. The only true way to  truly experience this endless journy and heartracing adventure is think positive on how your going to play. It all involves in how YOU want to play, be who you want to be whether an archer of one of the fighting armies, Swordsman of an outlawed clan, a Sorcerer/Necromancer become a deadric prince/princess with destructive power by your choice. Vampires and werewolfs are back to transform you, you can even form your own guild/party/squad/companions! Or as you choose to play solo against the whole world.I hope this review helped any of you thinking on purchasing!Just to share what I am doing1st character :Kyle Skylark ""Male""NordSwordsman/BowmanA Nightblade NightingaleSpecialty in blacksmithingNot-marriedDungeon Dweller2nd Character :Asuna Kirigya ""Female""ImperialSwordman Special in AkiviriTemplarNot-marriedFrontline Soldier({Goal to find the dragon in skyrim})"
Positive,"Completely worth the money and the 40 GB download. Would have bough this game a long time ago had it not been p2p. Tamriel Unlimited definitely deserves the title of an elder scrolls game. For those of you who are considering buying it as your first elder scrolls game, I would still recommend Skyrim.Just keep in mind that this is NOT Skyrim Multiplayer! The dynamics are that of an MMO, for example instead of buying spells, you unlock them like you do in other mmos and mmorpgs. The story is amazing and the side-quests are awesome. The only problem is when you are supposed to be sneaking into a house and there are other people just standing there because they are at a later stage of a quest. But this is just nitpicking and I enjoy the game."
Positive,amazing open world Great design  Graphics are beautiful
Positive,"A really great game overall, with some stunning graphics, fully voiced and interresting quests and overall great combat.However, saying the game have ""NO SUBSCRIPTION REQUIRED"" is only partially true. If you want to enjoy all the game have to offer, you'll need to either Subscribe or purchase the new content through the ingame microtransaction shop, as they aren't avaliable through steam for some reason."
Positive,"I previously had a negative review on this game due to its monthly payment option, but that has since changed.That was the main reason this game was so poorly rated, because as a game it's really fun.I just wish I would have gotten to experience it sooner, because when I bought it the first time it refused to even let me play it without me giving it my credit card number.Again though, that was awhile ago and it's a fantastic game."
Positive,"WARNING: ESO is not Skyrim. Do not go into it if you are expecting it to be Skyrim but online. ESO is a really vast and lively open-world MMO RPG that includes the majority of Tamriel that we know of. Set in the second era, it sets out a fair bit of TES lore, so definitely pick this up if you enjoy that aspect of the series. ESO can be played as a traditional RPG no problem, but at the same time, you can spend your time in Cyrodiil taking castles from other players, or taking part in veteran dungeons or trials (4 and 12 man group content). The game does not have a specific path for you to take. It is whatever the player chooses. Whether that be roleplaying, min-maxing builds, creating houses, fishing, crafting... ESO has it all. If you really are serious about looking for a new game to spend thousands of hours in, ESO is great. Even the base edition will give you a lot of content. As well, the game comes on sale often for really cheap, so pick it up then if you want to try,Disclaimer: Lootboxes and real-money currency are in this game, but they only give cosmetic items. There is no actual benefit to buying said cosmetics in this game besides looking good. The game does offer a subscription service however, but it is worth the money easily if you intend to play a lot. I don't know many players who play as much as I do and who don't have it, it's just that beneficial. Point is though, try it. There's something for everyone."
Positive,It's fun I guess.Edit: It's still fun 10/10
Positive,I’d hate to be a giraffe with a sore throat.
Positive,Great game. No monthly fee. Explore for days!
Positive,"Game CompletionI played this game for about 6,791 hours, completed 75% achievement of the game, and earned the final alliance rank called Grand Overlord grade 2, so I decided to write a review. In PVP, I usually go to Cyrodiil for solo and zerg fights. When my DC PVP guild was ready, I joined the group and followed the callouts. Joining the Dc PVP guild, I learned a lot of different kinds of builds, guild fights, PVP's mechanics, emperor's build, and strategies. In solo fights, I usually fight inexperienced players when I defend my resource flag or my keep/castle so that I can collect my alliance points to get 100,000 -250,000 alliance points per hour. These inexperienced players can be players who do not learn or apply the fight mechanics from group to solo. Add-onsI like to use add-ons to switch gear from solo to group PVP gear. There goes mobility ring and speed ability, too, so I can catch up to get ""keep flips"" to earn alliance points. During my solo fights, I did not like to fight super tanks since super tanks like to drain my resources like Magicka and stamina and waste my alliance points per hour, so I ran away from them. Running away from them is easy since the super tank stays in one place. In my experience, when I fought one of them, I got tired of doing my damage per second (DPS) rotation. I think the fight lasted 20 minutes. In group fights, I usually follow an organized group or a random big group to get 50,000 alliance points per hour because I want to learn different enemy's faction guild, what build they use, how they do their call out, and how they organize their group. I mainly play a very populated server for Cyrodiil, where the battle took outside of the imperial city.PlaytimeFrom morning to night play, I learned that each faction has different groups to be brought out. Morning flights are not very intense in group fights because they don't have the gear to work out with the group. Night fights are very hard in group fights because people follow orders from their group leaders and wear specific gear. Each organized group has a different style of fighting and using gear. These gear are required from veteran download contentable.Leaderboard's number 1 in a populated PVP serverAfter I became number 1 for getting alliance points in the leaderboard, most Daggerfall covenant members helped me to become emperor/empress. They had to take over all the keeps around the imperial city for me to become emperor. Having an emperor/empress power in the number 1 populated server in North America, I used pure damage gear so that I could 1 or 2 shoot players down with a destruction spell and sorceress's crystal frag. My alliance points per hour went up to 500,000 alliance points per hour, and I went to solo more against Ebonheart and Aldermia dominion players. When I fought them, they forged a purple pact that red and yellows helped together to fight me. My alliance points per hour came from an add-on that tracks your alliance points. My excuse for not being in Cyrodiil was completing Pve's core trial.PVP Add-onsLearning to use add-ons, I usually look around all the buttons and what they do from the setting and disable some of the features to decrease CPU usage. For example, Lui-extend has some healing and attack displays from other players so that they will not fake their play in the game. I see so many healing numbers from strangers' healing of spring at Deshann.PVE experienceIn PvE, I usually made my sorceress as an ice tank-DPS or ice off-tank so that I could speed up to clear the dungeon and help new players to get their completion for veteran white gold tower and veteran imperial city in hard mode. Non-DLC dungeons are straightforward, but DLC dungeons are very mechanical. (Download load contentable) DLC dungeons require steps not to get your entire team dead and yourself dead. I find non-DLC dungeons to test new players who have a good complete set of equipment and understand their role and their role's rotation by using abilities. Hybrid roles work in non-DLC dungeons and some DLC dungeons like the white gold tower, imperial city, and ruins of mazzatun. Every new patch expansion or DLC, group DPS keeps on increasing and making the game easier than before. I stopped doing trials because we are missing players at the weekend and cannot get new and experienced players to replace them to keep up with the latest trial. A trial is a 12-player end game content that requires players to have all their gear to be epic or up.Fun Daily experienceI do daily quests because I like to explore new places, learn the world boss mechanic, learn motifs, and get to know new players. The world boss's mechanic does come back to trials and dungeons.Loot cratesI don't have anything to go against loot crates. I think the best-looking mounts were from the fire atronach crate series since fire atronach looks very good. Their loot crate's themes were based on download contentable and monsters.PVP vocabularyHere are vocabulary and acronym words:ap = alliance pointDC or dc = Daggerfall covenantEP or ep = ebon heart pactAD or ad = Aldermi dominionPvE = player versus environmentPVP = player versus playerzerg is a group of 12 players or more that are like zerglings from Starcraft."
Positive,"Who needs real life when you can be a Khajiit thief or a Breton mage in a world full of dragons and magic? I've spent so much time in this game that I've forgotten what the sun looks like. Who needs Vitamin D when you can have virtual gold and experience points?Sure, there are downsides like server crashes and my dwindling social life. But who needs friends when you have the entirety of Tamriel in your hand?"
Positive,"I was at first hesitant to get this game because of the negative reviews I read and heard. It seemed most were upset that it's not just like the other Elder Scrolls games, and it does suck it's not exactly the same. But I still find The Elder Scrolls Online to be highly enjoyable. If I weren't playing it exclusively with my girlfriend whom games less than me, I would be obsessively playing it. The quests are like the usual but with a twist that makes them more unique. They have characters that I actually want to help. Maybe it's the fact they're fully voiced, but the characters feel more real to me and I like that some quests have the choices to have a character live or die. And if you get sick of quests there's other places to explore.Crafting is actually fun. I love cooking.The world itself also feels more immersive because you can interact with it, Being able to enter most buildings, search through dressers and crates.. In most MMO's you can barely interact with the environment. There's so much more to be said, but it will take too long. If you're expecting something like Skyrim, then don't buy it because you'll most likely be disappointed. If you look at this as an MMO with Elder Scrolls mixed in, and you watch gameplay videos and it looks enjoyable to you, then you should get it. It's a very, very gorgeous game that's more immersive than most MMOs."
Positive,"I originally didn't recommend this game because of technical issues. They have been fixed. The game itself is a lot of fun. There's a ton of content to play through, and it's enjoyable even as a solo-player experience. The endgame is a little different than your typical MMO and provides some variety for gearing up and strengthening your character. If you're looking for a traditional TES experience, you won't find it here. There are some similarities though. You'll encounter a lot of the places, lore, factions and characters you've encountered in some TES games but the gameplay is definitely nothing like those games. The music is great, and everything is fully voiced. Combat is similar to Guild Wars 2. You have 2 weapon skill bars (swappable in combat) with 5 skills and ultimate on each bar that you can customize and create some unique builds. This game is fun. Questing is enjoyable, the storylines are entertaining enough, PVP is fun (although annoying at low gear levels) and the game is adequately challenging. I definitely recommend this one to MMO fans, and TES fans alike."
Positive,"I'm writing this while waiting for the in-game loading screen to finish so yeah, when people ask me what games I play, I reply 2 years ago I bought a whole bunch of games on the Steam Christmas sale and I played a few of em while waiting for TESO to finish downloading. 2,298.6 hours on record later.... It's gotten so bad that I flip between the NA and the EU server just to find more of a challenge when playing and to dodge the dreaded latency monster. If they ever open up a SEA server or even an ANZ server I'll be rolling up new characters to play there just so I can get better latency when I pvp and STILL play my other characters on the other two server. And if you're asking, the graphics are BEYOND skyrim when you max out the settings (but without graphical mods like ENB so let's not even go there). It has just enough stick and carrot to get us to grind out every new content being churned out. If you're just getting in, add me and I'll go a few rounds in Cyrodill with you (Better RED than dead/GOLD for the Queen/United in BLUE/Purple Alliance I don't care we're just grinding AP here)."
Positive,"I'm not a huge mmorpg player but I really enjoy this game. And I rarely leave reviews.Easy to get in to, smooth to play, plenty to do, scale is great (you don't feel like you are running a marathon between every building or object)Micro transactions are reasonable...they add to the game but are not essential.Gold is not too difficult to earn.Crafting has detail but is not too complicated.Not all missions are the same, some you gather, most you kill, some you have to wear a disguise and sneak in whilst stealing stuff.There are 3 groups to choose from and the areas are different so it's kinda almost like getting 3 games.Plenty of character slots.Don't have to subscribe.Says ""partial Controller Support"" but once you have logged into your character it is full (as far as I know).My laptop doesn't have an amazing spec but it runs just fine.Tip...If this game isn't on sale do NOT buy the Imperial edition- get the standard then buy the upgrade in the game store with crowns (the diff is £20, the upgrade costs 2100c, 3000c is £15) so you save yourself £5 and end up with just over £5 worth of crowns to spend."
Positive,"Gorgeous, fun and you don't have to pay a ridiculous subscription fee anymore.   Would recommend."
Positive,Most of my hours are from waiting for updates on the launcher :)
Positive,good! except when it's not.
Positive,good game but it the file size is 50GB for macbook pro rentina user not recomended
Positive,it's great because i can play it when im home alone and then no one will judge me
Positive,"I was getting used to game, decided to try the skills. Hit a peasant unintentionally. Peasant attacked me. Killed the peasant. Peasant's wife also attacked me. I killed her too. Got bounty to my name. Started to run away. A guard attacked me. I get raped by the guard. 11/10 would destroy a family again."
Positive,"As a forewarning, the way the game is designed is not friendly toward newcomers unwilling to spend extra money on the game, as inventory and banks space is very scarce, if you don't go buying upgrades for it. Not a subscription service fan, myself, so you won't see any ESO Plus praise from me. However, if you can stick with the game for long enough and can afford putting some extra money into it, the game can be a great experience - particularly with friends.There are plenty of events - of which many favor PvP (something I don't really care for) - and they gradually add more DLCs to explore. It can be a very expensive venture to buy all of it, but I'd personally take that route over a subscription service, any day.Every now and then, there will be some glitch or bug that substantially hinders gameplay, (such as an invisible wall blocking quest progression, for example) but they get ironed out, eventually.I'm not one to gush over the positives with this game, as most of the things I could say have either already been mentioned in my post here, are baseline things, or - especially - are parts of DLCs that some people interested in playing this game may not go for.On that note, I will say this. If you think this game might be of real interest to you, I heavily recommend buying whatever the most recent DLC pack for the game (includes the base game) is - even if it's a pre-purchase. The reason for this is because it will cost you less in the long run to buy that upfront than to buy the base game and then purchase the main DLCs later."
Positive,"I make sure not to write review of an MMO if I don't have a least few hundred hours of its game play experience. With that being said I've experienced almost everything this game has to offer both PvP and PvE, hard and easy game content such as: trials, dungeons, pvp game modes etc.Let's start with the content game has to offer.If you have friend(s) to play this game with you, you're almost guarantee to have a blast. However if you're like me and like to experience the game by yourself you'll still have a great time. You can do all hard pve stuff by yourself with exceptions like dungeons and trials where you have to queue up to play with other players.The Elder Scrolls Online main story is way different then Skyrim or other Elder Scrolls single player games so if you're looking for Elder scrolls 6 in here this game is not for you (it is more MMO oriented). The main quest has somewhat decent story which can be only done solo by the player. You're looking for around 35-40 hours of main story game play.Dungeons are by far the best and most fun PvE content ESO has to offer. They are easy enough to be enjoyable by new players while at the same time dungeons have hard veteran challenges for higher level-endgame players. You get huge xp bonuses for queueing up for a random daily dungeon (currently there are 144 dungeons, including the DLC ones). Every dungeon has a unique mechanic which you have to understand in order to finish it on veteran difficulty. Veteran dungeons also require teamwork of all 4 players (2 DPS,1 tank and 1 healer). All in all it's something you can't miss and I promise you you'll have a great time playing one.PVP is pretty much for endgame players. It has various modes and can be buggy. Your enjoyment from it depends heavily on your build (gear and skills you use). The gear in ESO is kind of different and a bit harder to get then in most MMOs. Your gear score comes down to how much you're willing to grind for it.My experience with ESO community is pretty positive. With of course few exceptions (such as some players being toxic in dungeons), but that's just people being people. Most guilds are really friendly and will gladly help with anything you need.The biggest minus this game has is:DLC, DLC, DLC for everything. You want a house? You have to pay for it. Want a mount that's not a horse? Pay for it. Want a good looking outfit? PAY FOR IT.Overall it's a great MMO game, but if you're looking to get more than a few hundred hours of actually enjoying the game be prepared to invest a lot of money in it."
Positive,"I own the game outside of steam, but I can't add It to steam. But I love this game so much...."
Positive,"It's okay I guess, when of course it's working properly."
Positive,"It's got its issues, but still one of the best MMO's I've played."
Positive,"This game is amazing! Currently I get so obsessed with this game. It is the best MMORPG game that I have ever played. Every class is fun. The players I meet in this game are very friendly. Besides, I think the best thing in this game is that it gives you the chance to try numerous builds to create your unique character. The only bad thing that I have experienced is the maintenance."
Positive,"Outstanding! It took me quite a few hours to get into this. It's quite deep and the classes are very very deep and diverse. Plus there is just so much to see and do!! One of my favorite things so far is  searching for treasure chests which gave me great low level armor in the lower zones and are located everywhere if you look closely. The anticipation of not knowing what will be in each chest is like a fun game just by itself. The quest system is very deep. I would not recommend not listening to the quest givers because the stories behind these quests are incredible. They're not your typical kill this or fetch that quests all the time either! I followed a dog who led me to a dead body which in turn led me to a werewolf quest. The werewolf was terrorizing the town. The neat thing about it is that even NPC's that weren't involved in the quest would sometimes give me clues. (Spoiler alert) One woman who just happened to be walking by said something to me about avoiding certain alleys because of the ""Alley murderer"". I found the werewolf in an alley, but he proved much too tough for me at level 4 so a few people who were running around town helped me kill him.       Many of the quests are involved and lead to different branches. I would visit dungeons and caves and sometimes have to do different things like open portals or go stand next to a certain NPC who would protect me during a bosses special move. It gave each fight an original sense of doing something different. Mobs reacted differently with special moves and I had to learn to adapt. Speaking of which...I am terrible at MMO's when it comes to using the WASD keys to move around while fighting. But in this game, I can actually do it for the first time EVER and quite efficiciently. I can actually kite a tough mob now. I still die occasionally in close quarters but the game allows me to get better through practice...love that aspect! I never could play archer well because i could never strafe good at all. For some reason this game's movement seems easier to me and I can circle the mob while using a bow or staff. And fighting is definitely awesome in this game. You need to  position yourself out of the mob's special attacks at times and circling the mob works well at times too. The best thing is that when I hit the mob, it actually feels like i'm hitting the mob. Even as a Sorcerer, there is a satisfying OOMPH to my special spells when the mob goes down.           The hardest thing about this game is deciding what class to be. There are so  many options in each class. You can be anything you want really....a heavy armor fire sorcerer even! the only thing I don't like is when you spend your skill points, it's super expensive to change your mind...100 gold per point and you can get over 300 points worth of skills. Fortunately, 300 points will allow you to be proficient in several classes, so it's not a game breaker, but it's still a pain if you don't like the way your toon is shaping up. You only get 6 skills on your toolbar, but you get two toolbars after a certain level, but it still means you have to choose wisely as far as what to specialize in.         I only delved into crafting a little bit so far because I spend too much time exploring which is a blast. The crafting seems very cool and I was able to craft items I actually needed which was great. Finding the items i needed for crafting wasn't hard since there are chests, bags, urns, etc. EVERYWHERE...and I mean everywhere. They are filled with all manner of items for crafting. I made some cloth pants that were much better than anything that had dropped during my travels. I had found several great pants but nothing in cloth. Ironically I found out late that you should mix your armor up at low levels so it all levels up and now I'm doing that.      I'm three days into the game and still not level 10!!!! Lol! There are just too many things to do and see and I keep getting sidetracked. Typically, i'll be hunting for treasure chests and see some lone person on a beach or in the forest and talk to them. They'll need help (a quest) and I'll do it thinking it will only take a few minutes and it opens up a whole new storyline...and the each story is just too interesting to quit! On top of that, many of these side quests hve little tidbits of information for your main quests or even lore that leads you to other things!! I never get anything done, but it's very cool!      If you like reading and lore by the way, this is the game for you. There are books, letters, notes, everywhere and the stories in some of them are fascinating. Many of them lead to quests and many have information that will pertain to people you meet making the world and especially the NPC's seem alive! Some of the books give you skillups as well...pure awesomeness!    If you're the type of person who wants to rush to end game, this is not the game for you. Not only would it defeat the concept of how to play this game, but you would miss out on so much. And since the gamne is free, you don't need to rush...just explore and enjoy the stories and lore...it's really worth taking your time.     As for the classes....I've liked them all so far at the lower levels. Some of the skills I picked were disappointing and some were awesome. I would reccomend researching a skill to see if it fits your play style before investing your point.       Bag space and bank soace like every other FTP game sucks. I can never have enough bag space and with so many containers just lying around in this world, you can fill your pack VERY quickly if you pick uop everything. There are waypoints that are free to use so you can sell stuff, but a lot of the items are worthless unless you craft...then they're great! It would probably be quite challenging to level every craft just because of the bag space. You would have to do them one or two at a time, I guess.      At first I felt like this game was just too daunting. The whole class thing confused me.I kept dying too easily if I accidentally pulled too many mobs. But now that i'm three days into and still only level 7...I'm starting to love it. I think I was just too used to MMO's where you  level up quickly, ignore what the questgivers say except to find out what they want you to kill, and mad rush my way to the endgame. It's not going to be like this in this game....it's not like those other MMO's. It's similar but with hints of Skyrim and a whole lot of interesting story mixed in and strange places to visit and cool NPC's to meet.     There are quite a few people in my server, but most are just soloing until they have trouble with a quest and then there is an occasional shout for help on certain quests. As for guilds, I've seen a few shouts but nothing like the endless shouts in other MMO's I've played...not sure if this is because I'm in a low level area or not.      No matter what, I'm having a blast in this game and look forward to seeing what higher level play is like! I'll update this review when I get to a higher level!"
Positive,"I started this game during open beta stage. It really sucked big time and really didn't feel like an Elder Scrolls game. It felt like a WoW-copy with Elder Scrolls element. I avoided buying it during release and it wasn't until a year later after the prices has dropped a lot that I actually bought the game. It had improved a lot since beta and launch and started to feel more Elder Scrolls than before but it wasn't great yet. I leveled up that character up to 32 but then stopped playing and went back to SWTOR which was my primary MMO and it's Knights of the Fallen Empire expansion that was closing in for a release. It was a good expansion but made the actual game a bit bad and more simplified. But not until the latest SWTOR expansion and the total break of that game with 5.0 update (Knights of the Eternal Throne expansion) that made me kinda tired of SWTOR. Also that the game lagged big time even though i have a good gaming computer.. All that made me reconsider and I started to play Skyrim as well as Fallout 3 and I started to feel an urge for Bethesda/Zenimax and then I heard that Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood was launched as well as Tamriel Unlimited plus the housing expansion. And then I saw the announcement of the first actual expansion for ESO: Morrowind! All this made me start playing ESO again, and this time as the primary MMO game. This game has improved a lot since the beta stages and feels like a true Elder Scrolls game as an MMO. Just like the way I always hoped for. Today's ESO is the actual ESO that I've always wanted to play! And it feels really good that you can start as an Ebonheart Pact player but go directly to Auridon and do the Aldmeri Dominion storyline instead. At least Bethesda/Zenimax are improving their MMO-game that was shitty at start to the better with each new installment and is now a great game, unlike Bioware/EA who made an awesome MMO-game turned shit and crappy.If you are an Elder Scrolls fan or a fan of open world games with an urge of a great story. You should buy this game and play it. It is also worth subscribing ESO Plus even if it's still very playable with only the one time buy. And since it is buy2play with optional sub, there isn't any pay2win-elements as most free2play games has."
Positive,"This game was awful in beta and I don't mean just because of the litter of bugs.The gameplay was bland, boring and it was missing elements from Elder Scrolls games...like stealing..That all changed in 1.6.5, though.  Now the game is awesome.Full voice acting, Elder Scrolls gameplay, all mashed up for online gaming.  No raiding though, so if you're into raiding or expect it, this is not for you.  Otherwise, get it.  This game saved itself in my opinion, but it STILL has some ridiculously stupid bugs.  They don't ruin the game, though.BUY IT!  DO IT!  AND PLAY IT WITH ME!  GO!"
Positive,"when it first came out this game was filled with bugs and it had pretty bad gameplay, but now they fixed all of these bugs and improved the game play to bring back the old elder scrolls feel, by far one of the best mmorpgs i ever played, its so beautiful and its so fun to play with my brothers and bond over. its worth every single penny to get this game"

Positive,It's like Bethesda had #ex with Blizzard
Positive,It's great to take a game slow not worrying about the lvl cap invalidating all your work every expansion.
Positive,"If Skyrim was your garden, this would be a national park."
Positive,It's alright I suppose...
Positive,"Quite a decent game, Lets you revisit tamriel before the main TES games, Seeing Vivec before it's completion was pretty interesting, Visiting balmora felt so weird when i tried finding caius cosades's home, And of course, Markarth is very cool with all the reachmen stuff, Overall, I give this game a 7/10, Quite good indeed."
Positive,"*UPDATED REVIEW*I found a lot of people giving some certain bad reviews and this is my 2 cents for the certain issues.Regarding crafting bag, I never bought it since I just use my bank to store those things. I just max my inventory bag and bank slots with ingame currency yet I still can do crafting without any difficulties (unless you store everything you get from the loots). Theres a mod that can show you a place where you can gather a certain things. I was there when ""one tamriel"" not existed yet and its very difficult for me to get advance in quest since the certain area is level-limited. And I had to do lots of side quest + grinding to level up in order to proceed with the other so called main quest. I still remember when I was level 10+ something when someone offer me a werewolf bite  and I had to go to him (high level area) to get bite. Right after that he just left and I cant survive at all walking from the ritual site to the nearby shrine with lots of high-level enemy within that. Thanks to ""one tamriel"", I can go anywhere that I like, and makes it easier for all players to complete the Holiday events especially, since it confined to certain area that is 'high-level area"" previously. So far, tbh, I never spent my money apart from the customization. For story, Im not a player that is into stories cuz I never bother with it. I played GW1 GW2, BnS, Rift , etc and I never bother with what the NPC saying and keep clicking the dialog fast to get over with it. I love grinding and crafting, thats why I play MMOs.."
Positive,"This is coming from someone that hadn't obtained the game until AFTER the One Tamriel update and Morrowind release.That being said after delving over a hundred hours in to this product, I will say that it is a completely different experience than what was reviewed at release. With the update via Thief DLC adding theft and the justice system. To One Tamriel itself allowing you to go to the other lands not integrated with your original alliance questing. To the other DLC such as Dark Brotherhood or the Solo Dungeon DLC's. If you get Tamriel Unlimited Gold Edition, I personally believe if you were a Skyrim fan you would enjoy this 1000x over in comparison to the original release. If you are a veteran MMO player, you may have some gripes in comparison to the original version of ESO.If you are looking for long spoken dialogue voice acted, and are here for the Elder Scrolls experience. I can say personally, they have achieved that. Add it with years of creating content and you have a HUGE world to delve in to.If you are a veteran MMO player looking for level specific zones, and to feel more progressed as you play. That is where the new wall has been created.ESO has became similar to Guild Wars 2 where the questing itself takes over the progression of questing. They did this to achieve the more ""single player Skyrim"" feel. For me, someone that does care about MMO aspects. The missing Auction House aside. It does create a new MMO styled experience that in my opinion is what we will see in the next generation of MMO's much more often. It allows you to do quests at your own pace and you will never have to worry about grinding.As a Vet MMO player, them removing grinding to me is a god send. I didn't realize how much I hated grinding, until attempting to return to LOTRO after playing this. It becomes almost game breaking irritating after you have become accustomed to the newer experience.The actual story of the quests, maybe since they are fully voice acted, also seems to be next level over Guild Wars II. I found myself following the story easier, and feeling the impact of twists that are attempted much more than some of the main character deaths in GWII. For point of reference, I am using GWII due to me having a level 80 in every class. It is my most modern MMO experience aside ESO. So do not take my comments as a insult to GWII, I love GWII. Single Player wise, it just does not hold up to par to Elder Scrolls Online.I played the PvP experience of ESO, and that is one place it is lacking in comparison to GWII. But instead of it making the veteran MMO players angry, it will make you happy to know that the levels you earned, gear, and so on actually matter a great deal in the ESO PvP.GWII, became a system that relies on various buffs/debuffs each update to balance PvP across the board.You will eventually as I am sure ESO end game has to, will have certain advatanges and disadvantages to abuse. the upsidre with GWII however, it is patched often, as well scales the equipment, level, and so on. That way even a level 2, can have a chance at a fully capped char in PvP if the character was built properly.For PvP it is a matter of preference. I prefer the scaling and changing in GWII in comparison to the MMO heavy version of PvP ESO currently has. There are people however I am sure, with capped ESO characters that feel changing the system demeans their earnings. Which, that is literally correct. I just believe because of that, it isn't top tier as GWII in PvP balance/entertainment.All that being said, Elder Scrolls Online has become the one MMO I just can't seem to put down. The free range experience a Elder Scrolls brings you with live teamwork on dungeons, and integrated lore you have become a fan of prior to this release places it in my opinion on a new plane/tier.Other established Single Player games attempting to create a system should take notes on ESO 2017.If they do, the MMO genre has the brightest future I have seen since the release of WoW after the death of Everquest"
Positive,I am mainly doing this review to get the achievement. This game is the first MMO I've ever done. It is very forgiving to new players. Most things are reversible when it comes to character building. Overall the community is helpful and welcoming to new players. It does not take long to learn most aspects of the game after spending a couple hours on Youtube. Good luck if you decide to purchase!
Positive,When I first played ESO it was still in its BETA stages and its was real fun and as far as Beta games go it was grate so i went and bought a copy on steam and it was Grate the most fun iv had in game in a long time. The reasent add ons of the Justice system and the new strength of Werewolvs make this game amazing now that there is no subscription fee it just makes the game so much better. A must play for all gamers looking to have fun playing as a single player style MMO player or a groupe or (Guild) style of player theres so much awesome things to do and see in this game. :D
Positive,can say my favourite game and it's one of the best
Positive,I kinda like this game.
Positive,"major improvements from when it was first released, it feels more like an elder scrolls game now"
Positive,JUST PUT ME BACK UPSTAIRS N
Positive,"If you enjoy the Elder Scrolls storytelling, get this. The world is huge, and the stories are very good."
Positive,i'm writing this review just because i played the game 69 hours and as all of you know 69 is a pretty important number :D not funny ? ok sorry .this game i really good like world of warcraft level and i prefer this one though to the fact that the lore is way more deeper and better . there are uncountable amount of content for you and your friends to go through and enjoy. my only complain is the fking servers fix the goddamn servers zenimax .yeah overall if you wanna burn your life time play this game
Positive,"This game is one of the best MMORPG games I have ever played.Yes, Its not Skyrim, Morrowind or whatever. Not even close, but the plot is the same.Yeah, Skyrim's Fanboys WILL be mad.But please. This game is so good in so many ways.Textures, varied and unique quests and some really nice community.The only con in my opinion, is the hard-time to level up.This game is recommended to all MMORPG lovers, But remember: its not Skyrim.8.5/10."
Positive,"ESO is less of an MMO than it is a single-player lore game with tons to do. Yes, the combat is more bland than other MMOs. No, it does not stop me from playing it because the amount of content feel insurmountable. I'ts less than OSRS but definitely hovers around GW2 in terms of sheer scope at this point.I pay $15 a month to play Tales of Tribute and decorate my house. It's good enough that you will likely find your own excuse to pay."
Positive,"I waited so long to get this because I knew it started bad, but I'll tell you its way better now this is the most fun I've had in years I can't stop playing! I'm sure ill have hundred of hours into this game! I recommend you get it. it took me a few hours to understand how everything works but after everything clicked together I cant stop playing."
Positive,"A great MMO RPG to play when the game works. But that's a rare case. (I said that in 2018 when i started playing this game. And now I'll give the review of current state. I'll still keep positive review as it was in 2018 because I always loved the game. But I feel there is something missing in 2023, there is a lack of will from the devs to keep the game in a good condition. It's not that they never tried, they said they've got themselves new servers which worked for few months. In the end, devs only work for new players and abandoned it's old payers. Then comes money, they want to charge you a lot of money for everything but they give you a very little effort. The new chapters are just copy paste of their old contents and they doomed the game with their latest chapter. It is pure disappointment when you see they keep charging you money but they've 0 effort to make something new for you to try. Then comes crown crates and the mounts. Most of the mounts are the same thing just new skin and they keep charging you for that in a way where you've to spend thousands of dollars sometimes, because it's gambling. You keep buying crates until you get a mount or you get enough crown gem to buying those radiant mounts. Yes, buying a new skin for your mount might not seem bad, like in most fps game they sell weapon skins. And I don't find it wrong, but the mount skin in ESO is different. Overall I had fun for a while in this game. But after Covid 19 pandemic the game started dying slowly in PvP. And the lack of new PvE content made me quit the game. Also I've lost all my friends in this game over the time because people lost faith in the dev team. So I had to quit the game too. I'll always remember the good time in this game and as I said my review is still positive. Also if you think I'm quitting because i was afraid to spend money to have some quality time in a game, then you're wrong, I bought all the chapters during pre purchase to get those cute little mounts and what not. Then there was Necrom, I found it as waste of money, so end of the day I quit buying anymore chapters.)"
Positive,fantastic yknowmsayin haha yea baby
Positive,Nice MMORPG!!! :)
Positive,"Before I begin, I must get this off my chest. This game is made by ZENIMAX! For those who are constantly complaining that it isn't like all the other Elder Scrolls games, you are right. TO A POINT! Yes, the Elder Scrolls games previously were single-player games. However, when you see Elder Scrolls ONLINE as well as tags that say MMO; that means it's going to be different. This game is different from many other MMOs in terms of combat and overall questing. So for someone to get angered that this game isn't a ""good MMO,"" you just haven't tried one like this. If you are a real fan of the Elder Scrolls series you would support this game, regardless of what type of game it may be. Now, for the actual review. This game has kept me interested since the original launch. I didn't pick it up until this last Christmas, however, because of the numerous reports of bugs. Once I did start playing I haven't been able to put it down,  because this is exactly what I want in my MMOs. I have played WoW and just didn't feel a connection like the one I have formed for ESO. The community, as small as it may be, is so relaxed and friendly that I enjoy logging in everyday.  I absolutely love this game and will continue to support it because I am interested in what Zenimax has planned for the future. Am I dissapointed that it isn't a single-player like Skyrim? Yes, but until another game comes out; I am very happy with playing this."
Positive,"so i have play this game for hundred of hours and let me tell you some of my reviewGameplaythe most interesting about ESO is that it plays different from your usual MMO, the quest and gameplay is what makes this game far better than any other MMO, first of all the battle is action battle, where you need to repositioning yourself, evade enemies attack, dodge, shielding all active you need to be quick on your wits which makes the gameplay even cooler. second the quest... oh god i love the quest, the voice acting everything you can get from an elder scrolls game is presented here the quest itself is far more fun and depths if compared with your usual MMO which makes it one of the best MMO with its questing systemGraphicsfor graphics, it has outstanding feature, the graphic character have a combination between cartoony and real which is a unique features. additioanlly all of the effect are top notch. however what makes this game different is because the world graphic are beautiful (remember it is an MMO) for standard MMO the graphic are beautiful, you will feel like in real tamriel continent with all of the vegetation, people, creature and so onSoundWell, the sound are one of the main point of this game, the sound is beautiful soundtrack given are perfect for each world and theme we are in the game. it gives us an epic feeling which is a great plus for an MMOConclusionIt is a beautiful and well made game, i am really confused on why some people saying this game is bad because as an elder scrolls player from morrowind, oblivion and skyrim (not yet try dagerfall, arena, battlespire and redguard) i feel the game is perfect it has its own personality like any other elder scrolls game which play different from each other. so my conclusion is buy this game!! buy it and feel the adventure you on tamriel continent :), and it is recomended to purchase this when there is a discount so you can also get the latest expansion as well"
Positive,"It is an absolutely amazing game, but DO NOT BUY IT FROM STEAM!! Steam has login issues constantly, buy the game from its own website and you can actually log in and play."
Positive,"Hopefully this review should answer a bunch of questions a lot of people I've talked to have asked (and even me myself) about the game's content and quality. Skip to the end if you just want a star rating if the descriptions are TL;DR.SCALE: First of all, the game is absolutely gigantic. I've been in-game for about 400 hours so far and am not even a third (maybe not even a quarter) of the way through the questing alone. The quests are slightly less in-depth than those of, say, Skyrim, but if you don't try and skip through there is easily about 40-50 hours of questing for every single region (which is somewhat equivalent in size to skyrim's holds for another skyrim comparison)MULTIPLAYER VS SINGLEPLAYER: Another piece to touch on, and a critical one for many at that, is that while the game IS technically an MMO, aside from certain topics (which I will get to later) the game is really less of a multiplayer game you play with other people, but a singleplayer game that other people happen to be playing as well. In things like questing, exploring, etc, other players are nothing but a slight nuisance, occasionally tearing their way through farming a quest while I try and play through the story and take it slowly.GAMEPLAY: the game offers quite a large range in terms of gameplay. A few popular things you can do (and spend your entire time doing with minimal issue) are questing, trading, crafting, doing PVP, fishing (yes, fishing.), and simply collecting and completionism. All of those gameplay styles don't really interfere with the other, and you can easily do any and all with minimal issue. MULTIPLAYER CONTENT: Getting back to what I touched on earlier... so what IS the multiplayer content? Primarily PVP, Dungeon-delving, and guilds. For the first, the PVP is a sort of faction design. There are 3 ""teams"" you can join (although they don't really majorly affect your gameplay because of your particular choice) and you are put in one of a number of different campaigns mostly centered on group teamwork. While higher-level campaigns have a habit of being fairly salty, the low-level campaign's players (in my experience) are relatively welcoming and friendly. As for group dungeons and such, it's much the same. You group up with a handful of other players (usually 4) to go into a dungeon and kill monsters and do a quest together. Unfortunately, because of the lack of attention to levels, many of my early experiences were me entering a dungeon for the first time while high-level players blazed a trail through it, ignoring the quest and skipping entire sections of dialogue, and I found myself miles behind them trying to follow the quest as quickly as I could. As long as you can deal with any hope of players caring about the lore and storye being completely crushed, they're relatively entertaining and offer some nice rewards. Lastly, guilds are probably the least contentious thing here for me, at least. They're places for you to meet friends, do trading, organize groups to fight in the alliance war. You don't need to do any of that, though. There's a guild for whatever you'd want, so if you just want to talk with people and ask questions for instance, there's quite a few such guilds floating around for you to join.LORE & STORY: Okay, there is definitely some significant opposition from players as to the content. Let me try to dispel that as well as I can. ESO doesn't COMPLETELY get rid of lore and things. I'm quite familiar with the lore myself as a member of a major Skyrim modding project for the last 2 years, and the game has so far attempted to remain faithful to the dot where it was capable of doing so. Some have argued that the war between alliances is contrived, but to be fair, the game does attempt a fairily fleshed out backstory for their existence, and quite well explores all of the points of contention with established lore and actually does put quite a bit of work into explaining them. For instance, in ESO, the argonians are allied with the dunmer under the Ebonheart Pact, despite the latter having enslaved the former up to that point. And quite faithfully, they discuss the lingering racism and distrust between the two parties being hesitantly sandwiched together. That's just an example, but it should give an indication to ESO's attention to detail to make sure people can't gripe too much about itTECH SUPPORT & BUGS: Here's the real doozy, and most of why recent reviews have been mixed. Unfortunately for whatever reason, ESO's Steam support is less than ideal, with the game being completely down for steam users about 1-10% of the time. If anything, you should buy the game directly from the website, where failure is much less common and lets you not waste your day trying to log in.PREMIUM/BONUS CONTENT: Okay. yes, the game has premium content, expansions ,etc. I've seen people run away simply because of its inclusion of it, but just because it exists the game isn't automatically rendered horrible. The primary kind (and the kind I imagine gets bought most) would be the DLCs... often just a couple extra dungeons, but occasionally entire new regions, or even large expansions (""chapters"") with the minor ones usually only being a couple of dollars. The game is completely playable without them, so they are true bonus content rather than withheld basic features. Secondary content is mostly aesthetic, from various followers to different mounts to ride around on. My point is, if you buy the base game, you will not be wanting at all for the premium content, and will be more at your leisure to buy it.FINAL RATINGS:SCALE: ★★★★★MULTIPLAYER VS SINGLEPLAYER: Multiplayer is optional, you can play the entire game by yourselfGAMEPLAY:★★★★☆MULTIPLAYER CONTENT:★★★☆☆LORE & STORY:★★★★★TECH SUPPORT:★☆☆☆☆ (on steam) ★★★☆☆ (in general)PREMIUM CONTENT: Not at all necessary for a fun and fulfilling game experience."
Positive,"do not play without friends its boring and confusing as hell!  its best to join a guild to help you out and make new friends then playing this solo, becuase ESO is just 100% like any other MMO out there just with a skyrim theme.i do recommend this game even tho i might never play it again, but i wish you luck."
Positive,I have tried and tried with this game since 2015 on the Xbox One to 2017 on the PS4 and I have to say that now currently in 2021 on the PC I am officially hooked. I can't believe how long I've ignored this game / didn't play it long enough to give it a chance. There's an abundance of things to do and so much to explore that you'll never run out of content to do. I appreciate all the updates they continue to provide (especially the new player reward system and skill recommendations). My main MMORPG is FFXIV and I haven't been able to enjoy the genre outside of it until now. Thank you Zenimax Online Studios.
Positive,"Masterly TES game to experience Tamriel on MMO platform. Become a part of strong community and start your legendary journey. The game offers level up, skills, craft materials, mount, pet, daily rewards, DLC, paid membership, game event and many more content. I highly recommend this game for rpg lovers.Also No Subscription required to play that's makes it more satisfying . You are always welcome whenever you want to play."
Positive,"You had me at ""no subcsription required""  <3"
Positive,"Ok i don´t usually write reviews about any game but still i think this one desserves alittle time from me to explain you guys why this MMO its so unique and fun.Ok a certain clarification about this game, this isn't skyrim and its not gonna be 100% like it that or any elder scrolls game, although it doesn´t mean its a bad thing, it take some elements from previous elder scrolls game and adapt them to the MMO style it should have since its a Massive Multiplayer Online game!Lets start by inmersion, they really do a good job on this aspect of the game, you find public world bosses and certain events called dolmen scattered around all the map, it has collectibles and resources for your crafting jobs as well so it encourages that you explore around their beatiful made maps, for every faction i must say it takes roughly 150+ hours to complete theese maps and they are beginning to add more content to the game so it doesnt end that quickly.Ok this is no ordinary mark target then spell cast MMO you are used to, it´s combat system its kinda unique it reminds me a bit of Tera online but way better, you have 2 bars where you can allocate certain spells that you intent to make part of your specialised build, certain spells are actually skill shots or require you to be targetting the mob with your camera so its not the usual jump and spam buttons from other MMOs, in dungeons and in pvp positioning is actually key for your success, and not only that you can actually block and dodge (dodge roll) spells to minimize their effect on you, its more action based without skipping the RPG because depending the way you built theese bars affects hugely the play style of your characters, you have a really big skill tree where you can allocate like 300 skill points in crafting passives,combat passives, weapon passives and actives, and 4 direrent classes each with 3 skill sets actives and passives as well. It´s really flexible to do a really original build ive seen crazy builds like sorcerer healers or tanks etc it really lets you do really personalized stuff. AND NO not only that! when you reach end game you unlock a thing called Championship System where you unlock points every certain exp amount that you can allocate within a really wide skill tree that looks alike skyrim tree (theese are passive skills) to tweak your character to your own needs.Dungeon wise it has a really big spam of dungeons around 15 or more dungeons each with unique boss fights and mechanics and around 10 more End game dungeons, 3 trials (raids), so its kinda hard to get bored specially on the endgame dungeons since they require skilled players to beat, also you have with the DLCs are big solo player Arena and a huge PVPVE map where you have a hybrid of story and pvp.Talking about PvE it has a really really big map where you fight for the dominance between the 3 factions available, with diferent mechanics, you can even use siege weapons to break down walls on Forts and so (i don´t wanna talk much about it because i dont wanna spoil the fun of seeing it for yourself).In conclusion this game it´s a gem specially for thoose who are TES games fans, no its not a pure TES game but it uses a lot of it´s elements, and also players who just want to play a MMO can be delighted with it, specially if you are bored of the same usual MMO."
Positive,Played the beta and found that it wasn't my cup of tea.  Played again after the relaunch and the buy-to-play model and I am SO glad I did.  This feels like multiplayer Skyrim and I'm loving it.
Positive,"The best MMO on the market, no doubt. especially if you are an Elder Scrolls fan. 9/10"
Positive,Games not even that good
Positive,"I am new to this game, i am a wow player.I bought this game in hope for something better than wow, i've found it!This game beats wow's ass in my opinion.Best mmo right now, story interesting, quests (alot of quests), you never run out of stuff to do.. etc... etc...And heck yeah i recommend this game!!"
Positive,"As a huge fan of The Elder Scrolls Series I would highly recommand this one. GET IT! NOW! Great game 9/10 for everything it has, good graphics, gameplay, unique skills system, life skills(blacksmith, potion maker, cuisine, ect...) and definitly the quests and story! If you like The Elder Scrolls games than you should buy this one and try it out there's a ton of sales."
Positive,"I came from WoW years ago so I have some baseline as to what to expect from an MMO. It can be very daunting if you have never played one before because there is so much to learn.I have had sufficient fun without any DLC or subscription, simply grinding on my own and using the dungeon finder. I find the story is a little more immersive than WoW due to how it is presented up close to the NPC's when speaking with them and the text is large. The combat mechanics are more dynamic than WoW as well. The crafting is a little more complex and interesting than WoW and are not limited to how many professions you want to take up. There is no Auction House but there are Guild Merchants that are essentially the same thing.Downsides I have noticed are the limited buttons allowed in the action bar, it has led me to focus on not as many varying skills in the skill tree. Not being able to inspect other players' gear is pretty lame. This may just be me but I have a hard time distinguishing the classes/races when seeing other players. I feel that in WoW it was more distinct. Overall I would recommend this game. I got it for $10 during the Summer Sale and I think it is normally only $20. No subscription needed to enjoy the content."
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online is a Great MMO which you can play Solo without a problem due to rich content and massive story line. Every Quests in Game and NPC's have  solid voice acting.Combat and Class/Skill/Crafting/Gear system are very detailed., It might  become complex at start for beginners, but there are nice community websites out there to figure out the mechanics.  There are guilds for beginners  with members willingly to give you information about your class and game. (At least on NA, i can confirm).There are tons of Cosmetic items, houses,customes and many more you can have, if you are into that stuff.  Highly recommend it , if you like  RPG Genre.  This is one of the few MMO's you can both enjoy solo or together with others.Also is one of the few MMO's again you can  play as casual player or competitive.No matter what, you won't feel you were  lagged behind even if you have limited time  due to work or any reason.  There is adaptive level scaling, therefor you can play with your High Level friends in Normal Dungeons and Delves- World without being useless.  With this system , you can easily find groups for Normal Dungeons even if you are low level.If you like  Skyrim -Elder Scrolls World, you'll be at Home in  ESO."
Positive,"Takes too much time to get to end game, but otherwise good."
Positive,"Played Beta for a week. 0/10Picked it back up on a bored, impulsive purchase. 11/10 Would impulse again.No really, it got good. Damn good."
Positive,"It's not just a game, like a friend I love to visit from time to time."
Positive,"When this game first came out it really disappointed me, it was hardly an MMO and hardly an Elder Scrolls game. When it went B2P I figured I'd try it again.Wow am I impressed with how much better this game as gotten.Combat is really fun and satisfyingThe mechanics of the gameplay blew me away.A lvl10 dungeon was funner than any other MMO experience I've had, and it really suprised me"
Positive,"great game, i used to play skyrim all the time.this game has a lot of similarities to skyrim and has gotten a lot better over the years, this game still continues to grow and they're is always something new to come back to when i haven't played in awhile.9/10"
Positive,"I can only judge this game as one of the few games I've played entirely with a friend.  I've LVLed almost entire alongside my friend, so with I must say that Elder Scrolls Online, compared to other MMOs in it's field, has a long ways to go.  Its been an entirely joyous adventure creating my character, whether it be an assassin, mage, or warlock, Ive done this with ONE character.No other MMO has let me customize, and build up a character, scratch that direction, and keep my fella and build him up to be something else.The 15 monthly is the biggest problem in the back of my mind, Id hate to abandon ship and leave this awesome character because of something so trivial as a subscription, but there are some other issues to blame as well.The foundation that Bethesda has shipped this game out on is bland, the bank is interesting, but if you dont know anyone that is a part of a good guild that deposits items in the guild bank...Good luck.  The Dungeon system is a joke, youll spend hours trying to find takers to your cat calls for people to unite, only for them to drop out midway through.  Nope, in this age of instant gratification there are NO LFGs, so onto the map.The map so far has to be where my bipolar mix emtions reside.  The beginners island was just that, the post secondary island is a chaotic mess of missions and horses(ohh yeah horses are annoying, they are still the MMO moster trucks much like Skyrim, so at least you have that similarity going for you SKYRIM fanboys)There are always issues with this game in regards to errors, either you cant see your group for periods that span a quest, or a whole guild quest is lost because you left s portal by clicking the exit beyond the portal itself(ive totally lost out on the mage guild), to put it short its clunky, youll get used to it, but its still not worth charging someone monthly.  Thats a place in gaming for the golden goose, there is not two or three, gaming should be highlander style, there can be only one.  If you dont meet that bar yet, dont ask the same dedication from your fan base.(But in the age of corporatism, its now or never)Back to the game...No, the maps are pretty much quest whoring left and right, with no real purpose other than to make your head spin around and never do anything short of confuse you with why you care.  And the storyline is based on such a boring monotonous story, Ive hardly persued it at all, but no need for popcorn so far.  The land is beautiful in Bethesda's sharp texturey sorta way, but it plateaus, you spend alot of time skipping the reason Elder Scrolls is so cool.  The quests are boring, they are voice acted, but who cares when you would rather not read or hear them in the first place.  But back to the scenery, so far the towns are the meat and potatoes of the traveling, but when youve seem one camp or cave, youve pretty much seen them all.Again, the character you develope is as emmersive as you will ever get and its great to been linked what ive created so far, that part is amazing, but on solo times I get the time to really analyze the game to its full potential, and thats when I start to ask for more.  People that are supporting this game deserve more than a Beta, they arent calling it that, and they sure as hell arent charging for that.70%"
Positive,"Okay where do I start.I discovered the elder scroll games from the most popular one, skyrim which like many other fans, i enjoyed it thoroughly.that being said, I came to expect a certain degree of fun from elder scrolls online, which I was not disappointed.The overall gameplay of the game is pretty similar to that of other mmorpgs, the only difference is, the stamina bar that regulates how much you can run, also allows you to use attacks. which is a very unwise choice for gameplay, you will find yourself running out of stamina just from sprinting, and if you are attacked, unless you have a magic weapon as a back up, you are pretty much doomed because all your basic attacks derive from your stamina bar, much like skyrim.The graphics of the game are extremely beautiful  on high settings, they are definitely not the best they could be, but pretty decent all the same.The controls for the game feel extremely restricting, I find myself getting aggravated very quickly because i can only have 5 attacks on a hot key list but i need way more just to do some basic things, and the fact that i can't assign more then 5 attacks makes it very annoying, somebody that came from another very popular mmorpg (wow )and is used to macros and specialized keybindings will find this game... somewhat inept and pretty poorly made.the voice over (for npcs and what not) is pretty well done and they are improving the npc's and players graphics features such as facial animations to make them more realistic and natural. which is pretty cool.pvp: I personally have not been able to get far into pvp yet, but ive been doing quite a bit of research, from what i've read and seen, if you like pvp, this game is perfect for you.dungeons: n/a will update at later timepve: can be pretty annoying due to the fact of stamina issues, but never a loss for something to kill.quests: tons of quests but most of them are not very interesting, over half are, walk here kill this walk there open this... i would like more quests with puzzles or bosses with specialized moves, or at least a interesting story to it.membership and game base price, this game is pretty expensive, and if you were lucky enough to land 6 months of membership before they removed it, can be a big price tag upfront, i would recommend you by this game if its on sale, the membership is pretty expensive (15 bucks or something a month) and will quickly add up. gameplay: pretty common, 5/10sound and graphics: very well done and impressive. 9/10storyline: uninteresting 5/10game price: pretty expensive, doesn't feel like it offers alot at first. 2/10pvp: HELL YES 10/10pve: pretty challenging but overall annoying because of stamina 6/10all in all: for a mmo-rpg this game doesn't give you alot of ""unique"" things and it feels pretty generic, if it didn't have the elder scrolls fanbase working for it, and a killer pvp.... then i would not recomend this game, but since it does. i would give this game at base price 6/10 and if you can get it on sale 8/10."
Positive,"Overall this is a MMO that will ask for your time. If you love the Elder Scrolls lore and know the Elder Scrolls game for more than Skyrim this won't be a bad way to spend some time. The game has many classes and different way to play them and a vast world to use them in and content to clear. With that being said I can see how this isn't for everyone but as a huge Elder Scrolls nerd with tons of lore and content to see this was worth it for me.Pros:+ Controller support.+ Fun and balanced class system. (Pick whoever you want with some basic RPG knowledge you will make a character capable of playing the game easy.+ Massive map and world to see.+ The ability to add some Add-Ons is really nice and kinda needed to get the best experience. Cons:- While the maps are massive they don't have tons of great things to do in a good chunk of the maps out side of overland content like world bosses ect.- Expect to play a lot before you get a grasp on the game but again it is a MMO. (Not a game for someone without time to invest i'd say.)- You need ESO Plus to get the full best time in this game, while this is a con you can tally it up like a monthly WoW sub that you don't have to have but should if you're gonna play the game a fair amount."
Positive,"For the gold edition:Definetly worth the money as you get a mount which is really useful in the start of your journeys.You also get 500 in the crown store which can help you with the starters pack that contains really useful items for leveling up fast & getting a taste of what it's like later in the game when you have lots of items.For the game:I've always loved the elder scrolls series, even though this one doesn't follow the same lore as bethesdas it's still really fun to play & when you grind multiple hours with endless of fun.Combat system is amazing, it's the best one i know in any MMO."
Positive,"This review is a bit outdated, since it's based on before 1.6 patch.1.6. patch removed sub fees, added crown store and added justice system and champion system into the game. It also made many tiny areas of the game a lot better, such as animations and provisioning has now better named items, and yes you can fish yourself a meal now. This review still matches my opinion about the game, but now the game feels -a lot better- than back when I wrote this review originally.----I honestly don't understand why people hate on it so much. As an Elder Scrolls fan who loves the crap out of Morrowind, this seems like a fair MMO in TES world. I like it, the exploration is fun and no restrictions when it comes to building a character, apart of the class skillset. For example, you can make a heavy armor sorcerer who uses bows. Silly and cool combinations can be made. You can also play as a brawler, but they don't have weapon skills. You just gotta rely on your fists with that one. Combat is tons of fun, I see myself doing it a lot instead of trying to avoid it like in some MMO's. Justice system is great fun and adds thievery in ESO. I suggest reading more about it from the ESO website. This game is also a lot more immersive than other MMO's I've played.What I could complain about is the default interface is a bit clunky, but luckily community has made some mods that solve the problem really well (thank you UI mod support!) Then there's also the blatant ""shortcuts"" and other lore-breaking stuff in the game, that come up at some points, but I'm enjoying the gameplay a lot so they don't bother me that much. (The three pacts thing is a bit silly but considering it was made because of PvP I understand it.) Cyrodiil PvP can be a bit laggy sometimes, or thats what I've heard from North American players. As an EU player I haven't really seen any lag in Cyrodiil at all, but this is something no-one can predict.Otherwise, I love the rest of the game: Combat, exploration, modability, quests.. In retail copies I've seen ""Exploration Pack"" codes which let you make any race in any alliance, but they might come with this too. Those codes can be bought from Crown store, too. Crown store is basically cash shop, but I haven't seen any pay 2 win crap there, only costumes and skins for mounts.Keep in mind, the game is primarly an MMO, within TES universe. The gameplay is somewhat same as in other games, but still, in the core, it's an MMO and people shouldn't expect it to be like Skyrim.Oh, be prepared for the 50 gb download! For some people it wasn't an issue, but for someone who doesn't have a good internet it WILL take a while. But for me it was worth the wait. If this can be an issue for you, get yourself a retail copy. :)"
Positive,91 gigabyte update/10
Positive,"As an MMORPG is awesome. People who are looking for an Elder scrolls please go and get an actual Elder Scrolls, ths is an MMO:D"
Positive,"good and fun game, lots of things to do and people to meet"
Positive,"Very good game. There are alot of DLCs, but that doesnt make it bad."
Positive,"One day, a wise man introduce me into this game. ""it shall protect your virginity, my lad"" he said.Not many people speak your language.Not many people play well.Not many people talk nicely.Not many people work as a team.But if you find people that do...You'll have the most fun you've ever had.It's like an unhealthy one-way relationship. Like, you have invested so much time and energy to making things work, but somehow you're never good enough and it is always your fault. You still love them though.."
Positive,"I love being able to explore a world space that is near and dear to my heart. There is SO much lore to learn in this world and the quests are mostly nice and interesting. I'm pretty picky about the aesthetics of games I play, being able to run around with beautiful surroundings is always a plus in my book; ESO exceeded my expectations. I recently got my partner to start playing as well (he was not interested for the last 2 years I've played) and now we get to play together sometimes which makes me really happy :3But no game is perfect, inventory (and bank) space is limited, even with upgrades. I gather constantly while I'm running around and my inventory very quickly filled up. If you want to have crafting materials available to you anytime you will need to get ESO+.To me personally the WORST part about ESO is that its NOT cross-platform and your account does not carry over. I originally started on PS4 then XBOX, and now I am playing on the computer. If I didn't love this world, l lore or characters I've met (i love razum dar and pacrooti sends the funniest mail) starting over this many times would probably dissuade a few newer players; especially if they don't have the same console as their friends who play. But that doesn't mean multiplayer is lame because there are SOOO many guilds and I've met so many friendly people! (don't let a few bad ones ruin your overall experience)This was supposed to just be a simple review but it almost looks like a love letter.. Oh well, if you're new definitely give it a chance!"
Positive,"I am huge fan of fantasy games/mmorpg,  I have played so many before and I gonna be honest here, when I play teso it's make me feel like I am part of a movie such as Lord of the Rings and similar movies, I never felt like this in any of the games I have played, it's awesome the freedom u have in game, you can be thief, but if guards catch you, u better run or pay for everything u have stole, the quests and dialoguem make you wanna finish it cause u wanna see what gonna happen it's like a novel, the class and skills system is huge, I am sure the % to find someone with similar build is realy hard, the graphics and music is 10/10, I have played in beta and comparing beta with currently game patch,  it's like another game, it's so polished, the combat is so clean and soft, the skills animations  is awesome...  The game have cash shop inside,  all items is about fashions / mount,  there's no items can interfere in the game play,  or make it more fast... It's b2p, no Montly subscribe, for a huge content game with expansions it's very very cheap price, the new expansion is coming and one of the features will be housing system, can't wait for that, if you like fantasy game with deep craft system, lots of quests,  freedom to do that u want even kill npc, balanced pvp,  huge pve path, dungeons, faction war, mature and friendly community, lots of different gears that make u not gonna look similar with others players, no p2w game...  Seriously buy it fast."
Positive,"I have traditionally hated most MMOs. I started trying them with Ultima Online in 1997. I played for one month before getting bored. Everquest? Hated it. World of Warcraft? Could't catch my interesting. All of this free-to-play nonsense? Too full of whiny children.But something is different about Elder Scrolls Online. I've played it more than almost any other game in my library, and I doubt I'm going to stop anytime soon. It's very engaging. I almost feel like I'm playing a single-player RPG that just happens to have some other players in it. And that's great!The amazing amount of content in this game is staggering. At 127 hours played, I have not even finished one-third of the main game yet. The stories are reasonably well written, and the quest structure typically falls outside of the standard MMO faire of ""go kill 10 wolves"" (though there are a few quests like this). There are various player choices to be made, as well, that have minor effects on the game world.But it isn't all roses. The built-in UI is woefully inadequate and requires a smattering of add-ons to make it really useable. There are quite a few bugs left in the game (though the support forums show they're fairly quick to address). And some of the choices are very imbalanced (see, for instance, the Mages Guild quest line).Overall, I highly recommend this game. If you are a fan of RPGs at all, you should find some enjoyment here."
Positive,"This game very much rivals LOTRO and games of the like. Extremely detailed and accurate to previous mechanics and design of The Elder Scrolls games. Pets, Mounts, Crafting, Upgrades, LARGE map, Guilds (Multiplayer and in-game), Character choices and customization, Races, and All the NPC's TALK (an extraordinary feature in an MMORPG).  You really feel immersed in this MMORPG as opposed to others.... almost as if you bought a single player RPG game. Yet, it's not that. The storyline is just so capturing and the gameplay is very fluid. Spending money on new features for your character and gameplay experience is not necessary in the slightest, nor do you feel like you are missing out on anything if you don't. However, spending money can be a little tempting if you are a super picky player that wants all the bells and whistles. (Unecessary bells and whistles, mind you.)"
Positive,"Now that the monthly subscription fees have been done away with, this game is well worth the price of admission. LOTS of content here. The quests and story feel like classic Elder Scrolls but the gameplay is a blend of Elder Scrolls and typical MMO. There are a very few fetch quests peppered here and there but the majority of quests are all unique and interesting. The voice acting is great. There really is no ""grinding"" involved. I play primarily in first person and there are times when it really does feel like I am playing Oblivion or Skyrim.  My only real gripe is that I wish they had a ""hide helmet"" toggle and the ability to sit in chairs, sleep in beds, and an easier access to other weapon and armor styles."
Positive,Server and Updates appear more stable - So I'm more willing to recommend this game.
Positive,It is a good MMORPG if you like questing and exploring around. It still has some annoying bug but it's a good product overall.
Positive,"I've only got a level 8 character, so I'm quite early on. Still, I'm enjoying this game. It's the least MMO-ey MMO I've played, but it *is* an MMO. If you enjoyed something from Skyrim, it's probably in this game too. I don't think there are many people that liked Skyrim that won't enjoy this. This does play differently, but not necessarily worse.I had a few questions going into this game, so I'm going to answer them for anyone interested. More detailed explanations are below.Q. Can you sneak?A. Yes.Q. Can you steal stuff?A. Yes.Q. Can you pickpocket?A. Yes.Q. Can you break into people's houses?A. Yes.Q. Can I assassinate random civilians?A. Yes.Q. How's the combat?A. Pretty good. Melee combat is arguably better than in Skyrim -- it actually feels like you're *hitting* the enemies. Everything else is at least as-good or better-than Skyrim.Q. Can you summon weapons (""Bound Sword"", etc.)?A. Not that I know of.Q. Can you be a vampire or werewolf?A. I think so, but I believe it's a late-game thing.Q. Can I play co-op with my friends?A. If you all start a character at the same time, and only play on those characters together, then yes. Once anyone's completed a quest, they can't do it again. So you have to all go through the same quests at the same time if you don't want to get split up. Co-op doesn't change the game much. It won't get much more interesting, you'll just be going through it together.Q. Can you do co-op stealth?A. Sort of, but not really. If you're like me and what you want is Skyrim's stealth but co-op, with cool interesting strategies involving distracting people with arrows, silent-casting spell traps, etc. then I'm sorry to say this isn't it. (Stay hype for Tamriel Online, though). I think if you have 2-player co-op and both do stealth-archer, you could *pretend* you were playing co-op Skyrim for a little while. But at some point you'll just have to accept that the game considers stealth and combat to be completely separate things. That doesn't mean it's not fun, but it's unfortunately not Splinter Cell: Tamriel Unlimited™.Q. How does sneaking work?A. Basically like in Skyrim, but sloppier. It's hard to explain. Since it's an MMO, everything's a little bigger, and a little laggier. So it's harder to feel like you're being ""precise"" when you sneak around. You'll also have to accept the fact that while you're sneaking around a town or dungeon, other players will be running around doing things nearby. Mechanically, you can still pull the ""sneak around the pillar"" trick and other classics, but in general sneaking is only useful outside of combat, for stealing and stuff. For combat, you'll usually land a sneak attack, then be perma-detected, and forced to run in swords-blazing.Q. How does stealing work?A. Stealing from containers works as expected -- random loot is in the container. Stealing from the world is different. You won't find a ""Glass Dagger of Flames"" sitting on the ground, you'll find a ""Dagger"". When you take it, you'll get a random dagger drop which is marked as stolen.Q. How does picking pockets work?A. Rather than poking through someone's inventory, you have a % chance to get a random item from the person. Different sorts of people have different sorts of items (e.g., guards, farmers, noblemen, etc.).Q. Is being a dirty thief boring, or a waste of time?A. No, not really. It's harder and less engaging than in Skyrim, and the world generally has less stuff to steal, but it's not unrewarding. Stealing stuff regularly can net you quite a bit of money, at least early on.Q. How does murdering civilians work?A. People respawn. You'll sometimes see people standing over their own dead body, which is one of the more surreal things in the game.Q. How does crime get punished?A. You have a bounty, and ""heat"". Heat wears off quickly, and bounty wears off slowly. These are in the same bar, and bounty acts like ""minimum heat"". There are two markers in the bar. If your heat+bounty is past the first marker, guards will give you the ""STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM"" spiel when they see you. You can pay your bounty and surrender your stolen items on the spot to reset to 0, or run away. Running away is a crime and adds bounty.If you go past the second marker, guards will attack you on sight. I've never been killed by a guard, but I've been caught a lot. In general you'll get caught a lot more than in Skyrim. To reset your bounty without forfeiting your stolen items, you can pay your bounty to a fence, or wait somewhere until it wears off. Bounty wears off while logged out, so you can go on massive crime sprees before you logout for the day, if you like.---Hopefully that answered some of your questions. If I remember any more, I'll update this.I do recommend this game, though. It's often on sale for $20, so get it at that if you're interested."
Positive,Best MMO ever......
Positive,it is pretty
Positive,"This is enormously better than it was from when I was in beta and said all those awful things (albeit all of them were true; the game WAS horrible). It went a long way since. In fact, I'm quite certain it would score 85-90% should it be re-evaluated as it is now by review outlets. Mind you it's not completely reminescent of the a real ES experience: it lacks the freeform exploration and self narative from the offline series (amongst other things). But it's really rather fun and doesn't feel like WoW with a Tamriel skin anymore, as it was just a year ago.For the record, I picked the game up on March 19th 2015, and I hadn't played since the fiasco of the closed beta (and had barely played then; I just couldn't find it in me to even start the game)."
Positive,"best mmoRPG game so far, buy it now it doesnt matter how much it cost just buy it!8.9/10"
Positive,Honestly its the only gam on earth that i feel sfe to say that i cum to that shit
Positive,"Awsome game, played since the game started in the free weekends, just bought it and its simply amazing! skyrim online, extended crafting, realtime sieges and battles. BIG ASS monsters to small monsters, justice system is awsome, fencing,thieving,assasinating, overall a great game with alot to do!"
Positive,Like Fallout with magic and swords! Like Skyrim with friends! Don't have friends? Neither do I. It's still fun to play solo. Tons of content and on sale for $9.99 a lot of the time.Edit: I now have friends and it's still fun to play. Also it's usually on sale for $7.99 now. Would continually recommend.
Positive,skyrim 2 is big fun
Positive,"10/10 would sell my soul and all of my time to get the ""Master Thief"" role again"
Positive,"This game is so underrated, it's all because of pay to play. That was removed. This game is awesome, especially if you're into Elder Scrolls. I reccomend purchasing it."
Positive,One of the BEST games in the world
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is a remarkable MMORPG that keeps the essence of the original series. It plays very differently from traditional MMOs in the sense that there are not quest hubs. This means that it is up to you to find and explore and by doing so level up. The combat is fantastic, there are no cool down timers. It is up to you to dodge, block, interrupt, cast, heal.Being able to play in first person adds immersion. The graphics are fantastic. All quest texts are voiced."
Positive,"Fantastic game - I'm a huge MMO fan and have been playing MMO's since WoW back in 2004. Elder Scrolls Online's newer quests from their newer content Morrowind, Clockwork City, Orsiniuim, Dark Brother Hood have such Incredible quest lines that sometimes you don't feel like you're playing an MMO.From a purely Questing and Lore perspective there really isn't anything out there that's this rich and deep. I would still say that WoW's end game raiding is slightly better but ESO's world and quests are soooooo good"
Positive,"As someone who was recently diagnosed with a terminal illness and given less than a year to live, I'm incredibly grateful to have played TES Online before my time runs out. This game is a true masterpiece, with every aspect, from the gameplay to the atmosphere and graphics, expertly crafted.I highly recommend it to anyone who loves immersive and engaging gaming experiences. Thank you to the developers for creating such a fantastic game that has given me joy and excitement during a difficult time."
Positive,People apparently have problems with downlaoding it from steam... wtf...everything works perfectly fine for me.In general I really love this game it's just amazing.GET IT IF YOU WANT A NICE MMORPG WITH A THE ELDER SCOLLS FEELING
Positive,"Positives:  Consumer friendly (you can have full access to what you purchase without a subscription), flexible and balanced mixture of classes and roles to choose from, big world to explore, lots of different PvE situations to not have yourself get bored with it, no pay to win, s-tier housing for those who like itNegatives:  CPU-driven game, memory issues (might flood your CPU after extensive playing hours), wouldn't suggest for a PvP experience (game is mostly catered to PvE), new content always comes with an overpowered amount of sets to increase attraction then the sets get nerfed down (still though you can create good builds without them)Overall my suggestion to a new player would be to buy just the base game for a good while and after they have explored most of it, they can go ahead and purchase whatever expansions and DLCs they want or even get the subscription, but first test with the base game. Trust me, it takes a lot of time to discover the world! :)"
Positive,"If you played Elder Scrolls series before, you will like ESO (Elder Scrolls Online) for sure. Most of the aspects in this game is like Elder Scrolls series like gameplay , fighting styles and etc. Experiencing this game with my friends is making this game more enjoyable for me and I highly recommend you to do that. I think classes and races in this game is one of the most interesting part that you should pay attention to that to create your character and in-game role wisely although in other Elder Scrolls races has little differences. At last I wanna say it is a memorable experience for me although I don't play a lot these days and hope you will find ESO interesting just as I did."
Positive,"The graphics with outstanding colors, soundtrack and fast paced, visually stunning fights are just the beggining of ESO...kind invitation to the huge world full of secrets, conspiracies and mysteries wrapped up in thick plot of well written storyline.There is no chance you get bored here, you can follow the story or you can just start your own adventure.Whenever you go you'll find quests, treasure maps waiting to be decipher ,hidden chest that need to be unlocked etc,etc.Everything that bugged me in Skyrim no longer exist here!!!Don't mind what people say about microtransaction: You can only get mounts, pets, cosmetics, crafting mats, and access to DLC if you want. But there is no pay to win accesories available here.You can easy manage without buying stuff from game shop."
Positive,"its pretty good, a lot of content that you discover along the way and dont overwelm you."
Positive,i hate myself
Positive,"I'm not a big MMO player, but I'm amazed so far about Elder Scrolls Online!"
Positive,It's worth the money.
Positive,"Great game overall. But there is a two cons: cosmic AH system, steel fractions system and some guilds like in WOW. We don't need guilds but CLANS. There is many guilds in game right now - Guild of Warriors and Guild of Mages etc. PVP should be like in Lineage 2....9/10--------------------------------------------btw WHERE IS A POLISH VERSION ?? WE ARE WAITING FOR A POLISH VERSION !"
Positive,"+ basically skyrim online with few downgrade (because it is online)+ vast map,exploration is quite good+ there is no level bound farm/hunt area so you can do quest together with lvl 50 friends even if you just lvl 5+ you can play it solo,but party with friends is good too- well after you download 60GB on steam you still need to another 80 GB for installing - too GREEDY with their crown store, i still need to pay for DLC like theves guild and dark brotherhood - i dont know if many hours of grinding can be rewarding"
Positive,"I've had a lot of fun with this game so far. I'm only able to play in a very casual manner (a few hours a week basically) but even so I have been able to level a character and have a lot of fun doing so. Highly recommended![EDIT] Since writing that brief review I have been able to spend a lot more time with this game. As before, I highly recommend it! Lots of fun. Absolutely love it."
Positive,"After a disappointing Battle for Azeroth, I shopped for a few MMO's as I saw my free time dwindling. Final Fantasy XIV was a great contender, however due to the sub cost I felt I was not able to get my money's worth from the game and quit it. Guild Wars 2, while interesting, didn't attract me anymore after playing for a long time. And then I noticed that I had bought Elder Scrolls Online in a sale a long time ago and decided to give it a shot.I feel like this game has a very odd learning curve. There is a lot of knowledge the game doesn't tell you about, but with a (mostly) friendly community like I've encountered in the EU, it's been a steady stream of knowledge until I started to understand the game better. In the .. 3-4 weeks I've been playing since making this review, I've hit Champion Level 200 on my first ""main"" character, a Wood Elf / Bosmer Dragonknight that uses Stamina as their main resource. I had quite a lot of fun questing through most of the 'Aldmeri Dominion' (One of the three factions) storyline and felt intrigued almost every step of the way. Quest design isn't done with a very heavy hand and sometimes requires some thinking to complete, although it still follows some of the Skyrim quest design pitfalls (""follow the arrow"") which can mar some of the experience somewhat. There's a few interesting characters that you'll meet along the way that subvert expectations of story in an MMO, which is a fresh breath. Every province has a larger storyline that is supported by several quest hubs, 'delves' (solo dungeons) and public dungeons (harder dungeons, these bosses can be quite tough). The crafting system I found was straight-forward and simple and it allows players to craft items that have a ""set"" (an additional bonus ontop of the already defined things) so you are not forced into dungeons or raids in order to get good gear to get started. This might be a problem or a good thing depending on your perspective but for me as a very much casual player it allowed me to play a strong character without being forced to spend a lot of time. While there is a defined meta for some classes and gamemodes, the game is very open to newcomers wanting to experiment. Gear is an important thing the higher level you get, however this is true for many MMO's. But where it's variety lies is in the quite broad skill system the game employs. Your classes only define 3 of quite a lot of trees that you can spend your skill points in. Weapons form another tree entirely. So do the guilds, racials and even crafting skills in the game. You can dedicate characters specifically to the purpose you want them, which is a nice thing. Classes do not define the type of character you will be playing as is often defined in traditional MMORPG's, as such, a Dragonknight can be a good healer and a Nightblade can be an excellent spellcaster. The skills are a base that can be expanded upon with morphs and each changes a character in a unique way, or an ability to have different properties. One gripe however is the cost of many things. This is two-ways. 1. Gold - Now this isn't a big issue if you do a lot of the 'crafting writs' (daily crafting quests that grant experience, resources and considerable sums of gold at higher levels). I found however that the cost of bag space becomes a bit .. much, especially those without ESO+ that do not have the crafting bag will quickly find themselves wanting more.2. Time - A lot of the crafting takes time. And I mean a considerable amount of it. One of the traits, a special property used in crafting for equipment, can take up to 5 days to research. This is real-time, 5 days. Now of course you can use the microtransactions store Zenimax provides to buy an instant-complete which only shows what part of the design philosophy has been in the game. It is a black spot, to be sure.Now, for ESO plus, if you want to explore the game further than the base game allows (which, with Tamriel Unlimited, is quite a lot!) it is a great deal. You will get all the DLC (Which include some of the DLC, but not the most recent as of writing which is Elsweyr), 'Crowns' (Microtransaction currency for the game) equivalent to your subscription for that month, the Crafting bag which holds all your crafting items and for higher level players is an absolute must, and a few exclusive aforementioned microtransactions store deals alongside some buffs to experience, research times and food.TL;DR It is an MMORPG with quite a lot of depth that innovates on a couple of key things making me like it quite a lot. The community, as I've encountered it, has been quite friendly and although the learning curve is stilted at times, is quite rewarding. However, the looming microtransactions and the pushing of them in many regards does put me off of some of the systems in the game. Despite that, the game is quite fun to play and there is quite a lot of variation to choose from if you know where to look. Luckily, most players are quite willing to help you do that. If you do not want to interact with other players - you can choose not to and play this as a very large very expansive skyrim with a lot less immersion."
Positive,Tnx to destroy my fucking noob friends in ICRip btai & amirmmd<3
Positive,WHERE FUS RO DAH!?
Positive,"A fantastic MMO that has a bit of everything for everybody, if you know WoW, GW2 and the like- You will feel right at home, the full voice acting is a godsend as well and is honestly what sold me on the game in the first place.Also, the glorious hum of a nirn root gets me all tingly and funky and never gets old."
Positive,"Why do they have different builds, sets, gear, etc in ESO ? After Update 35 They might as well change the game to a simpler game where there is only one player with one type of gear and every one has the same stats - then they will have achieved their goal to make it equal for all ! Goodbye ESO - It was nice while it lasted !Update : Some of the problems seems to have been fixed - so maybe ESO makers reacted to all the negative responses the update caused ! I decided to give it another chance !"
Positive,The devs have made a lot of improvements over the years to quality of life and stability etc. The game really starts when you get your first toon to level 50 and unlock the champion system which I must say I find quite useful as the points are account wide. It can be difficult for new players to get into things like PVP but it can be a lot of fun playing in the Cyrodiil campaigns.
Positive,"like most rpgs, it's grindy, but you can enjoy it moreso since you're flooded with quests all the time.graphics are top notchpvp is not easy to get into from a beginner's perspective, but it is ""fun""biggest fucking downloads I have ever seenIt's just about worth the money in my opinion, however since I got this on sale, I am more inclined to say that this is a good game."
Positive,"I very much enjoy this game. It even fixes some of the problems I have with single player Elder Scrolls games, such as leading much less inventory management. And this is *before* the backpack upgrades and training for horses that you can get to raises your carry capacity.I also very much enjoy the story of the game, which is the main thing I look at in the game.There is plenty for roleplayers too due to a ton of emotes, light armour being good for RP clothes, and a lot of RP clothes between the Crown Store and what can be stolen."
Positive,"This is definitely not a multiplayer version of the past Elder Scrolls games. The play style is very different compared to them, and yet it does not feel like your average MMO either. There is something far more immersive about it, and although as with any MMO you definitely have to invest many hours to rise through the levels, it doesn't exactly feel grindy either. True, as of the writing of this review I have not quite invested thirty hours yet (and I'm impatient to get to level 15 so that I can use the weapon swap system), but so far I haven't had to go out and grind monsters for hours in order to get a special item or enough experience to level up. I have several quests in my journal, but many seem to be actually thought out and you feel as though you are participating in an actual story instead of killing x goblins and y bandits in order to ""thin the ranks"" of creatures that are just going to respawn.All in all, I think I actually enjoy this game more that I do Oblivion, and I would recommend it to any fan of the Elder Scrolls, as long as they go in knowing that they are not playing ""Skyrim with Friends.""UPDATE:After a couple hundred hours, I can still call this game good: The developers keep adding fresh content and have changed the entire system since I first started playing, and pretty much all of the changes have been good. If you like MMO's for good community then the dungeons are fun, or if you prefer playing solo the lack of levels makes the world feel *somewhat* like a single player RPG.All in all, I recommned even more strongly than I did before, and I know I'll probably be spending hundreds more hours in ESO."
Positive,"Skyrim multiplayer :) stealing option is great ^^ also i like combat mechanics, GREAT MMORPG <3"
Positive,"Awesome MMORPG with tons of stuff to do, fun classes, enjoyable combat, and even some interesting PvP. The graphics are nice and the story isn't bad for an MMO game."
Positive,"First time i played this game I thought i would love it i mean its an Elder Scrolls game and i loved all those i played but after a couple of hours in the game it just started feeling repetitive and just overall boring so i quit.Recently with all the hype about the DB coming out i decided i'd give it a second chance so i booted it up,deleted my old character and made a new one for a fresh start.I have so say i'm seriously enjoying this game so much it's all that i play anymore,the storyline is fantastic i never paid much attention to it cuz it annoyed me getting one quest after 5 levels . The dark brotherhood storyline is super good i like it way better than skyrim's ,dare i say actually oblivion.It's not just kill this and kill that you actually feel like what you do actually matters they immerse you in this assassin role so much you just can't let go of it.The optimization in this game is really good too,i mean there are some areas where my fps drop ,when there are a lot of particles ,other than that game runs fine.______________________________________________________________________________TL;DR~Didn't like the game b4,gave it a 2nd chance and loving it.Totally recommend."
Positive,7/11 Pick pocket the king simulator
Positive,"Exteremely good game. Please note that the game is a bit different from Elder Scrolls Skyrim, and the gameplay is not the same. Community is strong and not cancer yet."
Positive,One of the best MMOs out there. I honestly liked it. Also a geat addition to TES lore.
Positive,this is game
Positive,DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER !!! This is my annual review for the holiday steam badge. Good Game - that is currently having stability issues *sigh*- UPDATE2021: Unfortunately performance issues in PvP/Cyrodiil still persist  - curated drops are a HUGE update but companions are a fail as the 'new system' added this year - UPDATE 2022 - tepid card game(Tales of Tribute) as the 'new system' this year is the very definition of meh and combat damage as whole received a VERY large nerf -  We got a new class(Arcanist) this year(2023) overall still a fantastic gameHAPPY HOLIDAYS !!!
Positive,"A solid RPGMMO that is quite easy to master and provides easier content for those who just want to play in their off-time to unwind and relax, however still has harder content for those willing to seek it. As of 2016, Elder Scrolls Online is the most recent title in TES series. It boasts the authenticity and freedom of its predecessors, while bringing in new features like an expansive online experience that many TES players have dreamed of having (myself included). However, don't let the pretence that this game is strictly an MMO deter you from playing, there is a plethora of activities, quests and storylines that can be completed solo and can actually provide you with the same feeling of immersion and fulfilment that previous titles are so famous for. There is PvP that is completely optional and is not required for any endgame content, which is nice for those who are more into the RPVE and PVE scene. The PVP, however, is one of my favourites as it still provides you with the freedom that TES games are notorious for, while also giving you new objectives at a fair pace and enabling you to slaughter some of those pesky knife-eared no good aldmeri cu- i mean, engage in rewarding combat with other players of similar qualities. The classes are very well thought out and all classes can actually play each role in a dungeon (Tank, Damage Dealer and Healer) when set-up correctly. This is possible due to each classes moves being able to ""morph"" into more powerful ones as you level up. While these abilities level up you sometimes get the option to change the damage type they do and what resource is consumed upon activating the ability; a magicka move that deals fire damage can be morphed into a stamina move that deals poison damage, which is more suitable to a melee attacker that uses stamina as their main resource.This game is in a very interesting point in TES' timeline, it's a period of turmoil and conflict, a time long before the coming of Tiber Septim and the Tamriel that we've come to know through the previous TES games. Quite ironically, the newest installment in the Elder Scrolls series is actually the oldest in terms of the timeline the games are set in. If you like TES and also like the format of MMORPG games like WoW and Black Desert, I could not possibly recommend this more. Also this game is canonical with the rest of the Elder Scrolls series, as proven by the loremaster himself, Lawrence Schick. There is so much content in this game that I have sunk at least 500 hours into this game at the point of me writing this review and I still haven't finished all of it."
Positive,"Its a drug, never start to play this game.No pay to win.500+ hours to finish all the base game content (at least).No need to buy DLC: Farm money ingame and use it to buy your DLC's from other players."
Positive,I like to dress up my character and visual storiesHehe~ :P
Positive,Really glad that they droped the subscripton fee for this game. Perfect for any die hard Elder Scrolls players.
Positive,This is the mmorpg to play until something good comes along on Steam.
Positive,"I have not had the opportunity to play this game since release so I am not familiar with any bugs the game supposedly had.  Based on my experience since March 2015, this game is rather solid with an active player base and a lot of content beyond the main story to stay engaged in the game.  The developers actively assist if an actual bug is found in the game.  The only big downside I have seen so far is the quests and how repetitive they become from area to area.  Otherwise, as mentioned before, there is a strong player base with which you can run end-game content, dungeons, etc."
Positive,When it comes to mmorpgs I have commitment issues with my PCs. ESO offers eight character slots standard unlike most I've played with a limit of two. There are many 'quests' to accomplish so I don't really have to repeat to gain levels. I never got to endgame but that's not my thing.  I just every once in a while like to escape reality without my graphics card heating up the entire apartment so I'm glad it offers many levels of graphic detail for folks with older rigs line mine. Cheers! Happy gaming.
Positive,"At first I would like to thank the entire team of developers from Zenimax Studio for their titanic and passionate work. TESO is a really good and fantastic game with tons of interesting features and content. I’ve played about 180 hours and proud to say that I am still noob in it.The reason why I post this review is a “missed opportunities”. Every six months, the developers treat players with huge DLCs with new content and features. Rarely – upgrading old systems. The last update with champion system was like a breath of fresh air. At this point, I realized I was missing such changes in TESO.There are a lot of small but vital problems in game. The social part of the game suffers the most. Still, I found a high potential in such areas like:- Roleplaying (game with such abn active community could process a new content and events by roleplaying, the thing that developers should do is just give them attributes and context for this (for now we have roleplaying guilds, emotes system, housing, costumes, etc.)). Nice l narratively decision would be to give people an ability to create and share in-game content. For example, their own texts (notes, books and so on without addons). Of course, it should be a huge work from the community, cause people is the sourse of a new stories, but developers could stimulate players fantasy and wish. It’s truly connected with social aspect of a game which (I repeat) the most weak for now);- Housing (I have nothing to add here, cause, I think, housing system is really good, except of furniture limits, but it’s just a cavils);- Exploring (lorebooks, treasure hunting and other features are the good motivation for exploring along with quest and narratives);- Battling (thanks to the new update they have improved it but there is still a long road to go).Partner system is here to come. However, I’m afraid that situation with one of my favorite MMO Wakfu will repeat itself. No other players are needed with this system. It’s enough to explore Tamriel with your braindead NPC. The game was so criticized (and praised at the same time) for the lack of sociality. With this new system, it suffers even more. TESO need more social activities.There is no value in joining a guild. No rewards, bosses, bonuses or joint activities. Only a free travel, bank and, possibly, a merchant. What guild can do as a guild? And why people in it should create entertainment for themselves on their own?There is no value in friends. Okay, we can clean dungeons together and dolmens along with killin world bosses. And then? It would be nice to have group quests, some kind of friendship points or another sort of activity, which will be cool to make with my friends. There is a usual situation when you just don’t even know what to do together. There can help puzzles like in Zelda/Genshin or another challenging exploring activities.Mentor system for a newcomers? To give mentors gold, achivemetns or something for helping noobs.Time events are appreciate too (for example, weekly).Trading system is not comfortable at all. It’s good for exploring and king of “story” flow, but without addons is hard to maintain.Narratively there is no reason what class or race you play. It’s hard to make for the whole game such system, but possible in future DLC’s. Choices matters.Werewolfs and vampires are useless. It’s just a label or something like this. One bite and then? Nothing. It really need (once again) social meaning. Events for werewolf and vampires (or even quest) should change this.There is a lot of fun in this game, but it is not fun to play it with other people."
Positive,"This review is for those out there who, like me, were/are skeptical about getting this game. I've been playing MMOs for years, from EQ1 to WoW to Aion to Rift, and I can tell you now that this game lives up to my standards, and more. Getting started might feel a little odd at first, but after getting used to the controls, interface and realizing that it's an Elder Scrolls MMO, it feels more and more comfortable the deeper you delve into it. It's not for everyone though, especially if you're the kind of guy that wants to race to the top speeding through dungeons and quests in less than 24 hours. This game requires sharp attention to the quests and lore to be appreciated fully, and if you can do that, you'll realize quickly that this is one of the most innovative and interesting MMOs created to date."
Positive,"I have only ever dipped my toes into other MMOS prior to this game (so take this review with a grain of salt), but I personally enjoy the fact that ESO doesn't play like a ""traditional MMO;""; it's exactly why I think I've played as much as I have so far. I mostly do solo player content (which ESO is great at, to be honest), as I find it damn satisying in this game. The voice acting is wonderful, I find the majority of the quests to have enough depth and variation between them to keep me endlessly entertained, and the world is absolutely beautiful. I have, however, done a fair share of the PVE content (all the 1-50 4-man dungeons, most of the delves and dolmens, almost every public dungeon) and find that the game excels here as well. The group finder seems to be lacking still, but I think it's just because most people seem to ignore it and choose to form their own groups in chat. I haven't reached ""end game"" (Veteran ranks) yet or done any PVP so I cannot offer any feedback on these elements, but I will update here once I've experienced these parts of the game.TL;DR This game can very easily play as a single person MMO if you choose to go that route (which I have) and it is a very satisfying experience that way. My decent exposure to group PVE has been largely outstanding as well. Haven't done PVP yet."
Positive,"Have currently played 140 hours of this game, and still adding on more.Love it! Despite other people's complaints of it not being like other Elder Scrolls games, it's not meant to be, it's an Elder Scrolls twist on an MMO and is fantastic in my opinion."
Positive,"I recommend because it is a different mmo experience,played the free weekend, can't buy, but would, it sure can be something to play for a long time!"
Positive,Downloaded 50 something gb's finally donejk u just reached the launcher now another 7000gb to go10/10 would download 19 times in a row again
Positive,"Seriously, ZoS is a petty, incompetent, company. They are the company that are run by suits that ONLY look at the botton line and not what players what.Want a dungeon fixed where you get feared into a wall and remain stuck? Nah FUCK YOU, here is eyeliner for your character. Good luck trying to get support. They have a few generic responses from BOTS  Dan, Allison, Meredith and Chet. I've delt with them all/1. Sorry for your troubles, get fukt guy.2. We are ZoS, we care more about money than your actual satisfaction, if you read the EULA, we bear no responsiblity for anything, even if its our fault, still not our fault.3. Raise a fuss because we have broken stuff, BAN!Now my hours dont reflect this, 800 CP, All pve complete, former emps. I have over 5k forsure.I reccommend this game if you have poured time and money into, if not, stay the fuck away from this greedy company.I won't list the the pros or cons because frankly, the servers suck, cheat engine is still around, broken add ons, giant zerglag balls, I can only suspect things will get worse with the new patch.  Since I played, a new patch has never gone off without major game breaking things. 2 years in, still have elementary glitches, bugs, exploits that still havent been fixed."
Positive,"got me addicted. highly suggested. i dont know how to thank this game and the developers. everything abt this game is good, the stories, the lore that connects each other, the community . everyyyy thing. its not only a game, its a world. last year this time i started this game.  after 3100 hours here i can say its well worth it. ""Blood for the pact """
Positive,Great game filled with content. Easier than ever for new players to begin understanding how the game works. The updates over the past few years have been pretty great too. Hours of endless fun if you join an active guild with discord.
Positive,"After Elder Scrolls Online became Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited, this MMO has become one of favorite MMOs of all time. Each quest has a unique, interesting story behind it and at times doesn't feel like the average MMO quest. ESO also does a beautiful job of capturing the lore of the Elder Scrolls universe allowing it to appeal greatly to fans. They have also made the game to where you don't need to be a fan to play the game. It's easily accessible to everyone else. All in all, ESO is a stunning game that is worth your time."
Positive,"My 1st mmorpg and totally worth it....not like skyrim at all and the combat system is far better....you wanna feel like a dragonborn, breathing fire and mastering everything dragon related go for the dragon knight, tho you can't fus ro dah any1 off cliffs but still atleast you got the fire breath...and irs awesome.... Moving on.. if you feel like murdering people around tamriel, be sneaky, and swift with blades then the assassin nightblade would be your best choice....and if you wanna feel like a daedric wizard and wanna have some pets you will find sorcerer addictive...this class is unbelievably selfish tho....and next... if u wanna be a holy freaking unbeatable overpowered nuclear missile launching with op healing with op buffs with op everything and wanna feel like an aedric god yeah templer would be your preference....and then the expansion class... if you are a calm nature lover, loves to be with animals, loves greenery, and loves ice cream more than anything and wanna play a versatile class which can be played by any race and kinda same kind of OP as templer but a little hard to master class then freaking buy the morrowind dlc cuz WARDEN is the man for ya....yeah these all are coming from a WARDEN class lover....and once you are logged in ooo mama this is your new life....this is your skooma....have fun nerd...and oh yeah be aware of guards.... They are immortal....so don't mess with them :) ciao 😂"
Positive,"The game has some nice tie-ins with familiar characters from the single player series, but is best approached as fan fiction executed on an epic scale. If you can reconcile the game that way, you'll have a great time.As an MMO it stands smack dab in the middle of your hardcores and your casuals. It's a game that can be played passively enough for people just looking to lose themselves in an immersive environment or actively enough for people really seeking to challenge themselves through achievement hunting or PvP.With no shortage of accessible content, from questing to exploration, the solo-player experience is wonderfully executed. For the most part. Since the world is shared between yourself and multitudes of other 'Champions', the in-game player reference, it is often easy to run into other players completing your objectives for you and wholesale ruining a crucial story moment. The best example of this is mini-boss or boss fights being completed even a second after you load into the area. With no hits on the boss, you get no loot, and with no time for the game to set it up, you miss out on bits of story and unique NPC interactions.The game world is vast and beautiful, with equal effort given toward recreating familiar areas from the single player series and creating new areas from TES lore. As is fairly standard for a modern game associated with the TES universe, the soundtrack is outstanding, filled with immediately recognizable pieces and just as well-crafted new ones. The main story segments (known as chapters) are generally well-executed, with side-stories being hit-or-miss. The challenge for newer and returning players, is figuring out exactly how to go about approaching the story as each major expansion exists as isolated narratives. This can get confusing when you run into characters that you shared 20+ hours of adventures with that have no idea at all who you are. It can get just as confusing when you're meeting a character for the first time and the game assumes you finished an earlier chapter that included them without you having actually done so.As a product, it leans a bit on the predatory side when it comes to cosmetics, cash-store boons (looking at you $50 personal merchant) and loot boxes, but its $15 a month subscription service gives access to an infinite storage space for crafting materials (essential for inventory de-cluttering), a handful of crowns (one of the premium currencies) and any expansion content excluding the latest release. If you're looking for content alone, you'll find yourself with a heck of a deal.A lot has been made of server reliability, but even with long weekly maintenance (5-8 hours downtime), it's easy enough to put in 30+ hours a week if you can find the time. The game has its warts like any other, but many of them are overstated by a vocal few who have been unlucky enough to experience them more often than the rest. The short version: If you dive in expecting a new TES experience that may or may not be connected to the grand story of the single player series, you'll find a beautiful game world with good-to-great storytelling, fantastic music and seemingly endless content to explore at your own pace. Not spending money on the cash-shop does not impact your gaming experience. Depending on your play style, not subscribing may become a hindrance as inventory space is at a premium for newer players."
Positive,"I have personally been loving this game all around. I started playing on PlayStation with a couple friends but now am playing solo on PC. I have been enjoying it by myself and enjoyed it before with friends, I think either way it's worth playing.. Or at least giving it a shot! It has it's flaws of course, and I'm very picky when it comes to MMO's. This one just grabbed me as soon as I started playing and 100+ hours later I'm still loving it! Definitely recommended"
Positive,"I started playing this game back on the PS4 four or so years ago and quickly became addicted to it. I moved to playing on the PC because of the player made mods and quicker updates, but regardless of which platform you play it on it's just straight up addicting. It's easy for anyone to get into, you don't even have to play with other people if you don't want to. The entire game can be played solo or you can join guilds, play PVP, or participate in other activities that involve other people if that's your thing. The game scales down to your level no matter what content you're participating in, which I really enjoy, and makes it easier for people wanting to explore content that's expanded outside of the beginning cities. The lore is great, as is the voice acting. There is just so much to do in the game - crafting, questing, dungeons, collecting, etc, that it's so easy to lose yourself in it for hours at a time.It's my all time favorite MMO and though I take breaks that are sometimes months long, I always find myself coming back because it's just that good."
Positive,"Overall, this is a good game to get into, however there are some problems with it. Firstly, I understand that this is a business and they want to make money. However, they are more concerned with content creation and pushing more cosmetic in game items than the sustainability of the game. There are a bunch of bug problems that have not been fixed for a long time. As you can see I've played this game for quite some time. I would like them to stop with the new content and fix the existing content. They refuse to actually do this. This is still a fun game if you are looking for this sort of MMO; a MMO that is in a fantasy world that has a large player base and allows you to play the game you want. There are certain meta that you need to stick to, in order to be successfull, but other than that, it's however you want to play. There are too many pros to list...Cons:The big problem is that PvP is not noob friendly, unless you join a massive group of other people (zergs) and run down others. Champion Point systems also needs to be reworked. Endless number of bug fixes."
Positive,"Just started to play this recently - I finished Skyrim ages ago but I will not pay online subs to play any game, so when this same out in the present format - I don't mind shelling out the coin.Like I say just started - need to rank up a fair bit - but that's the game.If I would have to moan about something - it would be the fact there is no Player Housing - I think given the right format and the fact you can paly with friends - A chance to have a virtual Friday Night Out with the LADS ( and LASSES ) in the game sounds pretty good to me - I'll make sure the wife's in bed and my beer is flowing - you lot just get the party house started !"
Positive,"It took time for ESO to get really good, but in 2019, it's really, really good."
Positive,This game is a lot better than I expected it to be.
Positive,i fak this gaem in esss
Positive,"Over monetized, Unstable servers and out of touch devs. Questing and exploration are the main reasons to play this game. If that isn't your thing then dont bother."
Positive,Look at the hrs! Enough said!
Positive,"Just started playing last month and wow this game is nice. The quests and plotlines are very nice and immersive. The various scenery are diverse and well made for each region. The technically open class system is very refreshing and interesting to experiment on and the RvR (Realm vs Realm pvp) is awesome :) I just wished i pre-ordered so i could use any race on any faction since i want to be different (Atlmer on DC, Orc on EP, Dunmer on AD etc. etc. ) haha. Hope to see more of us gamers here and hope the game and story keeps on moving forward :)"
Positive,"As a blind person looking for good gaming experiences this game has some good accessibility options, that with the voice acting makes for a last long experience.Base game has more than enough content to decide if it's your type of MMO, and you don't have to pay a subscription, though it's nice to have."
Positive,"There is a really fun download simulator bundled with this gem:Download 59GB via steamLaunchSelelect languageDownload 8MB patchDownload 2GB patchDownload 28MB...Download 36MB...Download 508MB...Download 1GB...Download 8GB...Download...Download....Download.....

Positive,"You'd think they'd drop the ball on the MMO, but they certainly have not."
Positive,love this game :D
Positive,"Good Game , fun game Love it GW2 !"
Positive,"Cannot believe they stole Skyrim and made it into an MMO, that guy that made the thing about the fridge will be furious"
Positive,Played a bit. I mean it's ok.
Positive,Looks and feels like what you would expect from an elder scrolls game.
Positive,I find this game fun and challenging especially if you have a friend to play with.
Positive,Closest thing you'll get to playing an Elder Scrolls game with friends (Skyrim multiplayer). As an MMO it stands apart with its easy to use system and awesome fully voiced quests and NPCs. Some of the main NPCs are voiced by well known actors in the VO and Hollywood circles.So so so much content in the base game. No pay to win. No insane out of lore skins and stuff. Everything just looks good and fits in this game.I would recommend this game to any MMO fan or Elder Scrolls fan!!!
Positive,"Let this one tell you why you should buy this sleek product, yes?First of this one has to tell you that she loves to explore and travell (because of the freedom this bestows on her). Maduri has been to many places from cold Skyrim to warm and sleek Elsweyr, from High Rock to strange and cruel Morrowind (This one didn't much like it there for constant fear of being enslaved by those cruel Telvanni, also the contant ash matted this one's fur). There are many treasures to be had though for the brave five claws who venture into the ruins and crypts of Tamriel, this one can tell you. She's even tread the ground of other planes, strange yet wonderful (Maduri's inquisitive nature just always gets the better of her). There are also many more places to be visited season for season. And if you prefurr to travell in the company of others you can team up with friendly people from all corners of Tamriel despite the dreadful times we live in and form bonds with close companions that you might meet along the road, yes? This one has to warn you though, you will have to deal with lots of villains and beasts along the way or you can fight in the war of the alliances (but this one leaves this to others and seeks her fortunes elsewhere). There is always more to be had if you have the coin that is, but that's the point no? Be who you want to be this one says.Maduri would say this is a very good deal for any one wanting to see more of Tamriel than their own front yard, yes?"
Positive,Wouldnt you like to know weather boy
Positive,"Love this game. The story is great, UI mods, 3rd preson and first person mode. Hated this game during beta but after each up date this game gets better and better."
Positive,best Bethesda.net_Launcher.exe i've ever played10/10thx zenimax
Positive,Still one of the greatest MMOs out there.
Positive,"Ive put over 100hours in this game and havent even scrached the surfess its a nice sold mmo and a good story teller i love the game enteratcion, people, quests. playing it with friends ( during holidays months is a must ) is also very enjoyable. I give it a good 8.5/10 and a solid 9/10 with DLC's"
Positive,"Edit: Changing my review to positive for now because there hasn't been a Steam lockout for a couple of weeks. I still urge anyone reading this to buy from Bethesda and not Steam- read on  for my orginal negative review. I love this game and it deeply pains me to leave a negative review, but buying it through Steam was a huge mistake. Steam logins have been breaking weekly causing me to be unable to play. The game is gorgeous and addictive and I just want to be able to play it instead of staring at a banner on the official forum saying that ""they are aware that some Steam users are having trouble logging in"", which actually means that no Steam user can log in, while people who bought the game from its official website are able to play- so by all means, please buy this wonderful game. Just don't buy it from Steam!!!!"
Positive,"To put into perspective on how much I love this game, I've had this game for only two weeks. As a former WoW player, everything about this game blows me out of the water. From the deep complexed crafting to the open landscapes and revisiting multiple areas known throughout the series, I cant recommend this game enough.The quests add so much more depth compared to the ""slaughter 10 warthogs because **** it and I will give you ten copper."" Instead, they are replaced with solving a murder mystery all the way to quests of political intrigue. For most of my life, I have spent thousands of hours MMO hopping just trying to find a MMO that impacted me like WoW did (and boy did I play a lot of cancer during that period). Once I came upon this game, I have become obsessed with it. I cannot recommend this game enoughONE BIG CON HOWEVERThe Steam port, while works great 90% of the time, has a lot of issues with server connectivity. Ill sit down ready to play the rest of the night and my plans are thrown overboard by connectivity issues. I would recommend buying this game through the actual website."
Positive,"I actually like the game, I'll however mention a few things out of the bat. Don't download the game trough steam as you may waste time download time (as the size of the game is quite large aswell). The launcher can be bugged and not update the game if obtained trough steam. According to a comment It was fixed but I'd still play it safe and download it manually.Other than I say this is a pretty solid MMORPG if I've ever played one. Graphics are decent. Grind can be fun with friends and it's not too boring solo. I've haven't seen much pay2win elements. While I'll say the story (or lore if you may call it) isn't all that good, I don't think it is horrible as many may have a problem. Maybe I've haven't given enough care on the story to be displeased.I recommend it."
Positive,"This game keeps getting better with every update.  There's more than plenty to do, and with a welcoming, non-racist community, it's always enjoyable with friends!  Seriously this community is amazing.  Take the average MMORPG community (Black Desert, Runescape, etc.) and think of the exact opposite of those communities.The bad:This game looked like shit when it was released in 2013 and still hasn't held up to this day.  I recommend going to Nexus Mods and downloading the re-shader for this game.  You can change the graphics how you like.  I personally use the Fantasy shader settings.  Look up a few video tutorials on YouTube to see the difference between dog shit and shaders."
Positive,Please describe what you liked or disliked about this product.
Positive,Besides the lag and glitchy-ness this game is an entertaining way to forget you live in the shit society we do. Beautiful scenery.
Positive,This one doesn't mind to save Tamriel again and again
Positive,"A ""Wise"" man once said. ""It just works"""
Positive,i realy like the game but the only thing that doesn't let me enjoy the game is my potato pc :'( am planing to buy a new one this year.
Positive,Pretty good game but it's exactly what you expect an MMO to be. A little repetitive but it was very fun for a free weekend. I beat the main storyline but I would consider playing more on another free weekend. Very fun but worth the wait for a free weekend.Needs Steam achievements.
Positive,"This is the first MMO I've ever subscribed to for more than a couple of months - it is filled with amazing content, stories, lore, craft, detail, humor, and more. I played the beta and wasn't interested in pursuing it at the time. Now, a few years later, it's become my constant gaming companion. Well done, Zenimax, this is a terrific property.Update: a year later I'm not running as strong as I was out of the gate, but I still log in constantly. There is so much content - it's endless! And I'm not even much of a PvP/raid guy. Still keeping on, but now with way more dragons."
Positive,"-Logged on to the server-Awesome Intro vid-Character creation! Finally-Still at character creation-Still at character creation-Still at character creation-Still at character creationlook at the time, oh**** UPDATED ****After 6 years? Still only at the character creation.98hrs/10 best character creation game ever"
Positive,"8/8, no bait, would buy again.- I've played my fair share of MMO's.- This is not your typical MMO (WoW, Guild Wars 2 etc..).- Hands down, the most immersive GAME I've EVER played (excluding other Elder Scroll games).- Combat system is both exciting and tactical. 9/10.- The world and quest locations are well designed and relevent (no fetching).- Covenant system is a bummer if you want to play with others but still! not a biggie! Jusy chose the same covenant!If you're looking for a quick fix this isn't your game! 24 hours in and I still haven't left the first area <3"
Positive,"ESO makes teamwork accessible and rewarding. That's the most critically important thing a MMO can do in my eyes; lore or stats just don't matter as much as being able to log in, spend an hour with friends and walk away rewarded. 1,150 hours played as of posting this and I just bought the last DLC I was missing. I'll play this game until it sunsets."
Positive,"ESO is one of my favorite games of all time, and I have a lot of games ive played in the past. In my honest opinion, after playing every single Elder Scrolls game, from Arena to TES V, and finally ESO, I have to say I enjoy ESO the most both story-wise and gameplay.Yes, ESO is an MMO, with MMO mechanics, crafting, abilities, etc. But its also much more, you can explore a vast amount of Tamriel so far, with more parts of it being added in new DLCs and Expansions. The storylines are IMO some of the best in the entire Elder Scrolls series, with LOTS of lore being added to the universe, and with both memorable and lovable characters to boot!Now, I know I have been expressing my love for this game, and have been listing the positives, but I will also list the negatives to be fair:The game engine isnt the greatest - ESO is great, the engine it runs on however needs a serious rework, its unoptimized and clunky at times.The LAG - Some will experience lag more than others at one point or another, is usually depends on your hardware and connection, one universal thing though is the lag in places like Cyrodiil, the lag there is almost definitely server/engine lag, it doesnt matter how great your computer or internet are, you will more than likely get some form of lag there.The bugs - As with any game, you cant have it without its fair share of bugs, however, a lot of times when ZoS makes fixes, they end up making a LOT more bugs, including ones from the past.Redguards and Tu'whacca - If you ever travel to the Alik'r Desert, you will more than likely hear the local Redguards mention the name Tu'whacca in almost every sentence. It gets to the point where you either end up hating the Tu'whacca, or want to activate the Numidium and wipe the Alik'r Desert from existence.This game is far from perfect, but from all of its cons, the pros of the game have hooked me better than any Master Angler ever could, that being said, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the Elder Scrolls series, RPGs, MMOs, or just want a game to casually play."
Positive,"This is so fun. Forget WOW, this is the game to play."
Positive,"I avoided this game when it came out after hearing so many complaints. Well, whatever state the game was in at launch doesn't matter now, because now the game is fantastic!"
Positive,very good game
Positive,"I put on 66 hours in 4 days, oops."
Positive,This game is good ! for people who love to quest ! PVP ! Craft !  and explore
Positive,Very good game.
Positive,A Perfect Balanced MMO
Positive,Normally I am not a fan of mmorpgs but this turned out better than i expected as far as mmorpgs go. But as an Elder Scrolls game? It’s on the “meh” side for me. If you want a decent mmorpg then this game is worth it especially for the price they have it as for the steam sale. If you want a awesome elder scrolls game then i suggest picking up the other games.
Positive,"If you are looking for a game that will immerse you in a vast and rich world, let you customize your character and playstyle, and offer you more content than you can reasonably explore, this is the game for you. The voice acting is amazing, and every single quest is voiced!  You can play solo or with friends, join or create a guild, engage in PvP and PvE, craft and collect items... there's just so much to do.The only downside: the crafting bag requires the monthly subscription.  You can get by without it, but if you want to do any crafting, you realistically need it.  It's easy to forgo if you aren't crafting, but you'll throw out a lot of materials."
Positive,Honestly not a bad game if you enjoy questing everything else seems a little lacking though
Positive,give this a thumb up if you peed your pants
Positive,Super awesome game! absolutely love it! The controls and combat take a little getting used to but it is a beautiful game that has plenty to do. 9/10
Positive,"This game is amazing, especially when you have 7 others to play it with.Has a really nice RPG feel.11/10 would waste my life on."
Positive,"This Game was amazing before it went buy to play, and still remains this way.Just take your time, go slow, go in first person, and enjoy the world lovingly crafted for you.I have yet to play with a nicer MMO community than the one on here."
Positive,"if my 1000 hours dont make it obvious, i love this game. theres a ton of great areas to explore, and the best in game community ive seen in a game. dungeons and trials are fun, however pvp is a bit laggy and the server does randomly disconnect you sometimes."
Positive,"I haven't played the game for very long, therefor it'd only be fair of me to recommend to look at other reviews as well. With that being said: This game is great. The combat is good, it's gigantic, there's a lot to do, and a lot of quests. The game sounds too good to be true, and sadly, it is. How come? To play the game to the fullest you'll need to either get the monthly subscription, or need to buy Crowns in the store. This review is meant as a warning more then a review. i hope i was helpful, i wish you a great day!"
Positive,"Much more worth it to get the gold edition than regular subscription-based version, provided it is on sale you can think of it as buying any other Elder Scrolls game, though requires several extra signups to create your account but nothing major.Whilst I haven't played very long I can give a few things for beginning players such as myself:- Combat is slower than the single player  games, much like other MMORPGs, but if you were expecting good combat from this game you will find it lacking.- The quest system and layout of inventory and such is a bit confusing at first but I feel you can get to grips with it quite quickly.-It is an online Elder Scrolls game, not the most brilliantly executed but it works and is enjoyable. -I dont see myself sinking hundreds of hours into it like many do for the single player Elder Scrolls games but I certainly see me coming back to it a fair bit.-You may well not have much time to test it and request a refund should you not enjoy it if your internet connection is poor, there are quite a few somewhat large patches that need to be installed when you first launched the game, and then you have to sort out emails and everything else, so if ever there is another free weekend or anything, try it out before you buy."
Positive,Great game not too addicting but keeps you comming back for more every day.  Just buy the DLC on the initial purchase its worth it gives you tons of perks and in game funds.Upsides:-Great open map-Tons of quests-Fun for solo or party-Lots of content-So many skill trees-Even more skill trees-All the crafting-Non-toxic people (atleast so far that I've met)Downsides:I DIDNT BUY THE DLC OR WAIT FOR THE GAME TO BE ON SALE ;-;10/10 would swallow a live frog and have a lucid journey with a talking tree and his animal friends
Positive,"I love how the game gives you complete freedom. As a brand new player to the world of PC gaming and ESO, I can wholeheartedly say that this game is WELL worth it! The only thing i do not like about it is the housing setup. I wish it was a bit more like Skyrim, but that's just the console gamer coming out of me. Still, get this game if you can!"
Positive,It's fun for a few hours.
Positive,"As of the date of this review, I've logged 237 hours of gameplay.so... that's my review."
Positive,"Don't trust Youtube gameplays of this game because it may look very lame from there, but once you actually try ESO by yourself, it actually feels way better.Pros: Good story for a MMO gameHuge worldThe skill system forces you to make a decision because they actually matter unlike some other MMOsDynamic quests (not many kill x number of monsters quests)Very good music (from elder scroll games) and Voice actingUnique crime systems like theft, murder, and much moreElder Scroll UICons:  Combat system to be improved (after playing a few korean mmos such as TERA, I felt that the combat system in ESO is not very entertaining, but the world's atmosphere and story make up for it)Pay wall for certain add ons (not essential and they aren't that expensive)Not many player interactions available compared to other MMOs"
Positive,fun times ahead buddyedit: can't stop lol
Positive,"sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe shit"
Positive,Good Game !
Positive,There is a elder scrolls game here but since it is an MMO you're gonna do some serious grinding.
Positive,"Literally hours of entertainment and no shortage of things to do.Great to play alone to play the story, level and explore or in a group to fight dungeons and bosses and make friends.Added bonus is though you can pay money and buy the DLCs (and they are great) if you're not looking to spend more than the base game amount then you still have no shortage of quests, areas to explore and things to do.10/10 would recommend."
Positive,"Beautiful game, breathtaking soundtrack, solid gameplay, nicely optimized. A huge world to explore filled with amazing locations, lots of lore, lots of quests... And quite an interesting story from the very start. Awesome voice acting and ambience sounds. It really feels like TES. As long as you're open for new adventures, and not just ""skyrim online"", i highly recommend this.Update:Voted this as the ""TEST OF TIME"" nomination 2016.Update 2:Voted for ""Best Environment"" award nomination 2018.Update 3:LABOR OF LOVE 2019"
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online is the MMO-RPG spin off of the main Elder Scrolls Series. Taking place over a large majority of the entire continent of Tamriel and other realms, you are a Vestige who must sought after defeating Molag Bal, the Daedric Prince of Domination and Enslavement. You can explore the expansive landscape of each province within Tamriel, with more zones and sections to be added in future updates/DLC. ESO has a fun and great range of creativity in playing any race, any class, any province.ESO can easily soak up a good 300-400 hours of gameplay purely off the basegame and without spending a penny on any DLC/Crown Store item.- Great Graphics- Great Soundtrack- Fun Gameplay- Fun Combat- Fun Skills- Wonderful world of Tamriel- Tons and tons of quests and dungeons- Factions & Guilds to join- Great DLC- Nice Community- Lots of cool updates- The Imperial Race, one of the 10 core playable races of the Elder Scrolls Series, is only purchased from the Imperial Edition of ESO or buying the Digital Imperial Edition Upgrade from the Crown Store.- No Cross-play of EU and NA servers. Purchases from the Crown Store do not cross to the other server. Meaning if you bought a DLC or item from the Crown Store in the EU server, it won't be on the NA server unless you buy it again for the NA server. (However if you are a ESO Plus member, DLCs are Free for both servers, just not Crown Store purchases)There is a good thing though, Crowns and DLC bought from Steam apply for both NA and EU Servers, meaning- Crown Store has hefty prices. The only things worth it are the Zone DLC's which add new lands and delves (Which all DLC can be for free if you're a active ESO Plus member)- If you love Elder Scrolls Lore. This game more or less breaks, manipulates and retcons lore, there are many inconsistencies as well as changes to what has been a constant in elder scrolls games. So it's best to play this game for it's history within the Elder Scrolls Universe."
Positive,"What can i say. best mmo i have played. great story, graphics, and combat are all outstanding and a cut above the competition. coming from former guild wars 2 and tera player."
Positive,ESO = Yet a wholesome strange life sim where you can be... almost whatever you want!
Positive,"10/10 would recommend. This game has lots of gameplay and is very fun when playing in a group, even if it's just people you meet in game. Most people are very friendly and helpful in the pc community."
Positive,Very lore of elder scrolls
Positive,"im not an MMORPG guy at all , but im really enjoying this so far"
Positive,This game is lit. I usually hate MMOs but this one I really enjoy so far.
Positive,"A good mmo would recommend a look, very helpful and friendly community too :-)"
Positive,"TESO is simply the best MMORPG ever honestly!!!there is some much content thousand of hour of gameplay, very very dynamic pvp and pve!!!!!!Loved the Elder S series and this is just totally crazy! i just cant stop playing!!!!!!!!!! :)hope you guys enjoy and help this magnificent franchise!!!See you soon in Tamriel :)"
Positive,I play this game really casually so I can't speak for the hardcore folk out there but it's great to pick up and put down every now and then. There are so many things to do even without the subscription that it's really something that can keep you entertained for such a long time. The only real gripe I have is that a lot of the loot crates are shoved in your face at login and any time you open up the in-game shop.
Positive,"Played ESO for years, enjoyed so many things. If you are thinking about this MMO you should probably plan on a couple of things. Go ahead and sub, join a guild as soon as you can (trading guild, then others later), plan on logging in everyday and spend lots of time playing. If you don't you'll run out of storage, not have a good way to get the help you need except for Que's and zone chat, and you'll lose out on daily rewards. Otherwise, it can be a lot fun, play as a group or solo, and get plenty of free stuff or have a great way to learn to purchase things by either crafting or using in-game gold. The Lore is good, zones are all very different, great voice actors, music is nice, it's really a good game that you can put time in and enjoy. Supports hi-res and ultra-wides, a big plus."
Positive,"Firstly, I would like to say that I enjoy TES games since the childhood. My meeting with this game series began with Morrowind, and this part made an incredible impression on me. In 2011 the World saw the Skyrim, and It was a breakthrough and awesome game that has a bunch of fans to this day. I spent a lot of hours playing this game, and I'm a true fan of it. However, waiting for the TES 6, I decided to try to play TES Online. The main conclusion that I did is that this isn't typical TES game and even if you're a huge fan of TES, you may be disappointed in this game. If you wanted to see just a new part of the ""Scrolls"" - forget about it.Anyway, let's see that we've got. 1) A long story that goes in chronological order, but in which it's very easy to get confused.2) A large number of side quests.3) A diverse, but very difficult gameplay. You have to spent quite a long time to understand it, especially, if you are not familiar with TES games and MMORPG as a whole.4) A middle level of graphics, but I found it pretty good, because it's about simple but very colorful picture.5) Large and different maps. Absolutely like it. 6) Constant updates and number of DLC.To sum up, I would like to say that TES Online is about playing in a group of players or at least with a friend. Then, you can get a pleasure from this game. In other cases, the game is unlikely to interest you for a long time."
Positive,Good MMO with epic soundtrack if you want to stop having a life.
Positive,Almost as good as The Lusty Argonian Maid.Edit 11/24/21: 3 years later. Still playing
Positive,"Hooo boy what a game doodAs someone who likes playing mmos solo mostly, this game has provided enoguh content for 800 hours already, with some dungeons and battlegrounds of course.The single player content is just about one of the best mmos out there. From the stories of zones, to big ones of entire alliances, to small ones in delves.It's a game full of life and immersion.Next you can try your skill in some arenas, pretty difficult solo content by itself.there is professions for crafting, provisions, archeology, you can become a trader, a thief (game as pretty deacent stealth system).Combat personally flows really nice, but many people are put off by animation cancelling.And after being one shot in PVP a few dozen times, can confirm some of this shit has got to go.The biggest downside to this game is it's monetazation. Straight up scam in the crown store. 3000 crowns for a mount, like come on ZOS??PvP is besides the players that geek nothing but pvp, good.Can say it is fun enoguh i spent a few days doing nothing but battlegrounds.Open world cyrodill is fuin, but it's just too much running and traveling after you die.AND THE LAAAAAAAAG HOOOOOOOOOOLY FUCK????????tldr overpriced shit, i love this game8/10-ign:)"
Positive,"This game is a beautiful game.  If you like Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind, you will enjoy this Elder Scrolls Online.  It has a great community. I am what you call a super casual player.  I don't do trials (high-end raiding) or very frequently dungeons, I mostly gather, make items, sell them and repeat.  I do fishing and talk to people.  Very few games are can be tailored to both the super casual style and the high-end raiding at the same time yet ESO does that.  Hopefully I will see you there.Edit: Almost 5,000 hours in and I can still say, I enjoy the game.  I adore this game and can't wait for playing High Isle."
Positive,"ESO has done a great job with this game and in my opinion, it is one of the best MMOs ever. The one key thing I'd tell people to not get burnt out is TAKE YOUR TIME. I don't normally even read quests in MMOs, I just burn through it. With this game, take your time and enjoy all of the immersion and work that went into it and you'll find yourself lost in a great story.First off, immersion. Ever quest, including the significant content they continually roll out, is voiced over. The graphics look fantastic and I would put it up against most AAA games today with looks.They keep rolling out great content frequently and have a great buy to play and subscribe to play option.Are there things they could improve? Sure, guild houses would be nice (with shared storage). Other than that (and I'm typically very critical), I honestly can't think of much. The game is GREAT."
Positive,"When I had played this during beta, it was one of the most broken, buggy experiences ever. Now, like a phoenix soaring out of a pile of rubble, we have one of the best MMOs to date. The graphics are stunning, quests are fresh and often unique, and the combat is smooth, flowing, and engaging. Also, as someone who enjoys as much immersion as possible in my gaming experiences, ESO delivers a top-notch world that you so easily find yourself a part of (even moreso with the right addons). If you are a fan of Skyrim, Oblivion, or Morrowind, this game will align itself neatly and proudly alongside them."
Positive,"Update: 3 Years On:I periodically go back to ESO when a new expansion is released, and feel my review below is still very accurate. In my opinion, this is a great PvE game if you only have one character (more gets to be a chore). I haven't tried much PvP but imagine it's very competitive at max level. I'm enjoying the new Necro class, but am a little sad he doesn't have any persistent pets :'(-----+ Nice action-combat system, like Neverwinter. + Good graphics.+ No monthly sub required (though the ""ingredients bag"" is only available with the sub and is extremely useful).+ World quests and areas aren't level-gated. You can go where you fancy, play with friends of different levels, and always be earning xp.- World quests and areas aren't level-gated. Strangely, this also makes the world feel very flat. You lose a sense of progression (since no areas are harder than any others), and don't feel your character become more powerful. - Grindy. - Replayability not great. There are three different starting areas, but the main quest and guild quests are all the same and get very repetitive if you want to make a few characters.- Officially supports ""animation cancelling"" - Though not crucial, this is a weird system you do need to learn if you want to do the maximum DPS, important for PvP or even high end PvE. Personally I find it a bit cheap and nasty - the artists spent a lot of time on the animations, don't make us cancel them! :P"
Positive,"I purchased the game recently for $9.99, which included the Morrowind DLC, after putting some hours in the game I feel like it's a definite value at that price point. I used to own this game previously on console.Having spent almost 30 hours ""completing"" the Morrowind content, I had a blast. Very rarely did anything feel like a chore, and I felt that there was a large emphasis on exploration and the lore....kind of like a Elder Scrolls game (shocker). Now I'm working on the regular main story content, and this also has been great so far. Again, at $10, if you like the Elder Scrolls series or are looking for an MMORPG with a different tone, just give it a shot and see if you like it. Even before adding in the DLCs, THERE IS SO MUCH CONTENT IN THIS GAME.The Good:Pretty good adaptation if you were going to make an MMO Elder Scrolls Game.The lore is still pretty good (not a lot of handwaving), and locations from Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim that are in the game look familiar, which pleases this old fan of the series.Gear grind doesn't start until CP160(thereabouts) so for a long time you can experiment and mix-and-match without obesssing about minmaxing (I'm 30something hours in and I'm not even Level 20. The level cap is 50 and then you progress on CP experience levels). I dislike being forced to run something a particular way for hours and hours only so that at the end game you can be stuck in a niche.Probably the best MMORPG I've played for solo players, as almost everything (non-raid/dungeon related) can be done by yourself, and the people in chat and the community are actually pretty helpful and nice(!!!).The Meh:Hotbar system. Ironically, I think it's better than Skyrim's ""pick two things"" combat system, but this is probably the part of the game that resembles a typical MMORPG the most.Non-instanced locations. I have had people sit in the main boss chamber for me to summon them, only for them to attack them so they can grind XP. I don't lose XP from them doing this, but the difficulty for those areas kinda goes to hell which is a bummer.Scaled enemy leveling. Having played before this was implemented, I'm glad that it was changed, but unlike Oblivion which had it and it was absurdly hard at times, this trends the other way and makes it too easy. You start picking up really powerful (for your level) gear as you complete quests, which means that most enemies are not too difficult. Currently I am a DPS who has some healing abilities as well, I rarely die even when doing the hardest quests.Very long dungeon queue times as a DPS, but that is par for the course with a lot of MMORPGs (specifically thinking of FFXIV).The Ugly:Sometimes you get serious lag, especially if you are in a popular area. Thankfully it's more of an issue in cities, but for instance the dolmen locations can get very crowded. Or in Cyrodill war hotspots.Occasionally get DCed from the server (appears to be a steam-only problem judging from other reviews). Dungeon Finder is still a mess, I recommend using LFG websites or even zone chat if you want to team up with people and you're not in a guild."
Positive,"This game used to be fun, even with all the minor problems, ZOSs' attempt to improve the game have only made it worse. I used to pve, but for the last 2+ years I have been in Cyrodiil, pvping and since the last MAJOR update, the game is ruined, unplayable, and so disappointing because the it was before was at least decent enough to play. I have almost 6k hour in this game, was a yearly subscriber (not anymore), because of the issues the game has now. I could deal with the random disconnects and the laginess, but what it is now is utter shit and will not recommend anyone to play it.****Update**** Zos has finally done something and fixed a good amount to the problems, its not perfect but atleast its a step in the right direction. Enough for me to recommend the game again"
Positive,I get to hang out with my friends in quarantine yay
Positive,Downloaded the 75GB file size through steam. All i got was an installer and another 40gb download. Why zenimax gotta fuck over their customers?Good game tho.
Positive,its one of the best mmo right now.
Positive,"the game keeps crashing, but other wise it's really funny"
Positive,"Me likey!Also, if you do $1/hour, this game is well worth the money."
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online is a very fun game to play by yourself or with freinds! There are quests, dungeons, guilds, alliance battles(PVP), and tons of side quests! I have been playing for 72 Hours so far and I've started my own guild. Crafting is fun, easy, and doesn't take forever to level up. A++ for graphics and soundtrack."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game that offers an incredibly immersive and thrilling gaming experience. The storyline is rich and captivating, with main and side quests that immerse you in a fantasy world of magic and mystery.The graphics are absolutely gorgeous, offering amazing landscapes and fine detail that will make you feel immersed in the game universe. The characters are well drawn and their design is very interesting and varied. Moreover, the game is optimized for a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience for all players.PvP is also very respectable in The Elder Scrolls Online, providing an intense and fun combat experience. Epic battles between players are balanced and can last for hours, giving you unforgettable moments during duels and conquering territories.The lore in general is remarkably well developed, offering a wide variety of stories and characters to discover. From The History of the Empire to the Mythology of Tamriel, you will find a huge amount of knowledge and legends in this game that will keep you guessing for hours.Crafting is another interesting aspect of The Elder Scrolls Online, which allows you to create gear and other useful items for your character. With a wide variety of skills and resources at your disposal, you'll be able to explore creative avenues of crafting to make meaningful upgrades to your character.Finally, the interactions between the players are very pleasant and interesting, offering opportunities to establish powerful alliances or to pursue quests and adventures together.

The captivating storyline, stunning graphics, intense PvP, richly developed lore, varied crafting, and meaningful player interactions make this a game not to be missedGlobal rate: 17/20"
Positive,I am a huge The Elder Scrolls Fan so i can say that only those 1.6 hours i have played this have been fucking amazing and i recommend this to anyone who is a big fan of elder scrolls or someone who likes a good action mmo game
Positive,"Really good MMORPG, despite my time dumped into this I feel I can't really give a good guage on how this is overall. I bought this years ago, and didn't like it all that much, but because World of Warcraft has started to severely drop in quality I've started to give ESO more attention. Prefer it over World of Wankcraft.Also gives a decent multiplayer Elder Scrolls vibe without entitled developers like that one Skyrim mod. Did I mention that the player housing system? It's better than Wildstar's and you have full freedom of item placement. Want a bunch of braizers upside down and floating in the middle of the entry way to your house? Go for it!10/10 Will buy all of the houses."
Positive,"As a standalone MMORPG, this game has a lot to offer, it is huge, the quests are immersive and there are a lot of things you can do, you can wield any weapon you want and wear any kind of armor you wish, it doesn't limit you in many things. I myself have been a fan of The Elder Scrolls series for a while now and to be completely frank this has been a bit of a disappointment for me in that aspect, not because I don't like the game, no, it's fun and all, but I somehow still cannot perceive it as an Elder Scrolls game, with all due respect to the lore and everything going on with the Oblivion crises and all, I've always wanted to see everything written in the Lore myself, but I guess I did not imagine seeing it in a form of MMO. I guess I don't see the Elder Scrolls world working for me as massively multiplayer kind of thing, it takes away the impact I can have on the world as an individual, co-op is as far as I would go.Nevertheless, the game itself as an MMORPG is great, it's alive, dynamic, full of so many things, the crafting is great, the combat and dungeouns are fun and overall there's always something going on everywhere you go.For that I give this game a positive review and I can see it working for many people, fans of the TES games or just regular MMORPG players, I'd reccomend you to give it a try."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Experience With Your Friends.Absolutely brilliant game, as soon as i entered the world everything felt familier and i knew exactly what i needed to do. After playing the other games i thought there might be a large learning curve for playing an mmo version. I was wrong. If you are coming over to this from the other games you will feel right at home.Again the lore is here and every step of the way is filled with books and small details about the world that just sucks you in and makes you want to play more.I couldnt praise the team enough for the fantastic job they have done here. Allowing you to play the game with your friends and keeping the core Elder Scrolls gameplay.Love It!"
Positive,"Things I love about this game:The biggest Elder Scrolls map since Daggerfall. Despite its huge size, each region has its own personal flavor and everything feels hand-crafted. You get everything from snowy climes to deserts to forests to the bizarre, alienlike Vvardenfell. Overall, the world is visually stunning if you have a decent rig to play it on.Combat starts fairly simple, but with 5 + 5 slotted abilities, passives, enchant bonuses, 2 ultimates, persistent summoned familiars it quickly becomes richly complex and interesting. Exploration is rewarded and is totally engrossing. As you explore, you discover resources, dungeons, skyshards (collect 3 to get a skill point), quests, chests, and bosses. If you get into crafting, every nook and cranny has something useful to collect for later creations.Unlike in other, offline Elder scrolls games, you can't cheaply pause the game and use stuff in your inventory. This means you have to choose your loadouts and healing items carefully, because you can't do that during combat. This keeps things interesting and high stakes. No eating 15 cheese wheels in the middle of a fight.  The healing potions themselves have cooldowns. Dungeons are highly rewarding and chaotic. If you ever wanted to face a huge onslaught of enemies and bosses with friends or even randoms using the dungeon matchmaking system, you'll love this part of the game.Returning to Vvardenfell is nostalgic yet modernized. You will recognize a lot of it if you played TESIII back in the day, but you'll be pleased with the graphical overhaul and the depth and volume within dungeons, which are much more open and grand than TESIII's, which are largely small corridors due to hardware limitations at the time. The music really adds a lot. There's hints and themes from past games, with tons of new original melodies.Fast travel is possible, but it costs in-game currency to do it, unless you find a wayshrine(a free teleportration pub that goes to other wayshrines) or boat. If you fast travel several times in a short time span, the cost increases significantly, so there's incentives to travel manually or find transport in the world rather than just quick traveling. Pathing is very good for AI. It's hard to use terrain in cheap, exploitative ways to kill powerful enemies.Things I don't love:While some quests are interesting and memorable, a lot can be a little shallow. The game is pretty poorly optimized. In crowded cities, even on my high end rig, I can hardly break 40-60 fps, whereas outside of cities I can usually keep a steady 140-144 fps keeping up with the refresh rate of my monitor. You can't turn off quest markers on the UI and map completely. This makes it possible to just click through the dialog and follow the marker instead of having to pay attention to what's happening in the quest. This makes questing feel a little dumbed down. Most areas are a little too filled with enemies for my taste. The devs seem to think you'll get bored if you're not constantly fighting something. It's a shame because constant fighting somewhat detracts from the gorgeous scenery."
Positive,Very nice very evil. 10/10
Positive,Nice. I give my soul to the scroll. Do not resist. Just accept your fate.
Positive,"I would first like to start off my review by saying this PLEASE REMEMBER THIS IS AN MMO, IF YOU COME IN EXPECTING SKYRIM ONLINE YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. With that being said, on to the review!Elder Scrolls Online is the first MMO i've ever REALLY got into besides LOTRO, now don't worry about my hours as since I launch ESO.exe and not the launcher steam doesn't track my hours because overlay isn't on, I have played this game every night till 5 am for the past week and it's still fun, let's take a look at some pros and cons!PROS:+Great Enviroment +Beautiful Graphics+Fun Combat (Not your usual tab targeting system)+Fun Quests (quests are also a con but I'll get to that)+Unique Classes, now I say this because with there being a skill tree for each weapon type it makes class abilties kinda like helpers, you can play a Nightblade(rogue class) and be a healer so you don't have to do what say the class focus is, which reminds me of skyrim as you can play anyone and be anything+Neat Story+Great PVP+Fun Dungeons +Easy and Rewarding CraftingCons:-Quests, now I listed the quests as a pro because the quests are great but as with any MMO sometimes you get the repetitive vibe and with a lot of the Daggerfall Ccovenant Quests I got that vibe hard, does that mean the game is bad? No! Not at all, but be expecting some repitition when questing.-Crafting, again I listed as a pro but it has its faults, sometimes gathering materials can be tedious and annoying, hides don't drop everytime, you don't get markers on map or compass for gather mats like Jute, but this is easily fixed by UI Addons but i still have to list it as a con because it should already be in the game-Latency, the Mega Server technology is still new so the latency a lot of times (especially peak hours) can severely hurt the gameplay, a lot of people don't have issues a lot do, me i get 50ms in every other online game except this one, so at times fighting mobs can be a pain and PVP is just not fun-PVP, you get the option to PVP at LVL 10, now even though theres others who are Veteran Rank 14 you scale up to that rank, so if you're LVL 10 your stats scale up to VR14, simple right? Unfortunately that isn't enough as you are still level 10 so you dont have access to skills a VR1-14 would have, so you can't perform well in combat so it's IMO pointless to PVP at 10, until you can have a full build you are comfortable with I would wait to PVP till 50-VR1-Race System, one of the biggest faults is dividing things up into 3 factions to make the game more like an MMO, it sucks if your friends want to be in Ebonheart Pact but you like a race in Daggerfall Covenant, you can't group and so that is not fun, this is solved by getting the Adventure Pack in the Crown store it lets you play any race with any faction and that was a preorder bonus but its still a con because it gets annoying-Guild System, the guild system is great you can join 5 guilds but guilds are alliance wide which is again great but like I mentioned you can't group with people in other alliances so why they made guilds alliance wide I'll never understandAll in all I rate this game a 8/10, go in with the mindset of skyrim online you'll hate this game, but if you love MMO's i would recommend this game, I played it during the closed beta and it sucked they have improved so much in the next year and its nice to see the developers actually making the game better, this game has a bright future ahead and I would recommend you hop in and join us."
Positive,"tl;dr- gam is gud, u shuld play if ur interestd, b2p is way 2 go, horses r xpensive lol I followed the Elder Scrolls Online for a long time through it's development, mid-2012 at the very latest. I watched countless hours of interviews, Shoddycast Elder Scrolls Online Weekly and Elder Scrolls lore videos, read the newsletters and ""Ask Us Anything"" articles on the ESO website. I built up my own hype for this game, engaging in lengthy conversations and even arguments with my friends and high school classmates about this game. I think the pinnacle of my hype came in late 2013 while watching the stream for the E3 convention. The trailer featured the voiceover of Michael Gambon, the actor who played the late Dumbledore in the Harry Potter franchise, whom I instantly recognized and which triggered me to send several texts to my friends, and a tweet or two on top of that. Following that, the coverage of Elder Scrolls Online, and my overall opinion of the game, began to slowly plummet. I was part of two weekends of beta testings, much of which I encountered bugs and glitches which did not surprise me or dissuade me in the slightest- a large MMO such as this was bound to have a good number of them. Coverage of these bugs was fairly brutal, however. But the thing that did deter me was, of course, payment. I have never, nor most likely will I ever, pay a monthly fee for access a game. $15 a month was just too much to ask for, even though I was making $11.25/hr sorting packages for FedEx. Beyond that was the announcement of the imperial edition. I was very enthralled in learning about the preorder package, coming with a sculpture of Molag Bal himself, and a nice lore-oriented  artwork book. But I was not keen on learning that the imperials became an entire race available only to those who got the imperial edition, as well as the any-race any-alliance malarkey. I had one friend who went and bought the $100 box set, recieved the plastic Molag Bal statue, the book, and the digital content, and then proceeded to pay $15 a month of his parents' money up until now. I did not buy the game at all. There came a point where I sat down and looked at my collection of Elder Scrolls games and basically gave up hope for ESO. I wasn't going to buy the game at all. Not even the game going on sale on Steam could assuage me. ESO fell from my high aspirations as a game that me and my friends could play together and enjoy to a very sat state indeed. Zenimax, as painted and portayed by the gaming media, became greedy and did not listen to the cry of the consumer. This sad affair lasted until my one friend who had bought and subscribed to ESO told me and a few other people that Elder Scrolls Online was going buy to play. My interest was rekindled in the game, and I found myself watching the cinematic trailers once again. I bought ESO a couple days before it officially went B2P for $60, the first time I had spent $60 on a single game since Skyrim. It took me two agonizing days for the download to complete, which aligned itself with my spring break. It took me four hours to come up with a name and design my new character and join the game, comparable to my past Elder Scrolls character creations. Joining the game, I soon realized that ESO has changed a fair bit since I last experienced it, it has relatively become a word I use very selectively- polished.  In this past week, I have spent 32 hours on ESO. That's a lot for me, to the point that I should be recalculating my life. But do I regret it? Not in the slightest. Elder Scrolls Online is an enjoyable experience, and feels the way an MMORPG should feel. The UI is not the main focus of the game, thankfully. I don't feel rediculous when I use hotkeys. The various quest lines do not feel linear in any way. Exploration is something I want to do. Crafting doesn't make me suicidal. PvP isn't as big of a cluster fuck as it could have been. This game feels like it belongs in the Elder Scrolls universe to me, and can be enjoyed with friends and other people. Though, I still firmly believe that Zenimax has a ways to go with this game, I can recommend playing Elder Scrolls Online to people who are as I was- fenced between the overall bad public image of the game and the incredible potential of this game. I just hope and pray that Zenimax knows what they're doing with the introduction of the crown store."
Positive,Khajiiti shisha got a bitch praising the moons.

Positive,"At the time of me posting this review I only have about 4 hours into the game. That said, this review should be taken as a ""first impressions"" sort of review until I have more time into the game and have experienced much more of it. All that said:The feel and look of the game is great. It definitely has an Elder Scrolls feel to the game and it mixes elements from a couple of the previous Elder Scrolls games and puts them into an MMO environment.The combat is pretty good, it doesn't feel really clunky and its not as much of a press a button, let the invisible dice roll, and watch your character beat up an NPC until it dies while you watch the animations. It is a bit more involved and it isn't overly boring. Graphically, it doesn't hold up to Skyrim graphics, however it is still a visually pleasing game that gives the Elder Scrolls feel. I have noticed that when I run up to NPCs or load into a new area that there is some texture pop in even though I'm running it with every setting maxed out. It's a minor issue but it is pretty distracting when it happens.The game can be as bit buggy, that said its not been anything game breaking. It was mainly NPCs kind of quickly changing directions and bouncing back and forth in a small area where they were standing/walking before they stopped as I talked to them. Again, nothing game breaking or serious, but it is quite distracting.The UI is a bit hit and miss. It's kind of clunky at first but once you get aquainted with where everything is and how to work it it quickly. Over all, not a horrible UI just takes some getting used to. That said, you are able to look at your map, inventory, journal/quest log, and pretty much everything else as you are running across the land so you can look through things as you travel to break up the monotony/get more done as you go.Overall, my impressions of the game are very good. I did not play ESO when it originally released as the idea of a sub fee and the initial reviews turned me away, at least until the game was improved. They've now made the sub an optional feature and from other reviews they have improved a good bit of what people complained about when the game released.Overall, defintely worth a shot if you like MMOs and the Elder Scrolls world/series. Do not run into this thinking its Skyrim Online, because you will be disappointed. Instead, walk into it with an open mind and realize you're going into an MMO that's based inside the Elder Scrolls world. You won't have any unrealistic expectations that way. I bought the game for $24 on sale as I was apprenhensive, even after the Tamriel Unlimited relaunch, to pay a full $60. Whether or not you are willing to wait for another sale or pay the full price is up to you. But considering what I've experienced so far, i like it. Depending on how involved I get with the game I will be considering the optional subscription. TL:DR: Solid MMO (based on first impressions) that is set in the world of Elder Scrolls. Great looking game and it's quite fun. Worth a shot if you can find it on sale."
Positive,"The only reason that I did not purchase this game when it first came out was because of the subscription fee. Now that the game can be played without a subscription if you have a copy of the unlimited version there was no longer a reason not to pick up this game.I would highly reccommend this game to anyone who enjoy games with Open World, RPG, MMO, Story Rich and Sandbox as Tags. My two favourite features about this game are the tutorial system for the game, if you have completed the tutorial once than you are offered to skip it on a second character while gaining the standard level of 3 that you would get from completing it normaly. Very helpful for people like me who play as 15-20 characters for the first few days to learn more about the classes and skills before deciding on what I want my main character to be. My second feature that I enjoy about this game is the hot swap weapons that you are able to set up at level 15 this counters the limit of only having 5 skills and an ultimate skill set up.My cons for this game are not having enough time to play and the delete system although I wouldnt change how it works since I do think it is a great idea and solves a lot of normal bot problems. It is troublesome for my method of haveing 15-20 characters to decide on what class I want to be.Overall Best MMO I have played yet and favourite Elder Scrolls game."
Positive,"Fantastic game, was weary at first to purchase this.I feel like this is a successful blend of Single Player Elder Scrolls meets MMO. I've explored countless hours viewing the landscape fighting the evil of the daedra and exploring the lore of the land. I have been doing quests that feel like quests just like I do in the other Elder Scolls Games. This is only the start of my journey, So thumbs up to Elder Scrolls OnlineI have gotten what I paid for and moreand like me if you are unsure as well just wait for a sale, looking back I would probably pay full price if it weren't on sale knowing what I have played thus far."
Positive,One of the best game ever created. :)
Positive,"Great roleplaying, fun character grinding, different ways to play, and a huge world to explore. There's always something different to do."
Positive,"Great MMO, worth the money and ESO+ is amazing. Love the cosmetics and the customization a MUST HAVE in your library."
Positive,Step 1: Buy Gold edition.Step 2: Join Dark BrotherhoodStep 3:  backstab commoners and peasants for endless hours and sell their belongings Step 4: Profit!
Positive,"Originally reviewed in 2018:Great game, best mmo I've played to date. Quality quests and voice acting with minimal grind. Spent so much time already but feels like I've barely completed any content with still so much to do, also highly recommend the latest Summerset expansion :)2024 edit: I've spent many years and hours playing this game and even after a long break I've gotten back into playing yet again (took a break from 2021 until now) and ESO is great in that it can appeal to more casual players and the super competitive, completionist types all at the same time (such as myself). Still 100% recommend it to anybody who wants to simply chill doing quests solo and fishing to relaxing music on the one spectrum to those that want to play end game vet dungeons/pvp/crafting/loot hoarding or whatever floats your fancy (or both cause why not). Did a video showing why I returned for those who may be undecided but I hope ESO is able to attract more and more players. The community is also really friendly and helpful and much less toxic from my experience compared to other online games."
Positive,"Played only for a few hours (as of 7/11/16) and I have to say that i'm impressed. The combat is not like a standard MMO, it is more like skyrim's combat system. The leveling system is limited (only a few trees to make only a few playstyles), but I find it acceptable. The graphics are satasfying, but i recomend that you download some graphics mods on the nexus. VERDICT/RATING (so far): 8.5/10"
Positive,"Made the transfer from Xbox to PC and PC is by far superior, I have to say the lack of load times is a pleasant change, the add ons are a sweet treat and I have to say I think the folks are somewhat nicer and more organized. Enjoyable. glad they had the packages/bundles on sale too.Update: 2023 has been pleasant. My only complaint is that the in game currency is extremely inflated. Thankfully, almost everything is obtainable without purchase."
Positive,"Its a different type of MMO that has gone more towards an ARPG style. If you're not a WoW player and would like to get into MMos, this is the one to aim for. 8.5/10"
Positive,"Bought the game about week before membership wasn't required, haven't stopped playing since!"
Positive,"Switched from xbox to PC. The grind is real again to get to where I was, but well worth it!"
Positive,"Mostly positive experience with this game.+ Quality graphics that run well even on slightly older machines (like mine)+ Very good tutorial systems to get you into the game quickly+ Crafting missions (certifications) easily introduce you to each trade+ Highly immersive story based missions that can change the game as you play+ Weapon and ability skill system reminiscient of the single player ES games and well executed in the MMO environment- Ran afoul of the crashing bug requiring the use of OpenGL drivers over D3D11, this caused a slight framerate drop- UI add-ons are almost required to get the most out of the game*-> *Examples include no built in mini-map, no built in spam (gold-seller) filtering, experience and resource (health, mana, stamina, ability) bars are not persistant and can often fail to appear when they would be useful.To be fair the crashing bug, while persistant over several patches, seems to affect a minority of players and there has been some indication that the develpoment team is trying to find solutions. Unfortunately the solutions over the last couple of patches seem to help some players while creating problems for others.While UI add-ons make the game easier they are by no means required and you can make your way through the game quite well without them.Overall I would say this is an excellant game that has the potential for a reasonably long life as far as MMO's go provided the dev team can get it stabilised/optimised a little better."
Positive,"It's pretty good for an MMORPG game, just beware: GET READY TO GRIND if you want to play this game.+ Pretty good and diverse leveling and gear.+ Lots of different monsters I have never seen in elder scrolls games that make the game fun.+ Good quests for a MMORPG game.- GRIND, GRIND, GRIND and GRIND for everything, from armor to weapons, levels.- Everything is really expensive so you WILL HAVE TO GRIND (housing, gear ect.) or $$$ your way through it.- Expansions, additions and everything costs $ (I personally have an ESO+ subscription but I understand that that's not an option for everyone. I bought this game and the subscription expecting to poor hours of my time into this game)- Steam is weird as to buying expansions for this game. Since morrowind is no longer purchasable through steam so you have to do it through the in-game crown store. And steam sometimes says that I need to have the base game of Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited, even though I have bought the Gold Edition that includes it... So my general thoughts as far as the game itself are that: it's pretty good. BUT regarding the steam and the crown store it seems weird to me and I do not like how much I have to grind or pay in order to get housing or something like that (but I still expected that given that it's a MMORPG game). Still prefer games like FO:NV or Oblivion though, but that's just my honest opinion."
Positive,still better than BFA
Positive,"I picked this game up for 10 dollars solely to play it singleplayer. For that it's alright. Some places look even better than locals in skyrim.However, past the shiny surface, if skyrim was an ocean with the depth of a paddling pool, ESO is an ocean with the depth of a water molecule when it comes to singleplayer. The mmo mechanics still worsen the game."
Positive,"The world design and architecture of this game is beyond amazing and has always been a source of inspiration for my day to day life , the quests have never felt repetitive and the public dungeons are quite fun to do because of the memento rewards and so on , the instance dungeons i can do without because they aren't really considered challenging but what can you really expect in solo based instances in terms of difficulty so i don't really mind, oh did i talk about the music ? my god the soundtrack of this  game is nothing short of incredible, every staff related to the art direction for this game need to have a raise. I really hope this game will have this same positive flow of productivity for years to come."
Positive,"This game is top quality here and there some bugs but it has content for everyone if you like pvp you can do that, if u like pve u can do that aswell, if you are solo player dont want to do mmo stuff pve or pvp only want to do questing you can do that aswell, quests are very interesting  and voice acting is top top notch i have been playing this game for over 2-3 years now the amount of improvement Zos did over this game is amazing, yes graphics are bit on old but this game is over 5 years old thats to be expected otherwise this game is perfect zos release regular updates of new content and improvement  ill rate this game 9999/100"
Positive,"I love ESO! Its one of my fav games along side Skyrim, Even tho this isn't ¨Skyrim. Online¨Tho its hard to get into at first because there is so many things to do and you can get lost in it all. I think its worth giving it a shot!I personally love that there is a lot of things to do for example:Perfecting your craftig skills, Making the perfect build for Pvp/pve, Collecting items and become a merchant, hunt for achivements, Be one with the shadows like a stealth god, explore! enjoy all the many quests in all of Tamriel! And my favourite thing decorating your houseTBH its kinda sad that this game started out with horrible reviews. The reason why I didnt buy the game earlier was because of these bad reviews, and my friends said it simpely wasen't worth it.BUT i am so glad they have turned it around! because it has grown into something spectacular! and its only getting better with new events, dlcs and other cool things :DAnd i have to mention this: the people playing this game are super friendly. You can make many new friendships and get help easily :)Hope to see you in Tamriel in the future!"
Positive,"This is, in all truth, a real estate game wrapped in RPG elements.I love it."
Positive,It's like 2:00 in the morning and i'm putting way too much effort in to trying to think of something to writeYeah sure buy it why not go on treat yourself you deserve it mabey
Positive,"ESO is my first MMO, and probably the last I'll ever try.Not because it's bad, but because i'm addicted to it. I enjoy it so much i don't want to try any other MMO anytime soon.+ beautiful landscapes (graphics are awesome)+ very rich lore+ variety of quests+ skill system (a lot of skill lines to develop according to your preferences, including crafting, attacks, defense and healings)+ veteran skill system (past lv50, you get access to 90 new skills to develop)+ crafting (6 crafts with a lot of different styles, materials and aspects)+ guild merchants (market system between players to sell/buy weapons, armors, crafting materials, etc)+ 3 different factions, each having an environment very different from the others (architecture, flora, etc)+ possibility to explore another faction, once the main quest is finished in your character's faction+ dungeons and bosses :D- city lags (some cities are extremely laggy, with freezes every 2 secs and loading screens in the middle of the city)- daily crafting quests, rank 9+, to turn in a faction zone you can't access before having already explored the 2 other factions' zones- a few boring quests to complete (a lot of running and talking involved, not much action)- not enough Caldwelli threw my amulette at an angry squelette, and lost it forever"
Positive,"UPDATE: Nearly 6 years later, I still stand by this review.Initally, I had my doubts about this game. I was torn between the love I have for the other Elder Scrolls games and the fact that I tried to get away from MMOs years ago due to communities becoming more and more toxic. Everyone who says not to walk into this expecting another Skyrim is right. It has a similar feel (obviously) but it's definitely not the same. Overall, the game is wonderful, and many of the community members are pleasant, friendly, and patient. If you're worried, wait for a free weekend or at least a sale. If you like MMOs and the Elder Scrolls lore, pick this up. You won't regret it."
Positive,"I've only played this game for 140 hours.I literally dream about it when I'm not playing it, so if you aren't ready for it to take over you maybe don't get it."
Positive,"The game's good, but it has too many paywalls."
Positive,Recently got back to this game and it's still one of the best MMOs I've played. Great quests amd storylines!
Positive,"After about 500 hours in Skyrim and about 20 hours in ESOGE I can tell that ESO is a better game. They are both epic, however simply stumbling upon some real person about to get their rear end kicked and then helping out to turn the tide in their favor is surprisingly satisfying. There is so much to do in this game that it is beyond the price of admission. It is not Skyrim Online, and does not need to be. It shines on its own merits."

Positive,"ESO is a good game, has enough Skyrim, and Oblivion in it to make it a good elder scrolls. But, it also has good enough multiplayer, PVP, and other things that make it an MMORPG. Overall game is pretty good but it is another skill per press type of game, combos are a thing but only the effects that stack nothing more,  graphics as good as you can expect.This game gets a 5 star rating."
Positive,"While I can only imagine I've barely touched the true surface of this games depth, I can only say, I love it.So, first off, it really isn't Skyrim 2. So, don't expect to play like you would on it. I'd also suggest finding friends who play, as teams, while not vital, will often prove more useful then anything else. Maybe, the tank and support. Or, close range, and distance, the usual run of the mill RPG sterotypes.The game looks and feels like you'd expect. Not all of Tamriel is explorable like we were lead to believe. But, this is still, a pretty sizable map. I'm not saying there's as much stuff as the Oblivion, or Skyrim map, but still, pretty sizable. Lots to see and do while still new to the game.I did a lot of, let's call it ""research"" before I bought it. I'd suggest the same. It'll take a fair amount of time to get anywhere (progession wise). And if you play like me, only a few hours at a time, I can only imagine this game will take me a while to fully enjoy.Do your homework before you buy. Always. I myself don't really trust game reviews, like IGN or Gameinformer, as everybody elses ideal mmorpg is vastly different. The quests, admittedly are a bit... average. Go here, kill these, report back. Go here, collect this, come back. Go there and report to that one dude. That's the quests. But, meh. Still enjoyable for a noob."
Positive,It's ok. It's an MMORPG with TES lore. Don't expect Skyrim Multiplayer.
Positive,Spent 10 hours playing the game still don't know what I am doing.... What are you supposed to do?Welcome to Elder Scrolls Online.
Positive,"I bought this three days before writing this review. Having played 33 hours, not including downloading through the launcher, I regret nothing. No ragrets, not one letter."
Positive,Has come a long way since the beta
Positive,"the whole continent of quests and adventures (without console commands and save-load exploits)despite a bad start, the game is very good today"
Positive,Realy love skyrim but this game its realy amazing )
Positive,Back in the saddle again.  I loved playing many many hours on Skyrim and now I can ride all over in Elderscrolls...I love exploring and finding all the hidden chests...it is also so much more fun to play with a friend...Thanks
Positive,"Back when the game first came out, things were unbalanced. Monsters were too weak and too strong, things only dropped one gold, and bosses were impossible to quest as they were farmed as soon as they spawned.If the eso that exists now had existed back then, I dont think i would have played anything else for months.If you ever though about picking the game up (Now down to 20$ and no sub needed), theres no better time to start than now."
Positive,"- get some amazing weapons and gear for your noob level- level up a bit to see your amazing weapons and gear turn to trash- start grinding to max rank to get max rank drops- get bored halfway- run around teabagging random weebs while taking selfies- buy some crown crates, get utter junk and rage-quit 10/10"
Positive,i have a very unhealthy obsession with this game.
Positive,"A very fun MMO with an interesting and gripping combat system, a very enjoyable community, a gigantic map and quite literally hundreds of well written enjoyable quests"
Positive,"Overall ESO is a fun mmo, it has an easy learning curve especially for players who have played other mmo's consistently, the community is very welcoming and the gameplay mix between pve and pvp has a good balance. The servers can have severe lag at times in pvp due to the high amount of players in pvp particularly cyrodill pvp. In my opinion this is a subscription based game like WoW due to all of the quality of life perks ESO+ offers with its access to dlcs (non-chapters), more bank space and the almighty crafting bag which will make life a lot easier."
Positive,"I'm not really a fan of MMO's usually, but this feels exactly like stepping into any other Elder Scrolls game. If you want to journey with a friend, great - but it's quite simple to just treat as single player too. It's big, it's beautiful and there is PLENTY to do!"
Positive,"One of the most important parts of any game to me is story. ESO is part of a almost 30 year history of telling stories. I love how the game is now chapter based which can be year long story-archs. The game play is easy to start with but like all great MMO's and RPGs, easy to play, difficult to master. The game feels very well footed and balanced and yet new with a very open future ahead full of all kinds of adventures.The game does have micro-transactions. I have never felt punished for not taking advantage of them. ESO does micro-transactions and subscriptions correctly. Pay for what you want to play, and there's always way more to play for free."
Positive,"I got my hands on this game after years and years of Asian MMOs. At first everything was so confusing, I felt lost without boob physics, quests that made no sense, grinding same mob for weeks straight and faceroll combat. /sarcasm over I have to say this is one of the most polished, incredibly well-done MMORPGs I have ever played. For maybe the first time I got involved with the story and I actually read what characters  said. Alright, good enough for intro, let's get into the actual review.Well let's be honest it is not the newest and most shiny title ever but it has the Skyrim graphics feel to it. I would say solid 6/10. Your PC will handle this.Second thing I enjoyed the most in this game. You do spam quests while leveling BUUUT *drum roll* they actually make sense and I have not yet seen a ""kill 5 wolves"" type. Also, after you finish questline the world around you changes accrodingly so you do have some influence, every quest is voiced as well. Quests are tied and it makes them awesome. 10/10First MMORPG I came across where crafting actually matters. A lot. After time you get to craft better gear than quests give you and crafted gear is entirely viable in end game. On the other hand, if you do not wanna craft life will be kinda hard (you gotta ask someone to do all this for you). 8/10I played the sorcerer and I gotta say I enjoyed it a lot. You gotta manage your resources and it is not a faceroll yet fast enough to entertain you. Skills are flashy and nice, 9/10    World scales to your level. If you wanna play with lvl 1 friend do not worry, your attacks will scale and you can play as if you were same level. How cool is that?    You can be vampire/werewolf!    Trading only in guilds, supports socialization somewhat.    Random world events/bosses.    Playing with friends is great, all the content can be done in group, only main story quests are solo (so I skip 'em :P)    World is ALWAYS filled with people and you are almost never alone.    Every class can be any role. Use any weapon. Use any armor. Started mage but wanna tank instead? Does not matter, get some heavy armor, throw some skill points into defensive abilities and there ya go.  Some quests make you run back and forth like madman.  I am only in middle game but being healer kinda sucks, nearly all classes have good self heal and I can just you know stand there.  Queues really long for DPS (expect up to 20 mins, depends when do you play). Extremely low for healer/tank (matter of seconds).  Horse is a MUST. You will struggle without this big time, costs lots of money.  Something I *REALLY* dislike. Since all instances are full of people sometimes you come to a delve (some public dungeon for story) and not only everything is dead and some people camp for boss to spawn, you sometimes  see someone finish him before you make it and then you gotta wait to kill him again, kinda breaks immersion with the quests, huh.   If you do not research traits early on you will be doomed in end game. Wow that is an incredibly badly organized review I wrote there trying to find a reason not to study for finals.Anyway I would say go for it if you love TES and MMOs!"
Positive,"A great MMO with a bit of usual grinding, Less than most MMOs out there, Not pay2win, If only loading screen times could be fixed along with the 2 hours downloading when you first launch the game it would be perfectand its not skyrim, its an mmoIf you are considering picking it up, buy it while its on sale.You are probably reading this because you are interested in MMOs, Or because you played elder scrolls before but get this:This is not skyrim or any elder scrolls gameThis is pure MMO experience, its not like skyrim at all so if you just came here to play another skyrim you can close the page -Not Pay2win-Less grinding than most MMOs-You can download mods aka Addons to change the UI-Great crafting system, one of the best i have experienced-Easy to play if you are not familiar with MMOs-PVP is actually fun-a lot of build possibilities-Replaying the game with another character and build is fun-A lot of races with different buffs to each race available-Housing system-Leveling depends on what equipment you have and what skills you have slotted, Its really good-Nice community, a lot of people helped me when i started-Lore-Enemy scaling, You will never feel powerful until really really late game, And you will never feel weak, Its kinda strange when you first play the game and progress-Prices of stuff are different in each guild, If you want to sell something for 100 gold it may sell on another guild for 150 gold-Classes aren't completely balanced in pvp, Some classes have huge self sustain and can deal shit ton of damage at early game like templar, while nightblade can't do that much against him early game, Same applies in PvE-L O A D I N G  S C R E E N S are the biggest problem in this game, it may take you 5 seconds to load in some areas but sometimes it extends to 3 minutes or more, sometimes infinite loading screens-2 Hours downloading in the patcher so you can't refund it when you launch the game first-Sometimes you will meet people while queuing for a random dungeons who marks himself as a healer while in reality he is not, kinda ruins some dungeons especially there is a cooldown between each queue you do-First person completely sucks and gives you the biggest disadvantage in both PvE and PvP you can only play in third person if you want to play effectively-Bosses are just normal monsters but with bigger models, no custom models whatsoeverBuy it if you are an MMO and economy fan, You won't regret it."
Positive,"This is my first MMO, and I was hesitant to purchase it because I had seen many friends play popular MMO's before and did not like what I saw. I've been an avid elder scrolls fan since Morrowind for Xbox, and was excited to hear about this release. Some friends play the beta and didn't recommend it. But it went on sale for Christmas last year and I had enough funds in my steam wallet so I said why not?! So glad I did! It's not really what I expected from an MMO (which was mostly negative before) and it's not quite the same as most of the other elder scrolls games preceding it (although a fresh approach was definitely nice!) you know the layout I'm talking about: run around, help rando's find their lost kitty, help other rando's assassinate their cheating spouse, accomplish side quests for factions that may or may not be more fun than the main quest which you never know if it will end up being very underwhelming and/or tedious, but at least feeling like the money spent on the game had been worth it...TESO has definitely been all those things and , I feel, totally worth it. It has all those elements quintessentially elder scrolls with that odd [to me] MMO gameplay style that lends something fresh to the elder scrolls experience.Sometimes other players can be of noxious and even downright rude, but my experience has been that the overwhelming majority of them are helpful or just leave you alone to do your thing in Tamriel, and there are countless guilds to join up with, meet new friends who love the elder scrolls series as much as you do, or or for you to teach them how!I definitely recommend this amalgamation of MMO and elder scrolls to anyone looking to experience the series for the first time and for seasoned older scrolls fans alike. I won't pretend it's perfect, and there are plenty of things I wish it had that it doesn't, but at the end of the day this exists for entertainment and when I'm asked if I am not entertained, I must say I absolutely am, every time I log on!"
Positive,"Do not buy this expecting a ""Skyrim With Friends"" game.This game is an awesome MMORPG. One with a The Elder Scrolls theme.There are plenty of things to do.I am yet to delve too deep into the PvP, but I have mostly been doing PVE and questing. This game contributes largely to the lore, more than some main TES titles did.From the little I played of PvP, one thing is certain: you must have seperate builds for both PvE and PvP. One is not really good in the others setting."
Positive,The Game gives you a good mmo experiance with the option of having a monthly pay or not or just buy the expansions your want or dlc content.
Positive,"first time playing this mmo, after years of playing WoW and FFXIV, its nice and different  in its own ways, and also the story so far is fun, deff a nice change if one is looking for a break from other things"
Positive,So 10 mins in and I can already tell It takes $$$ to hold anything. Otherwise Not bad. Free weekend. Likely will buy the game if Someone wants to babysit my kids for a few years.
Positive,"Very GW2-esk style of gameplay type of feel. Beautiful graphics, tons of content to expiriance and a fantastic player base!"
Positive,Not to bad but is a little slow at the start.
Positive,"I bought this during the Summer Sale , I played this in 2012 during the Closed Beta . Was super Hyped till it was Subscribtion based , Now its a 1 time Payment . After 4 Years i got in again . Fell in Love all over again and can't stop playing enough of this . 10/10 Would buy this for friends once my Raise comes in :D"
Positive,"People are going to hate me for saying this for reasons I don't understand, but ESO is the best MMORPG game out there right now. New, interesting content is constantly being added."
Positive,"This game is a 1st/3rd person MMORPG, where you can switch between 1st and 3rd person perspectives. Unlike TESV:Skyrim (that uses left and right click for attacking, casting or blocking), TESO uses the left click to attack and right click to block, paired with Skills (which can be used by pressing the Skill keys 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and R, where R is the Ultimate) and Q quickslot to instantly use potions or food. Still the commands are pretty much different from most MMORPGs, as you don't have auto-attack. What makes this game much different from TES main games are the Classes (despite also existing in games like TESIV) and the Skill Trees, each Class has 3 different Subclasses in form of skill trees (e.g. the Nightblade class has Assassination, Shadow and Sinphoning subclasses). The Skill Tree has a huge array of sections: a skill tree for each subclass, each weapon, each armor, each crafting type, and the list goes on. Yet you can use your skill points on any unlocked skill from any skill tree section. For an MMORPG, this game is unique, setting itself appart from other MMORPG games.TESO has a huge world map to explore, still some regions in Tamriel haven't been released yet (e.g. the other half of Skyrim area, which goes from Whiterun to the Reach), althought there exist some closed gates prepared for upcoming regions. Speaking of regions, they have a smaller scale when compared to the TES main games (you may notice it when you visit Cyrodiil or The Rift), it isn't a mainline game but such areas as the ones I mentioned might seem unconfortable in a way. Like TES main games you have the 9 races (10 if you buy the Imperial edition), however there are 3 factions and each one is composed by 3 races, this is crutial since the region where you start depends on which faction you take, which depends on what race you choose (unless you buy the Imperial edition, where you can be on any faction with any race). The NPCs have awesome voice dialogues, despite missing the option to have subtitles like the two previous TES games. The graphics sound quite good, but the camera and the way it graphically looks is slightly less dynamic than TESV:Skyrim, but is more dynamic than TESIV:Oblivion (I would say a hybrid between both). The only thing that mocks every player in TESO is the loading screen followed by the graphics rendering. Some loading screens tend to take some time and after the loading screen ends the area starts rendering, then it continues rendering more stuff as far as you keep going (if you are feeling laggy when running then stop and let the area around you to render, otherwise you'll face another loading screen). The objects/models/textures will start as unpolished graphics and they will take few seconds to render to its finest, some objects will take time, some others will render instantly after loading. Note that TESO will automatically adjust its visual settings according to your computer specs once you run it for the first time on your computer.  You have the Crown Store where you can spend Crowns that you've charged on your account. There is no Pay2Win, since all items that you can purchase on the Crown Store are: experience boosters, skilltree/stat resets and vanity/aesthetical items (costumes, pets and mounts). The DLCs can be purchased on the Crown store too, aswell as the Imperial expansion (for those who didn't buy the Imperial edition). I would say, however, that there are too many small DLCs to buy on the Crown Store, which might sound annoying for players either doing all the DLC Dungeon content or the whole solo storyline on Zone content. Otherwise you can opt to pay a monthly subscription (called ""ESO Plus"") to earn more experience than usual, earn 1500 Crowns per monthly subcription and gain access to every available DLC.In all, I would give it a 8/10."
Positive,"Edit (~2 years later):I have to admit, it's really fun again. Although ball groups still completely lag out the server during peak PvP hours, the PvP is really fun again, and generally performance is WAY better than it used to be. Most of the time, even in CP campaigns, the game is actually playable again. Just get a couple of friends and make builds that aren't trash, stick together, and you'll have a lot of fun.Old Review:Game is complete trash now. Laggy to the point that it's unplayable when there are ball groups (especially) or zergs nearby. As a solo player, unless you play the meta you'll find yourself easily being ganked from stealth by two dragon knights hiding at resources, and shit like that. It's just a huge waste of time even though it's still free. I used to pay for this game and play it a ton when it was good, but it's gone progressively downhill for years and it's finally at rock bottom for me. It's just not fun at all. It's a grief machine."
Positive,"I got the game a while ago, but finally really got into playing it just a couple of weeks ago. Let me say, the game has its flaws, but it is fun, I love that the world scales with your level, so the challenge is constant. You won't get bored even when you come back to beginner areas. The community also seems friendly, which is a big plus for me."
Positive,Its LIke SKYRIM but better... Great MMO. Got it on sale and no regrets...
Positive,I love it!
Positive,"Sort of revolutionary game in MMORPG genre. I could say it's not even MMORPG but just regular TES game slightly simplified for online. This game has all benefits that make us to love The Elder Scrolls: great plot, lore stories, world atmosphere. You are free to do everything you did in previous games and be whoever you wanna be. None of another popular MMO gаmes allow you to make role-playing desicions throughout completing quests, to be declared as a criminal or vice versa to bring the justice by yourself and punish thiefs and murderers for reward. Quests are not about killing tons of monsters (at least while you are low-level, I'm currently 10) but you should speak with NPCs and explore the world, even in dungeons you can just sneak through the enemies and complete the quest peacefully, still getting exp and level up. In sum, you can play TESO just like you did in Morrowind, Oblivion or Skyrim, with the exception of other players who play next to you. Because of that I wanna call this game 'Online RPG' not 'MMORPG'. In MMO like WoW etc you usually set your goal to level up faster, to reach level cap and be the strongest player on server, to get the best equip etc but in TESO I want to play slowly and relaxed, to read every lore book on my way and listen all the NPC's dialogues. Btw, how much MMO's have totally voiced dialogues? =) Just another score for TESO. So this is must-have game if you are the fan of TES series or just wanna try new experience in online games in spite of high price and quite low popularity among MMO players. 9/10 and strongly recommended."
Positive,"Downloading Update/Patching/""Maintenance[IN PROGRESS]"" simulator."
Positive,This game is going to ruin my life
Positive,"Overall an amazing game. The main story is very good better than most other MMOs i've played, the side quests feel significant, with the funniest interactions coming from them. (Everything is voice acted which is amazing)The Dungeons can be challenging on Veteran (DLC ones) and Trials are challenging and a fun experience/challange to overcome.The best part must be the PvP aspect, Cyrodil is simply amazing, massive open zone where the 3 factions clash against one another, being able to invade keeps using siege weaponry, being able to destroy walls or ramm through a keep door is an amazing experience.I very much recommend it. it's the kind of game you can play for a very long time and never really grow tired of it."
Positive,really makes you feel like an elder scrolls.
Positive,"I've never been a fan of MMOs but figured that I would try this one. As you can tell from my hours played, this game consumed a good portion of my life. I regret nothing. I rocked the story, made some great frinds and learned how to use teamspeak playing this game. There is never any need to actually pay for anything on game but I of course had so much fun, I felt that more purchases were much earned. Beatiful scenery, great story and a plethora of lore make this game a work of art."
Positive,"This is a uniqe MMOPRPG that utilizes a lot of other game's features that give it it's own unique playstyle.  The leveling experience is outstanding.  There's no rush to end game content and most everything scales with you, with the exception of some higher end quests, but that only means you need a group to complete it.  There are dungeons you can take advantage of at level 10, along with a free mount, and other goodies that make running everywhere a little more bearable.  The artwork is beautiful but the flow of how the characters move and interact with things could use an update... the artwork is 2018 quality while the mechanics are still in 2008, but it's still enjoyable.The only thing that bothers me about this game is that it can be pay to play to obtain any vanity items or aesthetics you'd really like to have (like mounts, costumes, DLCs) as well as experience gains for different attributes.  It is what it is and things like this are what keeps an MMO going, but I kind of wish they would introduce packages more that would make it ""worth buying"", like a set with a costume, WINGS even?, and mount, or costume, mount, and pet?Either way, it's an overall fun game with lots to do.  It's like Runescape and Warcraft had a baby and took all of their best features and called it ESO.**EDIT***So I've been playing ESO for a week now (not new to the Elder Scrolls and have played since Morrowind, but just new to ESO as an MMO) and I have to comment on the community.  Literally everyone is helpful.  Sure, in every game you have one or two bad apples from time to time and you just have to ignore them, but the second I have a question, BOOM, there's 1-4 answers from different people imediately in /zone chat.  I got into a decent trading guild pretty quickly as well and have made quite a bit of gold for myself through it, so guilds are definitely a good feature to take advantage of!  I've already made quite a few ""friends"" and everyone's just been so nice and helpful with all of my daunting questions lol.  Definitely don't be afraid to ask for help!  You don't know what kind of amazing people you'll meet here until you do!"
Positive,The One Tamriel update changed this game and MMOs forever. Absolutely everyone should try this game. Especially if you have ever liked MMORPGs.
Positive,This will be always my favorite MMORPG of all time.
Positive,"Great game, awesome quests, very addicting, and great community. Need I say more? A ridiculous amount of content... worth every penny. If you're thinking about it, just do it."
Positive,"182 hours later I have hit endgame and can treat this like a mobile game, researching traits while taking a well needed break"
Positive,Could be worse.
Positive,"After a thousand hours of wandering, exploring, and battling in war-torn Tamriel I give this a conclusive thumbs up. »─> »»─>"
Positive,Terrible MMO but fucking addicting for all the wrong reasons.
Positive,If you want refreshing story driven MMORPG this game is for you
Positive,"There is a giant learning curve to this game that many people veer away from when initially playing. I was lucky enough to have friends that could guide me through the game but even if you don't this game has a great community that is willing to help those that are lost or don't even know where to begin. You will find yourself slowly sinking in more and more hours as you get a hang of the game only to realize that you're (I am) 300+ hours into gameplay and only have scratched the metaphorical surface of this game's potential even without the Morrowind upgrade. It can feel kinda ""Grindy"" at times but some people are ok with this depending on your playstyle. Great optimization but kinda sketchy servers at times of high traffic. Otherwise, a pretty solid game9/10"
Positive,I got all my trading cards while waiting for the launcher to download the actual game 10/10
Positive,ESO is a good game but it is boring to level up since it takes a lot of time to get to max lvl. This game is without a doubt more fun with friends that you can level up with. The community is really friendly and helpful but other players will rather stay alone than try to make friends with you since their friends are already playing the game and won't need more friends. In short this game is like other MMORPG games and takes a lot of your time and will take time to know what you really should be doing and how. Luckily there are youtube videos and other sources to give you information as long as you are willing to search for it.
Positive,"The game is fantastic. Very beautiful locations and scenery. Lots of things to do and see. Depending on the number of users online, the gameplay can lag a bit, as expected. I would definately recommend this game."
Positive,it good game
Positive,"BEST MMO TO THIS DATE! At first it was not very good, recently i heard some hype how good this game got so i decided to give it another try and i am HOOKED!!! They did a great job! Definitly worth the money!!"
Positive,"Most of my playtime is on PS5.MMO for adults.Pros:- Great graphics.- TES lore. Tons of it. See characters and locations you've read about in books- Single-player friendly- Great stories/plots/characters- Hundreds of hours of story content alone- Epic dungeons and group content- Best in class housing system- Best in class fashion system- Horizontal progression (if you like it)- Allows you to completely ignore whole chunks of it. Don't want to do group content? No problem, it has its own gear anyway! Don't want to interact with other players? No problem, play the game as a single player experience. Don't want to play single player, just want to join a guild chat and do some 4 or 12 group PVE content? Feel free to do that too! Define your own way for this game to be enjoyable for you and it will ""adjust"" to fit your preferences.Cons:- PVP is broken to the level of non existing- Story content is too easy after the Tamriel Unlimited update- Developers become increasingly more greedy with paid content, and especially lootboxes- Subscription only craft bag without which game is almost unplayable- All classes feel too similar, traditional MMO archetypes tank and healer are not solo-friendly.9/10. Do recommend if you are looking for a chill beautiful game, ready to spend money in it, like TES lore and isn't looking for any serious challenge. Start playing this game singleplayer and slowly discover MMO in it on your own, don't rush it."
Positive,"I've put more than 40 hours in this game in one week. Never knew I'd be into mmos but I guess you never know. Buy this game, you wont regret it."
Positive,"Beautiful world design, intricate combat mechanics and no boring animation lock outdated MMO gameplay. I've been playing since the launch and every time i came back to this game i gain even more enjoyable memories. Community can be competitive but the majority is there to have fun. There's something for everyone in this game. From crafting to fishing, from pvp to pve, from achievement hunting to questing, ESO is full of content to explore and enjoy on your own pace.But of course there's always cons when a game is this big... ESO has been suffering from lag and server issues for years now. Depending on your location, lag can change your experience in the worse ways. PvP suffers the most, during large scale battles, lag can lead to not being able to fire your skills, break from a stun or change skill bars. Although they have been working on the issue for awhile now, there hasn't been a permanent fix yet.Other than the lag, rest of the problems might not affect you at all, depending on what you're looking for in this game. Balance can be a big issue with this game, but it's very different for PvE and PvP since the performance of builds and classes varies depending on the content. An example would be the current state of magicka nightblade. It's very strong in PvE but it's been on the decline for a while in PvP. But the power diffence between classes, races etc. doesn't mean the ones on the low can't perform well enough. ESO allows you to play however you want and you can succeed with almost any setup as long as you understand the game mechanics.Overall, a great MMO experience. It's worth your money if you have the time to explore this massive game. At it's current state it's an 8/10 in my honest opinion."
Positive,"I have been playing this game off and on for 5 years now and I absolutely love this game, there is just so much content. Every time I come back from a break in playing there are new improvements that make the game even better. The modding community is alive and strong and there's a mod for almost everything. There are several events a year that allow you to get XP bonuses and cosmetics/collectibles. Tons and tons of achievements. Three PvP modes. Group events, solo events, solo arena, 4 man arenas, 4 man dungeons, 12 man trials(raids). Lots of guilds for any play style. Lots of room for build creativity since you can play any class on any race and there are a large amount of armor sets. The crafting is rewarding (and lucrative) with lots of collectible crafting styles. Guild trading system that constantly improves. FISHING!! Lots of collectible houses and a furnishing system. The game itself is gorgeous and rich with content, almost all NPCs you can speak with even if they aren't part of any quest (even during low traffic times it never feels lonely or empty).I would like to address some of the criticism from other reviews:- Server bugs/lag/connectivity/log in queueWhile I've experience my fair share of these issues in the last 5 years I don't feel as though it's any worse than any other large MMO. It's very easy to report a bug in game and most major bugs get fixed quickly. For other bugs a quick google can usually help you bypass it if needed. The log in queues only happen when a content comes out or the start of an event because of a large spike in players, it's not an every day thing. Someone else also pointed out that the lag depends where you are relative to the servers which unfortunately there are only two.- ""Money hungry company""I feel like people say this about literally any game... $15 for an OPTIONAL sub is very reasonable and comparable to other MMOs. I hate to burst anyone's bubble but it costs more money to host and maintain these GIANT content rich servers and people buying the game for $6 does not cover that. Not to mention the free content and improvements for the base game that are frequently released. If you can only afford the base game and no sub there is still plenty of content and opportunities for free cosmetic items. Also I would like to mention that ZOS allows people to trade in game gold for crowns from other players (at your own risk, be careful) so it is possible to get crowns for cosmetic items without spending real money.- Subscription systemYes, it is true especially if you like to craft that it's very challenging to play without the ESO+ subscription that gives you the craft bag, particularly starting out when you don't have much bag space. Even with max bag and bank space you won't have enough room to hold items for ALL the crafting types because there are simply too many. I believe ESO+ at $15 a month USD is very worth it not just for the craft bag but for all the benefits including access to all the DLC apart from the most recent release and monthly crowns. However if you cannot afford the subscription as I wasn't able to for the early years of playing, there are work around through mods such as making mule characters and using an inventory manager to move items around quicker. It's difficult but not impossible.- Paid DLC/ChaptersFirst of all there is tons of content in the base game, as well as free mini DLC's that have been added over the years. People complaining that you have to pay for DLC must be new to internet because that's just how it works. If you plan to play competitively you will likely want to buy some of them to get dungeon/trial armor you need, however again with the option to trade gold for crowns from players (again, be careful) it's not impossible to acquire them. They also go on sale in the crown store occasionally, plus if you buy the game on a new account you can get most of the old DLC bundled for a reasonable price. Personally I like to wait for about 6 months for the newest chapter to go on sale.- Crown crate systemThere are some items you can buy outright with crowns, but most of the items are acquired through crown crates which is a ""mystery bag"" style item system. If you want something very specific then it may end up costing you a lot because of the RNG aspect but depending on the tier of the item, you also get crown gems which allow you to buy items from the crates specifically. It does feel a bit like a money grab system but it's cosmetics only... ESO+ gives you enough crowns for 8 crates a month I believe, plus the option to trade gold for crowns from players (again, be careful lol), as well as free crate drops occasionally on Twitch.TL;DR - This game is well worth the money due to the amount of varied content, mods make it even better, subscription is worth the money if you have it, if you don't you can still work around most things, lazy/greedy people will complain about anything. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk."
Positive,Did you know that ESO stands for Electric Shîte Orchestra?->Definitely recommended
Positive,"I started playing on April 6, it is now May 31st. I have 156 hours. I am editing this review, it is June 30th and I now have 237 hours. This is without a doubt the best game I have ever played and I recommend everyone to try this game. The stories are amazing, the voice acting is amazing, the graphics are amazing, the dungeons and trials are brilliant, PvE and PvP are thrilling, there isn't a single fault I could find for this game albeit the lag I face sometimes.My friends now all hate me cus i spend more time in ESO than in real life or with my friends, and my girlfriend is starting to get annoyed too but who cares because in ESO I live like a king.Try this game, you won't regret it. And if you do, add me in game @FatBrownKid"
Positive,One of the best MMOs out there. Lots of content. Neat combat system. Great social systems.
Positive,Its just fucking amazing.
Positive,"Big nice game, get it now!"
Positive,I only have 100 hours in and relatively not very far into the game but honestly i love it. I mostly play it solo and its enjoyable but its much better with friends. The only gripe i have is the inventory system is a little stressful without ESO plus but ESO plus more than makes up for it. Ultimately i think its a good game and i hope they keep adding content and supporting it for years instead of trying to make a new one in a year or two.8/10
Positive,"Despite each new DLC being so costly, the game overall is really fun. The map is huge and there's new quests everytime you login, and there is 1000 things to explore. If you're a new player and want to invest in some DLC's, Dark Brotherhood is a really fun one to play."
Positive,"To steal Avarti's words: This is a good MMORPG, but not a good Elder Scrolls Game. It's still fun to play with friends, there's some lore if you look for it, it looks GORGEOUS and new content is released fairly frequently. Grab yourself a mate, play together, RP if that's your thing, or don't if it's not."
Positive,"The character building in this game is fantastic! You can make almost any build that you can think of, like a hunter that heals? Green balance focused Warden + medium armor + bow. blood death knight? Bone Tyrant focused necromancer + heavy armor + 2 handed; just as a few examples.The crafting is fun in my opinion, it's great that you can choose the level of the item within ~2 levels and choose all of the stats on the item."
Positive,It's pretty ok.
Positive,PRO: plenty of missions and story driven missions to do.CON: walking simulator (unless u have a mount..)one day imma be OP...one day ;o;
Positive,Love it so far still learning and low levelSTill low level but got back into it defineltly the game to play if ur sick of fps
Positive,Great game that is constantly updated with new story and fun quests and events while maintaining a non-P2W business model
Positive,"Pros:You can play anyway you wantMassive worldGrinding actually pays offGrinding doesn't feel repetitiveAddonsDon't need a beast of a computer Variety of quest so it doesn't get staleThousands of hours of gameplayFully voiced NPCsBeautiful sceneryYou don't need to spend a ton ton of moneyEvents and free to play promotionsConsA little pay to win (because of ESO Plus gives you a 10% XP bonus) but most os cosmeticLeveling is a little slow (but is rewarding)Quest rewards don't always pertain to your classQuest location is alwayd clearReccomendationsFLYING MOUNTSMy conclusionI've had so much fun playing this game. I would reccomend this to any mmorg fans, and people who are tired of playing WoW. Get this game!"
Positive,"I absolutely love ESO.I wasted 3000 hours of my life playing Skyrim, then was looking for something to fill the void and caved and bought it just to finally see a new story. I was sceptical at first because I don't normally like MMO's dungeon crawler gameplay and more so enjoy heavy immersive storylines which ESO has hooooours of storyline and I've basically played the entire game so far by myself which is what I'm used to. Plus I've learned so much about the Elder Scrolls lore!"
Positive,Probably best to buy this game directly from the site instead of on Steam due to login issues every few weeks. The game itself is totally addictive and has something for every play style. It's improved dramatically since its initial launch and I'd rate it among the top MMOs now.
Positive,"Lots of quests, or it is fun to just run around and explore.  There is pay items but it seems the game is just as fun without buying any of that.  I received a free dog pet and a horse within a week of buying and playing the game."
Positive,Only half of my time is on Steam.I only did 20%% of the basegame.I didn't even touch PVP.What even are vTrials?I still have these 1k quests to do.Oh but the world is so cool and distracting and the people are so funYeah I guess it's alright someone please call an ambulance I can't feel my hands from animation cancelling at this point help.10/10 the only MMO I ever actually enjoyed but boi do I love it.
Positive,"Adore this game! Great dev support, great community"
Positive,"First time i played this game it was complete and utter shit. Gave it another shot during a free weekend, ended up buying it and now i've sinked more hours into this game than i like to think about."
Positive,"If you remove other players, daily quests and grind any unnecessary crap, I would say that this is Skyrim at maximum settings"
Positive,"didn't quite like it at first. but after a while it definately grew on me, and I've been having a blast ever since."
Positive,Only really bad thing - I jeard there are big spiders. I have arachnophobia to the point where I have fainted. I will have to find someone to play that part. Ugh! Should come with a warning bc not all fantasy games have spiders.
Positive,"THIS IS NOT SKYRIM ONLINE!It's better!Elder Scrolls Online has ALL voice acted quests and NPC's. Player Housing. A plethora of achivements, zones, dungeons and battlegrounds. Even with the BASE GAME you will have hundreds of hours of enjoyable gameplay, alone or with friends.You will not find a MMO with a more indepth universe and possibilities, without having to spend RL money (besides the initial purchase).-----------------------------------------------------------------CONS:Sometimes get infinite loading screen."
Positive,I have played this game hundreds of hours and still haven't finished all the content in the game. I've made it to champion levels but even that is a somewhat grind. It is very enjoyable from the top notch graphics to the story lines within the game. Seems there are a lot of trees needing saved lol. Also why does every single town I go to seem to have a lot of ghosts everywhere. All jokes aside though this game is way under rated. I feel like this should be way bigger than... some other cartoony styled games. Game is wonderful and Lets just be real friends or none its enjoyable all around. The community is still very alive.
Positive,"After over 500 hours, I must say I really enjoy this game.Pros:Gameplay is diverse.The scenery is absolutely beautiful no matter where you go.The class system, though seemingly limited with a measly 4 options, is surprisingly robust, allowing any class to perform any role (though some better than others of course).The lore and quest selection are rich and the vast world gives you a lot to do while levelling.The game is incredibly supportive of small parties.The game is steadily being updated and improved, not just through DLCs but through legitimate frequent updates.Allows access to all DLC through monthly subscription without having to buy it. A Gold Edition purchase will fix that.Cons:You will want to subscribe to ESO Plus ($15/mo) to fully utilize a few of the features in the game, notably the crafting system.There are kids and grognards who take the game too seriously here, just like any other game. Sorry dudes.This game is not WoW or any other MMORPG. It often doesn't even feel like a game in the TES series. It's very different and you will notice the difference as soon as you pick it up. But it is constantly evolving and feeling more like a true Elder Scrolls game every day. Highly recommended."
Positive,Great musics and graphics and very real looking world! Combat is cool and crafting is ok but not perfect. Very basic MMO that has you pay to win. If you want to spent money on this game then you will have very much good time and play it long time. Little more casual player can have fun with friends but that's all. I'm gonna give thumb up because I did like this and had fun but game is not for all! Game is also very big on disk size so you have to have pretty good PC for this.
Positive,"Only RPGMMO I hv ever played and I love it. There is only TESO for me.Just wish I could get a unicorn in it xDLove this game <3 9/10Update: 23.08.20Sitting in a dungeon queue...10min...20min...30min...40min , finally gets in the dungeon, gets to the 1 boss, all goes good :)  kicks butt, gets to the second boss, 1 team member is struggling, trys hard, 10mins later tank and healer gives up and leaves.... :/100% would play again, big PP26.11.20Dungeons are hard, pvp is fun, sometimes lag, still 1 of my favorite games."
Positive,It's a fun game.
Positive,"Awesome game, the PvP makes it all worth it.Don't mind the hours you see listed above, i've put way more time than i'm proud of into this game, and I judge it a worthy exchange."
Positive,it may not be really elder scrolls mechanicly game (gameplay is not the same as skyrim) but the lore is awesome and i find the gameplay enjoyable.
Positive,So amazing gives me a hard on
Positive,"Played beta and launch date a while back even paid the 3 month subscription, it was okay had its problems. Now with the huge changes and adjustments they'd made, this game is way better than before. I recommend this now, great community and people can be very helpful in game not salty."
Positive,This game is probabally one of the best games I've ever played. I have only owned it for 3 days yet I already have about 20 hours on it. My sleep schedule is completly gone to shit ever since I got this. Please send help.... I think I need it.
Positive,"The game got a bad rep in the start, but once people got over the fact that it isn't Skyrim they realized that it isn't that bad of a game. It may be the worst elder scrolls game, but that's like having a shitty mansion. It's still pretty fricken cool. Combat system is a little repetitive and I have heard the endgame isn't too good, but have fun getting to end game because leveling in this game takes forever, and that's a good thing. It gives you more time to enjoy the quests the good old fashioned elder scrolls way."
Positive,"My Friends, this game is simply amazing.People who dislikes that game has only seen it on beta. I know, it was full of bugs, there were lots of log in issues, I even couldn't download it from the website directly. But the devs worked hard, fixed almost everything in the game ! Every game has minor bugs that you face once in a while, you get stuck in a ridiculous place, or you may not be able to loot a mob you've just killed. These things happens all the time. This game is the best lore driven game out there at the moment. I never felt the need of getting to the level cap even though I have almost 300 hours of playtime on it. THE GAME IS VOICE ACTED ENTIRELY ! Never seen a quest without background, sometimes you see an npc on the way to somewhere else, later when you progress, you see that guy/girl again, sometimes as a friend, sometimes as a foe. The world is alive, it changes and adapts to your playstyle. You can be a villian or a hero, it's entirely up to you. If you need an mmorpg to play, make friends and have quality time, this is the game."
Positive,"I waited until early 2016 to play this game because I heard so much negative feedback on it. I had hoped for ""multi-player Skyrim"", but all I heard was people complaining about the game. Maybe it was considerably worse at release; all I know is that I love how the game is now. Is it perfect? No - it's a Bethesda game after all! But... it really is multi-player Skyrim. The quest system is enhanced, it's entirely possible to ignore other people and have a great single-player experience. But if you get in over your head, there are other PCs around who can help out. I really like the PvE areas. The PvP areas are much more difficult, as you'd expect from a game that's been out for, what, nearly 2 years now? But even though PvP can be frustrating, it never really is not-fun.I loved Skyrim, and I really like the direction this game has gone. Deeper quests, lots of good voice acting and backstory to the quests and good graphics that seem well optimized. My only real cons are lag when lots of other PCs are in your ""area"", some quirky quests and lots (LOTS!) of disk space consumed. But overall, I really like the game and recommend it completely."
Positive,"Game has a ton of content, and one of the most interesting combat systems I have seen in an MMO. The writing/lore is great and keeps questing from being too mundane.I haven't even touched the pvp, still leveling my character to max rank - but dungeons and questing alone have been fun enough for me to wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who loves the grind. For 20-30 bucks and no sub fee required, you can't really go wrong.Edit: Been playing for more than a year. Excited for morrowind. Good updates."
Positive,"Its totally different from the other Elder Scrolls games, but if you like RPGmmo's. This is the best mmo you'll ever find.Imagine, an amazing mmo... in the Elder Scrolls atmosphere. I love it !"
Positive,"Very Good MMORPG... looks like Skyrim, but the game play is an MMO style with some elements from Elder Scrolls Games."
Positive,"The best mmo which i ever played,10/10"
Positive,"This game is very well made, it has amazing pvp, I have no lag even in massive pvp matches Cyrodiil and the gameplay is astounding. It is easily the best MMO I have ever played to date."
Positive,"When I played ESO in the beta, it was absolute garbage. Bugs were everywhere, the combat was dull and unsatisfying, and the severely restricted freedom made it feel like anything but an Elder Scrolls game.Since then, the bugs have been squashed, the combat has been improved a ton, and with the addition of the justice system, freedom has been greatly expanded. It's strange. It feels like such a light touch, and yet it makes all the difference. The new ESO is an excellent game. The B2P model is executed as well as in Guild Wars 2. Crown Store items are strictly conveniences and cosmetics. It's absolutely not pay-to-win.If you were put off by ESO early on, I'd urge you to give it another shot. ESO: TU is a completely different beast."
Positive,I played Elder Srcolls Online beta and to be fair it was both awesome and bad there was a looooot of bugs and you had to wait hours to a NPC to spawn to complete a quest and you would ony get 1 gold per body :D (alot of this carried to the main game after it was relased) And the 20 e per month was just ridiculous (in my opinion anyway.) BUT after ESO Tamriel Unlimited me and my friend have been having a blast with it and there is no required game subscription and they fixed the major problems and made the game overall better so i recomend it to everyone who likes MMO's and elder scrolls games overall. So if your computer can support the game go buy it !
Positive,This game is great fun. Looking for different things for a quest and the exploring.
Positive,"Got this on sale for a really good price and am enjoying it quite a bit. It doesn't hit you over the head with ""buy this now"" all the time either.Just for the low price of the base game, a friend and I have been playing non stop for a couple days now and having a lot of fun with it.Combat is more action oriented too, which I like."
Positive,"I played all of the elder scrolls games before and i have to say that as an MMO-Game its way beter than i thought.I see where all the complains about this game come from as there are microtransactions, some minor bugs here and there and some things that are unbalanced but the game itself is really enjoyable.Here are some of my positive and negative points about the game itself:  ++The character customization has expanded since Skyrim bringing a few races which couldn´t be used in all elder scroll games.+The animations are way better than any other Elder scrolls games.+The game looks good.+Optimization isn´t that bad although the frames drop here and there sometimes.+Controls aren´t fucked like in some MMO Games.+Quests are what you would expect but there are some special snow flakes from time to time which are really fun.+You can bring up your horse whenever you want and use it unlike in other elder scrolls games (besides arvak from skyrim).+There are many and i mean MANY different weapons and spells for you to use.  --Microtransactions in this game are like refugees in europe, they´re everywhere.-The UI is sometimes really confusing and hard to adjust to but you can get used to it.-Crafting is really ""different"" than elder scrolls games and by ""different"" i mean really fucked up.-While there are some cool quests as i mentiond there are these quests:""Oh hello traveler i lost my pink panda bear and i need you to find it""After 2 hours of either punching your way through a horde of enemies with 10 million health points you find this god damn pink panda bear bear you hear this:""Oh thank you very much traveler for finding my pink panda bear now i can resume to FUCK IT IN THE ASS, oh by the way here are your 5 gold pieces for recompensation.""Yeah that pretty much sums it up.-The combat system is pretty much pressing the left mouse button and pressing either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 on your keyboard but i don´t honestly have a problem with that.Well i have really not much more to say about this game anymore you go on quests which you can find on your way to the main quests or by exploring the world and you do the quests and you cut your enemies heads off and gain treasures so you can cut off even more heads to gain even more treasures.As for me i like it as i do any other elder scrolls game and i would recommend it to anyone who likes elder scrolls or MMO games."
Positive,"Bought cheap version (silly me) and bought the 4dlcs in-game, this game is worth it, if you are gonna buy it buy gold edition!"
Positive,for those who like MMORPG and open world games......this game is worth a try :D
Positive,Best MMORPG I have played.
Positive,"Just play itagain gonna say it, just play it"
Positive,Played a little. I think it's nice.
Positive,skyrim but online!
Positive,VERY VERY NICE
Positive,This is one of the best MMORPGs with a great pack of quests and in-game world. The burnout in this one is lesser compared to other MMORPGs. The story line is greatly enjoyable and much appreciation to Zenimax for keeping the new chapters and updates rolling out that makes the player base keep coming back to the game for more and more content.
Positive,Great game! i really enjoy how it is similar to the other elder scrolls games but has the multiplayer part to it.- Large open world- amazing world desgin (graphic settings dependable)- lots to do (too many damn quests lol)-....to much to say about how great this game is11/10 would buy again
Positive,"Well I originally avoided this game because of bad reviews at launch and the subscription model but now with the new buy to play model I decided to give ESO another chance. All i can say is I've felt like a fool for not trying this game sooner. Incredible immersion and the voice acting is superb. Combat is fun and feels impactful, music is epic and the questing system doesn't feel like so many other mmorpgs. ESO feels organic like everything is just happening naturally around you and you can choose to be a part of it or go about your business. love this game, can't wait to drop endless hours in."
Positive,WHAT THE FVCK !GOLD EDITION IS CHEAPER THAN BASE GAME
Positive,300 + hours.... yeah its a good game. Great community. Must get for Elder Scrolls fans.
Positive,"Basically Skyrim with friends, definitely recommend this game to any RPG, MMO or Elder Scrolls fan!"
Positive,"PLEASE READ IF YOU ARE PLAYING FROM ASIA!!!If you are expecting a fun and fair pvp experience, don't, the agonizing 250+ ping will force you to think two steps ahead of players who are playing from Europe or US.As for solo content, I haven't really played as much as to entice you into buying this game but since I got it at a discount, I'm just gonna have to trust me on this one and say that It's really fun and I've enjoyed every bit of questing. The immersion breaks tho due to lag and with your enemies just teleporting to your side while you miss some abilities.  -_- Pls add an Asia server. I beg you. I'm fine with playing at 90 or even at 150 ping"
Positive,"8.0/10First off, I AM NOT AN MMO guy. I have tried many over the years (LOTR, Guild Wars 1 and 2, SWKOTR) and I really just don't enjoy them for 2 reasons. 1. I hate strangers in my dungeon, and 2. I don't like killing a monster and then 2 minutes later it respawns again- right there in the same spot- as if to spit in your eye. It breaks my immersion and kills my sense of progression...That being said, I owned the original ESO from 2016, and when Summerset came on sale I decided to purchase the whole package again this week for $26 cdn. At that price you can't go wrong.My buddy Thulgar and I are working through this together, and I am really enjoying it. I just have to set aside the above mentioned niggles, and I can be content with the story and sense of exploration while co-op gaming with a friend."
Positive,Started a cult of Cliff Racer Worshippers. 3/ES would recreate Morrowind
Positive,a very good game i wish you could sell stolen goods thats my favorite part of other elder scrolls games  but i would rate it 9 out of 10
Positive,This was a $70 impulse buy but I'm glad it paid off.
Positive,"""Like Far Cry 3 without guns"" - IGN"
Positive,Game is amazing no 2 ways about it..nothing to hate on it really..levelling is great quests are awesome..loads of content and the DLCs are well done too..I think the launch issues were the main reason this game had bad reviews..it has improved greatly now and developed into one of the best MMORPGs out there! A must play now..believe me..thank me later!
Positive,"My origial review is below. They have long since fixed the steam zenimax issues and I have have nearly no isues over the years of playing. If you like Elder Srolls games and want something that is more MMO-y this is your game. I do 100% suggest that you buy this game. Do not buy it through steam. I have 2 accounts, one thats stand alone, one on steam. I did this because I like steams security for credit cards and the monthly transaction worried me on zens servers. However, the steam server or method used to connect to the zen servers goes down weekly for an unknown amount of time. since about 4pm today(currently 10:30pm) I have not been able to log in with my steam linked account, and this is the 3rd time this month!  That is unacceptable for a game thats over 4 years old."
Positive,"It's a really relaxing game, I used to be a hardcore WoW player for 10 years and ESO has won me over. More realtime battle feeling, lovely graphics more realistic than wow so it feels more immersive, no mandatory stressing dailies/weeklies, and the main 2 points: you don't have to follow a guide or build, everything can potentially work and you get an incredible amount of freedom to define your own playstyle. and no1: the whole game scales so you can play with any friends from any level, in any area, you don't need to rush to catch up with anyone, questing is interesting. It feels like it's a game well-made to enjoy the journey to endgame as much as the endgame itself, rather than dangling Endgame like a carrot you have to struggle and race to never really catch unless you got a PHD in it and 0 life afk.Loving it :D"
Positive,"This game replace the gap in my soul that was originally occupied by SWTOR.For that reason alone, it deserves to be bought."
Positive,"Loved the game from the start, I mean it took way too long to get onto steam and why it was orignally a pay monthly game I dont know but I forgive you"
Positive,you can level up from killing innocent people 10/10

Positive,"Very easy to get into mmo that is fun for a variety of playstyles. The learning curve is shallow enough to not overwhelm you, but steep enough to make you keep learning for 100s of hours. Very fun to play both alone and with friends."
Positive,"TL;DR: This is a fantastic MMO, and with the monthly subscription gone, I would HIGHLY recommend it to all my friends and fellow online gamers.-----Absolutely love this MMORPG. I've made some solid friends, the community isn't the toxic environment you're used to finding in most massively multiplayer games. The controls and quest system are easy to pick up on, making this a good first MMO--though the amount of content makes this game worth any seasoned player's time as well. The world is full of life, the dialog is spot on and what you would expect of an Elder Scrolls game. While a lot of people would have preferred a combat and stealth system closer to it's single player counterpart, Skyrim, I don't feel it's lacking in charm or fun.While I may not be a fan of microtransactions within games, I do feel the ""Crown"" currency is fair in what you are able to get in return--should you be concerned with aesthetics. That being said, you can fully enjoy every bit of this game without having to spend more than what you pay for the game itself, and that's definitely saying something.Each update and patch to this game, while time consuming to apply, has been worth it. The new content they've added has made the continued play and replayablility remarkable.I could very easily continue rambling on about the depth this game takes with the lore, the gorgeous soundtrack, or the fantastic balance of PVE/PVP, etc, but this is already becoming a lengthy review. A++"
Positive,it has morrowind so 10/10
Positive,"The vanilla content is garbage, but expansions - including the free Morrowind chapter - add decent enough content to hold for a few dozen hours. I only started getting bored with everything close to 100 hour mark, and if you only buy it for the Morrowind, that's still about 40 hours of entertainment.If you consider buying it, then I suggest getting the cheapest basic edition and going through the Morrowind province, then if you want more buying expansions, and either skipping the ""vanilla"" areas entirely or treating them like exp/gold farms and not bothering reading dialogues or stories as they are all too dumb and uninspired.Which expansions to get after completing Morrowind?Clockwork City has the most interesting lore of them all and is fairly fun to explore due to sci-fi/fantasy visual mix. In my opinion it's the best expansion.Thieves Guild is decent too, very well worth getting as well.Elsweyr has nice jungle visuals, and is overall good enough if you still want more.Markarth is fairly average, to be honest I wouldn't bother unless you get it in some DLC bundle if there ever will be one.Murkire has broken main quest that crashes to desktop at some point for many people, and they never bothered to fix it, avoid!As for the rest, I haven't played or played only a few quests during some free weekend, so I have no opinion of them, except that Imperial City DLC as well as entire PvP in the game is garbage and you're better off skipping them, there are many better PvP MMOs."
Positive,"Pretty great so far, only a couple of hours in but it's piqued my interest. Keen to keep playing :)"
Positive,P.S. Darklolitagirl is a dude.
Positive,"Okayish elder scrolls theme park if you can handle greedy monetization.Story: If you are a fan of elder scrolls you will find a lot of cool roleplaying possibilities here. Main quests are mostly interesting. Side quests, while there are few gems, mostly are bland copy-paste clean ruins/bring items.Gameplay: A lot of stuff feels grindy and very time-consuming. Combat feels clunky with animation skips that are mandatory for good DPS in veteran content. All DLC dungeons are hidden in small DLCs that require $10+ per dungeon or subscription.  An endless crafting bag that comes with a subscription provides an advantage in trading. The housing system is good but also requires a subscription to double the furniture limit.Graphics: Bad, very simple models,  mounts have no weight. New zones look better.Sound/Music/Voice: Music good, voiceover on every quest.Optimization: Good, runs well on low-end PC.Bugs: Some minor bugs.Singleplayer: Yes (You can play solo except for certain missions, dungeons, and raids).Multiplayer: Yes (better with friends).Player Count: High (instant queue if you are a tank or heal).Pay to Win: Kinda (cash shop is influential, lootboxes, microtransactions, too many paid DLC, a subscription that feels mandatory)."
Positive,"I had anticipated the release of this game probably more then any other game in my entire life. I waited years for it when i heard about it and preordered it immediately. Upon launch, i played it for about 3 weeks and got bored of it. I quit playing it and never went back. I had randomly stumbled upon the trailer for the Morrowind expansion (My favorite TES game) about a week ago, and decided to check what has been going on in ESO lately. What an amazing decision that was. They changed almost everything about the game. It feels way more like an elder scrolls game since the entire game scales with you. You're able to have the freedom to do whatever you want whenever you want with no level restrictions. Sometimes i forget its an MMO just running around getting immersed in the quests and stories. If you like TES games, try it. If you like MMORPGs, try it.---update 11/29---the greatest game ever made. fits both casual players and hardcore players. game literally has something for everyone."
Positive,"I did not buy it at launch because I waited to see its condition it launch, which was by the way awfully undercooked. As it stands right now I have no problems with it. I think the problem alot of people have is that they expected it to be like a multiplayer mod.     Recently picked it up as it was on sale, and I am having a blast. Many of the issues I saw in the initial reviews seem to be fixed. Also very excited for the upcoming justice system (even though I rarely play an evil typed character).   In conclusion I can see what some people might not like about it, but I think that it happened as part of becoming an MMO, if you look at it more like an MMO I dont find it to be bad at all. If only they had waited till the game was done to release it they might not have gotten so much hate for it."
Positive,"As far as MMOs go, ESO is unique. You really don't have to play with others - but you can, and that's the beauty of it. Want to quest alone? There's a trove of content you can take on and excel at. Meanwhile, if you want to do all of the quests with a friend, you can also do that. But questing isn't where this game ends, and that's where ESO is special for me. PvE content is stacked. You can do dungeons, which can take up to 4 players (but if you really want, you can solo these or two-man them). There are a variety to choose from, and they all drop unique weapon and armor sets. There are also two difficulties (normal and vet), where vet gets exponentially harder. Most of the vanilla dungeons are pretty easy, some will challenge you on vet - and as a low level character all of them will challenge you. The DLC dungeons are designed to break you though. Even after over a thousand hours, I've not completed a few of them. Specifically Horns of the Reach. Trials are for up to 12 people, and they are designed with a challenge in mind. Like dungeons, they'll require you to learn mechanics and work together with others in your group. I've completed all the trials on normal, but vet is another monster entirely - and it's great.  The part I like about ESO the most is that I feel as if it pushes me, and that there is a skill wall for the harder content. No one likes a game where you can basically god-mode through the entire thing... and ESO does well to make you work to beat end-game content.  PvE content is exciting and sometimes time consuming. You'll spend hours in some of these longer dungeons, and you'll feel as if you really worked for it. PvP content is crazy. Once you think you're a badass and have mastered PvE content, you take a walk into Cyrodiil and you get your shit pushed in. Once again, ESO raises the bar for end-game content. Massive groups of players all in a huge battleground simulator, taking over keeps, defending landmarks, and it all being open world. After some time and effort though, anyone can PvP successfully.CONS: This game is buggy, sometimes a bit ugly, and it certainly has performance issues when you're in a group of 40+ people in one place. The crown store is not a pay-to-win concept, and there ARE freebies, but some of the content is indeed behind a paywall of DLC. I also recommend paying for ESO+, as the craftbag is necessary for not wanting to kill yourself for having a full inventory. PROS: Game exhibits all of your favorite things about Skyrim, Oblivion, etc... The world is set before all of these events have taken place, but you get to see familiar spots in their infancy. The game will continue to push you, and you will NEVER run out of content. It is also relatively easy to make money in the game, so long as you loot early and often + join a trade guild (of which there are plenty). Game is compatible on PC with a controller, if you really want that Elder Scrolls feel. Graphics are beautiful and the world feels very much alive. Populations are high in-game, but it also does a nice job of making it not feel crowded.As someone who came from TF2, it's nice to play a game where the devs seem to care and update it frequently."
Positive,Best TES in serie
Positive,"Great game! It can be a tad overwhelming at first for new players, but it’s really fun to learn everything this game has to offer and is very rewarding. Highly recommended for newcomers and veterans alike."
Positive,10/10 would recommend. Don't buy it via Steam tho
Positive,The most stable elder scrolls experience I've ever had.
Positive,There's another 100GB of updates to install after the game is downloaded. Just fyi for anyone low on space.
Positive,The Elder Scrolls Online Tamriel Unlimited is a beautiful MMORPG which is well worth the time and investment.
Positive,"Really fun Elder Scrolls experience, good to explore and quest, take your time, dont grind."
Positive,"From baby spiders, to giant spiders, to man-spiders11/10 would play againEdit 1: I did not play far enough that time to find robot spidersEdit 2: Seriously, there are a lot of giant spider bosses in this game"
Positive,"I played this game in beta and to say the least I thought it was going to be the first blemish in my favorite game series.That plus when the announced that there was going to be a monthly fee I thought that I would pass this game and just hope that the next game is better.When they dropped the subscription fee and released Tamriel Unlimited I decided I would take the jump and buy the game.I was not disappointed.While the game is not perfect I wouldn’t expect to be, not one of the Elder Scrolls games were published perfect.The biggest surprise to me was the fixing of the combated system. One of the biggest disappointments in the beta.Also to my liking was the tutorial was shortened so it didn’t take as much time. (In the beta the tutorial was alike like Skyrim where it last way too long.)Overall I thought the publish version if thousands of time better than the beta and in my opinion have the right to be called an Elder Scroll Game."
Positive,"Much beauty. Such flying octopodes. Wow.This game is a marriage of Star Wars: The Old Republic (SWTOR) and Lord of the Rings Online (LOTRO). It combines medeval and futuristic technologies in an MMORPG with a contemporary storyline and the ability to enhance the size of your female character's  ( . Y . ) *ahem*.John Cleese playing the guitar, cat people riding big cats, and lizards who talk in the third person. She thinks this is a good game, if you like your games imaginative."
Positive,"Huge, very good"
Positive,Excellent game with lots and lots to do.  You could never get bored in this game.  Hands down the best
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online is more than a multiplayer Skyrim. This gorgeous game provides epic storylines and unique quests to keep the player engaged. Just as in Skyrim, you can wander to any part of the map at any time to explore. ESO offers the vastness of Tamriel. There are ten playable races, all which can be customized to a decent extent. There are four base playable classes, each with three different skill lines to choose from. [If you wish to invest more money into the game, there is an additional fifth class and soon to be a sixth in June 2019.] ESO also offers crafting, house design, pets, mounts, collectable outfits, mementos and the ability to use mods to customize your playing experience. Combat is pretty standard mmo style, and I really enjoy the freedom of the non-cooldown weapon swapping. Skills are designated to weapon and they are class specific, but the player can use whatever weapons are preferred and swap skills on battle bars to better customize gameplay. Dodging and blocking attacks is woven into the fighting experience encouraging a more interactive style of battle. Test your combat ability at any delve, dungeon, public dungeon or raid.I am not a fan of subscription-based games. After ESO changed their payment plan, I decided to give the game a chance. I have not been disappointed. If you end up enjoying the game and want to play more, but the cost of the expansions are out of your budget, about once a year, each of the expansions go on sale and become very reasonably priced. The other choice is, paying a small fee to have access to all of the content with ESO Plus. There are FREE Plus week-long trials. These give you access to ALL content in the game and let you experience what it’s like to be an ESO Plus subscriber. Try it out before you invest. Free is best, right?Don’t get me wrong, the plus subscription is NOT required to play the base game, but it will make your experience with the game a bit more pleasant with the perks provided. I’d suggest, try the base game and if you find it very enjoyable, perhaps consider upgrading to Plus. I really enjoy this mmo. I think it’s aged very well, and I’m crazy excited for the next expansion: Elsweyr. I can’t wait for the newest class to be released and to explore all over the new area!True enough, this mmo garnered a lot of negative press on release, but since then Zenimax and Bethesda have worked together improve the gaming experience for the players by leaps and bounds. Even if you tried this game on release, I would definitely recommend returning to give it another go.Achievement Acquisition Difficulty: N/AAchievement Hunter’s Note: All achievements are in game and are not represented on Steam."
Positive,"This game is not bad! people go in expecting Skyrim, dont't do that. imagine playing oblivion with friends, that is what this is.I like it."
Positive,karasu familys utopia
Positive,Ok so personally i think the game isnt that bad but if you're coming from skyrim or any other elder scrolls then dont exspect a fully emersive experiance like those games.I can only suggest you get the game on a sale as it honestly should go free to play like many other mmo's.I like this game mostly because of the design of the game where you feel like you're in the elder scrolls world as your camera can be close to you or first person but you are with loads more people in the world. Pros:controls feel nice graphics are good the game is pretty optimised the in game market is really nice and a good way of buying and selling finding rare drops and loot is really rewarding learning a skill tree like enchanting is really rewarding Cons:The story i personally dont think is too interesting quests are very tedious sometimes enemy spawns can really un emerse you from the game (although spawns need to be high)mini quests can get crowded by random people so thats un emersive
Positive,"I love this game. I used to grind it out every chance I had back whenever I was on the xbox, and even now that I have moved onto the master race, it's still a pleasure to play. Theres tons of content for all of the alliances, and out of the two that I have actually played with, they haven't felt like simple replicas of eachother. Overall, this is probably one of my favorite games of all time. I can still find it fun whether it's playing solo or with a group, which is always good.Also, I actually have around 20+ hours on the PC version because for some reason it didn't log all of them, but I also have way more on the xbox."
Positive,Eh.buddy said hed give me 100$ if this gets to top
Positive,"By far the most played game in my library, I have been an Elder Scrolls fan since Morrowind and Oblivion. I originally Beta tested this game in its early stages and was not impressed, however I came back to it when it became free to play (even though I currently have a premium membership) and I am so glad I did. The quests and environment definitely keep in line with the lore that the Elder Scrolls team has spent over a decade to create and perfect. I highly recommend it for any Elder Scrolls Fan, old or new."
Positive,"*UPDATED*So I just got this game last november for the 9euro pricetag while it was on sale and would like to give it a little bit of review.TL;DRPros:+Really immersive+Really helpful and possitive community+Beautiful tamriel landscape+Plenty of quests to keep you busy (+750 quests), including dungeons and trials.+The mechanic of the game which lets players to dodge and time their next attacks demand a more dynamic play style (which is the strongest point of this game for me)Cons:-it's quite confusing to comprehend the game-there aren't any Asian dedicated server (only EU and NA)-the inventory is limited for non-subscription playersFULL REVIEW:First of all, this game offers you the experience of elder scrolls games with a touch of an mmorpg to it. The immersion that I get from this game is amazing, especially knowing that it is in the same universe of other elder scrolls online (only thousand years before Skyrim and Oblivion)All the stories are well-driven and you get to choose a lot of possibilities for your character which becomes really helpful for you to get comfortable with your character from the get-go. Everytime you finish a quest and save a kingdom or a small village will benefit your future quests as people will know you from your previous deeds. Sometimes, your choice during the quest also affects the ending of such quest. The huge selection of quests and different mechanics of each quests and dungeons make this game even more interesting and challenging (although for normal quests sometimes it gets slightly repetitive).Unlike the review videos that came out 3 years ago, which shows how killing a boss will only give you 2 gold or nothing at all, the current patch is really rewarding. Depending on which side of the RNG god are you, the final bosts will give you a high-end weapon for your current level. (on veteran dungeons the final bosts will gives a 100% chance of getting a particular type of epic headgear, with random traits on it.) On the other hand, the mechanics and how to play this game get quite confusing at first, especially for the crafting system. Nonetheless, it will be really rewarding once you know how it works and I suggest that you need to start working on your crafting skill line since the beginning, as it will become really handy during the end-game. This is not a big problem, however, since there are quite plenty of guides and tutorial on how to master this game or get your perfect character, either on youtube or eso forums. So, you will not have a hard time understanding this game. My biggest gripe about this game is that it doesn't have any Asian dedicated server which is really a shame since that means I cannot play this game when I come back to my country in ASEAN.The conclusion is that although it has some minor downsides, for me, this game brings the things that I really want the most from an mmorpg game, especially with the 9euro pricetag. 10/10 would recommend it. (unless you live in Asian countries)"
Positive,This is false advertisement all i seen was gold cost for 5.99 click on it it and its the standerd you have.
Positive,Better than I thought! ~
Positive,"The thing I love most is that, game don't make me work after work.I come here to rest, I have no grind, everything I do in game gives me bonuses and achievements.And no one ever tells me how and what to play.I'm not losing anything for not doing daily/weekly/seasons like in SWTOR or other online games.I am Skyrim and Morrowind mod maker that for last 5 years uses a mac.And installing mods after Skyrim updates on Mac was more and more problematic.So I tried ESO and completely satisfied with it.Mac experience is native.It has everything I added to Skyrim as mods myself gameplay-wise.And graphics/animations are better than in Skyrim no matter how many mods you install.Because Skyrim has its age.I just playing as alchemist gathering ingredients around Tamriel, and it's great.They are also completely re-done Morrowind map with all cities on it.As well as Eastern and Western Skyrim.Cyrodyil map is fantastic too, even though it's an open world PVP zone.But the game is fully playable solo."
Positive,"Favorite game of all time loving replaying and reveling on pc and steam deck, used to play on Xbox"
Positive,Got the game for free from Alienware Arena so it's all good. Would definitely play again if I ever peace out from Star Trek Online.
Positive,"Very fun game, played since it came out on console and still love it today"
Positive,"If you're looking for the best game on the planet, then look no further. Game is bussin bussin no cap. So much to do, new DLC on the mend at all times, hard to get bored. Can run it solo but playing with freinds/guild members makes it that much better. Source- TRUST ME BRO."
Positive,"The most fun MMO I've ever played, even though I initially preferred the classical style lockon activation skill based combat of traditional MMO's (especially in PvP), the action RPG elements have grown on me IMMENSELY, especially combined with the free-form almost (except for class choice) unlimited skill/gear builds you can create, no other MMO I've played has such freedom. The stories and voice acting are great, the world is incredibly large with all the expansions and DLC's over the years and all of it is well-crafted and beautiful to explore, the graphics haven't aged nearly as bad as many of its contemporaries, the character customization options are the greatest I've seen aside from some of the Asian MMO's that lack in everything else I appreciate in an online game...All in all, I can't recommend this game enough to the casual RPG explorer type, as that is what I ended up becoming in this game, terrifying, I know, I've dove a little into PvP and veteran dungeons, but have only done one trial over all my time getting to 1600+ Champion. Just the story content alone keeps you busy for a while, even in just the basegame. If I'd have to give one major gripe, it's the craft bag being locked behind monthly payment, look, I have no hate for subscriptions, in fact I think they are the only way to keep any live service game up, but I feel like the craft bag should just be able to be purchased with crowns, I'd easily pay over 10k crowns for a permanent craft bag unlock and still subscribe (especially the yearly one) simply for the subscription being worth it just for the crowns you get (unless you only buy the largest crown pack during 40% Steam sale, then again, that's no craft bag, which is mandatory if you want to be able to craft your own gear as a mostly solo player like me.)"
Positive,"Tamriel is again the scene of adventure in this new The Elder Scrolls.  The continent is our world to be explored and is well represented, with minimal details. The story develops based on legends present in the pantheon of the saga, with the right to famous names that are cited and remembered. After a brief period of peace, the land of Tamriel is again threatened by forces of darkness that have awakened and brought an even colder winter to its inhabitants. An arcane explosion occurred in Imperial City and awakened demons and other evil creatures, which killed some of the most powerful wizards and drove others crazy. In the midst of this chaos, three different factions swear to protect Imperial City from threats, even though they disagree with everything the other does with each other, which ends up generating more conflicts over time.  The player's character, at the beginning, is just ""one more"", but his form of evolution can help change the world, thanks to the prophecies that are always present in epic scenarios. Your hero's customization is vast, with many options on what to assemble and a lot of control over his appearance. Each race has its own look and we have the possibility to configure skin color, hair, eyes and so on. Overall, you can spend a few good minutes on this initial breeder. The player starts out as a prisoner, which is common in The Elder Scrolls series, and needs to build his character based on the available races, including the Breton, Altmer, Dunmer, Redguard, Argonia, among others, each with his base. Own alliance, between the three factions present - Daggerfall Covenant, Ebonheart Pact and Aldmeri Dominion. The most interesting part of the story is that it takes place about a thousand before the events of Skyrim, or 800 years before The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. See you in Tamriel!"
Positive,I go to the cloud district often!
Positive,"Things to know about this game;1) For the most part, the community is decent. GTA-Online seems to have collected most of the a-holes, ESO has good people...mostly.2) Even though the game has been greatly 'dumbed down' from it's original release back in 2015, there is still a considerable learning curve to figuring out how this game can be mastered.  (I'd played back when there was a monthly/yearly fee for access. The game play is a lot easier than back in the early days.)3) With the right build, you can solo almost anything. I've focused my Dragon Knight with heavy armor and several regeneration skills and provisioning and I have soloed a few 4-man dungeons. (I'm not bragging, just emphasizing that it can be done.) World bosses still need at least two people to defeat.4) The game play can be redundant, and some of the quests are silly while several are terribly written and contradictory even in the same paragraph. Most of the NPC's you get quests from are dicks or just flat stupid. They talk to you in a way that'll make you want to kill them, but you cannot, because there would be no quest if they died.5) The world is beautiful. Even seven years later, the world is a work of art. I love the atmosphere that ESO created. 6) If you were expecting 'Skyrim', you will be disappointed. The combat is more point and click, but there are some stealth advantages. You get five skills to use at a time, plus a secondary weapon after reaching level 15, so a total of 10 potential skills to line up, plus two Ultimate skills (one per weapon slot.) My Templar uses Sword and Shield skills with a powerful energy burst (as my ultimate) or a Regeneration Staff with a powerful healing AoE (ultimate.) Therefore I have twelve skills total to utilize in battle.My original review is below. I had a pissy attitude when I wrote it. This revised review is less assholio.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This game was fun, but there were between 15 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minute wait queues to even get online last weekend. It is a common topic in game about how we who paid money to play this game are now spammed with people who got the game for free. It isn't their fault, it's just a bad move by Zenimax. They cheapened the value of their own game. Sad on them.I will continue to play when I can because the game is mostly fun. Wait times to play are complete Bull****."
Positive,Such an immersive MMO with so many opportunities no matter your play style!
Positive,One of the best game I ever played with an amazing and kind community...
Positive,"I played for years on PS4 before making the switch. ESO has been and will always be an amazing game.The storyline for each faction/area is always fleshed out and is always supplemented by the lore books and NPC conversations.It can be a bit infuriating if you want to play a specific race (since they are faction locked without an upgrade), but the class and race system has always been great. Anyone can fill any role. You could always be a pure sword and shield tank... or you can mix it up and be a magic tank with a staff. A healer with daggers and a bow. As long as you can get the armor sets to work with your image, you can do it.10/10 - Will ALWAYS play again."
Positive,"Meu primeiro MMO. Um jogo muito bacana com dublagem de cada NPC. Muito conteúdo e coisas para fazer, um bom bocado está incluído no jogo base sem necessidade de assinatura, apesar de ter o ESO Plus para alguns benefícios e acesso a DLCs não compradas.Infelizmente não tem localização oficial para Português Brasileiro, somente com addon devido ao trabalho da comunidade brasileira. Também não tem preço regionalizado, tornando o ESO Plus inviável.My first MMO is a very good game, voice acting in every single NPC. Tons of content and things to do, a bunch included on the base game without needing to be paying monthly, despite having ESO Plus for some benefits and access to DLCs not bought.Unfortunetly, no oficial localizarion for Brazilian Portuguese, just with with addons and the work of Brazil's community. Nor it has regional pricing, making ESO Plus not viable."
Positive,"If you want something to keep you meaningfully engrossed for months at an end, definitely go for this game. Definitely worth every single coin I have spent."
Positive,I have no clue whats happening and its great
Positive,If there was a Game without which my life would be incomplete then this is the one
Positive,"Great mmo! Not your tradition elder scrolls game but if you like mmos and the universe of the elder scrolls I highly recommend! Great PVE and PVP, all lots of fun!"
Positive,"todd howweird, weird guy"
Positive,Not bad but sometimes seems that all new content is the same as previous
Positive,Amazing game except the part where you have to buy mounts
Positive,"Best MMO in terms of freedom, you want to be a wizard that uses a two handed greatsword, its possible and even strong, you want to be a necromancer that is a vampire, also possible. This might be my favourite MMO because it really has a great immersion. If you can look past the overwhelming amount of DLC that are pretty overpriced then this game really offers a great amount of fun for a long time."
Positive,"It's great if you enjoy The Elder Scrolls lore and world, and in my opinion one of the more engaging MMOs out there. It's not Skyrim jank by all means, but it's also not WoW. Kind of a healthy medium between the two as you actually have to strike with heavy attacks and light attacks VS spamming 1-9. Character creation and RP are endless on this game and if you so choose you can create some insane houses and post them on the ESO Housing Community AddOn. Dungeons are great and PVP (If connection/server is running right) can be awesome! Only con I can think of is that a lot of the coolest aesthetics are sold in the crown store, and the COOLEST ones you have to basically roll dice for with crown crates. Rather then that it's easily the best MMO on the market."
Positive,"ESO sets itself apart from other MMOs in creating both an incredibly fleshed out world along with quality voice acting and a tons to do and explore.  It certainly has its shortcomings, but there is a lot to enjoy here.  If you have played any of the Elder Scrolls games and enjoyed the world, ESO is worth trying.  Even if you do not typically enjoy MMOs, you can actually play the game as a single player RPG if you prefer.  Grouping and socialization is there to be enjoyed, but not mandatory by any stretch.  Same thing goes for the ESO+ Membership.  It adds some great quality of life improvements.  If you plan to focus on crafting, then I would say ESO+ is probably going to be necessary.  Aside from that, you can enjoy this game for free and still have an incredible time in a beautiful fantasy world."
Positive,"[BASICALLY]ESO is worth the price of admittance, period.The lore is deep, the content is massive, the combat feels fluid & for it's age the graphics are great.SOME NEW PLAYER TIPS:1.) Have a friend craft training gear for you.2.) At level 6 - Daily Crafting Writs can earn gold & experience - talk to Millenith & Danel Telleno.3.) Visit the STABLE everyday to get your riding skills up, once eligible for mounts.4.) Vivec City is the easiest to navigate for most new players.5.) Upgrade your inventory (BAG SPACE VENDOR) & bank space (BANK) as often as you can afford.6.) At level 10 = Press L, queue for Cyrodiil - Do the tutorial in Cyrodiil (Do Not Skip it).     Once you complete the tutorials make sure to get the ASSAULT passive skill = CONTINUOUS ATTACK!!!     This skill will increase your mount speed by 30%7.) Start doing DAILY DUNGEONS asap - press P then QUEUE.8.) Join a trading guild that has a vendor - look at the guilds RECENT SALES to get ideas what makes $$$9.) Google Tamriel Trade Centre - if you want gold this is a critical website.10.) There are TONS of ADD-ONs - but if you only get ONE add-on = get Votan's Mini Map (Google it).     Just check your My Docs/Elder Scrolls/live/AddOns folder ... drop the addon folder there.     You can config the mini-map ADD-ON to remain on in combat.11.) Learn about SEALS OF ENDEAVOR - you can earn them each day/week - you can get very cool stuff!12.) ESO PLUS is worth it, but you can play the game without it if you control your inventory well.KEEP IN MIND:  You should be tweaking you GUI settings & combat options to your preference.  ESO defaults to a very clean uninformative GUI.  This is cool for lots of people, but most of us change the GUI info.  ALSO...AddOns are life in ESO, you don't need dozens, but there is quite a few useful ones...just remember some AddOns break with each major update & need to be updated or re-installed.  The more AddOns you use the more laggy your game 'may' become in PvP or TRIALS.[BACK TO MY REVIEW]The flora & fauna in each region are detailed and immersive.  I would like to see aggro ranges increased as far as kiting goes, but it's not that big of a deal.  Riding across the landscape you will cross paths with numerous other players & have a chance to help rando's defeat various world bosses and random public dungeons.HOWEVER; their are issues with dungeons glitching, meta set grinding each update & end-game content is nearly impossible without being in an 'active' guild.That said I am not an ESO PLUS (monthly fee) member & my experience has been enjoyable.  I've had a few thousand hours of serious fun & immersion in the game world.  I made new friends & helped in hundreds of groups activities.  ESO still feels alive thanks to pro voice acting & random NPC's encounters.[OPINION]ESO feels unique unto itself, but still adheres to the traditional medieval high-fantasy genre.If you give it a chance, PvP is approachable even if you hate PvP.  Battlegrounds death-match & Cyrodiil open pvp style are fun once you find your style and work on your build.  The cool part about PvP is you can create you own builds and ignore the meta if you perfect your style.  So many players hate the meta grind, because they are perfectionist OR want to stay in the top 10% of the leaderboards.As for the new player experience ... it can be a bit overwhelming perhaps if you accept EVERY quest the game throws at you. Best advice is at first follow the tutorial, then complete the MAIN quest-line.  Don't be afraid to press P, select a dungeon PuG once you feel ready - Normal dungeons are easy and most of the time any player under 50 will be carried anyhow.If your on the fence and tired of TAB target MMO's -- just pickup the game on sale, grab all the CHAPTERS (it's only $20 for everything at the time of this review).ESO is easily one of the best MMO's even in 2022 - it seems to have updates that are MEH followed by updates that are COOL."
Positive,"This is the most addicitive game i've played. Been Day 1 player on Xbox, and now playing on the PC."
Positive,Fun with friends
Positive,"I wouldnt usually recommend a mmo, since it consume so much of ur time while there is so many other great games out there to play, and u will prob miss out on them if u spend all ur time in a mmo.But this 1 deserves it.I've played many mmo's and this 1 is by far the best. Excellent story and lore, really nice character customization, fun combat, u can even rearrange ur skills in ur hotbar so u dont have to learn a new rotation after every big patch.U dont need eso plus, u can upgrade ur bags and horse carry weight with in game currency, my characters have 200 slots, (u start with 9 characters) thats more than what i've seen in other mmo's. The crafting system is fast and u dont have to watch 1000 ore grind 1 by 1 and ticking hours towards a game that u don't actually play because u crafting.U don't have to wait 30 to 45 min for a dark anchor, world boss etc and make sure u early so u can get a ""good map"" since u either on EU or NA, and things doesnt take 2h to respawn.U also dont need hand holding and almost everything is soloable if u make ur build for that.Cosmetics can be bought with daily currencies, dailies that won't take u more than 30 min if u plan on doing them.There is houses that u can buy and decorate, also get some free inn's, and having a house in every map makes u travel for free.  This game have so much content, i probably wont finish it in my life time, even tho i started it in 2017 (non steam version), bonus points for letting me link my account to steam. Also it have 61k achievements."
Positive,"Lots of contents, greats stories, nice MMO overall."
Positive,cool MMO for RP's like me :b
Positive,"I've played this game for countless hours, and I must say that this game has brought me the best experience I could ever hope for in an online game. Wether you prefer to play solo or with friends, there are endless things to do in this game, ranging from doing quests like any RPG or clearing trials meant for a highly skilled group of players. Then again, maybe you don't like being a hero, which is fine, because you can join guilds and dedicate yourself in trading, PvP, RP, and more. The content is made to be available to everyone, and it keeps getting updates regurarly, bringing changes to accomodate for everyone. The mechanics are fairly simple too, so if you're new to MMORPGs, give this game a try. As for the multiplayer experience, the in-game zone chat and guilds makes it better. Most players go out of their way to help you out when needed, if you ask politely of course. I could write even more about this game, but it would not do it justice, so how about you jump in and see for yourself? Hope to see you later!"
Positive,this is a realy good game i would recommend it for others to play
Positive,its like elder scrolls but online
Positive,"A great mmo that plays well solo or as part of a group.  Every bit of dialogue is voiced, the devs constantly run streams to update the community and overall its literally Elderscrolls with other people"
Positive,it´s almost as good as the other Elder Scrolls games
Positive,"Pretty good gameplay, great for roleplaying (even if the chat will insult you for roleplaying from time to time) Parental advisory: Zone chat might cause scars on the brains of anyone under 17."
Positive,"Fun game with balanced classes. Nice crafting trees that can be helpful at any point of the game (mostly endgame) and a very interesting way to upgrade skills by morphing them. update: after playing for another 60 hours I still find new skill lines to find, more passives, better sets and millions of combinations."
Positive,"Engaging and expansive story content, with a wealth of lore and PvE quests that can be enjoyed solo or with a group. The base game is a great value for the sheer quantity of things to do, but the quality of life features gated behind the ESO+ subscription- especially the infinite crafting material storage bag - are a must for me, because crafting/inventory management is somewhere between massively annoying and completely impossible otherwise."
Positive,"Para quem gosta de um MMO que tenha muita lore, com certeza não vai se arrepender. Apesar de ter tido um lançamento um pouco complicado, acredito que o jogo chegou em um ponto que dá para agradar à todos. Com a possibilidade de fazer muito conteúdo solo e que não requer muito aprendizado - se comparado com o WoW - é um ótimo jogo para ser introduzido aos MMOs de modo geral. Recomendo e muito. Único porém é que sem o plus, o jogo fica bem complicado por questão de espaço e etc."

Positive,"I am a long-time MMO player. I started playing in 2006 with WoW (which I hated) and moved onto some F2P game that sucked down $200 down in a matter months before the server lost my character. (K2 Network can go to hell.) Anyway, I've played a lot. Most recognizable being WoW, Guild Wars 1, FF11, FF14 (my favorite), and Tera Online.Though FF14 is my favorite, ESO is just chill in a way FF14 can't be thanks to it's gear treadmill. Also, the combat is far more action oriented and builds diverse. That last bit isn't saying much since FF14 jobs are on rails, but ESO has a lot of room for customization and personalization.Thought not at FF11 or FF14's level, the story is more than servicable, and nothing at all like Skyrim's. If you like the brain dead simplicity of Skyrim's story, well, this isn't like that. It isn't a big brain story, nor does it have a significant emotional depth, but it isn't shallow.A lot of people malign the game for having content gated behind paywalls... Okay? It's not false. However the base game is quite expansive all on it's own with hundred of hours of game play. I'm sorry, but people who complain about wanting the additional thousands of hours of stuff for free are just whiners. Plain and simple. As for ESO+, it is optional, though I would argue playing without a crafting bag basically means selling all mats you get. The alternative, in my mind, is make the sub manditory. Would that make people happier. If you want nice things, someone has to pay for them and this is way better than the F2P models I've seen. As far as monitazion schemes go, this is far from the worst!That isn't to say the game is perfect. My biggest complaint is actually with the combat. I don't care for the assumption that you will be performing 2 actions per second. Frankly, my hands are too old for that! Also, if you have a server ping of more than 100ms, you'll really notice it.For those who are into it, there are mods! Yes, mods, but unlike Skyrim, they aren't necessary to fix the game. They merely add to it.Another plus is that the game features excellent controller support. (Remember those old hands I spoke of? Yeah, a game pad is a must for me.) FF14's is better, but... FF14 is FF14. There's any number of reasons it's so massive despite being so much more expensive than ESO."
Positive,"WARNING! Fighting, crafting, exploring, and quests to complete - this game will pull you in and time will pass by without you realizing it. Before you know it, your newborn will be leaving to college and you'll wonder where the time went. Great game, but don't say I didn't warn you."

Positive,Epic khajiit gameplay
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls online is one of the best mmo games I have played, with beautiful surroundings, fun quests, a good story, and the ability to customize your character in both skills and appearance.  Unlike most games of this genre, it doesn't feel super grindy, and is fairly easy to level up and find decent equipment, especially if you have friends to play some of the harder dungeons with.  The only downside to this game is that a lot of cool cosmetics are locked behind in game purchases, which wouldn't bother me too much if it was a free to play game, but alas, it is not.  Despite this, if you are a fan of the series, or just someone that likes these types of games, then i would definitely give it a try."
Positive,"Once you start play you will love it,  also be patient and give it time>In game the players are fabulous and helpful people.>Good Story and rich>Decent grafics>Realtime battle than others mmos>Freedom to use any build you want that suits on your playstyle>doesnt need to spend all your life also so many players are willing to help you>If you dont want to intercat with oithers treat the game as singleplayer is fun too!>Game Scales so you can play with everyone on any area and any level> you can do anything you want... even if you want to make a break of this game....If you play it will change your mind... so have fun! May we'll meet there !"
Positive,Nice game. Lots of things to do for any style of play.
Positive,played a lot on xbox and am bummed i can't transfer my character over. but decided to start fresh since i didnt get too much into the crafting anyways. Great game and friendly community. multiple build options if you aren't a min/maxer. 100% recommend if you've been craving an MMO.
Positive,"To start off the bad. This game has a lot of good content locked behind ESO plus (a subscription) or through micro-transactions. Are they worth it? If you have the money, yes, but it is an investment to get everything this game has to offer.But with that out of the way what is the good. The good is everything else. Playing with friends or solo is a lot of fun, you can do most quests together with your group yet each player can make their own choice.Which brings me to what I love about this game, how client sided things are. This makes it where quests can make big impacts on your world and only your world. For example, there are so many quests that let you decide if a character of the quest either lives or dies or maybe even a third option. If you decide to let them live you can see, talk and interact with them in your world, but if you decide to kill them you will see how the world reacts to both the killing and loss of the character. In one quest I did without spoiling which one, I decided to kill a person and the response was the person who killed the person became depressed and regretted their decision.But moving on, combat is smooth and clean. A big plus for me is being able to move while attacking. And there is a lot you can do with one class that you can have 2 characters of the same race and class and yet have both be vastly different in how they play.There is no limitation on who can use what, so customization of a character can go very far. For example, you can have a wizard in heavy armor with a warhammer. Although this seems unbalanced at first glance it is not so. For every weapon has bonuses that they give and debuffs. For example the wizard wearing heavy armor will have reduced speed and no bonuses towards his abilities if he was to choose light armor.As for exploration there is so much. With one DLC (Vvardenfell) it took me about 50ish hours to all the quests and that was only the quests. Note that this was listening to all the conversations and taking it slow. You can bang through a zone probably in 20ish hours. But there are about 15 zones including all DLC each with their own stories, history and lore so you get your money's worth.Crafting, this is what I would say was the biggest shock. I have played around 4 MMOs and with every one crafting was a slog, boring, and either one hell of a commitment to either you in-game wallet or your time. Though, I don't know how they did it but with this game crafting is fast (minus researching but that is fine) and not boring because you don't spend too much time doing it. Now I'm not saying it is fun but it isn't boring. Getting good and gathering all the required ingredients can be completed by just exploring the area you are in, unless you are in desperate need for materials, it is never grindy. If you still aren't happy with how slow it is, just have a designated crafter character.The community is also very interactive and kind. Though this has never been a problem with MMOs. Though playing solo I always found it hard to do the group events with randoms, though with this everyone is almost on the same page. One dungeon I was doing with 3 random people, one went afk for the restroom or something and both waited and even started joking and just talking. This game's community is awesome and I would say is the main reason going solo is worth it.If this is your first MMO then you are in for a good introduction to the genre. If you are a seasoned player of MMOs, this one has a lot to offer that is fun and unique to the genre. And if you are a fan of Elder Scrolls lore then this is a must have, for all that is said and established is cannon.One of the most solid MMOs, out there. Worth the commitment for it doesn't disappoint."
Positive,"see how many hours I've played this game, that tells you enough how much I'm into this game."
Positive,Definitely enjoying starting over on a new account after about a 3-4 year break the blackwood xpac is great with the new companion feature
Positive,"I Used To Be An Adventurer Like You, Then I Took An Arrow In The Knee ⭐⭐⭐"
Positive,"Sometimes I can't put the game down for months, other times I don't touch it for months. I've gotten a lot of fun out of it. Find a good guild, make friends. It's a really good MMO"
Positive,13 hours in with my first ever playthrough. Only at lvl 15. I'm taking my time. Haven't subscribed yet because there's just so much to do. 8/10 would recommendedit: 350 hours with an orc stamina dragonknight. 350 hours.....
Positive,"Here's the short, 8/10 large learning curve tutorial sucks. Long Review, I love this game with a passion it has amazing graphics not as in like 4k but as in the art style, fun and unique class system, while the pvp is somewhat unbalanced its the best pvp ive ever seen in a mmo, amazing world/lore building and very fun with a group. The grind hard max lvl beig 3600 at that this time, but not unfun, there is never nothing to do in this game, endless quests, dungeons, zones, armor. Just so much to do. Classes, There are 6 Classes to pick from and that sounds like very little but each class can be morphed into anything you want. wow sucks. thank you for your time."
Positive,"I love the gameplay, visuals and quest.It’s nice that all the chapters, dlc, and dungeon quest follow a story order! And if you have a very good memory, it’s cool to see someone from past quest greeting you and talking about that one last time that they crossed their path with you.I would like to see more develop into some characters, like Darien. the main story felt relative short + all the dlcs and chapters, however there is a lot to do, side quests, guilds, delves and dungeons.  I couldn´t enjoy so much the dungeons quest because everybody is busy grinding, I suggest looking for a clan or friends willing to join you in your adventure if you like lore.The only thing that It really sucks for me is that everyone loves and worship daedra, and all those daedra princes, they all are a piece of shit and backstabbing, so many stories ends in that way. It´s totally worth it to own the Last Chapter and ESO PLUS membership."
Positive,"A decent, story-driven MMO. Graphics and gameplay are showing their age, yet the lore and activities make up for it. A more detailed review will be contracted, when I will progress all the way through the endgame, and experience all of the various systems in their fullest."
Positive,"Took me a couple of days to download with my shit internet, game bugged out and gave me a DirectX error everytime I tried to load it up even though with my hardware I should be above the minimal DirectX requirements.I am currently reinstalling the game, 20-ish GB down, 30 hours playtime, the jokes just write themselves don't they?"

Positive,A very fun game would recommend!!!!
Positive,like the story and immersiondislike the lack of crafting direction and crafting inventory (although there is a craft bag available for premium subs)
Positive,By far one of my favorite games. A must have for anyone into the elder scrolls universe. Even if you've never played any elder scrolls I still highly recommend☑ Everyone☑ Casual players☑ Pro players===[]===☑ Beautiful===[]===☑ Full price☑ Wait for sale===[]===☑ Medium☑ Fast===[]===☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master===[]===☑ Endless===[] ===☑ Fantastic
Positive,"Great game. Amazing RP and PvE community. PvP is great too, but has clear ""skill brackets"" that allow newer players to be pit against highly experienced ones. Other than that, amazing game. Only issue is that resolution and graphics and flip out on you out of nowhere. 8.5 / 10 for this reason alone."
Positive,"Fun game to play solo or with friends (or even to get friends)! The game is full of lovely communities that welcomes players from any level! Its a bit slow until you reach a certain level for the first time but joining a nice guild will change the whole vibe of everything and fasten that process. Its a free to play game but I recommend buying few DLC areas after awhile <3 I'd say keep it in your wish list if you're unsure about getting it, I got the game as a gift but it fully deserves the sale price :)"
Positive,"I slept on this game for so, so long. It's so good. Especially with friends. I scoffed at this when it came out because I thought it wouldn't be as fun as Skyrim, and I was wrong. This game is so worth it. Especially on sale for $20 with all the major expansions. Such a great community as well. So many people helpful towards new people. 100% recommend."
Positive,"Few things I think this game lacks in my perspective of MMORPG would be;1- It doesn't make you feel any unsafety as you roam Tamriel, that's because there is no open world pvp. Yes, we have Cyrodill but think of it as a large arena. Things would be different if the alliances could hurt each other in certain zones. That could make the world around you more alive than it is. I think it should be implemented as a open world pvp option which the players can activate whenever they want and get more exp from quests, more yields from resources... 2- I know that it's always said that quests have been done in a way that everyone can do. But once you get used to the mechanics, get to level 50 and start to grind cp, the overland combat gets really boring. I wish that they somehow implemented a difficulty option. However, if you start a fresh new character, I guess it has a bit challenge when you are leveling from 1 to 50.3- Farming gears and obtaining crafting materials are relatively easy. Sure, you have to get through some pretty hard stuff when you are going for certain gears, but those are the endgame stuff you'll never want to take off. The only challenge is when you want to grind gear sets for many situations (Arenas, dungeons and trials or pvp). Also getting your gear to legendary tier isn't so challenging except for jewelry. I think, as I mentioned, the real hardcore challenge comes when you want to grind those for multiple characters or situations.These don't make the game less enjoyable or not fun at all. Of course, there are reasons of why the game doesn't have the style I mentioned. Even if we had what I desired above, the game would turn into a hardcore grindfest at some point and that is not fun for many. It's fun as it is and that's why I have subscription :) *******ESO has a great gameplay design, fun and hardcore dungeons, amazing scenery, aesthetic character creation options and gear designs, incredible stories and world************* PLAY IT"

Positive,I love the story and the open world of this game there are alot to do and alot of fun! But the bad thing is alot of lag
Positive,hands down the best mmorpg on steam if u have the money to spend on it. Do note though there's a lot of DLC and expansions for endgame which cost a lot of money. You will need these DLCs and expansions if you want to experience true endgame.
Positive,"I have been to the cloud district very often..Anyways, I highly recommend this game to any MMORPG lovers out there wanting to taste expansive story-driven gameplay. Personally, ESO is in my top 3 MMOs alongside FFXIV and GW2.Cheers,Fuzz."
Positive,"There are so many games out there with limited content; this is NOT one of them. There is always something to do, find, research, fight or hang out and have fun. It's really amazing."

Positive,Cool dress up game. They give you cool fighting mini-games to collect different colours and outfits. Very nice 10/10
Positive,This game is amazing with friends!  Logged in over 1000 hours and the grind don't stop!
Positive,"It's an easy to play MMO; I recommend this to people new to playing MMOs. Due to the bar-switching, it's easier to navigate through the different skills than for example in World of Warcraft. I do recommend just buying the base-game and checking if you'd actually like playing it. After that you can get the ESO+ subscription and get most of the DLC through it (plus bonus experience/inspiration boost and !crafting bag!).For people still not being sure about it, wait until the game is free for a weekend (which sometimes happens during events) and check it out then!"

Positive,yes cool mmo game
Positive,"It Is a Beauty to Behold Elder Scrolls Online is still a good looking game, even all these years after release.  Rather than relying on photo-realistic visuals which wouldn’t have aged well, ESO instead adopted a slightly fantastical aesthetic while keeping it mature, making it a joy to look at while playing even today.The beauty of the ESO is complimented by the stellar soundtrack that serves to capture and amplify the atmosphere on offer to players."
Positive,"I am still waiting to find the elder who wrote all these damn scrolls, but either way great game. I mean, who doesn't Like Skyrim with friends"
Positive,"Really fun MMO, but is not a traditional TES game. If you are looking for Skyrim multiplayer then this game is not for you. Have had lots of fun with this game and would recommend to any MMO fan who also enjoys the elder scrolls."
Positive,"I've pretty much played this game since launch on console. I recently decided to try it out on PC since my husband has a PC and i use it to game now lol. It sucks having to grind all over again with all my friends back on console but this game is fun regardless. I really like the details compared to console so definitely much more incentive to play this on PC...and cheaper. There's so much content to go through again. At least i know the build i want already, so i have something to grind for already."
Positive,Despite what people say about MMO's this is the first game of its kind ive ever tried. Now this may be bias because i have played most if not all of the elder scrolls games so it may be easier for me to get into but from by own experience this game is worth it 9/10

Positive,"Gorgeous game, increbile story and so fun with friends. One of the best MMORPG out there"
Positive,The best MMORPG Actually.
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online (2014)Friend got this for me for my birthday and it is quite a lot of fun. The entire Tamriel to explore with or without friends. Choose from one of the three factions in the game. Game plays like an MMO (cause it is one) but its done well that it still feels like a Elder Scrolls game. The maps are big and will keep you busy with a ton of quests to do. Once you hit the level cap you get prestige levels to further improve your characters. Do dungeons with people or friends. They really did improve the game a lot over the years, I remember on release the game suffered quite a bit but they have done a good job to bring the game up to a standard. Worth a try if you like online games and Elder Scrolls, but lean a bit more towards the online games side.8/10"
Positive,so awesome just wish i had friends to play this game with me i almost have 100 hours of this game and just got greymoor just now so wish me luck im going to make a magicka necromancer dps its gonna be awesome!!!!!

Positive,This character-loading screen simulator is really good. 20/20
Positive,I have never see a game like this I have played it on all consoles and I am playing it now on PC. It is my best game I have ever played.
Positive,"I bought this game 4 months ago. Overall, I really enjoy it so much, tho I will quit soon for many reasons.First, to me its not playable without the subscription and the prices is too high for me. Second, my Pc is great it runs the game with ultra settings if i wish to my graphic card set it like this by itself at first meantime I lowered everything and still have lots of lags and fps drop in solo arena and trials especially the part when I press the abilities many times or switching bar sometimes take 1 min to do so.... I think thy rly need to optimise this game for further enjoyment :)UPDATE I still see its the poor sides of the game especially don't  let me to do hardcore without bugs and i feel game target me when I do something for the first time with curses and other mecantics more than any player in the group for instance getting oneshot in no deth dungen in the last sec or when the group decide to wipe all group be unable to revive witch have to close the client  or when you are in the midde of the trial u become so ussless something unable u form using skills and autoatacks forever to fix that  u have to relog:)"
Positive,Fascinating experience for those who enjoyed skyrim
Positive,"PVP is HORRIBLE, like really don't even try to pvp without reading tons of guidesthe rest is ok5/10"
Positive,Only get if you have at least 1 other friend to play with because if not then the game is very overwhelming and just not enjoyable.
Positive,"Great game! Tons of content, enjoyable game play loop, but their is a lot of things to pay for only negative thing."
Positive,Fun game to play with friends. There are lots of people that are friendly and willing to help out new players.
Positive,This is the greatest game ever made!
Positive,"i reccomend this game, the story is good, the difficulty is decent, and for a MMORPG its great, but its HUGE flaw in my opinion if ur a gamer that plays alone i would not recommend it, i like playing the tank/healer, and i wanted to do the story, it took me WAY to long to clear some of the missions and dont get me started on dungeons, if u got friends or plan on getting it with some friends yes get it, but dont get it if u want to play alone, cuz the experience alone is so bad."
Positive,"[Update as of August 2022]I've not played this game for a long while now and the only thing I miss from this game, is my old guild in its prime, and the 200+ Euro Vampire Castle I've grinded about 1000 hours of playtime in. Hanging dragon skeleton included in the throne room. If you ignore the meta and stick to Dungeons you can literally play EVERY build you can think of. The two-handed dps/healer build I'll mention later? Yeah... when I wrote it I had no idea how bad of an idea that was near endgame. Until I pushed myself at 1800+ hours ingame, and made it work. Similar healing output, but less mobile, 80% of my regular dps against groups, but the same against solo targets. For those who didn't follow any of that. I made it work. My weirdass idea for an ""impossible"" build, was still possible and viable under certain conditions. Just keep your weird builds for playing with friends as people online will nitpick everything if you don't manage to keep up with them. The Elder Scrolls Online was a little lackluster at release. I bought it and thought to myself: ""well, for the same money I can have a better experience elsewhere"". I came back with the release of Greymoor, started out without a subscription and a week later: I have a subscription and purchased Greymoor as well. Safe to say I'm enjoying the game again. ESO: Online finally has enough content to keep you busy for months. It's safe to say this game isn't without flaws. Hell, there are a ton. Ranging from annoying bugs during dungeons, towards game-changes that are doubtful to say the least. I literally convinced two of my friends to get the game as well - which they did - only to realize that pvp content is restricted to full party play (4 people minimum) or solo. They completely removed the option to que for battlegrounds with 2 or 3 player parties making it redundant to get this game if you (only) want to pvp with a friend or partner. You cannot do PvP with 3 players and let a random player fill the last spot, unless you fill that spot with players from (your) guilds. It stimulates getting to know new people (low toxicity), but it also forces you to spend more time within the game. PvP has taken a back position compared to the rest of the game. With the addition of ""One Tamriel"" all leveling has been flatlined. Everything and everyone is at the same level and up until level 50 Champion level 160 (I'd say ~80-120 hours of gameplay), your gear will decline in quality the more you level. Take this to heart: it makes leveling up to level 50 basically ""the tutorial"" of the game. After level 50 you have most skills and passive you want for the playstyle you want. Sadly this also makes crafting trivial right up to endgame, you simply level too fast to keep up with your crafting skills that heavily require skillpoints you are investing to become stronger first. Your equipment does take a blow from this change. Everything you collect before you are lvl 50 (CP 160) you are unable to keep. Nothing. If you have gear of your actual level you are ""basically"" at full strength and with each level you gain, your old gear becomes weaker with time.So besides the bugs - you will notice at one point - the restrictive pvp matchmaking and the heavy focus on PvE content this game isn't for everyone. It's not WoW with endless gameplay-loops. Compared to WoW, ESO: Online there is actually less of a grind. Everything you do, is up to you, literally. I'm currently playing as a Vampire Necromancer healer that goes into combat with a two-handed axe and can heal when needed (I'm a dps/healer, which is working so far).However... the ""true endgame"" isn't as flexible. There are - as they say - meta sets, and meta builds. For the most part they are required to finish end-game content. It makes things like being a vampire risky because you take extra fire damage, so you might want to reconsider being a vampire. ""Play as you want"" becomes trivial the further you go. Magica users are (mostly) punished for using stamina based weapons. In their hands those weapons do less damage. The more you push endgame the less flexible the game becomes. It will enforce certain skills, morphs (variations) and gear sets which can take a lot of time to acquire and fine-tune. Changing these skills isn't cheap for everyone.So is this game for you?The Elder SCrolls Online is incredibly accessible to all players. It does not matter if you are a beginner and your friends are experienced, you can always play (most) content together with the exception of endgame content. The game's graphics are 'okay' but the level design makes some scenes absolutely astonishing. I would recommend getting the base game cheap and keep playing it until you know you want to play more. The standard content is a little boring compared to the DLC, but you will get a good impression if you like/dislike the actual game. A subscription is completely optional, BUT it unlocks all content with the exception of the last paid DLC (at this time: Greymoor). Including many quality of life features you literally don't want to live without after you've gotten it. You can also start question literally anywhere on the continent. They removed all faction restrictions, which may be a little weird story wise at times, so you can experience the entire story without the restriction of classes (only pvp is faction bound).So if you grew tired of WoW and want an upgrade? This game might be fun, but honestly there are still better games. If you also love The Elder Scrolls lore with fun PvE content? This game might actually be worth the purchase. Just keep in mind that it IS a Bethesda published game and they will literally ask money for everything. Getting the subscription will give you ingame money (about the same value as the subscription costs) so you can permanently unlock all dlc if you ever plan to stop the subscription and continue playing (you likely won't). This means investing that same money into skins/perks is bound to happen. Good thing is, almost 90% of the content you pay for is unlocked for all your characters. So if you can refrain yourself from buying skins, it's wise to invest those crows to permanently unlock the DLC's for the day you come back for more. If you are literally rich and want to dump your money somewhere? You can with this game! Just take your time and you will unlock so much more later on. I have a 1 euro per hour invested rule-of-thumb. Meaning that if I play for 60 hours (for free) I can buy DLC's worth a similar price. However, with most of the DLC sticking around 2000 crowns, they are not worth the investment in many cases. Just get the subscription, play everything and wait for the next DLC once you feel like you've done it all."
Positive,Out of all the Games on Steam this one is my favorite. This was my first exposure to Elder Scrolls games and I have had a very positive experience. There are so many ways to play and enjoy the many activities on Elder Scrolls Online. The story telling and graphics are top quality. 2 thumbs up!
Positive,:) ITS A PRETTY COOL GAME!
Positive,is game very good play well yes good enjoy very much
Positive,waka waka e o e
Positive,"I'm not saying this is a great game. However, if there were a pandemic and millions of people were forced to stay home, it would be okay to play."
Positive,good game yes
Positive,"I decided to give it a go, given that TES6 would not release any time soon. And oh boy! I was missing so much fun! I love it! Feels like an elder scrolls game, quests are awesome, combat is really cool and fast paced.I honestly recommend to give it a try!"
Positive,"The heartache, and the thousand natural shocksThat flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummationDevoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep--To sleep--perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub,For in that sleep of death what dreams may comeWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,Must give us pause. There's the respectThat makes calamity of so long life.game alright but the servers are down a lot- it's not a bug, its a feature"
Positive,"This game does a lot of things right—account-wide unlocks, a staggeringly exhaustive housing system that lets you terraform if you so desire, and a frustratingly good story. What it lacks is less obvious monetization. Zenimax and Bethesda both attempt to microtransaction you to death—buy some experience boosters, buy a new mount skin, buy an outfit slot for a character. Mind your money."
Positive,A lot to do which can be overwhelming but if you get bored with something you got lots of other options to do. Combat is simple but adds a little difficulty with the blocking and disrupting actions. I love the collection and questing which is not plain. I am more of a collector and adventurer so love the many different zones to explore.
Positive,Ist good Free Vbucks
Positive,"Okay , first of all, the game is great, I mean perfect. I will tell alot about it , but before you stop reading and run to buy it , I have to say that you wont be playing it peacefully and enjoying it untill you buy plus membership. It will be a never ending pain trying to enjoy this game struggling inventory space and not having the ingridients for the things you need to or you have to do. Because the only thing makes this game enjoyable and playable is given with plus membership, the material bag, that holds all the material so you wont waste inventory space for them. Seems like a little detail for someone did not play the game yet. Thats what I thought buying it. But you need to get and hold on to every little material in the game to be able to play it without struggle. But there are thousands of them! even if you fill all the bank space with materials , and also your inventory , it will not be enough. The game will also keep on throwing the things you have to keep in your inventory which will make you suffer more and more untill you go and buy that plus membership. So if you will not buy the membership , dont buy the game! It will be an agony. But if you leave all this to a side , or you buy the plus membership , oh man  its an heaven.. Take skyrim , the map and the story and  all the glorious nature and view , the great game play, and skills everything , multiply them with 100...  It is not pay to win, but it is pay to have fun, or cry all day struggling."
Positive,Fun break from more traditional mmo's.
Positive,من اجمل الالعاب في التاريخ
Positive,It's a fun game
Positive,I leyk de gem
Positive,"If you are a gamer who enjoy's making their own to do list, then this game is for you. If you like games where the next step is obvious and narrative then you may lose interest quickly as the game can sometimes be overwhelming with multiple stories and objectives."
Positive,"I was only nine years old. I loved Todd Howard so much, I had all the merchandise and games. I'd pray to Todd Howard every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I've been given. ""Todd is love"", I would say, ""Todd is life"". My dad hears me and calls me a faggot. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Todd Howard. I called him a cunt. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it's really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. It's Todd. I'm so happy. He whispers in my ear, ""200 ENDINGS"". He grabs me with his powerful nerd hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Todd. He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Todd. I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please Todd. He roars a mighty DLC roar, as he fills my butt with his love. My dad walks in. Todd looks him straight in the eye, and says, ""It just works"". Todd leaves through my window. Todd is love. Todd is life."
Positive,im still broke
Positive,"As an old WoW player this is surprisingly awesome game. By no means perfect, but way better compared to current Blizzard games. I will stick with it for sure."
Positive,"Pog mechanics, gr8 for vibing to"
Positive,a pretty good RPG game as far as I played it...do recommend it tho.
Positive,I can't believe how AWESOME this game!
Positive,A fun Elder scroll title to play.  It has a large world.  The community is nice.  I will give the game 10/10.
Positive,"Great MMO- great graphics, voice acting for every quest, and heaps of character customizability."
Positive,"I recommend this game with a caveat; only with friends.It's an MMORPG, sure you could play on your own, but why the fuck would you?The game really doesn't offer me that much as an experience on its own, but the game facilitates a different and better experience alongside it, and that's having friends in voicechat and messing about for a couple hours."
Positive,"I have to reccomend this game as an Elder Scrolls fan but im not happy about it. This game as an MMO is far too pricey (if you dont want to make a subscription like in WoW) with each dlc costing near 20-25$ at launch, the crown store is basically a pay-to-win money trap and the PvP can be unfair and unbalanced, however the game has a lot to do in singleplayer, I spent more than half of my hours at singleplayer and i still haven't come anywhere close to completing everything. The game is really well suited for casual gaming which is why the grindy mechanics can be tedious sometimes. Overall if you want a singleplayer experience I cannot recommend this enough, however if you want a competetive/multiplayer, be ready to spend time and money."
Positive,Great game to play with friends.
Positive,This is a very fun game that brings me much joy.
Positive,Outstanding well made game with endless amounts of content.
Positive,I played this game for years on ps4. I honestly love it so much and switching to pc was my best decision.
Positive,I like it.
Positive,ESO is one of the best games I have ever played. I was so very glad that it came out.
Positive,One of the best MMORPGS
Positive,I like this game.
Positive,"It's a pretty good game. Sadly i don't have a computer strong enough to play it so i only managed to experience it through cloud gaming services. But if i had a good computer though, i'd probably spend hundreds ,or even thousands, of hours playing it."
Positive,Many hours wasted and more to wasteGood game
Positive,"The best mmorpg game ive ever played, and im a fan of the elder scrolls franchise so this is perfect in that sense."
Positive,"It's nice, looks great, it's fun - specially if you play it with friends."
Positive,"I have not played many Elder Scrolls titles (just Oblivion and Skyrim) two games that i really love and always end up coming back to sooner or later. This game feels pretty unique to them having a whole new world to explore with some things that come back from the other games. I love you don't need to do main questing for very long at all and you can freely explore the world after you've done a few of the main missions, I thought i wouldn't see very many people but you can come across players in houses or dungeons like seeing a man transform into a werewolf and destroying a cave of people or my first encounter with earwaxjoe where we both thought eachother were bad guys and starting punching eachother for a whole minute10/10 bless ur soul earwaxjoe"
Positive,"First the negative, I recently tried the pvp and was disappointed, I play a lot of pvp shooters and never had to endure a loading screen in the middle of a fight before. But optimisations are coming this year, and I'm sure I will come to enjoy pvp in ESO more once I get to know what I'm doing.But overall I love this game! I play RPG's if I want a more relaxing time. I came to this from Oblivion and Skyrim, and although this game is pretty different, it is still excellent! I recently picked up Elswyr and Sommerset, and the quality of those areas, in every respect, is an improvement on what came before. Although the older areas are a bit dated now, the shear quantity of content means it is no problem at all, if you're not jiving with what you find yourself doing you just go and do something else, no restrictions, no problems."
Positive,My second favorite Elder Scrolls game. Zenimax Online ironically seems to care more about the franchise more than modern Bethesda does.
Positive,YES! GO BUY THIS
Positive,"Great game with thousands of hours of content. I like that the surrounding world scales around your character, regardless of what level you are. The game gives you very little in terms of an actual 'tutorial', which can be a bit intimidating at first, so you have to heavily rely on guides and online resources. Overall, it has a solid community with a large player base. I highly recommend playing your character to level 10 or 20 before you make your mind up about this game."
Positive,best MMORPG to date i bought it twice
Positive,"Amazing game, got fokin lost in it's massive universe"
Positive,Good Game <3
Positive,"Absolutely fantastic game. Very Skyrim -related, even though very far away from it mechanics-wise.Runs darn well and includes lots of fun with or without friends."
Positive,"One of the best mmos hands down, watch out for the end game!"
Positive,i love this game
Positive,"The game has so much to offer even if you just buy the base game. I like how big the map, rather the world is in ESO and the never ending side quests in the game. And you can also choose to battle royale and the best part is THERE ARE MULTIPLE ALLIANCES FIGHTING <3"
Positive,"They said that when this all began, it was a mess. When I arived to Tamriel, some two years after, a lot of bugs had disappeared, and the result looks nice and interesting, with a lot of space to explore, and grow. I like what they have done with ESO. Really love it."
Positive,"I'd like to say first off that I haven't touched PVP yet or done much PVE dungeons. I have mainly done crafting and PVE questing, and as a person who loves testing out the different options and playstyles I have made 9 characters and played with each, some more than others.My general opinion before going in-depth is that it is a very enjoyable game with a few technical issues and some quality of life features absent (I do recommend getting ESO Plus as it helps with this), but as far as mmos go Elder Scrolls Online is one of the best. I could never get into any mmos before, but this one got me hooked.Now for specifics.Pros:-The game itself looks really nice visually, sometimes you'll just stop to look at the view. The architecture and design of objects is interesting.-Crafting is compelling and viable, it makes you feel like your character really is a blacksmith or a alchemist, whichever profession you want.-Combat is fun and dynamic, you get to be more reactive and alert than more tab-targeting mmos. The way you can mix class skills with weapon skills and other skill lines leads to more customizable characters and ways to play.-Quests are mostly fun and interesting and they relate to your surroundings-Each npc is voiced, albeit areas will often have very similar voices since it would be a lot for the studio if each npc had their own unique voice.-Some npcs are brought back for dlc so it's often nice to see them again.-Collecting motifs can be tedious but it is worth it to get more styles, as we all know fashion is end game for most mmos.-The outlaw system is amazing! I would love it if every elder scrolls game based their outlaw system on the one in ESO. I get to feel like a thief, an assassin, and make good amounts of money at the same time.-You can get a good amount of collectibles for free, more than I thought I would if I played without paying for crates or items in the crown store.-Being able to swap back and forth from 1st person to 3rd person.(I'd like to add that the best moment in-game for me was during the Orsinium DLC in the throne room with chief Kurog and the orc chiefs. I won't say what happens for those that haven't experienced it yet, but when it happened it was sunset for me and I was in first person view. It felt like a movie scene and right after I was amazed that this game could make a moment be that cool.)Cons:-Animations are stiff and lackluster, this game would be so much better  visually and immersive if the animations got more attention.-Occasional bugs that usually make you have to reset a quest or start a dungeon all over again (getting back to the dungeon included), like being stuck in a wall in dungeon.-Inventory space without ESO Plus is dreadful, honestly the craftbag is the main reason I decided to try out and stick with a subscription.-Progression with riding skills should be account based instead of each character based.-While the crown store itself doesn't feel too intrusive some the items are immersion breaking, to me at least.-Combat at times can feel repetitive-The same achievements popping up for each character, as in one of them would have already gotten it and then when playing with another character who does the same thing they get the pop-up for it as well which throws me off.-While the mechanics for this game are fun and interesting the game doesn't do the best job explaining them.(A frustrating moment was when I was doing a quest for the fighters guild of going into a dwarven dungeon, I got knocked into a wall and stuck there. I was almost at the end and hated having to restart, not even in the dungeon again but getting to the dungeon as well. There should be a way to send me back to the last room I was in or something.)That's about it, I really enjoy and love this game problems and all. Until TES 6 comes out this will be my constant source of Elder Scrolls. I love skyrim too but I am not in the mood to go into Bleak Falls Barrow again."
Positive,"ESO is canon, deal with it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
Positive,"Most solid and balanced MMO RPG I’ve ever seen.Player Classes are pretty balanced, and the Gameplay is challenging. Image is fine and the World is also Story rich. So definitely worth try."
Positive,"Simply put: I dislike MMO',s. I love this game.It is unique."
Positive,Eso is the game where you can become the dog and win the log 5 stars out 5 stars rating
Positive,"steam awards, hehe"
Positive,"this is a good game with good story and good combat, what was my max dps again?"
Positive,"Great game with loads of content. Highly recommend this game. I was not a fan of Elder Scrolls games before this one, but since, I have played both Skyrim and Oblivion."
Positive,"I would highly recommend this game due to the sheer amount of things you can do. Sure; you have to buy a lot of the DLC, but that doesn't mean there isn't a story without said DLC. The simplicity of the controls is nice :3"
Positive,"At first before the whole One Tamriel Update, the game was difficult like every other MMORPG.  Where certain areas required specific levels however after the whole One Tamriel the game changed and its actually more fun than before.  I can't stop playing the game as each expansion and DLC has new content that makes the game challenging and fun at the same time.  The gameplay is amazing, though small ability bar forces you to pick which ability you must use and challenges you as you level them up over time.  In my experience the game is very fun and I do recommend the game for my friends who want this game."
Positive,"Finally finished customising my character, can't wait to see what this game has to offer!"
Positive,Been playing since beta went from pc-PS4-pc can’t stop playing!
Positive,Its just simply a good game and most people that hate on it havnt played it or only played on release when it wasnt in a good state. It's well worth a try if you love mmo's.
Positive,I like the game so much stuff to do
Positive,First and only Elder Scrolls game I like and enjoy playing. Huge plus for being really playable solo. I don't have time or motivation to participate in any kind of guild activity.
Positive,its an mmo with TES lore
Positive,"The amount of customization options, from the player's home, to their playstyle, to their outfits, makes the whole game feel much more like YOUR adventure: it's one of the most, if not the most, personalise-able MMOs I've played. The gameplay itself is easy to become familiarised with, and the storylines are very interesting."
Positive,"As someone who loves online games, I couldn't recommend this enough. It's a great, open game where you can play alone (get that grind in, level up at your own pace which I start off doing) or play with friends (dungeon party, guild hang outs, world boss runs) which is also a really fun semi-chaotic way to earn XP and roll through bosses. I've finished the main questline, but it's heartening to know there's still so much to do. Thousands of side quests, ever-increasing DLCs, special events. Take it from a humble college kid: This game keeps me going."
Positive,"I wanted to fall back into Tamriel after being one of the brave souls so long ago to experience the beta. My potato PC at the time not withstanding, there were a lot of issues that I ran into, and eventually grew tired of and let this title slip away to give it time to be actually finished. I came back recently after seeing the new content being advertised, as I wanted to give ESO time to become the game we were wanting back in the pre-release days.Now, I so want to say yes, go and buy this and enjoy immersing yourself into Tamriel with your friends, and even make a tonne of new friends across this globe of ours. But, I cannot. I saw the Morrowind content was on sale, so of course, me being the nostalgic turd I am, I grabbed it and decided to return to the land of Tamriel.That was where I was let down and left entirely confused. I watched the intro cinematic involving a certain NPC, lets call him ""Wormy"" for non-spoilery type things, as well as his employer...hmm, Bob lets say. Now, everyone who has played the ""Vanilla"" game before will know full well the rather unique tutorial level you begin in where you get your bearings. With Morrowind installed, I had none of that. At all. I ended up creating my character (7 hours playtime, but about 5 were character creation. Might be joking, but lets face it...the struggle is real even now) and where was I? I had to check to make sure I didn't somehow unlock TES3 Remastered for a sec there. But yes. I arrived in Morrowind in the very beginning.While not exactly unwelcome or anything to see the province that introduced me to the world of Nirn, it was rather...well, offputting. Now, not in a logistical way or anything, but a more confusing manner where I was free to go about my Morrowindy business, but decided to take off back to Anvil to see the Gold Coast. Once there, I had a random robed NPC in black robes off to the side to speak with, and of course, I was expecting some ""We Know"" slap, but it was instead the Main Quest integration, and mentions of my rather rude termination by my employer Bob in the beginning of my adventure, but yet I started in Morrowind.Am I bothered by an immersion break? Well, kind of. But its not truly *MY* complaint as I want people just coming into this world to experience the origins as it was, not be thrust into the current DLC you may have upon a new character being painstakingly carved out of sliders and coffee. Petty complaint, sure. But, honestly, I would rather begin the game as I once did way back in the days of my Potato PC that would immolate trying to run Minecraft. Then, I'd like to organically venture out to Morrowind at my own pace, and build myself up to prepare.Controls are rather awkward to a degree, but actually fairly solid and standard MMO style layouts. The game world is absolutely Keanu (Breathtaking). Will I re-sub and save crowns to unlock the 'smaller' packs? Of course. I don't by *any* stretch of the imagination dislike ESO. Not now anyway. Beta, well, that was an entirely different thing. And yes, I just rambled on for a good while on a review of ESO to complain about an immersion issue. I'm going to give this an upward facing thumb on the basis of it being fairly solid, and the microtransactions aren't in the realm of being too insane. If you want to see that, well, go check out Neverwinter. Also, if you like the Fallout 4 building mechanics at all, they're here in ESO as well, granted in a fairly low calorie version to add bits and baubles to your housing. I only had a room in Balmorra which I maybe had a table in. So yay. I was rich."
Positive,"Really fun game to play, especially with friends :D"
Positive,pretty good game
Positive,"fun leveling, good endgame and great pvp"
Positive,Meh it good i guess
Positive,"If you're looking for another Elder Scrolls, this isn't it. Still enjoyable though."
Positive,best mmorpg game
Positive,"This game is okay. You really have to be a MMO diehard or an Elder Scrolls Lore Fiend to really make the most out of your buck. A lot of cool cosmetics is locked under a paywall and a lot of areas and quests are locked behind area DLC. Its a low key money hog but you can enjoy the base game just fine for a while. There is a ton of content if you like MMO style games. Variety in terms of classes is present and races as well. The game also tries its best to mimic the most loved elder scrolls style, gameplay, and atmosphere. I personally do not fit into the category but I can see how some people can have fun and sink hours in it."
Positive,I guess I like it.
Positive,"It's like WoW, but Todd Howard made it."
Positive,"Many bugs, many fun moments"
Positive,"I have spent a lot of time in this game exploring. When the game first released, it was pretty lackluster, but they have continued to give it support and it is now a great game for anyone to hop into and experience the world of Tamriel."
Positive,"This is no normal MMO, if you played games like Skyrim and Oblivion the story is in line with those games. However, if you're an avid MMO, this game will feel very different to play due to a great story. I'll recommend ""The questing guide"" addon for new players since you'll be able to follow the story easily. It will show the order and you'll be able to perform all the main quests in order.The lore is vast and covers everything in the universe without skipping a beat. If you're interested in questing I'll recommend buying the collection as it'll contain all the latest DLCs (very good deal), then the year 1 mega pack for dark brotherhood and thieves guild. Orsinium is also great. Now, I see people complaining for the mostly negative reviews here and some have valid concerns. The ESO+ subscription is not needed at all, guilds often let crafters use their banks for mats and you don't need to go storing that stuff. As for the graphics, I'll recommend Aronfel's Reshade on Nexus mods (instructions there). It'll add a ton of post processing to the game and make the colours pop more whilst allowing for some hdr-like effects.Now for combat, everyone says it feels janky or hard to perform. Yes, there's a rough skill barrier, However, with the addon perfect weave and weave delays, it'll lower the barrier for skill as it'll do all the global cool down limits for you. Overall, this is a great game and if you like TES and it's lore, you'll love this game. It's currently free on epic and the plane meld and alliance quest are over a hundred hours worth of content. It's not boring either and the voice acting is amazing."
Positive,"This is a decent MMORPG of the fantasy genre, and easily goes hand-in-hand with Skyrim, lore-wise.  While the interface allows you to interact with the world in similar ways to Skyrim, at first glance, it is a different system.  Whereas Skyrim was a completely open skill-based character development model, ESO forces you to pick a race and class combo which will limit your choices for development.  You will find that you still have a monstrous number of ways to customize your character, though, as each class can be played a number of ways, and the addition of general and racial skills can totally change how that works for you.Currently, there is an enormous amount of land to explore and quest in, and this is enhanced by optional content which can be purchased through the ESO store (and much of which is available, anyway, if you subscribe to ESO+).  The game operates on a model similar to Guild Wars 2, wherein you buy the base game and whichever of their several expansions you wish to play in, and you CAN just stick to that and never pay another dime.  I have found it beneficial to subscribe to their ESO Plus service plan, though, as it delivers a certain number of store coins, and gives me access to most of the smaller content packages not included in the full size expansions I bought.Crafting is fairly well done, and can contribute significantly to gameplay, and is available to everyone.  There are craftable equipment sets.  Potions, poisons, gear, and other products are usable at the level they are crafted at, and worth trading for with other players.  In addition, one of the benefits of the ESO Plus service is having access to an ingredient bag that is separate from your personal inventory, and is accessible from all characters on your account.I don't participate in PVP much, so I won't comment on that.I really like the vampire and werewolf systems, and there are a number of ways to become them, some of which involve money.Overall, a well developed MMORPG and worth your time if you like the genre."
Positive,"Honestly a amazing game. It had a rough start at release. I have been playing since the first beta, and across console & PC. This game has a ton of content, and so much high level play. You don't have to play with people for everything. Most things can be accomplished on your own. Which for me is a huge plus."
Positive,"10/10 would recommend if you know how to download a game, ignoring all these negative reviews for issues that can be solved with a ticket to support (which btw respond in a few hours in my experience).The game features a massive world that feels like it's living and the immersion is absolutely there.  With choices for some decisions you make throughout the story, you can feel like your contributing to this living world and have a more personal connection to it. Combat wise, it isn't the most intense and is fairly simple, even with the weapon swap mechanic that allows you to use 2 weapons throughout your rotation, which keeps things spicy throughout the leveling experience but also at end game.The biggest selling point however has to be the customization and how you can literally make a tank/healer in 1 build, with an menacingly large array of different sets you can combine and mess with, added with the variety each class provides. Wanna be a blood sucking templar of the light? Go ahead and bite for the light! Wanna be a summoner of the dead whilst healing your friends? You do you buddy! Definitely a must buy, especially at £7.49 on sale(The ""P2W craft bag"" that people cry about is probably the least of everyone's concerns and more so is the DLC the game releases every few months there's alot to do if you dont mind buying it. Banks and crafting characters exist for a reason xD)"
Positive,"Best game for me because i love the Elder Scrolls series games!! You can join a online version of the all of the Elder Scrolls series games!!! Depending from which race you choose  to play will also determinate , your faction also and there are 3 factions in total!! You will need to level up your character , either by killing enemies or by doing so many interesting quests!! With so much interesting places to explore and see! This  game without doubt will never make you boored in this kind of huge world! With so many materials to collect , and skills to improve!! And this game have it all!! so = TESO is a masterpiece!! :)))))))))"
Positive,"Great game, The world is beautiful and rich. The story and the quests are amazing.It feels like Skyrim with different combat (not realistic like Skyrim but it's more addictive) but it still has that Elder Scrolls vibe. The graphics look awesome and the fact that I can play it on Med-High with my shitty PC proves that the devs really care about the game's performance. The Battlegrounds PVP is mediocre because it's not really tweaked. (No, I don't suck at it, never scored below top 3 yet, played like 20 matches so far) There are certain PVP builds that make enormous damage and have enormous HP that are getting abused and if you see them in the enemy team, you already know that you are gonna lose the game. PVP aside, the game is 8/10 IMO and I never played MMOs before. (Probably the reason why I think the PVP sucks is because the PVP in MMOs is gear/class based instead of everyone being equal and using skills/teamwork to win the game)"

Positive,"I never thought I would be one of those people, but here I am.Ahem....I PLAYED IT FOR A BIT, IT'S OKAY I GUESS."
Positive,"How-To:1. Create ESO account2. Wait for game to finish downloading3. Character creation and tutorial4. ???5. ProfitBut really, this is a fantastic game. Starting out will be slow and I really recommend that you figure things out for yourself for a while (a few days at least) before asking other players for help and pointers. There's just so much to do, from PvE combat and quests to the PvP zones, wrapped up with Crafting, Housing, Dungeons, Trials, and more.You can have multiple characters, up to 8 (I believe) before purchasing extra slots. After a character hits level 50, it starts leveling by Crown Points, which are account-wide and will match up across your lvl 50 characters. Example: Your first character has blown past lvl 50 and has hit CP103. When your next toon hits lvl 50, their CP level will automatically jump to 103, as well. As of writing this review, anyway. Changes seem to be in the air.But the system of multiple toons allows you to have different pack mules playstyles available to you when one starts feeling stale. Get tired of face-tanking damage with your main tank? Switch to a toon you're grooming for DPS, or hop onto the character you made specifically for crafting, and complete your daily writs.Guilds & CraftingYou can join up to 5 different player guilds at a time. Guilds tend to be either Social/Roleplay-based, focused on End-Game Content/Dungeon-running, or made for Trading (You can sell items to a variety of other players if your guild has commissioned an npc trader). Trading is the big bucks here because the economy is player regulated; prices fluctuate as items drift in and out of demand.  So crafting is something you should really get into if you plan on making in-game gold currency. If you have a character you want to be a crafter, you should be researching weapons/armor from the very start. Find a crafting station hub, read those pop-up tutorials, and manage your skill points wisely.A note about crafting: It's apparently easier to do when you purchase the optional monthly subscription plan, which unlocks the almighty Crafting Bag. The Crafting Bag is a service that holds any and all crafting materials you collect while your sub is active, keeping the dozens upon dozens of materials from clogging your limited inventory. Apparently it makes things easier. But I have survived without it for ~800 hours, and you can, too (periodic free ESO Plus trials will try to drag you into the trap, but you can still use materials from the Craft Bag after the trial is over, just can't put any new ones in).A Note on DLCBuying Crowns?(ESO's macrotransaction, purchasable currency) It's more profitable to purchase an ESO Plus subscription plan because you get the same amount of Crowns for what you pay per month, in addition to gaining access to all of the game's DLC areas.Note that the ESO Plus sub does not give you access to the Expansion areas; Summerset (unless it's gone the way of Morrowind and is part of the base game by the time you read this), Murkmire, and Elsweyr. Get a hunky collector's edition if you think you're going to love the game! Otherwise, the base game has more than enough content for you to explore and take advantage of, and you can upgrade to the expansions later when they go on sale, if you make the correct decision that they are worth your money.THINGS NOOBS SHOULD KNOW◘ Items in open-area chests -and crafting nodes, for that matter- do not spawn separately for other players. What's in a chest is what's in a chest, and if you loot one dry while a player that got there first is fighting off their aggro'd mobs, that player will not be pleased. Only chests/heavy sacks in the game's instanced Dungeons and Trials will have loot aplenty for everyone.◘ Stablemasters are good folk. Pay them once every 20 hours to increase one of your character's mount skill stats.◘ Press H to summon your mount once any of your characters have hit level 10. (unless you changed your keybindings)◘ You can change your keybindings! And toggle 'Prevent Attacking Innocents' (a very helpful measure against unintentional bounties). Explore the Settings menu and get comfortable with your options.◘ Speaking of bounties, guards in zones have infinite HP. You cannot kill them. Run.◘ Type / and then any combination of letters; then Enter when one matches and BAM, that's an emote. Popular ones include /dance, /playdead, /sweep, /salute, etc.◘ /zone chat will display for everyone in the entire instance of wherever you might be, such as the open land of the Alik'r Desert or an instanced Delve in Vvardenfell. /yell will display for players that are in a slightly closer, more immediate area around you and is used more sparingly, for effect. /say chat goes out to people in your very immediate area; 15 meters or so. /tell, /group, and /guild2 should be self-explanatory.◘ You can type /quit to close the game entirely, or /camp to log out to the character selection screen. Or you can press Esc and then click those same options with your mouse. Like a normie. Your call.Other players are very helpful and willing to help. Unless they're a NightBlade DPS in a vet dungeon who knows exactly what you're doing wrong and it has nothing to do with them. If you have questions after a few days/weeks of playing the game, ask in /zone chat to address everyone in the large instance. Or the /guild[#] chat of whatever you might have managed to join.Beyond the LauncherBethesda does promotional ESO content Twitch streams sometimes at twitch.tv/bethesda. Drops are enabled during those; have your ESO account linked to Twitch and watch for 10 minutes without having the stream muted, and you're guaranteed the drop if it's a pet or other special thing -and you have slightly lesser odds of getting a weak crown crate.Add-ons are allowed and encouraged in this game. esoui.com is the library, and they're all safe and won't kill you. Some people use Minion, some kind of addon helper, which I've heard makes managing things very easy. Explore the addon library once you've experienced vanilla ESO for a while and have an idea of what you're looking for in an addon. Don't install too many or your odds of slower gameplay/undesired bugs increases.At the time of posting this review, I've been playing for 2 months shy of a full year and have 1000 hours of playtime logged. That number will continue to rise. So, too, hopefully, will the player base. Join us."
Positive,So yeah its elder scrolls with mmo elements....yeahits fun
Positive,"It's pretty good. Exploration is a big part of this game and it gets really immersive. PvP is pretty good and is pretty fun to play with friends. Combat system is ok, pretty smooth. Overall really awesome mmorpg. 8/10"
Positive,"If you like the Idea of open World PvP good for you. ZOS doesn't. At it's current state (speaking for EU Servers only) its unplayable.1. Loading Screens that take 2-5minutes & maybe force you to restart the game entirely. 2. High Ping no matter how good ur connection might be.3. Input lag that makes the combat system just unbearable.Battlegrounds (4v4v4) is pretty cool though.Honestly the PvE Content is amazing, it would take way to long to summarise everything. PogU"
Positive,Always find my self coming back to this game.
Positive,Finally it's working like it was supposed to months ago.
Positive,i love it
Positive,"Very solid game, membership could be a little cheaper for Brazil."
Positive,Limitless possibilities. Play with friends or alone; do what the hell you want to .
Positive,"Very gripping and lot's of different styles of gameplay available (Dungeons, battlegrounds, pvp etc.) Also gives nostalgia to people who love and have played The Elder Scrolls series. Only critique I could give is that it asks for extra purchases for the imperial race and a few DLC's but I guess most MMORPG's are like that nowadays, but at least it's not pay 2 win."
Positive,"10 euros for the standard game and the morrowind chapter is a great deal considering at launch the base game was worth 60 euros plus an additional 15 per month! I have over 130 hours at the making of this review and it has paid out, it's a fun game if you have the time to play it. There is some grind in the game but exploring the vast world of Tamriel makes up for that. There are some restrictions if you don't buy the other DLC and i'm considering purchasing them."
Positive,Is an awesome game and pretty cool to see places like Cyrodiil and Morrowind with advanced graphics. Has hundreds of hours of content and has great replayability due to the different classes and races to choose from. The only bad thing is the combat is very repetitive and not that great for a game that relys on it.
Positive,i have to say when i bought this game i regret it at the start. but after some research i figure out that i was doing it wrong...for new players i have to say it's not like other mmorpg games u played before. in other games u just need to lvl up and change the land and continue the process. but it's not like that in this game. if u want to enjoy it u must stop rushing it. do the quest side quest w8 and listen to what npc says. quests r not boring at all. that's the way the game it is and u start to enjoy it every sec. and for the people that talk about gold members and unlimited bags i have to say it's managable dont panic.
Positive,Fun with friends
Positive,"Immersive, great and visually an awesome MMO.Good PVP, the one bad thing is there's no South America Server."
Positive,ESO is an amazing game so much adventure and quest. Would recommend this to anyone.
Positive,"If you do not like the word ""grind"" and prefer to play in mmo, which has developed quests and storylines, I recommend this game very warmly (a short review, but you can describe it in this way)."
Positive,1000 hours of gameplay and still haven't got tired of it
Positive,"This game has A LOT of really good content. Just remember, some of this content will cost some $$$.If you see the game as $20, don't. Think of it as like $60 but you can pick what the other $40 goes into.Personally, I would rather just pay the subscription than have to pay for all the new DLC but that's just me :P .Going to keep this as a positive as I still think the base game is worth $10, especially with friends and with new features."
Positive,"No matter how hard you try or grind for best set, how many times you've changed your build, restarted your points, not slept for a whole night just for one thing and how much you've cried out of despair. How many times you got wiped in Trials, Dungeons and etc. And how many gold you've grind with sleepless nights.There will always be some kid better than you and Tbaging on Cyrodiil field."
Positive,Nice game for relax playing and roleplaying.Love dunmers and khajiits so its perfect for Morrowind's fans
Positive,One of the best MMORPG on PC. Maybe #1 on the spot next to GW2 but Open World PVP in ESO is much better also the combat mechanics. Would recommended to other players who loves to play MMO.
Positive,One of the games ever made.
Positive,"My friend Dolphin got me this game as a gift for my bday and honestly it isn't a bad mmo. I really enjoy this. If you are a skyrim fanboy. I don't recommend ESO to you, but if you are looking for a new MMO to play. I highly recommend this game."
Positive,Played it for a while and I can say that if you like the Elder scrolls series you will enjoy this game.The game is really fun to play with friends. The game can also be played solo if you prefer it that way.The PVP is really fun in the open world and so is the smaller battleground version.There is a lot of dungeons to do each with their own armour sets to collect.The game is also a build freaks best friend. The amount of armour sets and styles to choose from is amazing and you can make your character the way you want.The game keeps expanding with every new DLC and story expansions there is a lot to do.Would recomend.
Positive,"I tried this game when it first launched and resolved myself to never touch it again due to the fact that it was pretty damned poor.However, I have recently had a hankering for some sweet, sweet Elder Scrolls and wanted a new challenge away from Skyrim, so I looked into it and saw that there was a whole host of new content, it had been pretty much renovated from the ground up and that people were rather quite enjoying it. I was looking for some MMORPG to play and didn't really want the cartoony style of WoW and had played the arse out of SWTOR, so I gave this another chance.Damn, am I glad I did!The game has so much content, so much to explore, is bloody beautiful and so much fun to play, even just by yourself. Travelling around takes long enough to feel epic but just short enough to get from A to B without getting bored. The amount of quests is unreal and the sheer scale of the places you can go to is fantastic.I'd highly recommend this to any Elder Scrolls fan, or even anyone who just wants a new MMORPG with a more 'rustic' look to it."
Positive,"Definitely a good game, gives a nice Elder Scrolls vibe while still being an MMO. Quite playable with friends or solo. My main issue is that about 25% of my ""playtime"" on Steam is just from downloading and updating the game."
Positive,"Although the game itself is not a bad game, it's not the best in the category either. This could easily be overlooked by the fact that there are no subscription fees, BUT, unless one does get an ESO+ subscription they will be severly hindered, for example by having only half the inventory space available, AND not having a separate materials bag (and when you're trying to maximise the crafting skills you'll need all the materials you can get). This, coupled with the fact that earning vast amounts of gold is not so easy for beginner players (for example, one apple costs 150g. the average enemy up to lvl50  drops a maximum of 7gold, and that's IF they drop it), means that free players will be struggling to do some basic things like expanding their inventory size or training their mounts until they can level up past a certain limit.The quests and dungeons are interesting but not ground-breaking, nothing you havent seen elsewhere, however the Lore and Areas are the highpoints of this game, especially for anyone who really enjoys The Elder Scrolls setting. Another good point is how you are not limited to a single Guild, you can join up to five different ones, whether they're more pvp, pve, trade or RP focused. This means regardless of personal preference you can join varied Guilds to make new friends, or if youre focused on one aspect, for example Trade, join multiple same-focus guilds to maximise your chances of meeting like-minded people.Sadly, the low-point, and the one for which I am not suggesting acquiring this game is this: If you buy it here on Steam, you will basically be treated as an inferior-class citizen. Not only have many people encountered connection problems when launching through Steam, but the support is a bit lacklustre, which can be a problem in some cases.I suggest buying it on sale and giving it a try."
Positive,"Certainly a well made MMO that recieves alot of updates and upgrades on a regular basis. I can not complain about the customer support either, which is most helpful and replies within a short time. (Mostly at least)I really enjoy the alliance war and the battlegrounds. If you plan to play in the alliance war and alot of people are present I recommend a good internet connection or not-shitty-laptop to handle the amount of players more or less lag-free. In the alliance war you fight for one of three factions over elder scrolls and keeps, trying to gain control over cyrodiil to eventually become emperor for a good six hours because the aldmeri dominion (lovingly called: bananas) is always awake at night, when the whole of central europe is sleeping and takes over your previously hard earned keeps.The battlegrounds is a really nice addition which gives you the chance to play short PvP games in various (fun and not so fun) modi. Those include deathmatch (simple: whoever earns the most kills), capture the flag (or relic in eso's case) and other flag games (of which some are really fun and enjoyable and others just a pain in the ass because all you are doing is running around from one flag to another). Deathmatch here is really the game mode with the most pvp out of all of those.ESO's first DLC is Imperial City which added a PVE area in a PVP one, which in my opinion is probably the greatest addition to the game. If you do enjoy PVP (and only a slight bit of PVE as well) I heavily recommend you to also add the imperial city dlc. It gives you the fun of not JUST running away from other players but ALSO from player-sized, not very remarkable bosses with AOE damage in small areas that you somehow always end up spotting way too late.I can not add much for the PVE trials and dungeons as I have not played those recently and am everything but up to date or informed.The quests are nicely done, the main story for the base game, areas and dlcs are interesting and well narrated. However sometimes you do have to run around a bit much for my tastes (example: morrowind questline for telvanni personality)Some of the characters you meet are awesome. Obviously our dear liar khajiit friend that has appeared in other tes games, but also a naked nord wizard that has turned himself into a skeleton. Or an argonian to whom all the bad things happened that could possibly have happened.Other charcters in the quests are well made character wise. They have their own ambitions and in general make for a great and interesting story.About additional crown store items/mounts/etc/etc:probably the main thing I have to complain about the game: Zenimax is constantly adding new mounts, which in theory is a good idea. HOWEVER: They are quite lazy and mostly just reskin the normal mounts or change them slightly. I would wish for more different mounts (for example the scalecaller crate ones are great, they genuinely look different and interesting. The psijic ones are a joke...also the masked bear is a joke. If you want to make a panda atleast change the model up a bit so it does not look like a polar bear that just walked through a coal mine and more like a fluffy, friendly, fat panda)"
Positive,"I dearly belove ES Skyrim PC and I was in raiding guilds for nearly two years on WoW - still get flashbacks.  When ES Online first came out, I was hopeful but found it difficult and simplistic.  I've recently returned and am extremely happy I did.  I have heard die-hard Elder Scrolls people bemoan the gradual fall from grace of the franchise...formulaic, less detailed and less customizable, but frankly I believe that is to some degree the fault of a consumer base that wants simple and familiar.  I think that ESO in 2018 is wonderful blend of old and new features, technologies and game play characteristics.  ESO has outstanding play value and the  graphics are  lovely.  I am hesitant to call it a 'perfect' compromise, but I believe that the development team is working hard to achieve this."
Positive,"A really good game that's worth wasting your days on.Some people complain about buying through Steam, but I've had no issues.Besides the tons of DLC that you can buy, that IMO is a bit overpriced, the game is massive and will take you hundreds of hours to finish the main storyline, and the other sidequests. The only reason to get ESO plus would be the infinite craft bag, and all the DLC. Dungeons are fun with friends, though the game needs more Arenas. There are only 2 stage dungeons, with one being solo only. They're really fun and challenging compared to dungeons, though there's only 2 for some reason?Also, thumbs up cuz you can mod the f*ck out of it. Download hundreds of mods as you would for Skyrim (Though they're only visual and macro really, of course, because it's a MMO game)"
Positive,"i don't understand people saying ""don't buy the Steam version unless you don't want to log in"" because i myself have NEVER had any loggin issues, and i bought the game like 3 days ago.the only loggin issue i had, was related to my own internet being VERY slow for about a day. this game is fun, despite it feeling more like an MMO rather than a true Elder Scrolls game. yet the combat and story length is worth it on it's own.there are Lore books in-game that you can find to read, and even the NPC's can be rather interesting and funny at times.also, the game is FULLY voice acted for those of you who don't like to read!it will take you almost 250+ hours to get through the main story (if you are casual) or maybe 150+ if you are hard core player. that's a damn long time. and if you add in dungeons and side quests with/without a friend, it will take you almost 350+. (250 if your hardcore)and that's just in the base game itself with NO DLC added! crazy right? but if my review hasn't done you justice. then look up a review on the game, perferably a revew from late 2017 or even 2018 to get a full in-depth of it."
Positive,"Hey, are you falling asleep?Yes, now shut up!You're still playing vRG with randoms.*confused screaming*"
Positive,"I have played very little, but seen a lot of videos,streams and stuff but till now is a very good game, very solid mmo with good story and gameplay. It plays very good, and is very fun. Keep it up team!!"
Positive,great for people with autism
Positive,"Originally played this on the Xbox One when it came out, hated the interface for it on there. During the free week when it was 50% off, I played it. Dumped 6 hours into it while it was free, spent the 10$ while on sale. With it being updated and having more expansions out, fun to play. Bigger Elder Scrolls world that has a WoW feel but without needing a subscription. Got the Werewolf DLC. Excited for more to come."
Positive,"For the one time price of $20, this game is seriously good. Forget paying subscription for MMOs, there's so much to do in this game, between the amount of quests and storyline and the sheer size of the world (even if most of it is locked behind DLC or premium membership) it's insane."
Positive,"To show how much I love it, I was once playing the game on console and got to max level (810). I moved over to PC and am already at 810+  Pros: .+very noob friendly. the game is really easy. with only trials and vet dungeons being the hard parts. +fun to play with friends+easy to level up+an entire world to explore (and more)+a great storyline in every single place you can visit +combat is fun+great addons that make life easier+pve and pvp are separate and are both super fun+several pvp zones+duelling (that you can opt out of) +all of the map other than cyrodiil is pve+new dlc and expansions often and full of life+can play however you want if you don't care about super high damage+for ALL ages. My dad of 70+ plays and enjoys it a lot!Cons:-community is quite toxic-lots and lots and lots of grinding. For everything. Literally everything. -can get boring solo -steam servers are bad, buy the game on the website not here!!! <- Most important part. Steam users get f♥♥♥ed over a LOT. EU server is pretty bad too.-servers in general aren't great, especially in pvp - Kaalgrontiid campaign formally known as Vivec (the most popular one) is a total lagfest. Other parts:Graphics: Good - able to run on any system. Looks amazing on high end PCsSound and Music: Fantastic, this is on spotify so feel free to check it out.Combat: Good and FunGameplay: Good Grind: Bad lots of grindingDifficulty: Easy except for vet trials and dungeonsSolo: Fun but can get boring alone Group: Fun but play with friends and not randoms.Overall I’d recommend this game. I’ve had such great times with it. It is my most favourite game. Please check it out, it is very enjoyable and I've still got more hours to put into it!"
Positive,"Worst place to run the NA server or the game netcode is crap, to be a end game player you NEED to subscribe to the ESO+ or spend alot of money to buy most of the dlcs. It's a good game, with a good progression, well made quest lines. The only thing bad in this game is the fact as a player who don't want to pay every month for a subscription, it's a pain in the ass to get the dlcs, because you first need to buy cash then buy individually all the dlcs needed to you enjoy the end game. Why not just make a bundle? The only bundle that the in-game cash shop has is one that includes 4 dlcs (2 useful and 2 useless one)....WoW doesnt have the best monetization method available at the market, but at least when they release new content, the previous expansion pack become cheap, also the monthly subscription can be paid with in-game gold."
Positive,"I feel the need to leave a review after the large wave of reviews that have been switched to negative as of late due to server issues. I don't think it's representative of the game, nor is it fair to new players.My hours played on steam do not reflect the actual hours played. I've played this game non-stop back in 2014. I felt the game left much to be desired back then.Now? It is a whole new world. The population is thriving, the mechanics are complex, the variety of things to do on a daily basis are endless, the story line and side quests will keep you going forever, the crafting is out of this world, and the community is alive. The fun I'm having in this game reminds me of that same fun I had back during Vanilla WOW.If you've been looking to scratch that MMORPG itch, now is the time - this is *THE* MMORPG right now."
Positive,Its okay I guess
Positive,"Step 1: kill cultistsStep 2: level upStep 3:repeatbut for real, this is a pretty good mmo"

Positive,A fantastic MMORPG game with a numerous amount of creative things to do around the open-world area of the ESO world. Overall a great and brilliant game. Love it.
Positive,"Get some friends, party up and enjoy.....it's worth it even in 2018, more than worth it if you can grab it on a sale.....And if you love the Elder Scrolls world in general, this will be a pretty fun experience.*The combat isn't mind blowing like any other MMO maybe except TERA and BDO, but it's decent.*PVP and Alliance wars are amaizing*Do guild stuffs :""3 *And there's a LOT of shit to do and a LOT of variaty and options"
Positive,"I've only got about 50 hours of play time so far. I'll probably update this review later on. FIRST OFF. Try to get the game on sale if possible. It'll help negate the cost of buying the DLC's!SECOND. There are two ways to go about playing this game. And before I get too far into this game, NO. YOU DO NOT NEED A SUBSCRIPTION TO PLAY. Here are the two ways to play this game: 1) Subscription - which unlocks everything for $15 a month. This also gives you bonus in-game experience, seperate bottomless craft bag, And I'm sure there are a few other things but I just don't think they're worth noting.. If you pay for consecutive months in a row, you'll get a small price discount.  Honestly, I feel like this price is WAY TO STEEP for what you get in return. 2) Buy the DLC's yourself.  You don't get a bottomless craft bag, or bonus experience. Lets say you end up paying for 3 months which is close to $50. You can BUY the DLC using crowns, which is about the same price as the 3 month subscription, and you own the DLC. You get all the access that the subscribers do, just no extra bag and no bonus experience. And if you're subscription runs out, You don't lose access to those quests, dungeons, delves, etc. I purchased this game with the idea that this will be replacing my old game and that I'll be playing this one almost exclusively with a friend or two. It makes fun easy so the choice was easy. In the end, It was much more economical for me to buy the DLC with a one-time purchase, and never worry about a subscription again.Now lets actually talk about the game instead of babbling on about subcriptions.Graphically I think this game is BEAUTIFUL. Im playing on a AMD FX 4800 running at 3.8 Ghz and a Nvidia GTX 750. My graphics card barely meets the recommended requirements and it runs the game smooth as butter on ice on a windy day in Chicago. I DO NOT HAVE MY SETTINGS MAXED. Most are at medium quality and still the game looks stunning running at a solid 60fps. Awesome sceneries, great music scores ( like all Elder Scrolls games do), shit tons of quests. Literally years worth of content to discover and play. There are four man dungeons, single player dungeons called ""Delves"", 12-player dungeons called ""Trials"", Quests, shareable quests, more quests, daily rewards just for logging in, multiple pvp modes including: Team Death Match, Crazy King (koth with multiple moving flags), Chaos Ball (odd ball but holder takes damage), and a few other modes that I can't think of at this time. There is also a huge battle going on for all of Cyrodill in which 3 player filled factions (sort of like Planetside in that aspect) battle for control of the map, its objectives, and the Elder Scrolls. All this while there are quests and mobs inside this giant pvp area. It is honestly the most fun I've had on a game in a long time.As of the point of this review, I cannot complain about this game in the least bit. It has exceeded my expectations graphically, game-play wise, and player-base wise. Players are friendly and willing to help. All you need to do is ask over chat and most of the time you'll get a speedy reply.   The ONE and ONLY gripe that I have about this game is that subscribers get that bottomless craft bag for their materials. I have in-game friends that say the craft-bag and extra experience (i think its 1.5x normal experience) is worth the subscription but I have to disagree. Sure it's nice but its not something that absolutely makes or breaks the game. A $15 a month subscription fee is too darn expensive! I would consider it if it were $5 to $7 a month. If you're interested in a new MMORPG to play and you love the elder scrolls games, I cannot recommend this game any more. I mean you can start a fight with a boss, start losing, and get saved by 3-4 random players that just happen to be walking by. You get experience, they get experience, and you all walk away with awesome loot and chances are some new friends if you take the 15 seconds to chat with them."
Positive,"Vast open world MMO with lots of great lore and gameplay. Would recommend.HOWEVERI would also recommend purchasing the game through the ESO website, as Steam linked accounts are currently having recurring issues logging into the game. Until these issues are permanently resolved, any Steam ESO players will be missing out on many hours of gaming time.EDIT: This issue has been resolved (to the best of my knowledge)! I have been playing lots and lots of ESO and the game is beautiful and has a wonderful community. I definitely recommend this game for anyone looking for a long-term world to enter"
Positive,"Absolutely incredible game. Great job done by Bethesda here.Graphics are stunning, gameplay is quality, quests are fun and well timed.Probably my favourite game of all time. Well done Bethesda!"
Positive,first impression is okay i guess
Positive,"While quite a bit could be said about this game and the relationship it has to the rest of the elder scrolls games, at the end of the day all I can say is that this is a fun game. At this point I'm almost 200 hours in and have still only scratched the surface of the content here, especially considering the recently released Summerset expansion which I have yet to touch. The game also has an interesting crafting system which requires you to both participate in crafting itself as well as put time into research to be able to make better weapons out of better materials. Bascially. If you want to play a fun MMO this is one of the options I would recommend."
Positive,"""It's so sad that there isn't Spanish subtitles. I'm wondering why French language is more important than spanish?"""
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online ... It's actually a wonderful MMO game. It's fun to play Solo, and it's fun to play with others in group. Just go and play it, make random friends, and explore Tamriel. You won't regret it."
Positive,If u are looking for content ESO is ur game. Amount of content in this game is mindblowing.
Positive,thx dad gud game
Positive,"I have spent a lot of time in this game, I came into this as someone who doesnt play a lot of mmos and hated the game at launch. They have improved it a lot since then, it's the only ES game where I actually like the level scaling.Both pve & pvp is fun. I would reccomend getting eso+ to do the dlcs as they are a lot more polished."
Positive,"buy it. buy it. buy it. you will like it if you like every elder scrolls gameredguard, skyrim, obilvion, morrowind, daggerfall. it includes every provience of tamrielpart of reaper march is in elsweyr, the AD starting zone is actually apart of elsweyrtheres three zones dedicated for skyrim, the rift and eastmarch and bleakrock.shadowfen includes even blackmarch!visit valenwood, theres 4 map dedicated to itauridon.the game also includes never before seen areas in the elder scrolls universe. the morrowind dlc brings you back to vvardenfell, which is the setting of elder scrolls III morrowind.the soundtrack is amazing. the one tamriel allows you to play with people of other proviences.theres also updates, festivals, and new zone (Craglorn)the dlcs you should buy are.-  orcisimer (an entire map, you can literally rebuild wrothgar)- dark brotherhood (gold coast, the city of kvatch!)- clockwork city (map of clockwork city, sotha sil)- thieves guild (map of hew's bane)- imperial city (fight daedra in the imperial isle, flash back to obilivion)you can have massive pvp battles in cyrodill, capturing cities, towns and forts. there are 3 factions, aldmeri dominion, ebonheart pact, daggerfall cov (best faction)each faction has its 3 race aside from the imperialsaldmeri - bosmers, altmer and khajjitsebonheart - argonians, nords and dark elvesdaggerfall - orcs, redguards and bretonthere are also amazing side quest that comes with the base game!- mage guild- fighters guild- an amazing daily crafting system- festivals (right now, 4/12/18, it is the anniversary event)- homestead, personal housing and decorations.- cadwell's silver and gold.pre order summerset, you are able to explore the main island of the summerset isles, the whole thing it is bigger then every other zones, with towering cities!UPDATE : Murkmire recently came out, it is for free if you get to day 21 ( i believe)"
Positive,"Why ESO?+ Good Old RPG elements with Elder Scrolls traits... Smithing, tailoring, etc really matters here..+ Game of Thrones battlefield (Cyrodiil Alliance War)+ Elder Scroll lores (if you want it)+ Damn Exploration+ Classes, Skills, and Roles are various.. It could be a downside+ Both solo and party friendly (if you good enough)+ Its super fun for casuals, and also I think it's challanging for pros.- GRINDSSSSS- The microtransaction is super disgusting in this game (hey but that whats make their microtransaction special, you could distinguish rich bois and poor bois easily) What I'm saying is theres a huge gap between rich bois and those who only play casually.. its not affecting gameplay I guess tho but for some people aesthethic is important.. My point is I want cool mounts available for purchases using Golds :(- Skills animation are just... meh.. but hey thats the point of elder scrolls, I mean the skills / spell animation is just elder scroll-ish (if you compare it to modern RPG like Black Desert or anything else).. its a letdown for some people, but for me its acceptable enough- Installation issues.."
Positive,one of the best mmo rpg games... the olny bad is that it has got so many dls
Positive,its a fun game till you realize you got so caught up in it that you missed your sons whole childhood....
Positive,awesomeeeeeee!!!!! too much addictive <3
Positive,"This game IS NOT Skyrim Online.Really, it doesn't play like an Elder Scrolls RPG at all, at least not in the traditional sense, and much more like an MMO.However, it's actually a really good game that I enjoy (and I hate MMOs), even though it let me down a bit in those aspects."
Positive,"To start, it's a good game. Lots of things to do, generally good community (although mega salty in steam comments lol), nice scenery, and great voiceacting. It is not pay-to-win. The Alliance War concept is really interesting. Surprisingly un-laggy (used an integrated gpu and internet from a literal radio antenna for years). Graphics are gorgeous if you crank them up. And, speaking as someone who's been around a while: the devs have done a really good job of absorbing useful player-made addons into the base game.A few issues keep it from perfection: Updates are frequent and large, so it's not good for people who play less than weekly just because of the needed download time. If you want to be really good at anything that changes regularly  - PvP, PvE, crafting - you need to be devoting a lot of time to that thing. I do play a multipurpose character, but I can't rise above maybe a B+ in any one thing because of that. It's better when you're social either with people you know or via guilds; some of the multiplayer stuff is VERY hard to do solo (esp. for non-dps characters).In its attempt to balance content across three Alliances, quests start to get a little repetitive.And remember, it's not ""Skyrim with friends"" nor ""Elder Scrolls 6"" - way more simplistic. Buy the game (and some discounted Crowns) on one of its many sales. Don't buy a new DLC immediately - it will go on sale in 6-9 months.7.5/10 because it's an ES game and the Omnipotent Argonian Klepto can strike again."
Positive,Tried making the biggest baddest khajiit out thereEnd up shorter than 9/10s of the population of Tamriel
Positive,"I can't play even with the lowest graphic settings because of the huge fps drops! Although had a PC over the minimum requirements, espacially in & around the crowded cities, FPS drops are insanely like as 3, 2 or even 0!!! Forget about the moving to such and such place; can't even turn the camera around! I've been investigating for couple of days and have seen tons of topics about the same issue in the Steam Community, Reddit etc. but there's no certain solution. This game needs more optimization and patch updates.edit: I guess the last server maintenance had solved the FPS dropping problem. Now I can play really smooth and everything is clean, and now I can recommend this game! Thanks so much to Bethesda and Zenimax."
Positive,You cannot play as a Jejota rune in this game as of 11/24/17.
Positive,"I'd write something more, but the general thing is that this game is AMAZING. Easily one of the best most entertaining MMORPGs ever. It's innovative, it's pretty as hell, it has good mechanics and easily some of the best PVP ever."
Positive,"I became addicted to the Elder Scrolls after playing Skyrim. It took me a while to get ESO but when I did, I was immediately addicted again. I have since purchased ESO Morrowind which haven't got to play much, but ESO in general is a GREAT game and love the storylines and how deep the Elder Scrolls History goes! It makes for very interesting gameplay especially reading the books in the game."
Positive,"After playing MMOs for a long time now and even going so far as to try classic wow. I can say that this game is still top of my list, its rich lore and world to explore always has me coming back. The community is great and I hope one day my friends will join on this game. This game was my first MMO and I still come back to it no matter what."
Positive,"Honestly ive played this game for longer than my steam time, I figured that my friend would think i had a social life if they didnt see my 2000+ hours on a game. I cannot recommend this game enough, for all its bugs it just keeps drawing me back for more. 100% would reccomend to people who are on the fence about getting this game years after release."
Positive,"If you're expecting 'Skyrim Online' then I would recommend rethinking your decision to buy this game. However if you are open to a modern MMO, and enjoyed the scenic beauty of the previous Elder Scrolls series - buy this game."
Positive,"This game is not only a MMO. This game is a piece of art.The ammount of effort put into the small details of this game, may it be the traveling merchant that you can even rob, the tavern songs played and sung by a bard, the beautiful background music that accompanies you wherever you go, the almost infinte amount of lore that you can read in books or see with your own eyes all around you... Everything in this game has nothing short of care and love from the developers.As an Elder Scrolls lover, I am kind of biased to say that this is the best MMO ever made, but also as an experienced gamer, do yourself a favor: Gather some friends, buy this game (on a sale or not) and embark on this glorious adventure."
Positive,"I've always loved the Elder Scrolls game. what I like about ESO is the fact that we can travel across all of (well, most of, really) Tamriel, from the Summerset Isles to Blackmarsh. It plays like an elder scrolls game, despite being an mmo, which is a nice change of pace from other Multiplater Online games.I've only got one nitpick, but that's mainly because I can't afford to pay for a sub. the DLCs, which include Dark Brotherhood and Thieve's guild, aren't really accessible to those who can't throw money at the game. I'd like to see at least some way to earn the premium currency in-game, that way the F2P players like myself can experience all of what ESO has to offer. WoW recently did the same, more or less, though in a roundabout way that I'm not too fond of. and with Warframe, it's possible to trade to other players for the premium currency, Platinum.That's my only nitpick. It's a very amazing game to me, and I'll play either way~ I just wish it were possible to -earn- the new or upcoming content through playing. Bethesda and Zenimax would get so much more players and supporters for their games and content if they did something similar."
Positive,Currently one of the best mmos imo if you can get out of loading screens
Positive,Great game! Steep learning curve but worth the intelligence investment!!!
Positive,"Easily the best MMO there is. Had a complete bad start at first, yet that didn't prevent ZoS to polish their game every patches and updates. Also a must buy if fan of the elder scrolls series."
Positive,Words are not needed here.
Positive,"My first MMORPG. I am a huge Elder Scrolls fan and it honestly satiated my hunger that skyrim had left me in after i had completed it. It is a kind of MMO which doesn't really have to be an MMO if you dont want it to be, the story is vast and the lore is ample for you Lore mongers out there. You could play this game for a year and never have indulged in any competitive activity but still be entertained by it. Summary: If you like Elder Scrolls this is a necessary pick up but keep in mind you need to have Decent net to enjoy the game. No Asian servers are the only downside that i would care to mention."
Positive,"So steam thinks I have 25~ hours into this game. That is so far from correct. Owned for years and only recently bought again to have steam handle my account and merged them. I cant say much is wrong with this game, it's probably the most solid mmo that has ever been made. Wonderful combat system, stunning visuals, and endless amounts of content. Great community and plaenty of players! If you don't own it, but it. It's worth the cash."
Positive,"This having been my first Elder Scrolls series game, I fell in love! I like the whole new MMO online spin,and the community is so kind! I enjoy leveling up, acquiring new armor, chatting with friends and completingthe many dungeons there are; despite the fact that this game does not compare to the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, a view from the Vestige in the past as well as meeting new friends is always enjoyable.A solid 8.5/10 rating."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls® Online: Tamriel Unlimited is pretty good.I will be honest with you, I've played only the Skyrim game of TES series. Had a few hours in Oblivion and Morrowind too, but not enough to say that I've actually ""played"" it.Not a big fan of MMO too, I find grinding very borring.However, this game has a very descent balance between MMO stuff and TES stuff. It does feel like an Elder Scrolls game.Yes, combat will feel a bit weird at first, classes as well, though you really can shape your character to be anything you want. Race and class define only 4 of your skill trees, while you still have skill trees like ""Two handed"", ""Dual wielding"" or ""Bow"" that are accessible to any class and race.I think, the best way to play TES Online is to experience it as a single player product at times. Just to go explore the world and complete some side quests on your way. And once you wish to spice it up, do some MMO stuff like dungeons or PVP.There is also a controversial side to this game: paid content. Yes, game already costs $20 (the cheapest package) and it has some in-game purchases that are not only cosmetical, but can give you some advantage as well. I, personally, did not find anything game changing though.I would really advise this game to either TES fans or to people who like MMO but try to find something a bit different to play."
Positive,"Best MMORPG a  must for Elder Scroll fans and the gamers who like to grind.At first I was skeptical about it due to some comments about require to download it two times but thank god that's not the case the launcher only updates approx 4GB extra phew!!!.But most wonderful thing is I got the game for INR 660 (10.3 $ APPROX) in sales,boy I was so overjoyed.My only regret is that I didn't buy the GOLD edition.Now I have to Buy DLC with Crowns,which is a lot of crowns.Oddly I didn't find any performance issues which some gamers have been pointing.Maybe the developers fixed it.I play it in 1080p so I don't know about 2K and 4K resolutions game-play.The game is definitely not pay to win although the crown items are a bit pricy,but they are not forcing you to buy anything.You have to grind a lot that's all. The ESO PLUS subscription is a bit pricey,at-least for me.If steam allows subscription through steam wallet then maybe I will subscribe it but I don't know whether it allows it or not,may be I should inquire steam about it.Nevertheless overall it is a VERY GOOD game and fun to play. P.S.:-It is not Skyrim 2 so don't expect it while buying it.It is a fresh new game with new aspect."
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online is a great mmorpg for players who like to feel free. Game never try to restrict your play-style, you are absoulately free on what you are doing/building. All the npc's have voice which is very nice. Quests are not boring like in the WoW or like any other mmorpg really. They surely know how to keep you interested.Community is very crucial for players who like to play like adults. If you are a guy like me who'd like to keep things civil and friendly ESO is just for you because it's community is number one. Veterans respects newbies and being patient, rich ones are generous, It's like European Union without Greece.Graphics are simply unique for a mmorpg. You will NEVER find better.So yeah I recommend this game if you are looking for a mmorpg.ENJOY"
Positive,great game. recomend it to people who like big mmo rpg's
Positive,"Amazing game , it is an awesome multiplayer experience."
Positive,pler gw kena ban ajg
Positive,"100% reccomend this game to others, it is really fun and inclusive :)Lots of content to play through :)"
Positive,"I seriously love this game so much. There are endless stories to follow, every day is different as you never know what online players are near you. I'll team up and play with my friend with one character and then other days I'll play by myself with another character and just try to team up with random people online to work together to take down some bosses. Great buy!."
Positive,"Awesome game, awesome story line and map. If your looking for a MMOrpg with huge amount of gameplay hours, ESO is the game that would fit your demands. With nice graphics this game generates an exciting gameplays with its missions, quest, dungeons and many more along with its coops where you can appreciate this game with your friends online."
Positive,"A quick heads up and I apologize for my English in advance.Never have I experienced any kind of MMORPG like Elder Scrolls Online.This review may sound biased but bottom line is, this is from the heart and I tried playing it with a grain of salt.Very rich story and content. I've finished all of the main story line in each alliance faction (Aldmeri Dominion, Ebonheart Pact, Daggerfall Covenant) It looks like the game is very well made and a lot of time and effort has been poured into conceiving this game. I might be understating it a little bit since Zenimax/Bethesda made this game but still. Every dialogue is extraordinarily developed. The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is ok, and the community is very helpful and mature (some people might have a different experience).I am from the Philippines and my country is synonymous with the term ""very bad internet connection"". You have to pay a little bit more to get a decent internet connection for gaming, but surprisingly, my internet connection holds up and the game's latency is more than sufficient to run a couple dungeon raids and 12 man trial with friends, giving me enough time for a couple of playthroughs and establish good relationships with players. Altough I'm not sure about Cyrodil (PVP), you need to have a beast of a gaming rig to get those FPS' up.Conclusion:I started playing this game way back October 2016. I heard that this game was bad when it first came out but eventually turned out awesome as time went by especially after One Tamriel Update. I was a little bit skeptical at first, but I gave it a chance. Running quests solo and having no community is a little bit dull to be honest but as time went by, I found a guild with people who are very passionate and devoted with the experience that I immediately fell in love with the game and the community itself. The people that you play with and the community is the highlight for this game in my opinion, and your relationship with other players are equally important than having the best gear in-game. If I could do it again, I would definitely do it in a heartbeat."
Positive,Just played a litle. I love it! ;D
Positive,"Skyrim, with friends! Access to a ton of countries to walk around and hit, shoot, or stab stuff with things!"
Positive,Great game if you like to grind
Positive,the best thing for me is that i can play it with controller
Positive,Really like it. Story is ok. Good for raids etc.
Positive,this game is awesome just need time to to be best game :)
Positive,"ESO has come a long way since its debut three years ago. At that time ESO was plagued with bots, many bugged quest lines, a subscription fee, and not much to do. Fast forward three years later: the fee is gone, you can be a thief and steal from the populace, become an assassin, or quest anywhere. No longer are zones too hard or easy. Quest where you want, when you want.For those of you looking for status items there is housing which range from a modest inn room to palatial noble estates."
Positive,My first MMO and I didn't regret. The community is very nice and friendly. Always support newbie. But difference in cp meant a lot to people making player sperate than others. Playing with group is the real fun you can have eventhough you dont have any friends. And pricing in this game is quite high...
Positive,"Originally my review was positive, then shifted to negative due to the scaling in the One Tamriel update, and now I'm shifting it back to positive after a couple years absence.All I can honestly say is that, I'm really enjoying playing through this with my girlfriend. Game picks up after you hit CP 160. Running around, questing, looting, skyshard hunting.. it's good times.Still no idea what the story is though."
Positive,Back when I played Beta it was the worst game I ever played. Mind you i played Beta a week before release and there was so many bugs game play was bad graphics where bad. After waiting a few years when thye got rid of monthly pay ment and it was on sale i got it an i now enjoy it. It has changed a lot and the game play became very good.
Positive,"7/10don't go into it expecting an elder scrolls game, it's an MMO at its core and if you treat it like an ES game then you're gonna be disappointed.+ i really love the skill lines - a lot of options to build a character just the way you want it+ you can do just fine in the game without buying anything from the crown store at all- graphics could be better, but mostly that's from me being used to modded skyrim graphics....- voice acting is... uh... well, they tried. sometimes it's very bad and sometimes it's fine.at full price i'm not sure if i could recommend it, but currently the gold edition is on sale for £20, which is pretty damn good for a non-subscription game with a fair amount of content."
Positive,As a person who likes solo play and does not care for group raids PvP etc this game has it all just keep playing total free roaming quests galore I am a subscriber but you can play this game free and still level to max the voice acting is great as all the quests. The real joy is the server (EU) is packed with people and yet you can wonder around in solo play and have so much fun it is a busy World filled with Real people who are busy having there own adventures you really get the feel you are on an epic Quest. On a final note The housing is an Awesome add on to the game which again is free you just pick up the quest from the crown store but be warned if you want a good house you will need to make lots of Money in game to afford the nice housing all in all best online game I ever played after leaving WoW 3 years ago 10/10
Positive,its a good game
Positive,great game loved it
Positive,"Open world, MMO, Great"
Positive,Such an Awsome RPG. And the best part is that its in a Elder Scrools Timeline and map. Explore Tamriel with your friend!
Positive,"One of the best MMORPG game at this moment in my opinion.Lots of fun.Friendly community.Really really big flexibility in making skill builds.Nice and rewarding crafting system.Interesting storyline.Challenging veteran dungeons, maelstorm arena etc."
Positive,"I know it only says I have 1.8 hours on this game, but in reality I have over 90 hours due to me using the client not through steam. It is an mmo that can be played single player, and the community is usually great. Crafting is very complex but fun, and quests are very well written. It may not be a traditional elder scrolls game, but it is a great mmo."
Positive,"This game improved a lot since launch and now I can say it's a AAA MMO with gret graphics and the right feeling for a Elder Scrolls game. The Gold bundle is a great deal, with 40 dollars worth of extra content.Just a HUGE warning - compare the price on Steam to the official site. Bethesda charges MORE in some regions, Brazil included, through Steam, for some idiotic marketing reason. I bought it here on 50% off promotion, so it was cheaper, but usually Bethesda games are 25% more expensive through Steam to Brazil (I guess the same happens to other regions too)."
Positive,"+ Player coop friendly system in killing monsters and looting (there is no killstealing)+ Many armor designs+ Crafting is well made here, with deconstructing, enchanting, jw, etc..+ Voiced dialogues and despite beiing mmo it has an elder scrolls feeling+ Skill system (it has it similar to previous es games)+ If you are bored by dungeons you can do pretty interesting quests pretty much like in previous es games.- Maybe horses are bit expansive so you'll walk most of the game.- Too expansive repairs (you will make 4k gold made by hard work in dungeons and spend 1k of that for gear repairs)- There are too much effects. Its good for the look but somethimes pretty confusing.-/+ At the start game is extremly easy then it will have greater diffilcuty than heroic dungeons in wow. Besides that there is always someone who will screw it up. So prepare to die often :D. Somethimes you wont even beat the boss and you must abandom dungeon.Game is realy entertaining with friendly community mostly. It's much better than wow. It's like guild wars 2 put in elder scrolls universe."
Positive,"Best MMORPG game on Steam at the moment. If you like Elder Scrolls universe and MMORPG then this is the game for you. I have this game since day 1 and I participated in Beta. The game has changed from launch, everything is better now, updated and even more great updates are to come. No subscription required, it is optional. No progression or leveling restrictions that could affect your overall game experience. The game itself has amazing story, rich crafting options, awesome player customization options. PvP, PvE, RP aspects of the game are also good.Edit: This game gets regular game updates, game expansions, dungeons, even the in-game store is often refreshed. Great job by Zenimax."
Positive,"Really like this game. I'm not much of a PVP guy, so really haven't tried it, but the PVE is pretty awesome. A lot of nice stories and quests. All in all a nice experience"
Positive,The game has brought me countless hours of fun with new friends and I highly recommend it as possibly the best MMRPG of all time.
Positive,"I went into this with the right expectations. An Elder Scrolls game that would be very MMO like, less of everything I love about Elder Scrolls games. But what I got sort of shocked me.Yes it's got a very MMO feel, but there was more, The mechanics of the game are carefully crafted to preserve as much of that Elderscrolls feel as possible... Hell I can steal axes and armor off of displays in shops and and then melt them down for parts or even sell them to or have them laundered by a fence.Sneaking is a bit odd at time but works well and can be a lot of fun when you start lifting everything not nailed down from every market stall on main street... which i do far more often then my noble Nord warrior would like to admit.Fighing is a interesting mix of do it yourself and auto targeting and hotkey skills. It works out well and does not break to much of the immersion at least in my opinion.Graphics are suprisingly good for an MMO of this scale, and the artistic designs throught the game hold true to the feel of the Elder Scrolls lore and game series as a whole.Many quests are simple fetch or kill but some of them turn out way deeping and far more interesting, Which as we know happens even in Skyrim and other games in the series. Overall the DLC content is the most well made of the story content. They seem to have taken more time in weaving a story and making it more then just fetch and kill. They even included player choice to some minor degree which actually made me think about putting points in the persuasion skill before.All in all I have highly enjoyed my purchase so far. I got the gold edition for 30$ on cyber monday so im talking from the perspective of that price compaired to what I got.I mean if you can often spend 60$ without blinking then ya this might be a good perchase for you, but if you struggle to spend 20$ on a game this might not be right for you if you think your getting a single player Elder Scrolls game cause you will be unhappy if that is what you seek."
Positive,I met my husband in this game <3
Positive,gr8 game m8 10/10 just buy it
Positive,"TL;DR: If you like MMOs, but are tired of the same ole' formula, give this a shot. If you like TES, you'll love it.This game has kept evolving during the 5 years since it came out and although game mechanics have stayed pretty much the same, the devs have done a decent job at introducing fun and challenging (DLC dungeons and trials) new content. Playing this game extensively can result in burnout since it does become pretty grindy, especially so for completionists, but it is a beautiful game world and if you have a good group of friends to play with, it can be pretty fun.Like any MMO, it will likely never be perfect and there will always be people who criticise one aspect of the game or another. As much as I've had my gripes with it however, it stands at a sweet spot today, and if you're into MMOs, and particularly TES lore, you should definitely give this a try. It is a beautiful game, with fantastic graphics, engaging questlines, fun easter eggs, great characters, and most importantly, an amazing community. As much as ZOS has screwed up in many ways, they have, for the most part, kept to their schedule on regularly released updates, and although they're not always particularly great, they keep the game bustling with players from all walks of life.If you are looking for a hardcore endgame/raiding formula with ample variety, this may not be your best bet, but if you enjoy challenging PvP and fun PvE, you won't be disappointed. I can't stress this enough: the community in this game is GREAT. Join a guild (or five) as soon as you come in, and your experience will be that much better."
Positive,"This game is honestly one of my favorite MMO's, and in my opinion one of the best out there. It retains an rpg feeling whilst adding MMO aspects and allowing you to play with friends, and do stuff such as PvP. If you haven't tried out this game before, I recommend you buy it, as you will not regret it."
Positive,Please support Korean in steam.i need korean for playing main stories.
Positive,Great MMO! :D great to play alone great to play with friends!
Positive,💖 Love It! 🐈
Positive,"This is a great game with an almost absolute freedom as in Skyrim (especially after Tamriel One release), a lot of social fun and a brilliant lore as in any TES series game. This is my first MMO game ever and I definetely love it. I agitated some of my friends to buy it and they liked this game too."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is by far one of my favorite games i have ever played, From the story aspect to the PVP.The game has found a sweet spot for Casual gaming to Competitive players, The game offers absolute tons of story content to look for, the same goes for unlockables and craftable items.If you want an MMORPG with lots of content, i can highly recommend this.Original Review: Nov 24, 2016Revised: August 24, 2020"
Positive,"I played this game for the free weekend and I was hooked, I started playing with 2 other friends so we can team up. I'm still having a lot of fun. I really recommend this game!"
Positive,"I've played this game with my chemistry teacher and some guys in my class it's 10/10. It runs surprisingly smooth considering my computer is a plate of steamed carrots powered by a hamster in a wheel and the enviroments still look nice in absolute worst resolution. The characters, stories and gameplay are superb. Totally buy this game, it's very expensive but it's totally worth it.Also, if you are gonna buy it have in mind:1. to play it you don't need premium membership, it comes with a key for your game2 the imperial version lets you play as an imperial, a character of any race and any alliance, marry someone in game, and gives you a starter pack with a horse, some crowns, ect."
Positive,"good game :D mass pvp, roleplay, storyline, quest, dungeon, and yeah lot moreI can be vampire/werewolf >:L 10/10only 1 that I dont like it..... I dont have friends to play with :'C"
Positive,Imagine WoW but made by elder scrolls and not shit
Positive,"This game is really brilliant, played 9 hours on the first day. Would so recommend this to fans of the elder scrolls series, it has added a different twist on everything. It is story-rich and satisfying. Great game, easy to pick up. :)"
Positive,"I've had this game since May 4th, 2014 but I decided to get it on Steam today too because it's just too good.I'd like to point out that this game is not for you if:1 - You don't like MMORPGs; or2 - You don't like the Elder Scrolls series.Don't give a bad half-ass review if you don't even read the description, because ZeniMax Online Studios delivered and you should feel bad.Also, the game is a meagre 40$ now so you can't complain. I originally bought the game and a membership for over 120$."
Positive,"Started playing this game about two weeks ago and look at my play time! That's right, I don't even sleep! This game has sooo much things to be able to enjoy. I'll tell you the things that I've done in these two weeks!! (1) Leveling-Love to level up my character and I'll explain about the lv system. The time between lv 3 to 10 is the most boring time that I've gone through but Hey, after lv 10 you can do the Random Dungeon Daily Challenge which gives you tons of experience, you get 1 lv after doing that Random Dun and you can do it all the time but takes like 1 Hour to queue with other people (Coz I play dps) (Healer and Tank got the queue faster)(2) Crafting- The crafting are soo OP in this game, you don't even need to go into the dungeon and kill the bosses! You can just craft the item by yourself! Even can put item effect on the items you made! It takes times to master the crafting skills! It's worth it!(3) Crown Store ( I can't say that it's Pay to Win but it does have alittle bit of it) - The game has  ingame purchase and you need to use the points call ""Crown Points"". What can you buy in the Crown Store!? Ok, I'll tell you. You can buy different kinds of Mounts, pets, crafting books, custumes and DLC!(4) Custume - Bascially they are just skins for your characters, don't do any effect on your character! You can buy them on the Crown Store but don't buy them it's not worth it! You can get them by finishing the ingame achievements!(5) Mounts - You can buy a horse with 10,000 gold and it fuking expensive for the low lv! If you aren't patient, like farming gold then you can buy them in the Crown Store! (Have different kinds of mounts, not only horse)(6) DLC - Well you don't even need the DLC to enjoy the game. The maps are sooo big to explore! If you wanna know what DLC give you then they add more dungeon, more custome, more places to do quest and PVP areas ( haven't try PVP yet, so don't really know) but if you are a PVE player like to do raid then it's worth it!(7) ESO plus - ESO plus is a system like monthly subscription, you can buy them on the official Elder Scroll site! Don't worry, you don't need to pay monthly sub to play the game! It's like a premium member from other MMO games! You get a little bit of advantage from being an ESO member!So yeah those are the things I learnt within these two weeks! And just wanna share to you guys who can't decide to buy this game! Do I recommened this game? Yes! If you love this MMO type of game! And feel free to add me on steam! ^_^ ( You can correct me if I'm wrong!!!)"
Positive,"Totally Pay To Win, but the game itself is not that bad, it has a ton of storyline and, well the Elder Scrolls Theme in it. Is it worth it  ? If you are not an Elder Scrolls fan then nope, go play WoW or Guild Wars, they are much better than this. But if you love the franchise then you can try it for the sake of the memories."
Positive,"I was a bit wary when I first bought the game again. I had heard stories that the game wasn't the best and I was around when it first launched and saw how poorly optimised it was. But it has changed entirely. This game is so greatas it is now and if you are thinking of giving it a try then I definietly suggest you do. Its worth the money especially if you can find it on sale. It feels just like the good old Elder Scrolls games, especially Oblivion. Tons of story line to keep you interested for hours to come. I have only owned the game for about 3 weeks and have already logged about 130 hours in and Im not even halfway through the main quest on any of my three characters let alone even started the DLCs. The graphics are amazing if your computer can handle it and if your computer can not you can lower them a lot and still play the game with little lag. And there are great RP communities all around the world if you can find them. All in all it is a great game and worth the money."
Positive,I tried to hit a guard chasing someone who might have probably stole something. I got notorious! Now the guards are chasing me too... Will never hit a guard again.
Positive,I have tried some MMORPG games... This game is the best one for me :D
Positive,Too addicting. Made me lose touch with my family and friends.10/10
Positive,"Remarkable difference since it first launched. The game is actually fun! Didn't feel like a grind, was immersed and took my time laying back with my controller. Story and voice acting is good!Only critical cons are: 1. The engine isn't really optimised but there are some technical tweaks to improve it - smooth framerates, remove 30FPS cap (SLI), and high res textures.2. Not made with SLI in mind.3. No polearms!"
Positive,Bought this game a while ago on aanother account. bought it for my main account because it was onl sale. This game is definatly worth the buy especially since it is on sale. I would say that this game is 100x better when you have friends to play with. Gameplay is mazing and you never run out of things to do.
Positive,"If you are expecting this to be an online version of Morrowind/Oblivion you will be disappointed. I don't really feel like I am playing an Elder Scrolls game but having said that the game itself is very addictive in my opinion. Pros:The graphics are beautiful. Free to play. Huge non linear world with an insane amount of quests to do spanning the whole tamriel regionChoices (albeit minor ones) that affect the outcome of each questGood controller supportBank. A shared deposit box for all your charactersA Craft Bag which has unlimited storage (only on ESO+ membership)Growth Customization. You have complete control over what you level up, when you level it, and where you distribute your attribute and skill points. Abilities also have two morphs at certain stages so it really gives you the feel you are tailoring your buildCons:Two hotbars which contain only 5 abilities each + an ultimate. I would prefer to have access to all my abilities Like in Final Fantasy 14 for example.Isn't really an Elder Scrolls gameUnless you beg people to join a Guild you will probably never be in oneIt doesn't have the same community feel as say something like Final Fantasy XI or Final Fantasy 14 and you will see a lot of people with questionable names that make them look like a high school kid. Also there are quite a few trolls in the /zone chatOverall I rate this game 8/10 even if it isn't a true elder scrolls game and would definitely recommend it for fans of mmorpgs."
Positive,"I got this game 3 days ago... 30hrs of play time ... pls send helpIf this game is on sale, I highly reccomend you pick it up, there is hundreds of hours of potential here, the quests so far have all been varied and interesting, the lack of specific classes as with all elder scrolls games is great as usual, giving you the chance to build any character you want (dark magic assassin, healer tank, heavy armoured summoner archer etc). The abilities are also very well thought out, and can be morphed changing their functionality slightly meaning you can make certain skills synergise very well together, and everything scales so you dont have to stop using your favourite skills because they constantly get more powerful as you progress. The map is very well developed, and you literally can just pick a direction and run and you will come across something interesting in minutes, and there is lots to find (runestones, alchemy ingredients, metal ores, treasure chests etc) so there is always something to be looking for.Apparently this game was pretty shit at launch, but idk, I didn't play it back then, all I know is that through a lot of updates, the removal of a forced subscription and many other changes this is now a fantastic game, and pretty much the only MMO I've ever played to keep my attention for more than about 15 hours.Downsides:When I first tried to log in, I kept getting error messages that changed every time I tried to log in, but after about 15 minutes these stopped, and I had to get a verification email to play on my PC. This happened on my second day playing as well, but the errors only prevented me from logging in for about 2 minutes. However this seems to have cleared itself up too, as it hasn't happened since.Not really any gameplay downsides, it is a bethesda game after all :D"
Positive,"10/10 would wait eleventy hundred years for support to respond before making entirely new account to play game again*Update*Used new account to login, says login info is incorrect, resets password and checks to make sure if user id is put in correctly, its correct, enters it, login info is incorrect, drop kicks computer, breaks toe in the process, medical bill still doesnt cost as much as it did to play this game."
Positive,"TLDR: Keep your expectations realistic, don't expect Skyrim or WoW and you'll like it. Pros and cons at the bottom.Most of the negative reviews are tech issues. ""Game won't launch, it sucks!"" ""Took 153 hours to download, it sucks!"" I had no issues with that. But most console games now require some kind of download so if you don't want that go play an original Nintendo.The other negative reviews are from people who wanted multiplayer Skyrim. This is not that.In actuality it's an mmo with the depth you'd expect from an ES game or as much as can be allowed in an mmo.Pros:- Any race/class can use any weapon and play any role. Yes, you can min/max but there are no ""cookie cutter"" builds. It really is about your play style not what Google says you have to do to be the best tank/healer/dps.- You know when you're playing an ES game, questing and some random person says ""you there! Can you help me?"" That still happens. There is no ""go to this city, do all those quests then get directed to the next city"" If you really break it down there probably is, but it doesn't feel like that at all. Just like a traditional ES game you can pick a random direction, travel and find something to do. - Multiple, diverse skill/gear sets on one character. Every mmo I've ever played I've been a caster preferring fire. I play a dragon knight. With him I can be my standard incinerate everything with reckless abandon. I can also put plate armor on, go sword and board and tank. And, I can switch these on the fly. -Story. Personally, I've loved every story and back story from every quest I've completed and I normally don't bother paying attention to this in most at all. I won't hate on WoW, the community is what killed it for me, but I honestly had no clue why I was doing anything I was doing at any point in time. Not that it didn't explain it, just didn't care. The lore in ES is phenomenal and the voice acting is the best in any mmo I've ever played and up there with any game I've ever played period. Cons:-A lot of the multitude of skill points you get come from collecting skyshards and completing certain quests. The thought here is that it encourages exploration. It does... But it also makes me have to worry about if I've missed any available points.  There are add-ons for that but as much as I like add-ons I don't care for them when they feel necessary. -Crafting, let me say that I love the crafting. It has just as much depth as the rest of the game. My problem with it is it doesn't do a great job explaining anything beyond the basics."

Positive,Its not WoW or Star Wars Galaxies but.... I like it.
Positive,This is an awesome MMO/RPG to play...from the ability to craft and join guilds to battles. The only downside to the game was the initial game purchase price. Graphics are good and they are adding more things as it goes.....I love this game! So fun!
Positive,"If you enjoy the elder scrolls series, this game will give you the lore and the scenery. The combat is more mmorpg oriented, but still real-time and not just button mashing. There's dodging, dungeons, and extensive gameplay. If you like WoW, I'd say this is a nice, fresh update from that insanely huge universe to this one. over the last few years, the game has improved a ton from a rather rocky beginning."
Positive,"Game is good no romance:This review is personal and very much like how a Anime lover would review after playing several JRPGs.Good Points:#1.Game is Vast#2.Game has many content to make a whole year worth playing it#3.Game got good voice Actors & Actress, seriously this was done right#4.Game has got good story for each character and background Story Tellings#5.Good explorations and environment designBad Points:#1.I expected to find girls who i can meet, the reality were most of em were boys or insecure girl who dont wanna meet at all in IRL!#2.Things are kinda expensive and DLCs are way too costly#3.Girl figures and facial structure could have been way better like japanese people does, i mean comeon we are all playing for dem thicc bodies and meeting some Gal in IRL!#4.I expected things like how Sword Art Online anime would go but i didnt expect i would learn commerce instead.#5.People would use emoticons and Wave then leave for no random reason worse part they ignore on wisper or even if u sent msgs.#6. i cri everytime.#7.The mmo mechanics could have been a little better but smhh...its fun i guess."
Positive,"I don't understand why this game recieves such terrible reviews.First off, this game is not morrowind, oblivion, or skyrim. It is an mmo. But if still FEELS like an elder scrolls game. I've been playing this game entireley in first person view, and it is phenomenal. I've grouped with other players, talked with people in the chat. The player base seems fantastic so far and the cooperative experience was fantastic as well. The lore is intense in this game compared to the others. They constantly throw lore at you and it makes for a very immersive experience.Staffs also, they are awesome. I thought I was going to use a bow in this game until I picked up and used my first staff. And I just about reopened the wound I just had surgery on when I saw someone summon a storm atronach (It was fucking glorious).Overall, the game is worth 60 bucks. I would not pay a subscription monthly to play it, but it is without a doubt worth its full price. ESPECIALLY, if you've got friends you want to play in within the elder scrolls realm. That's what it's all about after all, otherwise it would've been another singleplayer game."
Positive,"**Edit** Amended at end with full review details **This is not a detailed review by any means, as I cannot yet speak for 100% of the content; However, it is rare that such detailed completion can be claimed by reviewers of MMOs. At any rate, The Elder Scrolls Online appeals to me strongly, as it does with many gamers, due to its direct ties with Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series. After spending roughly 50 hours in game, I can attest to several negatives and positives of this title though I endeavor to be brief. My primary critique so far (In being a veteran of MMO titles) is in the control system itself. To be clear.. I do not have a problem with their intended method, only that I am fairly locked down to that method barring the use of some unknown addon. I have always mapped abilities to either key-mouse combinations or to clickable macros in other MMO experiences, so I was upset (at first) that I could not click abilities or control their assignment past 6 predetermined keys. This was further agitated by my own preferences as, though I may be alone in this, I have never fancied using the number keys as shortcuts. I felt that this game forced this playstyle. HOWEVER, this leads me to my primary positive note: The control system itself. 'Wait.. but you said..' I know what I said, but I also pointed out that this was my initial feeling. I found, after around 20 hours, that Zenimax knew better than me how to provide a combat experience, and after avoiding my keyboard related griefs by using numbered mouse keys, I found myself thoroughly enjoying an experience that I had once dreamed about: The Elder Scrolls in a massive online setting, with no extended action bars to take away from the experience. Furthermore, the limited action bar spaces served in the end as their own brilliant mechanic, keeping (most) fights varied and fresh due to a requirement of resourcefulness in opposition to the lackluster buttonmashing of the many proc based abilities on other games' always visible action bars.I said I would keep it short, so I have. As I mentioned, I do have several pros and cons, but for the purpose of this being quick ( I am strapped for time at the moment) I will keep it simple with one + and one - sentiment.However I will leave you with this: I am a HUGE fan of lore, and I am in most games for their story, and the Elder Scrolls series is far from an exception. This game thus far has both elated and disappointed on this front. My disappointment has come in the form of inconsistancies pointed out by a respected youtuber, but KNOW THIS: Even though dialogue may sometimes be quick and the stories bring other lore into question, any good nerd can look past these bothers and see ESO for what it is: A  wonderful representation of the future of MMOs with thousands upon thousands of brilliantly voice acted lines that tell a fantastic story from a time in Elder Scrolls lore that we honestly dont know enough about to complain. Any piece of Tamriel that I can get in this format is fine with me. Overall I recommend, but know that due to a fairly limited number of complaints, I must hold it to a modest 8.5 out of 10.** continuation **   A further complaint is with an almost pay-to-play environment. In lieu of most similar games allowing for a rested experience gain after logging out in taverns, cities, etc. ESO has provided smaller in-game gains such as the Ring of Mara (I would make a list but can literally think of no other example) with the largest gains only being available to those spending real world coin. I understand the necessity of money making in the business model, and it has to happen somewhere; however, there are no real alternitives for the players that cannot afford a subscription or random crown purchases. The primary experience boost is in the form of a consumable item available ONLY in the crown store. While there is the scroll's redeeming quality of persisting (and pausing) during logouts, this is an item that carries a real world price tag and lasts a measly 2 hours with a 50% boosted gain. WHAT?! A free system of doubled experience with a bar percentage limitation would be much more welcome. Take some notes from Blizzard, Zenimax, they have been in this 'game' a LONG time for a reason.  Discouragingly high in-game prices seem to further penalize players who keep responsible pocketbooks. I understand that this is an inflated economy where 1000g is easy to come by with a couple quests and a vendor selling spree, but almost 50k for a very basic mount? I do have other things to spend my coin on... Who wouldn't rather subscribe and buy a horse with their 'complimentary' crowns?  On a more positive note, this is NOT the worst system I have seen for microtransactions. Given the price of a subscription vs the real world price of crowns, it's actually quite fair as your subscription grants you access to otherwise paid content and an allowance of crowns that are roughly the value of your sub itself. For the gamer that is responsible with his or her wallet, this makes the previous complaint somewhat moot.  Now let's address the things that keep me playing. Despite its questionable continuity and how easy it would be to miss when rushing to keep up with friends, the story is still, in my humble opinion, worthy of the series, and far superior in the MMO genre itself. If one takes the time to listen and follows the quests from area to area, he or she will discover a brilliant slew of voice actors backing up an intriguing story of enemies and alliances in a world that I personally can't get enough of.  Meanwhile, the aforementioned combat system has grown on me and mixes extremely well with a concept that can't be praised enough: classless classes. In ESO you choose a class during character creation that, instead of locking you down to specific skills like most MMOs, provides you with a guideline for the type of hero that you wish the Vestige to be. Skill lines are divided between weapons, guilds, classes, and more. You really want to be an assassin that heals and is particularly brilliant with maces? Go for it.   Another bit of praise falls on just how good this game looks. Remember, you have to be fair; this is not a fully loadable file that you alone exist in like its single player brothers, this is a system that relies heavily on cached data and internet speeds to deliver a highly playable experience. With that in mind, to the people who say this game looks bad, and continues to compare it to a fully-modded Skyrim:  Have you ever played an MMO before? Do you understand what sacrifices must be made to make them playable by more than 1% of gamers? Finally, when exactly was the last time you actually played Skyrim?  Ok, ok, I get it. Some things could look better, but come on! The game looks beautiful with some truly breathtaking vistas! Don't be a troll!   This has merely been an addition of information to my existing review, not an alteration. The well earned recommendation remains:  8.5/10~Play with honor and namarie~"
Positive,"Brilliant game.  The core product has beautiful artwork and quests that are engaging.  In fact the storylines are so expertly constructed that it feels as though I'm a character in an online epic.  They've moved me, made me laugh, and made me go ""awww"" at times.  The quests force you to make decisions that will have consequences later in the game, such as which friends and enemies you will make that might help or block you later on (individual NPCs, not entire factions).  I like the way crafting progression is based around destruction rather than construction.  They've thrown out the rulebook on how different classes must structure their gear and skills and this is really refreshing - it leaves a sense of a limitless and rich structure for defining the characters you want to play.There are a couple of issues that I've noticed on the periphery of the game.  First is that prices advertised in the in-game Crown Store are not always applied as advertised, resulting in my paying around 30% more than expected in two occasions.  The customer service experience in trying to have this rectified via Steam was not helpful at all.  A friend who had the same problem was sorted with a refund but I was not - so it is ""hit and miss"" with the service level you can expect.  Second is the erotic Role Players who insist on putting their liaisons out there in public channels, the content of which can be brutal and distasteful.  Fortunately those occasions are rare but I would not want my kids hanging out in that kind of environment.  There are some basic things that the developers could do to make the environment safer in this respect e.g. insisting they use a private channel and/or banning reported players for not using one."
Positive,BUY IT. why?-specially when sale. Pick Imperial edition for horse- Its not pay to win. Pay to look cool. DLC for more contents.-Freedom choice can be a tank mage or tank archer IMAGINATION.- Elder Scroll Lore.-9.8/10   updating always like fine wine.Cure my dota 2 addiction
Positive,brings back skyrim memories into online mode with friends what else can u ask for
Positive,one of my top 3 games!
Positive,"I do not understand those who give hate towards this game,They just probably don't want people to play such an amazing game.Elder Scrolls Online is one of the most favorite games I have ever played.Upon Starting the game you can choose between-3 Factions-9-10 races-4 Classesand can customize your character almost completely.There is both PVP and PVE. Option to join up to 5 guildsable to wear costumes that overlays your armor look (Can even look like a Goblin with a certain costume)option to dye your armorSo much space to free roam eventually able to go to Coldharbour!The game is worth getting & worth the time.----------------Updatenow with One Tamriel update, the game is more funner, all PVE areas you can finally run into other faction players, before you couldn't run into Aldmeri Dominion or Ebonheart Pact players as a Daggerfall Covenant player. Only through cyrodiil it was allowed but with update 12, alot more sets are able to be used, brought back old sets. There is even dueling which is new with update 12.  It is definetly worth buying."
Positive,"The beta sucked but now its pretty good, i speacially like the crafing."
Positive,"Its prolly the best MMO i've ever played. Most of the neg reviews came before the game changed a ton, its definetly worth the money, but i might suggest buying from somewhere else"
Positive,"Fantastic game.  Great graphics.  If you're a fan of the Elder Scrolls series, you definately need this one in your collection."
Positive,"This is pretty much my first MMO, so I don't have a lot to compare it to. All I know is that I am loving it. I have become totally addicted. As we have come to expect from Bethesda the world is huge. I suggest if you play do not rush through it. Take advantage of the vast playground. There a lot of different skill lines to learn and develop, including an impressive array of crafting skills. Highly recommended."
Positive,"It's not much of a review, but so far I really do enjoy this game. The only thing I'm upset about so far is with the Bow and Arrow. Other than that, I have no qualms with it. It's challenging, the community is amusing at times, and time really seems to fly when you are distracted with doing story missions and other side quests."
Positive,"MMORPG + Elder Scrolls universe = TESO. What more could you wish for?But seriously. It's NOT a WoW clone like some would suggest. If you've played games like Rift and The Secret World, that's more in line of how the MMO aspect of it is. It's an action MMO. You don't just sit there and spam number keys until you win. Constant moving and rolling are absolute musts in serious combat. The blocking mechanic is much more important than it may appear to be as well. And no, there's no headshots, it's still an MMO. The first person view animations are extremely detailed. Every once and a while, I enjoy casting spells from an FPS perspective. Of course, 3rd person is king in an MMO, but that doesn't take away the fact that first person was very well exectuted and an occasional treat when I'm up for it.Crafting is well done. Combat and leveling are well done. The Crown Store is extremely fair with no pay walls. You can literally buy the game and never invest a penny into it...unless you want the DLC of course. But I dare you to not buy a cool looking mount or pet at one point or another =)Tons of content regarding the beloved Elder Scrolls lore. Don't let this fool you if you're new to MMO's but familiar with Skyrim or Oblivion. It may be an action MMO, but don't expect the type of combat and controls you get in either of those games. It's an MMO afterall, but wilh great animations, sick looking spells, heavy emphasis on positioning/blocking during major fights and an aesthetically pleasing UI.The graphics may not compare to single player games, but man, for an MMO I'm in love with it's aesthetics and general look. The Elder Scrolls art direction is in FULL effect here. (One of the dungeons will even make you think back to the beginning sewers in Oblivion)The sound design is top quality. And that music. The title screen music alone totally rocks!As always, it's best to play with friends or family to have a blast. Your crafting will compliment each other as well. Although, you shouldn't have too much trouble soloing if that's your thing. Finding groups for dungeons is quick and easy and TBH, the game just isn't very hard. Ever. You'll out level an area way before you finish all the quests, especially if you're running dungeons in between. It's the only gripe I have with TESO. The game is just too easy. I haven't tried out PVP yet, but from what I hear from people close to me, it's pretty damn good.It's my favorite MMO to date. Highly recommended.TDLR: If you like action MMO (like The Secret World) and the Elder Scrolls lore, this one's a no brainer. Get it."
Positive,"This game is awesome. It got basically everything you would want in an MMO. You're not bound to your character/class selection, you can be whatever you want to be. If you wanna be a tank, but have the skills of a sorcerer, do it! Wether you prefer Bows, staffs, dual wield, one hand + shield or two-handed, this game got it all. And you can't build your character ""wrong"". It got a decent guild system, wether you want to do pve, pvp or trading. The lvl-ing system is also quite nice. You decide if you wanna quest or grind. Or a  mix. The game ain't really challenging at first though, but once you reach some lvls, the game gets pretty tough. The pvp deserves it's own paragraph. You enter a ""map"" that's split into 3 sides, Daggerfall Covenant, Aldmeri Dominion and Ebonheart Pact. You conquer each other's keeps, take their scrolls, kills their players(They can respawn so being afraid of dying shouldn't be a problem). If you like tactics and planning, this pvp is awesome. And EVERY ATTRIBUTE scales up, so you can enter as lv10 and have the same HP/Stam/Magicka as a lv40. Pvp-lvling is awesome, there are small towns scatered around that you can quest in - and they give damn good exp! And the pvp-quests aswell are pretty nice. As you fight your way in Cyrodiil, you'll gain Alliance Points, AP, which you can use to buy Siege-weapons, soul gems.. etc. it's just fantastiiic. Though. It got loooooooaaads of bugs. Not extremly gamechanging-bugs, but bugs. The mount might not always work, you might have to alk to an NPC 2 times etc. But they're just small bugs. Nothing that ruins the game-experience. Graphic is also really nice, the trees look like actual trees!!So, conclusion: This game is awesome. It got all the treats you want for an MMO + it gives you a lot of freedom. But if you are looking for a 100% bug-free game, then this might not be the game for you."
Positive,"My brother tell me  to try this game.Ok, i'll try a little."
Positive,A must have game!
Positive,"Classic Skyrim exploration feel, just adding in the mmo aspect. Overall great game, even if you decide to play alone"
Positive,Buy itThere isn't a better game in the MMO worldBest Elder Scrolls Game EVER
Positive,seems dope so far
Positive,The one thing nobody mentions is:This is just about the only fantasy MMORPG that you can play in first person where your mouse actually moves your head.  This helps immensely with immersion for people like me who either don't like third person or don't like using a cursor to order around their charachter and click on virtual buttons.This is an absolutely amazing game considering the new updates its been given!
Positive,"ESO had a rocky start, but that was over a year ago. It's had a lot of time to grow and expand since then. If you expect this game to be Skyrim but with multiplayer, you're not going to be delighted because it is nothing like that. It's a great fun and addicting MMO with really intuitive mechanics and the quests and plot is amazing. I certainly reccomend it heavily to anyone who loves TES and MMOs in general.Pros:-Amazing quests that are fun and not monotonous-Great voice acting-Lots of character customization-Player based economy-Fun and intense PvP-You can put a skill point in anything you want basically. Wanna be a heavy armor nightblade mage? You can be that!-Lots of achievements-SO MUCH LORE-A lot of expansive detailed maps-More content coming on the wayCons:-Grinding at veteran levels is sometimes hard-Mounts don't have much variety, can't shoot arrows or spells while mounted-Game doesn't have any seasonal events compared to other MMOs"
Positive,"Graphics: 8/10, for a mmo, they look great, also characters are much prettier than their counterparts in skyrim or oblivion. Story: 8/10 for a mmo ofc. Dont expect the deep characters from TES Morrowind or TES Oblivion, but the fact that every NPC has voice acting can really make you fell like playing a single player rpg. DLC stories are the best imo, the last dialogues in Clockwork City storyline being epic.Gameplay: outside primetime 7,5/10 pvp and 8,5/10 pve, inside primetime 2/10 pvp and 7/10 pve because of very poor server and cpu optimization of the game which is mainly present in pvp areas.Content: 9/10. There are 4 man dungeons and trials available both in normal and veteran mode. DLC dungeons and trials are the most difficult ones but also the most rewarding in loot.End game consist in 12 people trials both in normal and veteran mode. DLC trials are the most challenging. Groups usually consist in 2 tanks, 2 healers and 8 damage dealers. Every class can succesfully do every role, but there is a best in slot for each role.Tanks taunt the boss and other enemies and hold them in place so dds can focus them with aoe dots or direct damage abilities. Healers usually provide buffs for group, heavy healing being mandatory only in few ocassions. Damage dealers have a fluid rotation, skills having no cooldown and also having animation canceling. Mastering every role has a rather long learning curve and needs a lot of practice, but can make a very nice difference, an end game damage dealer can reach 5 to 6 times more dps than a beginner, with same class, race and sets. That is why community is rather toxic, beginner roles only being unable in most cases to beat veteran dungeons and trials.PVP consist in a large pvp area called Cyrodiil where 3 factions compete for the imperial Throne. There are Battlegrounds, basicly moba based pvp with groups of 4. PvP areas are very populated in prime time, which also create a lot of lag because PC EU server is complete garbage and cant handle so many players.Another important thing is that this game is not pay to win. Even though DLCs come with better gear, the difference between base game gear and DLC gear is really small, under 5%. So to speak this difference can only be sensed only in super high end score runs guilds. Every veteran content of the game can be finished with base game gear without any problems. Meta changes almost every patch and there were times when base game gear was best in slot. Experience, skill and rotation carries you much, much more than meta gear or class.Grinding is also really little. because max level gear is the same with every patch.PS: and yes, it is not skyrim online!!!"
Positive,"There's a ton of great content in The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited waiting for solo and group-focused players alike, including crafting, PvP, four-man dungeons, and raid-like Trials at the endgame. The gamepad controls are pretty good, which makes the action-heavy combat work well from the couch. And except for some limitations from the voice-only communication system, it nails most of what I love about PC MMORPGs"
Positive,"I won't get much into technical details, because i can't consider myself an experienced MMO player. I've tried playing several MMO's in my life, though i couldn't really internalize these games. Speaking in terms of abstraction, i couldn't help but see floating green letters and numbers of Matrix in them. The universes seemed constructed, artificial. I know they are constructed; maybe even our real universe is :) But ours succeeds to make us overlook this fact. That is what ESO succeeded for me too when i logged into its universe. This game is an MMO which doesn't feel like one. When i was roaming in Skyrim (i mean as game), i was feeling i am really there. The ambience was so tense that i didn't want to come back at times to our own universe. ESO is pretty much the same for me. As for the technical details, first of all you don't need to click and hold on the right mouse button to look around. I don't know why but this is an important detail for me :) All the crafting opportunities offered by Skyrim have been multiplied and multiplied in this game and i have never seen a skill customization that gives you so much variety options. Probably no two players have the same skill tree.But yet again, what really struck me is the ambience of this game. The first moment i bought a mount, i started to ride it. That moment i saw a thunder sruck in the horizon and it started to rain thereafter. That was one of the moments in my life that i didn't want to log off back into the universe i am actually living. But it was almost dawn here and i had to :)If what matters to me matters to you as well, i would of course recommend this game to you. At least it made me write my first review on Steam :) Have fun guys ;)"

Positive,"460 hours as of writing this review, Id say i def like it. Played when it came out in 2014 but couldnt really get into it. had fun but only leveled to 15. Been playing again for almost a year and threw in 430 hours. leveled multiple characters past 50 and got my champion points to lvl 382. this game is great...dungeons are fun just get repedative at low levels since you have to be certain levels to unlock new ones. questing is great, once you complete your races story youll get to do the other races stories. DLC is fantastic, the dungeons and trials are rought but well designed and worth the eso plus price tag.ESO PLUS: isnt needed to play the main content which has hundreds of hours in but is well worth it just for the craft bag and the stimpend of 1500 crowns per month. well worth it.all in all its a great mmo, ive played many mmos over the years and this is my favorite so far.use your first build to learn the game and enjoy questingmake an alt build using ALCAST online, theyll show you best builds for PVP,PVE and etc"
Positive,"Extremely fun game. Have not encountered any standard ""fetch quest"" so far. Every single interaction and mission is unique and interesting. The world is big and it looks pretty great. The production itself is very good (not brilliant, but still very good) It looks better than Skyrim. Great voice acting and writing and although it is not exactly a ""normal"" Elder Scrolls game, it doesnt feel like a regular MMO at all. People dont have their nametags hanging over their heads, you have to focus on them to see if they are even real players, which is a nice touch, it is more immersive this way IMO. So if you are looking for an MMO that is different (in a good way IMO) check this out. I appreciate artists not going down the ""tried and trusted"" methods nearly all  MMO games seem to follow these days and take risks with new ideas. Note that this is not as ""in depth"" as Skyrim but it makes up for that with its online elements. I think a lot of the hate is from the previous release (that I never played to be fair), because seriously, this game is really great.  It still has crafting and enchanting and all that, its just a bit of a different game. As long as you are not expecting a focused single player RPG, I dont think you will be disappointed. But don't expect a standard MMO either! They really have done something different (and good) here.  Seeing as this no longer has a monthly subscription, that easily makes it one of the best non-subscription MMOs out there, certainly the best one I have played so far. Could have been a bit prettier, and dear god is the download massive. Im not taking points off for that but jeez. It took me a whole day to download. I guess we can't really do anything about games getting larger in size. So it is written. Online can be a bit buggy as well with players blinking in and out of existence instead of moving in a smooth motion. But they are minor gripes really.  For an MMO, 8.5/10. Definitely worth the money."
Positive,"okay so after spending some time on this game i have to summarize the crucial points.Pros:-Large scale pvp (from 1v1 to 50v50 or more, open world pvp)-Huge crafting system (woodworking clothing enchanting provisioning alchemy and blacksmithing, but needs TOO much time investment cause researching traits for items will take a long time, but thats the fun part of crafting, i would say 6 months at least to make a full crafter)-Skill-based pvp but also gear dependent-Dungeons (4party dungeons or 12party trials)-Huge storyline-Huge map-Crown store (its mostly for appearance, things you can buy in there for gameplay is only food but you can craft it also for really few materials)-One of the best combat systems-Available on all consoles and regionsCons:-Loading screens (sometimes, maybe rarely, you are stuck in the loading screen and you need to alt+f4)-PvP in the EU server has too much ping on 100v100 fights or so (500+ms)-Leveling is somewhat hard and time consuming if you want to get to endgame fast-Lacks diversity on endgame pvp (many builds from streamers become viral and everyone uses them)-DLC that you have to buy in order to access some regionsi think i have missed a lot of things but i think this is enough for now. shortly, i think this game is fun and players who are searching for an ""all-type"" mmorpg should give this game a look because i think most of their ""demands"" will be answered."
Positive,"If you are a fan of the Elder Scrolls series and MMOs, I'd definetly reccomend trying the game. Its a bit rocky to start with, but afterwards its a really rewarding and immersive experience."
Positive,"I'm just playing it like it's a single player elder scrolls game, and it's great."
Positive,"There's no wrong or right way to play this game. You can PvP on your own, or with friends and Guilds, you can PvE on your own, or with friends and Guilds, you can spend all your hard earned gold at the Luxury Vendor every weekend, and have houses stacked with Daedric Thrones. If you're on the fence, take it for a spin during a free-to-play event! There's plenty of people on the forums, who stream, and even random strangers in game, who're willing to lend a hand."
Positive,"What can I say? I'm having fun. This late in the game there's a TON of stuff to do, and they look into the weirder parts of TES lore. Game is still very active.Only downside is that the resource bag is only available with subscription, and it's necessary for anyone with multiple characters or crafters. But if you don't want to keep resources (like if you know you're only going to make certain things so you only need to carry those certain resources), I guess you don't need it. And subscription gives you SO MUCH MORE than just the resource bag, so it's not a bad deal, exactly."
Positive,"I absolutely love the Elder Scrolls series. I've played all of the main-series games, though I've only beaten two of them so far. And Elder Scrolls Online is definitely on the list of my favorite MMOs ever. With more than 700 hours plugged into the game since I got it, I absolutely love the open-world aspect, the amount of exploration you can do, and the great character creation engine, which is better than those used in most of the MMOs I've played. The story, while a little bit typical of the Elder Scrolls at this point (save the world from such and such threat that could destroy Tamriel, come on anyone who has played this game has to have at least played one of the others and become familiar with this concept), it makes up for it by giving you more in-depth side stories with the expansions. While I still need to finish up the Morrowind expansion, everything else so far has been amazing despite the less-than-stellar initial game release.ESO is a game that I personally would highly recommend anyone who is an Elder Scrolls fan at least try. You may or may not like it for one reason or another, but it's still a pretty decent addition to the Elder Scrolls universe. (Can't wait for the EVENTUAL Elder Scrolls VI though. The REAL Elder Scrolls VI. In the meantime, I'll have to explore what I can of Tamriel in ESO"
Positive,"With almost 2,000 hours logged at the time of writing this its safe to say I have played this game a lot. With that said there is probably 10,000 more hours of content left for me. I havent even begun to finish every dungeon, trial, and DLC. You could effectively play for 2,000 hours and still be on the base game content. That said I will talk about my personal experience in the game. All just my opinion.-Beginner game content-Starting out for the first time is easy since you dont know how vast the world is and the game leaves it easy for you to focus on one map location at a time. The main story is paced out through levels, I believe every 10 levels up to level 50 is a new main story quest. So in between each story quest you have Zone quests for each zone in the world. They are all very fluent and easy, they wanted to make it so everyone could complete the stories. Over-all very fun and enjoyable for first time players.-Midgame Content- The Mid game hits when you complete the Main story, reached level 50 and start earning Champion Points(CP). CP is basically what your real level is gonna be. at CP 160 you have matched the highest level enemies and gear level. This is when you will really start to create a build that falls in your skill set and play style and really start to define your character. Most mid game content is going to be normal dungeons, trials, finishing other zones outside of your alliance area, and DLC's. This is where most people will start to fall off maybe and feel over whelmed or perhaps not know what to do or where to go next. However this is also the most free part of the game. The entire world is open to you my tip is, go where you want, do what you want. If you like story check out the other alliance areas or the DLC maps, if you like pvp try Battlegrounds or Cyrodiil, if you like challenging boss fights and group dungeons then go with undaunted quests and finishing dungeons. Me personally, I like to do it all as I feel in the mood for it. Over-all mid game can be the most exciting and the slowest part of the game. It all depends on what you do with it.-End game- Ok now we are going to talk about the hard stuff. In my opinion its hard to say what End game really is in ESO because essentially it's just mid game content but set to a harder difficulty. Veteran dungeons, or PvP with CP enabled(to really show off your build). I understand this is where a lot of people may disagree with me on what exactly End game is. If you ask me though its mostly the Vet dungeons and trying for every achievement such as the no death achievements and such. The truth is though, the end game is just mid game continued, because its whatever you make it out to be. For some its just growing wealth, crafting, fishing, or running around killing things. I guess the point here is that this game really doesnt have end game simply because the game never ends. Over-all the game in its entirety is fun and full of content.-General comments-My own comments about the game. I think the buy to play module is great, it allows for a more mature community(mostly) and when you buy the base game you get a whole lot of content to do with out paying anything further.ESO plus(premium subscription)  to me is necessary to play the game, with out it you dont get the craft bag which means basically you cant pick up materials because you will have no room to store them. Now if you dont mind not gathering materials and just not crafting then for you ESO plus is not necessary to play. I can justify spending the $15 every month for it because i enjoy the game and would like to support it, they are always putting out new content and to me that feels very deserving of my money.As far as any pay to win, there are none, Crown shop is cosmetic minus a few things such as potions and poisons(which are just as good as ones that can be made in game). For anyone who is a fan of Elder scrolls and has been putting this one off for years because its an online game, I suggest in getting it. The amount of lore in the game is immense. You could also essentially play the entire game as if it was a single player game(for story content that is). For anyone who is a huge fan of MMO's this one is a great one to play. There is always a full community online, Guilds ready to help you with dungeons or anything else you have. A lucrative and competitive Guild store market for those who like to grow wealth. As well as plenty of challenging content for those who like to ""beat it all"". I feel there is something for everyone in this game.-Conclusion- I enjoy playing for a little bit of everything the game has to offer and I have a lot more left to learn still. My personal score of the game is 8/10 for its immense content(and content still being added regularly) and grand vistas from a huge world map expanding through different zones, islands, and even planes of existence. If you disagree with anything in my review feel free to share you opinions in the comments so others may hear and be able to formulate their own opinion as well."
Positive,"-- DISCLAIMER --This is NOT a World of Warcraft Substitute.If you're going into this game hoping it's the MMO that will keep you from falling back into the crack-handed clutches of Blizzard, you will be most likely be disappointed, and probably wont enjoy the experience too terribly much. That being said, there are some aspects of the game, such as general MMO staple content, that this game shares with WoW and other WoW clones. Some examples of these would be your Dungeons/Raids/PvP/Battlegrounds etc, HOWEVER; the execution of such content is unique to ESO and differs greatly to mainstream MMO content.  This game is a more story driven MMO than most MMO's, and as such, it does a fantastic job of executing its purpose by flawlessly immersing you within the world it brings forth. There is a beautiful community aspect to the game that always feels welcoming, helpful and sociable. Being that the game is more story driven than most other multiplayer games out there (the most i've experienced so far), you end up recognizing familiar names and people through your encounters in the world. As such; you begin establishing lasting connections quite early with fellow players across your journeys in Tamriel.The leveling process feels rewarding and steady, and the talent/skill system they have in place expands your ability to play how you want substantially. While there are a few ""broken"" builds because of the flexibility with skills and freedom of character development, I believe it is a small trade-off for what in my eyes, has greatly broadened the horizons for 'Role Playing' players, and 'Personal Preference' play styles. All in all, I am really enjoying this game, and the fact you do not need to pay a monthly fee really sold me on the buy. I've payed full price for this game on XBOX, and if it wasn't on sale right now, i'd have paid full price again. I would also like to add that; this is the FIRST MMO I have experienced where the incentives to become a subscriber are exactly that. INCENTIVES. NOT removal of HINDRANCES. And i've played the likes of SWTOR and LoTRO, so I know what the heck i'm talking about.Anyways, much love <3 And I hope to see you in Tamriel :) Below you will find my basic check box review list.Gameplay-☐ Nothing better☑ Very good☐ Good☐ Nothing special☐ Okay☐ BadGraphics-☐ Masterpiece☑ Beautiful☐ Good☐ Will do☐ Bad☐ AwfulAudio☑ Amazing☐ Very good☐ Good☐ Decent☐ Not too bad☐ BadAudience☐ Kids☑ Teens☑ Adults☐ EveryoneStory-☐ Lovely☑ Great☐ Good☐ Average☐ Not great☐ NoneDifficult-☐ Just press a bunch of buttons☐ Easy☐ Significant brain usage☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master☐ Not so easy☐ Difficult☐ Dark SoulsGrind-☐ Nothing☐ Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks☐ Isnt necessary to progress☐ A bit grindy sometimes☐ Average grind level☑ Tons of grindable content☐ InsanityGame Time-☐ Short☐ Average☐ Long☑ Depends on you☐ EndlessPrice☑ Just buy it☐ Worth the price☐ Wait for sale☐ Maybe if you have some spare money left☐ Not recommended"
Positive,"There is a lot of fun content in this game, u can do a lot of things, be a master enchanter, crafter, thief and so on. The main storyline of the game is very interesting. Overall, the game is not hard to play, so people who do not play MMO/RPG type of games, this is the game to start."
Positive,"Played the beta, found the game aweful, and I didn't find it worth a subscription fee however all of the annoyances got fixed and the subscription dropped. Now I am absolutely IN LOVE with this game, enough so that I even find it worth a subscription now. It no longer feels like a rip-off from any other MMO like it did before. Right now I truly feel like I am playing an Elder Scrolls game with friends from all over the world!"
Positive,"Every update brings this game closer and closer to the MMO I wanted it to be. Definitely the most freedom for character development that I've seen. The world is rich and the story is engaging. PvP is a blast, as well."
Positive,A must-buy if you like Skyrim because the content has been adding and will be in the future.
Positive,Been enjoying myself fishing
Positive,god i fucking love gambling i want to give zenimax all my money to spend on crates
Positive,"An amaazing game, However if you go to buy it drill it in your head that its not skyrim. Its a MMORPG set in the elder scrolls universe. If you're a fan or the lore youll love the game as I do. ITs great game to play with friends. Somehow getting your ass kicked by a boss with your friends is fun. Great game 10/10 worth the money"
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online. Need more be said, really? Beautiful world, beautiful mmorpg. Spent many of hours in this game, and boy, does it leave a satisfied feeling. Now, you'll see a lot of people complain about glitchiness (mostly from the early days) or maybe price (but they dropped the membership fee) I mean, there are a few mechanics missing still, but i'm hoping to see implimented eventually, like duels, and battlegrounds. The only PvP offered as of now is that in cyrodiil and it's subsidiary parts. Don't get me wrong, the siege is beautiful, but i'm a duelist type of PvPer. Coming out on top in a close duel to the death feels great, where as in a war, you can feel a bit cheated by a few lucky bombardments of siege equipment. A lot of people complain about the graphics also, which I REALLY don't understand. The graphics are SO beautiful in this mmo, and if you've played ANY mmo, you'd know these are top notch graphics. Well, as top notch as you can go while still allowing people who don't own super gaming computers to play also. But, there ultra quality settings for a reason. The feel is great in this game, and the balance is definitely there for each class or build. They want you to be able to make who you want to make and choose what you do in the world, and they succeeded in that. Definitely worth a buy. Buy it."
Positive,"What ever you might have heard about this game around its release, put it aside. When the game released it had many problems but the current state of the game is Exceptional. They have really made it into the great open world MMO it was meant to be. I would very much recommend this game for anyone looking for that sense of adventure or just need a break from the behemoth that is World Of Warcraft. Even if you have no past knowlage of the Elder scrolls seriers like Skyrim or Oblivion this game is still excellent as is standing alone. If you are familiar with the franchise then Bonus points. To sum it up coming from someone who couldnt really get into skyrim this game is a Must for giving it a shot. I would however wait until the price comes down on a sale. I picked this copy up for around 20 USD opposed to their current 60 dollar price tag. 9/10"
Positive,"While playing the game can be fun, it is easy to get bored of.  The main thing that makes ESO fun is the people.  When I first got the game, I played with two friends from real life.  As I played the game more, I became part of a guild that I did some dungeons and trials with.  But eventually, my brother and I started our own guild.  Through this guild, I met quite a lot of cool people.  And even when we get burned-out of ESO, we remain in contact with our friends from the game.  If you're lucky, you can meet some of the coolest people you'll know by playing ESO."
Positive,"I love TES (played Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim on consoles) and had to buy the TES:Online game too, of course...STORY AND GAMEPLAY:TESO is super consistent and has one of the best - if not the best overall - plotline presentation a MMORPG could have.You will understand what is happening and love the lore ingame! BIG PLUS.As always on the series, everything is movable, searchable, pickpocketable and so on... Lots of freedom.Solid gameplay, solid controls, very nice artwork, no glitches and no bugs that matter or ruin the fun.MICRO-TRANSACTIONS:Paying for stuff is mostly about cosmetics and more explorable content - so no worries about falling behind for not injecting a few dollars more. Not a pay-to-win (would suck hard if it was, you already purchased a game copy afteralls!)COMMUNITY:But as for the Community Feeling, not sure... Didnt have one decent conversation with any real player yet, while ingame...I played a lot with a personal friend of mine and we still enjoy this game a lot.Used to play a lot of MMORPGs and Turn-Based RPGs when I was younger, but nowadays im just not really interested that much on these two types of games... FINAL THOUGHTS: Recommended for any Elder Scrolls fan, you can play with friends or alone - its still fun!If you are into MMORPGs, try this one out, you probably won't find anything better than this."
Positive,"One of the few last standing, strong MMO's around. Give it a shot if you're looking for something like this."
Positive,"I have only played enough to reach lv 9, I am loving this game"
Positive,"The game is very fun and atmospheric, the music feels like The Elder Scrolls, it's a solid MMO and it's better with friends, if you're thinking about getting it it's worth it."
Positive,WoW but on crack
Positive,"I love the Elder Scrolls series gave this game a chance to see what potential this game has. I was not dissapointed, I know the Elder Scrolls games are supposed to be Single player, but this game is pretty awesome and fun to play."
Positive,"1,500+ HOURS I've played this game and it continues to evolving - Good & Bad.  IGNORE reviews from those who haven’t REALLY played this game.  Want to skip to TL;DR, go to the end...GOOD NEWS:#1 - Value.  You easily get your money's worth. It takes 100-150 hours to work thru the main story line plus your 1st Faction.  On the flip side if you dislike Lore and want to PvP. You can grind your way to the upper levels in 40-50 hours by watching YouTube videos. #2 - PvE.  As a previous Elder Scrolls gamer, I love PvE and Solo campaigns. When ESO first launched, I felt it struggled in this area EXCEPT for the main story line and the 3 Faction stories.  If you love Role Playing, Lore, or reading Quest back stories, count on another 300 hours of enjoyment as you to work your way through the main game.#3 - DLC.  Orsinium is large. I pushed hard to finish the Orc story line and get the 1st and ""easiest"" Achievement and it took me 30+ hours.  The Dark Brotherhood quest is fun, its ""Blade of Woe"" adds a new element with various Kill Cams and help the game feel more like a traditional Elder Scrolls game.  #4 - Subscription. You do not need to buy a subscription to enjoy this game. But the plentiful Crowns, extra XP, all the DLC, and maybe most importantly the Bag of Infinite Holding for crafting goodies hooked me into paying for a subscription. #5 - Holiday Events. These are FREE to all.  Witches Festival, New Life Festival, etc., are a blast and nearly every player in the game participates as the giveaways and rewards are significant.  BAD NEWS:#1 - PvP.  The game is split into PvE areas and PvP.  The PvP area while large, with its own story line, is nowhere near the size or scope of the main PvE story.  #2 - Lag.  In the PvP area, when hundreds of players are on the screen at the same time, players often complain of lag.  This is something Zenimax says they are working on but it is an ongoing issue.#3 - Inventory.  Crafting is a fun and an extremely useful part of ESO, but inventory is a problem as you amass lots of ingredients and mats. You can continue to buy more inventory but it gets expensive with in-game gold or with real $.  The ESO subscription resolves this issue but without it you may will find yourself needing Alt's as mules or spending $ on inventory.#4 - Sales & Auction House.  There is no Auction House.  Players join guilds and each guild bids on Traders which are open to the public throughout Tamriel.  You can join up to 5 guilds (which players create) and you have 30 slots in each one, in which to sell items to raise money.  If your Guild loses their weekly bid for a Trader your items may not sell.#5 - Grouping - ESO has a grouping tool to help players find others who can help them fight in Delves (dungeons), Trials or as needed.  The Grouping tool has gotten better but often if you want to play as a DPS (vs Tank or Healer) you spend a lot of time waiting.  TL;DR ---> BOTTOM LINE:I have found ESO to be a great game.  Plus, the ESO community friendly and very helpful to newbies. If you are looking for a game you can play for a long time whether it be Role Playing, Sole Questing, Toppling a Castle ""zerg-style"" with hundreds of players, or peacefully Fishing alone in the wilderness - this game might be for you."
Positive,"Oh boy. 278+ hours into this game and I have still only recently left early game.I have spent countless hundreds of U.S. dollars into this game, and it is worth it. I had to buy every single DLC and try them out, and then I realized that DLC doesn't cross over to other megaservers. What did I do? I bought the gold edition. I bought every single thing on the ESO steam store page... some of them multiple times.The shitload of content ZoS drops on you is fucking amazing, I just want more.Early Game:You start off in Coldharbour, Molag Bal's plane of Oblivion as a prisoner OR on the Firemoth Islands in Morrowind (Morrowind DLC owners). You meet the Prophet, Lyris Titanborn, and get a general idea of the Evil of Molag Bal. Now, you are dropped in an alliance starting zone and you quest your way to the top. You get through 3 entire regions, two of them small and one of them GIANT from level 1-15. Of course, there are many other quests and things and you only complete about 50% of the regions. The amount of content is amazing and the amount of work ZoS put in polishing the regions makes you immersed.End Game:There are many trials and dungeons that you can do in endgame, as well as PVP. The good thing is that there is no real endgame because regions are scaled to your level and no one has ever done EVERYTHING there is to do in ESO. However, ZoS still gives the players a steady stream of updates that will make you spend hours upon hours of time, doing whatever the fuck it is that ZoS gives you. Wow.Devs and Updates:ZoS is a truly amazing studio. Their dev team listens to players, which is the reason they are loved so much. The devs brought the game from its previous state as a shit game to a glorious MMORPG set in the Elder Scrolls universe. Please support the devs and donate to them because they do such a good job on the game it is overwhelming.Polish:The game is polished AF. Even though there are some bugs, ZoS is constantly working to fix them. Sometimes polishing the game infuriates players because of changing mechanics. That I can relate to, but there is no need to get really angry about mechanics changing. Every single area of the game world feels polished, even though there are many rough edges that ZoS is trying to fix.Gameplay:The gameplay is good. There is no revolutionary combat system, just the standard combat you would expect from an MMO. The visuals and sound effects are buffed up for the combat though and you feel like you are really doing something and making an impact on the enemies. There is also some/a lot of skill involved, depending on what build you play as. Jumping, running, and exploring is a blast.Graphics:The graphics are great in this game and they run unexpectedly well. I am on a shitty Macbook Pro and medium graphics are fine with some framerate problems. The visuals are pleasing to the eye and make exploring fun. I can stand and admire the beauty of the game for 2 hours running in circles. The graphics are sometimes bad if you have a bad internet/GPU. They look shitty as hell if they aren't loaded, yet there is a certain beauty about it.Story and Quests:The quests and story are sometimes too long and extended and make me feel like I am just running errands, jumping, killing bosses, and just... questing. Sometimes ZoS does a bad job on the quests and make them feel ""grindy"" and repetitive. There are good quests though. There are some very interesting, even humorous quests. The fact that ZoS can implement humor in a game is awesome, since good humor is nonexistent in most MMOs.DLC:I loved the DLC and the zones that ZoS create. Orsinium was a really good DLC that made me question myself and my morals, and just an overall blast. Thieves' Guild was great, as I loved jumping around Abah's Landing doing parkour. Dark Brotherhood was also good, yet it was smaller. The devs seem to have looked at and checked every nook and cranny of the game, and I loved that. Morrowind was blast with a heavy emphasis on exploring, although I did not like the repetitiveness of the quests and sometimes the exploring was just too tiring.Design:10/10Bugs:So funny I don't want them removed from the gameVerdict:ESO has many rough edges, but the dev team listen to the playerbase and are doing the best they can to fix them. Overall, this is a great game with tons of polish and it is definitely something to spend your time on. There is a plethora of activities and quests and no one has ever done every single one of them.I give this game a 8.9/10 as a final verdict. This is the best MMO I have played in a while."
Positive,This is in my opinion the best MMORP.Whole lot of fun to do the quests.But the group dungeons are the best. The community is very nice and friendly to eachother. If you ask in the chat if some people want to do group dungeons they will help you. Even if the lvl distance is incredibly high they will still help you out.
Positive,"This game brings all my past nostalgia into new life, and it's just wonderful"
Positive,this game gave me crippling depression
Positive,Really really  fun need friends  to play with
Positive,"Kind of boring in my opinion but its definently well designed and the people who balance the game have a good idea of what theyre doing. The quality also doesn't fluctuate much, what you see is what you get."
Positive,A game that you'll never get tired of. Always something new to do!
Positive,"I got the base game as a gift, and slowly got into it enough where I've spent real money on DLC and cosmetic stuff. This is the first MMORPG I've ever played, and coming in from the mainline Elder Scrolls titles, it does a good job of acclimating new players into the experience. The gameplay is fun, combat is engaging yet simple, and it's always fun to just log in and run some dungeons. The community is shockingly great and welcoming to new players, which is really nice when veteran players of other online games tend to look down on new players.I think that if you're a fan of the Elder Scrolls, you should at least give ESO a try. The base game is very reasonably priced and comes with the Morrowind DLC (which is really good and filled with love, so if you're a Morrowind fan I highly recommend it). It's an experience worth checking out, and I definitely enjoy this game."
Positive,"Bought this game and put maybe 30 hours into it on console and couldn't enjoy the game. After playing just 3 hours on PC, I now realize that I was playing the wrong version. Bethesda makes the most accessible MMOs on the market, and the size and scale combined with a dedicated adherence to existing lore. Also started in Blackwood, rather than Morrowind or Elsweyr and it's the perfect way for an Oblivion fan like myself to enjoy the magic of Leyawiin and the murder-mystery questline that is a welcome change from the ""you save the world"" trope that is present in almost every DLC for this game. Amazing and I look forward to exploring the whole of Tamriel!"
Positive,"+ The friendliest most mature community. The bad reputation at launch scared most kids off I guess. It's so nice and polite generally. Grammar is much better and there's more reliable people in general. (Though kids are still around, just faaaaaar less than with any other online community I've ever seen.)+ There is SO much content. Quests, completionist things, building your own home, getting into PvP which is its own game entirely. + You are able to make a difference right away. Level differences doesn't stop you from playing together in most of the game.+ Plenty of lore to enjoy. All cultures get some love and all races will be appriciated. (You'll even care about Altmer.)+/- It's not for everyone. I love it but I often see people asking ''What's the fastest way to...''  And this is not that type of game. +/- The game is overpopulated. That's often good, but it also often means you're stuck waiting for stuff to respawn, or don't get many boss-fights because someone steamrolls it along with you.- Some things simply don't work. Queuing for dungeons especially is just glitchy too often to be acceptable. Zenimax learned well from Bethesda, because you're often wondering: ''Feature or glitch?''  Nothing relogging or retrying won't fix however."
Positive,"Picked it up in July for the steam summer sale. Haven't had time to play it a whole lot, but it seems pretty good."
Positive,Absolutely love this game. A friend recommended I get it so we can play together and I have been having a lot of fun playing both together and alone.
Positive,The fact that you can perform necrophilia on a corpse with the push ups emote makes this the best Elder Scrolls game.
Positive,"I love this game, I've always been such a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls and to finally be able to play this game is awesome."
Positive,"Amazing !, got lots of negative feedback on its early published, but now getting stronger, better and addictive :)"
Positive,Elder Scrolls has always been a favourite of mine. From 2 to 5 I've played and now we play together. Yay!
Positive,"Really awesome game, wide range of skill tree and huge build freedom. Characters are not limited to their class combat style."
Positive,Very grindy. Very fun. I suggest learning pvp ASAP lol. very hard if your your new to PC and/or mmo's. Best played with friends.
Positive,"very good game with almost endless content and possibilities, the community is a likable group of people as well!"
Positive,"Since I am nearing my 1 Year Anniversary of having the game, I figured I'd give my thoughts on it.First thing is first, danggggg this game has a lot of stuff to see and do. I have clocked in 1,000 hours, and most of that is from playing it mind you, not sitting AFK. And I have only scratched what I feel is the surface. I love to get myself caught up and look at stuff and read the books. But doing so takes such a long time. As a result, I have probably explored only a 3rd of what it has to offer. It doesn't help when you sit there and listen to the beautiful Voice Acting either. If you fancy the Elder Scrolls franchise, or you are a Skyrim scrub (like me), then you will find lots of enjoyment in this game. Just do everyone a favor and not go into this game thinking it is a Skyrim Online. It isn't.I love this game and can see it lasting a lot longer than what it has given me. I play Aldmeri Dominion and let me tell you, I am more than excited to get on Caldwell's Gold. I. Must. See. The. Alik'r Desert. I just must. When I get to that part of my journey, I will feel as though I am complete."
Positive,It's pretty good
Positive,"Not bad at all, i played many mmo and this is a great mmo and has so much thing to do and see. great game"
Positive,Greatly improved since first release. Combat feels much weightier liek in skyrim and monthly sub fees are a thing of the past. Wewt XD
Positive,This game is simply addicting. This game is no Skyrim but I believe Tamriel Unlimited is much better.
Positive,still waiting for tiber septim to conquer all of tamriel
Positive,Pretty good I reckon.
Positive,"I love this game- It's the only MMO right now that keeps me interested. Between the research and leveling I have a lot of incentive to log in (So many opportunities to make spreadsheets!). Solo play on this is also a lot of fun, the world is beautiful and I find myself content wandering around getting supplies and mining. It's pretty easy to group in traffic-y areas and go where you need to when you want to team up."
Positive,By far the best MMO ive ever played! PVP is on point as well as the amount you can do alone is quite something. I have always loved plundering through caves to uncover weapons and armour and then bringing what you have found into the PVP area to fight for your alliance till death! This game is a work of art and i highly applaud the developers! Thank you and have a great day! ~Heibz
Positive,">Bought the game on Saturday>Excited as F*ck>Game takes untill monday arvo to finish downloading (non-stop at speeds >=400kb/s)>""It's Finally Done!""

Positive,"Great game, subs are gone which was my only previous issue.PROS-Easy to learn controls and basic mechanics-PvE is fun and a viable to play unlike most games that have little rewards for it besides xp-PvP is also fun though i have little experience in it, never like PvP too much in most games-Guilds are implemented well into the game (fighters, mages, ect.)-New justice system adds realism to the game, no more taking items right in front of someone just to break it down for mats-You can join more than one clan, i am in a clan for stores, roleplaying, and my own for friends to just hang out.CONS-You will lose you life if you steal a sweet roll infront of 3 gaurds at level 4. personal experiences."
Positive,"After spending hours hunting daedra to rack up xp and collect daedra hearts for my friends armour, I can officially say this game is great for grinding with friends whether you're going to: discover new lands, battle it out against another group of players in pvp, have a dance party in an npc's house or even having a debate about social and political parties in the chat.This game is worth the ammount of money paid, thousands of hours of gameplay, great to play with friends and if you're a true fan of The Elder Scrolls Series I'm sure you will have already gotten this game.P.S. Join Tamriels Communist Party today!"
Positive,Really nice game always got something new to do 10/10
Positive,i dont even own this game
Positive,"I mean, I guess it's alright."
Positive,If you like WoW but do not like to pay every month to play it you will like this like me.
Positive,"An excellent attempt into the MMO world for the Elder Scrolls series. Only drawback is the latency issue for people playing from countries further away from the servers. Makes PvP unviable. However gameplay, sounds, pacing and value all remain high and it is a great investment."
Positive,"I spent so much of my early adult life to this MMO game and loved it, for its Elder Scroll's lore, to its exciting game play, to the community and guild that positively supported me. But dang did I put in so much of my time here, likely because I missed the chance to play WOW, but looking back 3000+ hours seems surreal. Wish I had more time for the newer expansions, was never that great at it because my build sucks and never could pay to win, seeing how some of the players there just cut through foes and dungeons solo build."
Positive,"Update - One Tamriel :  Totally ruined the experience. Basically there is no point to abilities anymore when you can 1-2 shot anything in overland or delves. No skill rotations are needed, I never get beyond the second skill. You spend 5+ mins getting to a character confrontation to spend 20 secs in conversation, 10 secs 2 shotting him and then spend 5+ minutes running back to hand it in. Absolutely awful design. No challenge, no sense of achievement, Zero immersion, soulless. its now just a game for completionists ticking off all the icons on map after map. What an incredible fall from grace.Original:Great visuals and audio, absolutely masses of content, engaging stories, flooded with players. Boy has this improved since launch.Great solo, workable as a duo (overland mobs can be a touch easy with 2), loads of group content.Without doubt the current mmorpg to beat."
Positive,"I love games that don't tie you down to missions only. I like to craft some things I might need or sit back on my horse and take in the sights. The Elder Scrolls® Online: Tamriel Unlimited has plenty of what I like. After a free weekend, I decided to buy the game because there was way to much I hadn't seen or done. There are three factions each containing three races of beings. Each faction has a different story line. I'm guessing they will converge in the end game, but I am far from that point.One thing I really appreciate is the mounts are much easier to use than in Oblivion and Skyrim. They never get lost either.I've only played for a couple weeks and feel I've only skimmed the surface of the game. I'm looking forward to a lot more exploration and fun.Update: It's been an enjoyable year. Time well spent. I love Elder Scrolls Online even more. I finally subscribed to the game and got a lot of benefits; the best being a bag to hold all my crafting materials...I'm a real collector. ;-)"
Positive,"This game recieved alot of hate for apparently not being a true single player elderscrolls game, but they were all wrong!  My first elderscrolls game was morrowind and i have player every game since.  This game in my opinion completely lives up to the name!  I have over 350 hours of gameplay and I am still not bored!  Well done Bethesda, well done.*****  Five star rating!!!!Amazing game!"
Positive,With the recent acquisition of Zenimax and Bethesda by Microsoft.  I do hope they can now afford to have South East Asian (SEA) servers.
Positive,The game is fun.
Positive,"Alright, I loved the hell out of ESO when i first started playing it. Look at my clocked in hours. Anyone that has played half that much as claims the game sucks, is lying.  But this review is more for Morrowind.. Which was a complete rip off.  For some reason it's not letting many Morrowind purchasers review that game. Sure, the content was lovely and refreshing.. but it was so limited.  It offers very little for new and old players alike.  And at the price of a full game.  I mean seriously?  It should have just been a DLC provided for free with subscription... but to use the term ""Chapter"" to be cute and screw subscribers out of something the size of the other DLC (Guilds, Orisinium) is just blatantly dishonest.BUY ESO for sure if you are a fan of the genre, stay clear of Morrowind if you want bang for your buck. Just a ripoff.I am a post-Tamriel One player, and you can probably see from my playing hours I have spent perhaps way too much time on this game! While I have written a lot of areas for improvement, I would recommend it for a 3 month heavy gaming stint.Basically the good and the badGood:-ESO allows players a high level of freedom in design of characters (though not nearly as many as some d20 systems). There are so many different builds I would like to try. -The Community is generally relatively positive and helpful to new players.-Aesthetically appealing world (not nearly as lovely as the Witcher 3, way better than WoW or Glyph)-Well thought out quests (better than WoW anyhow)-Very few serious bugs-Decent world lore (Delivered in the form of terribly written soporific texts or entertaining PCs)Mixed Feelings--ESO Plus Subscription was supposed to come with DLC on a quarterly basis.  I don’t think it has.  It was worth it for me as I am new player, so I received access to DLCs released from the last few years (Orsinium, Thieves Guild, Dark brotherhood, Imperial City).  I haven’t sees a release this past quarter anyhow.Bad:-While Tamriel One lets you play the zones and quests of each faction the quests are very much the same here for each group. Some, but very little new quest content.-there is little sense of accomplishment in levelling up.  All zones are accessible to all players as the game scales to your level ….  Levelling in this sense can seem irrelevant.  But you do get new skills, but no additional firepower behind those skills.  This is a Tamriel One “feature”.  An alternative would be to set up a server or instances where there is no such scaling based on a player’s choice of scaled or not. -You cannot fully enjoy the game unless you have an ESO Plus subscription. Without a crafting bag that gives you a lot of NECESSARY inventory space, you will be forced to be a choosey looter (Not easy when going through a high paced dungeon with a random group of people), purchase merchant follower (with real money), or give up crafting.  This problem is likely compounded with Homestead that has added a lot of housing items that many people won’t be using.  That means more trips to town to sell them off instead of time adventuring… unless you are a picky looter. It appears that ESO purposely creates inventory problems for the user to force them into a ESO Plus purchase situation: Monster Trophies, Undropable token items, housing, crafting.  The last thing I want to think about when playing a game is inventory management.  Makes it feel too much like work.  At the very least they should provide players with extra inventory to accommodate the homestead associated drops. I have purchased a merchant, a banker and an ESO crafting bag (Via ESO Plus) with real money and still get annoyed.-Allow inventory to be sorted additionally by sets.-You need a fairly organized group of 12 players to get the best gear in the game… not good if you don’t want to or have loads of time to invest in game.-Asia is laggy, and there seems to be no plans for an Asia server.-GMs either do not exist or do not get involved to spice up the world (I haven’t seen any in my 3 months of play anyhow)"
Positive,It's fun.  Very improved from initial launch.
Positive,"It's not skyrim, which is what I was hoping for, while I was disappointed, a new world of Elder Scrolls came out to me, different, some people might not like that, but ESO TU still holds that rustic elder scrolls feel we are used to, walking for hours in skyrim? walk for days now, being this world is HUGE."
Positive,"This game saved my life.I am 27.My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you."

Positive,"The amount of content this game offers in its base form alone is amazing,the community is friendly and will gladly help any new player out. Would recommend this game totally. The extra content for the game can sometimes be overpriced so i would say you wait till a sale is up then grab it"
Positive,A good game although the last chapters (Skyrim and Elsweyer) are quite boring
Positive,"Great Combat, Very Lore Friendly, RPG greatness, and all around great game!"
Positive,"love the game for its lore, storyline, characters, setting, world and the friendly community"
Positive,Has a lot of soul and life. Don't rush leveling enjoy the content while leveling.
Positive,I enjoy this game a lot as a Morrowind fan but the monetization is really terrible
Positive,"Pretty much the only go-to for after World Of Warcraft ends. I like everything about this game and it is one of my favorites to get lost in. I don't like how expensive it has been over the years, obtaining DLC packs and whatnot, but overall, the gameplay is deep and immersive and has plenty of content to keep you busy for many days and weeks."
Positive,"Almost at 350 hours and still really enjoying it, its much faster to level with friends and much more fun to play and it has a sort of skyrim feel imo, but its substantially different ""power"" wise, with the spell/power bar set up as an MMORPG should have, making it easier to cast and change between weapons. My advice to new players would be to get a mount ASAP, as the open world is massive.. but the quick travel system is fairly good once you discover locations. Probably the best aspect of the game, is that any class can play pretty much any role (DPS, tank, healer etc), its up to you what your character can do, and what you put skill points into (of which there are plenty once you get going)Regular Patches are good, and new crown content, updates and everything are great and regular. I play on low graphics on a low end PC and it runs fine, low graphics arent anything to complain about either. If you enjoy Elder scrolls story, Battles, PVP castle sieges, dungeon raiding for high end loot or an escape from the thought of your parents imminent divorce, you will enjoy The Elder Scrolls Online."
Positive,"before the elder scrolls purists start up their no positve eso votes regime understand that i highly recomend this game as an mmo not as an elder scrolls game, as an mmo it's like a breath of fresh air in a world of the same ui for every single game.the combat is revolutanary in the mmo genre, the story is good, the voice acting is sort of bad at times and you can still go almost anywhere (admitedly i miss the world that levels with you). yes 15 dollars is alot of money to add onto a 60  dollar game which is ludicrous so buy the game on sale, your 15 dollars keeps the servers running and encourages new eso contentto me it is an mmo with elder scrolls ellements which while not as was intended makes it actually look very good, no it dosen't match up to it's elder scroll predecesors but it in my opinion is a good mmo so farp.s its actually quite a bit simpler to install the game with the bethesda installer instead of the steam installer"
Positive,"I tried this game on PS4 on release and couldn't get into it. Came back early this year for a second crack, and what a different game this is. If you are a fan of Skyrim, or any Elder Scrolls game, then you will enjoy ESO.I'm not usually a fan of MMO's, but ESO hits different. Most of the content is playable both solo or in a group, and with a TON of content you will never be bored of things to do. The different classes are so varied that you want to have multiple characters to try them all. The lore and stories of the various factions and areas are also engaging and fun to follow.ESO is regularly on sale, and with the amount of content it's a steal!!"
Positive,"The VAST majority of my time running this game has only been waiting (sometimes days on end) for installations and updates. You're expected to buy some of the seemingly dozens of DLCs to get basic things like piercings for your character, which leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The gameplay is truly the quintessential mind-numbing experience, as (at least so far) not much at all has truly stood out and excited me about the game. I will melt away the hours and then put the game down and reflect if I really had very much fun. It's hard to say that I have, sadly.However as much as I wanted, primarily, to complain about the absurd sizes of updates and subsequent outrageous waiting times if I wait just a little too long to play the game again, I'm not much of an MMO player, so I presume most of my gripes are part and parcel of the genre, therefore it feels unfair to give a bad review. Would've given it a ""meh"" if given the choice. What I know is not common of the genre these days is my one-time purchase lifetime experience. That alone is refreshing. I am also still a huge fan of Elder Scrolls and its worldbuilding and lore and, as such, I do feel lovingly catered to regardless. Some great content in here. I'd recommend people play, but only for the selfish reason of probably needing more people to play it with."
Positive,"this game is amazing, its awesome, its one of the best games I have ever played. its also a pile of dog crap. its stupid, its horrible and I hate it. and i would know, i only have like 23,000 hours into it. which is very little when you think about it. I totally haven't wasted away my life playing this amazingly horrible game. im totally not sucked in, forced into this wonderful divine hell called elder scrolls online. and by that I mean HELP! SEND HELP! I'M IN A CONSTANT STATE OF AGONY AND BLISS! ITS HORRIBLE! ITS WONDERFUL! GOD I HATE IT BUT I FUCKING LOVE IT TOO! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAanyways 10/10 best game ever."
Positive,wow wolf mount is awesome! now I can finally play the game :3
Positive,"Just got this game recently and still plays really good for being an ""older"" game."
Positive,"Best game I've ever played, even beats out Skyrim for the top spot. Very much recommended!"
Positive,Do you like scrolls? Then elder scrolls.
Positive,"Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood daily missions teach you to improvise and find different approaches to solve problems, which is quite useful in real life where a way cannot eliminate a trouble that another can. I used to plan ahead and think planning was the key to successes in missions. But improvisation is another way to complete them flexibly. People who like stealth, assassination, and theft should play this game because it tells you more what you can do as a thief or an assassin."
Positive,"I met my husband on this game. Initially I was hoping it was a malnourished female partner who i could potentially degrade. I came to find out that I was actually talking to a 500lbs man who is unable to walk. So I wheeled him into my home and there he sits, like an obese piece of furniture. Contributing nothing to the household except his stink.Ebonheart Pact > ADToilet Babies Forever!"
Positive,The definitive PvE sandbox experience.
Positive,Game seems to work.. you can select characters and stuff... never gotten beyond tutorial.. but seems to be a good game..
Positive,The hours say it all :)
Positive,Best MMORPG Game on Steam!
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is an extremely well crafted world of amazing wonders, magic, fantasy, adventures, & exploration! Very addicting in a wonderful way!!! The amount of content to do is massive even before any downloaded DLC additional content, world expansions! I'm only 10 hours in, & I can say with a smile on my face that I am 100% in this world for the long haul. I'll grab DLC as I go, now off to my next adventure!Beyond highly recommended on sale, or not! Everyone should experience this world!!!Get Elder Scrolls Online today, & join the fun! XD"
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online is a friendly online game for all ages(of course not for 8 and under). You can explore all around tamrial and enter dungeons with friends and other players, you can also solo them by yourself.You can also enjoy playing pvp in cyrodiil and entering battlegroungs to fight against other players. I really love playing this game, you could get hooked within the first few hours, my dad allowed me to play it one day and I got hooked, he created my own account and now I look forward to the weekends thanx to this amazing game."
Positive,"I really recommend ESO as a person who hates MMO'S. To be clear, ESO does have MMO elements, but it feels more like an elder scrolls game, than an MMO. I'll try to clarify: You still get quests such as ""fetch quests"" but they aren't surface level quests, neither do they fee like simple fetch quests. This is because of a few reasons:The first is, all quests are grounded in some kind of story that is voiced and has been written with a larger story in mind. I have not found one quest that took me a few minutes to complete, instead, ESO seems to have quests within a larger quest line that tells a larger story than one expects at first. The second reason, is that these smaller parts of this larger story, are not simply: go kill 10 bandits. Instead, it would be something like: obtain a necklace in order to climb up the ranks of an organization, to kill the head of said organization. (just an example, no quest I have done, does this specifically). Then, to get this necklace, you would have to obtain the information of where this necklace is held, go into a dungeon, cave, mind etc, find the necklace, take it back to the person who contracted you, give your findings, and then start the final small section of the larger quest.) A questline can take an hour or even more to fully complete.In short...ESO uses quests to tell stories. What helps this even further, is none of the characters feel unbelievable, or boring to talk to. Every NPC that I have found in quests, really are interesting, and I want to know more about them and their story.Another really great thing about ESO (that all Elder scrolls games have)  is the worlds are really, really interesting, and almost every sight of something in the distance, makes you want to continue exploring. You can explore for hours on end, and never get bored. I think the only part of the quests that is a bit disappointing is that there aren't really any dialogue choices that you can pick, other than the default one, unless a really, really important decision comes up, but even then, there are only two choices usually. So...choice wise, you can't really flesh out your character that much, the quests will be done as the game wants you to do them (99% of the time) with the last choice usually being a good or bad option (however, thankfully, the game does not really make them seem just evil or good, and they really do effect the characters in the world that were in the story) To me, the Elder scrolls is about story, immersion, a great world and memorable characters. ESO nails all of these. So, if you are a solo player like me, really only wanting to do stories, meeting characters and exploring the world, ESO is 100% worth it."
Positive,"[Full Disclosure Zenimax Sent me a copy of Blackwood, but I had already purchased the game and all prior expansions through Zenimax's website]If you are expecting Skyrim Online you might be disappointed, But don't let that scare you away.The Elder Scrolls Online Is easily the most Solo, Casual, and New Person friendly MMORPG I have ever played, In all the best ways. With thousands of hours of story content, Gear that stays relevant forever! It's very hard not to recommend.Especially after they removed some of the older faction restrictions, and now allow you to go anywhere in the world you want, It is a great choice.ESO provides a GREAT MMO that has the feeling of a classic Elder Scrolls Adventure!"
Positive,"Played a bit, it's alright..."
Positive,badhiya game hai
Positive,I mean... I've played over 5k hours... it's good.
Positive,This is the first MMORPG I have played and i love it! Both playing in a group and solo is great and there's endless hours of content and personalisation possibilities
Positive,"kill bugs, gib loot"
Positive,playing for 4 year still love it - new content always around the corner. Great community
Positive,Good game for a good price
Positive,one of the top 3 mmos i've ever played
Positive,"Gonna cry me a river? Go ahead, maybe you can float out of Craglorn.."
Positive,"An amazing mmo, set in the elder scrolls universe, and this is probably the only way the elder scrolls could have been an mmo. It's a really enjoyable game, and can be enjoyed for the story part alone. Takes a while getting into, but there is a lot of good guides on youtube, i recommend Lucky Ghost."
Positive,"The game is surprisingly interesting and dynamic, both by playing with friends and by one. I'm considering buying a game!"
Positive,"I gave this game negative review long ago because it wasn't good. Now it's amazing.Great game. Just need more classes though. I want a real warrior experience man, I can't whirlwind in this game."
Positive,Game is amazing!
Positive,"Игра конечно клёвая, но деньги доит просто нещадно. Хорошо что я её получил на халяву, в таком виде это практически лучшая ММОРПГ из существующих."
Positive,"Very nice game for an mmo rpg, the story is enjoyable, combat not fancy, but simple in a way mixed a lot of diversity, though lacks in the fun department at times. Game is great if you have a 4 man group of friends to fill every roll and just grind out the game together and if you have the computer, the graphics look pretty top tier especially in the newer stuff."
Positive,"One of the best - if not the actual best MMORPG games out there IMO. There are no pay-to-win things, almost everything is absolutely farm / grind based. And don't get me wrong, farming and / or grinding in this game is the most satisfying and pleasant experience. The graphics are amazing, the stories are good, most of them are amazing (Clockwork City is my favorite). The amount of content is INSANE, you will never run out of things to do, and I think this is the only ""CON"" I can think of - ironically, because it can be overwhelming. I stopped playing this game 2-3 times just because I actually didn't know what to do first and wanted to do all, but nonetheless always came back to playing it again and again.IRL Cash system - Crowns: the Crowns system is absolutely fair: you wanna look cool? you wanna have some nice companions (that do nothing, just follow you and look nice), amazing mounts (that are not superior to the actual first mount you get for free at level 10 - they just look awesome), then you can do that with Crowns (real cash). Also, Crowns are the base currency for buying ESO+ or other DLC's. ESO+ is very much worth it not only because you get access to the crafting bag (stores all your crafting materials - infinite amount - and not filling up your inventory), but also because you get access to ALL DLC'S except the very last one. And that crafting bag is not even game breaking, it's not a must have item to be able to progress. Overall, I think ESO+ is a great way of playing ANYWHERE YOU WANT (except last expansion's area) and it's really worth your money if you want access to an insane amount of content. If you don't want to get ESO+, you can still have an outstanding amount of content that you'll need thousands of hours to complete.I totally recommend this game to every Elder Scrolls fan out there, who is up for some amazingly fun and unforgettable adventures. Community is friendly, willing to help, there are role-playing guilds, trading guilds etc. Just give it a shot and you won't be disappointed."
Positive,"I've waited 550 hours to write some kinda review hoping by then I could come up with something good.... I can't. Truth is... This is probably the best MMORPG out there. I've played well over 100 of them in my time including the big ones. ESO somehow manages to make all the stuff that normally ruins MMORPGs... fun, Or... Just doable. I've never gotten a sense of drag or boredom in this game even doing dungeon runs 200+ times for 1 set piece you still don't get, Somehow... isn't boring or tedious. And I've chalked it all down to it being just a case of.... Good gameplay. Something nearly all MMORPGs get wrong. ESO does it all right, I mean I literally have no complaints. Except maybe server quality. Being in AUS we kinda get the rough end ping wise. 300+ isn't uncommon. But, It's playable. 10/10 Just try it."
Positive,Yeah I had a quick go at it nothing too crazy.  It was fun for a while.
Positive,"the game is cool, but it sucks if you don't have friends to play with, but you can handle it yourself/"
Positive,this game has an amazing open world.
Positive,10/10 - Would smash Molag Bal again.
Positive,"If you love Skyrim but you want to play with your friends, you're out of luck for now but this is close. It looks good, plays smoothly and is very little pay to win (there are crown experience scrolls you can buy to level up faster but, they also kinda hand those out like candy). Most things in the shops are cosmetics, pets and mounts."
Positive,"At this point ESO is a really well rounded game. Great story content, great dungeons, and the little pvp I have played has been good. The classes and builds are awesome and I really really enjoy the combat. I'll update this after greymoor comes out with the new changes!"
Positive,"Great MMORPG for a long hours of play. Just have in mind, that if you like immersion in quests - be sure to teleport to standard faction start location after starting games with DLC's. Game automatically starts in newest DLC you possese and assumes that you already know NPC characters from previous chapters. I think its better to make things chronologically. :)"
Positive,If you like the Elder Scrolls games there's atleast an 80% you'll like this unless you're not into mmorpgs. Very calming and easy gameplay to just relax and play when you have downtime. Highly recommend giving it a chance! :]
Positive,If you are a big Elder scrolls fan then this game is for you.
Positive,im noob and im happy
Positive,"I've dabbled in this game a bit - I must say, I'm still constantly learning new things, and enjoying the game thoroughly.Maybe one of these days I'll actually play through the story to learn what actually happens."
Positive,I enjoy the story telling the most but the graphics is great!  I can't stop playing!  I really like this game!!!
Positive,"I like it, nice lore, nice environments, kept me attached for 3-4 years now, probably gonna have a lot more"
Positive,"Oh man,,, i got hooked up in the elder scroll series from the TES III Morrowind, and seeing Vvardenfell here in TES Online sure brings back a lot of memories. it's a 8/10 for me, although I did bought it from steam sale and i havent join the premium member, yet. All is well and it's a decent game."
Positive,"To the people who are planning to buy this game:I was planning to buy the game on a sale event. But I thought I'd regret it. But I bought it. And I don't regret it. Even if I didn't play Skyrim or any elder scrolls game before. If you want to buy it, and if you like the game, just buy it. I did the same. And I'm enjoying the game.Edit: I used to play the game like crazy, until some time. You just realize it is getting boring and repetitive. My opinion after 165h."
Positive,"I have been a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls games since the very early days of its fourth installation - Oblivion. This game is absolutely amazing. While it was not produced directly by Bethesda Game Studios, its made by their owner company, ZeniMax Online. There are quite a few inconsistencies towards the original lore of the elder scrolls universe, and the grouping of this game could be improved upon. Therefore, I do understand the negative opinions shown towards this game by several people. However, the characters, the places, the quests, and the music (OH MY GHAD - THE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC) are so overwhelmingly good in this game that I can only love every bit of it!"
Positive,"im sure if you are a big fan of the elder scrolls lore and stuff like that then if you get this you will be captivated for days on end, its not as time consuming as most mmorpgs and doesnt require hours of grinding to get anything cool, its all pretty much there for you and you can still do alot without even having to pay for anything (though you will probably see what they have in the store and you will probably buy it)"
Positive,i'm a simple man. i see a pay to lose section then i buy a stick horse and a pet rock for 15 bucks. i regret nothing.
Positive,"It's grindy, lore friendly, and fun."
Positive,"Highly detailed, immersive game play.. lots of customization and the fighting styles are unique. Everyone is sweet and it's a generally very welcoming environment. I love this game!"
Positive,Yeah the games pretty cool
Positive,Elder Scrolls + MMO = Epicness
Positive,"kill dragon kill deamon, create dracula castle. party with friends."
Positive,"Easy to get into unlike other large MMORPG titles such as World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV, the only downside I've seen so far is the fact that half the quests are you running around and delivering letters to everybody and their mother as ""quests"". Like, literally half the fucking quests.This game does a fantastic job in including new players, whether it being people new to this game in particular or MMORPGs in general and you really need to give the game props for that."
Positive,"It's okay. I have played many more hours on the Official Launcher, but same consensus. The game doesn't do any one thing better than any one game, but it does them all acceptably. In all reality, this game was an attempt to get in on the cash flow of MMOs and Microtransactions, with the latter being not-so-great in selection. Any store out as long as this one should be packed with aesthetics and/or community created content. Just as well, the costs should bottom out an affordable rate where, while the game is next to nothing, after $50-60 you should have everything you would be happy with for at least the first 60 hours of gameplay. Releasing $15+ cosmetics or even horses is inexcusable, even when first released into the store.TL:DROverpriced store, okay at everything else (as a whole).65/100"
Positive,"The best MMO on the market right now.TESO came a long way, was practically re-launched twice, but managed to become a very good game. If you are choosing an MMO to sink your time into - you must at least try TESO. Thousands of WoW sinking ship refugees call it their home now.Pros:- lots of various content, both solo and group- story and voice acting are very good, all dialogues voiced- handles TES lore with love and care- combat is dynamic and has good learning curve (easy to learn, hard to master)- pve is accessible, while highend is (very) challenging- pvp is in good shape- crafting is valuable and needed- customisation options are great- additional mechanics that diversify gameplay like justice, sneak, lockpicking, stealth killsCons:- will take a lot of time to get to high end content - beside regular 50 character levels, there is over 800 account-wide champion levels, and you need at least 300 to participate in higher content. Is MMO requiring time really a con?- many quests are pretty generic - kill, gather, escort. Good story smoothes it out though, so not much of a cone, either.- subscription is addictive, especially if you want to play DLCs, craft and hoard, but not requiered"
Positive,"Despite not being the Elder Scrolls game that I had hoped for, I really enjoy this MMO. The community is top notch and there is always someone willing to give a helping hand. Compared to other MMOs that I have played the ESO community is remarkably wholesome."
Positive,"Still dont know, but mb nice game."
Positive,no it is not :((( i like it actually when i knew how to play it XD
Positive,Love this Game!
Positive,Perfect mix of skyrim and a mmo
Positive,"dont buy for full price, buy it when it goes on sale. i bought it for morrowind expansion, to relive my childhood. really fun. not worth 70 bucks tho."
Positive,"I bought this game out of curiosity. I read some other reviews online which stated that ESO was not worth it at all. However, I have to say after almost only 3 months of playing it, I've grown to love this game. I can see how people may not enjoy it as much as Skyrim or any other Elder Scrolls games, but it has to be one of the best MMOs I have ever played. I'm thinking about purchasing an ESO plus membership to access even more content. All in all, I would definitely 100% recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the world of The Elder Scrolls."
Positive,"Despite the mixed reviews, I personally really enjoy this game. The NPCs are fully voiced, the quests are interesting and not the usual ''Get 10 this or that'' kind which is absolutely fantastic, and the community is friendly and helpful. The game can be easily played solo, which is awesome when you're not feeling social. My only problem is I got stuck in a quest for one of my characters (Level 5 so it wasn't really problem) which I couldn't get out of or progress in, and sometimes I get logged out for no reason, but it's really rare for me. I give this game a solid 8/10."
Positive,"Firstly - this might be a turnoff for diehard Elder Scrolls fans. It's certainly not the same single player open sandbox experience.For action MMO fans it might be totally different - you get fun pve, very bursty pvp, several build options for each role of each class. While there are cookie cutter aspects you must follow to fully use a class's/role's potential, you can personalize around it.Graphics are gorgeous if you use Reshade or ENB, which really add depth. The default graphic fidelity is not that great, although the models and areas are well built and there is a lot of immersive detail put into dungeons, to the point you don't see in most MMOs.Performance is a lot better than a few years ago, but still not stable. The engine is just that bad. Some customization through settings files is recommended to get fps to a stable-ish level. Even then there will be drops of 20-40 fps drops at times, for no apparent reason.Overall I love the game. Tanking and healing are well done, although tanking might seem very frustrating to pick up as first, as there is threat mechanic familiar from other mmo-s, it's more or less random and crowd control is the key outside single target taunts. Also tanks and healers are the ones providing most of the utility in the group, so there's always a lot more to do than just play straight into your main role. Good dps is godsend though. When they pump out awesome damage and don't stand in fire to boot, no death hardmode speedruns become just that much easier. Tanks and healers being pigeonholed into wearing almost only dps boost sets can be turnoff, though.This brings us to the community. It's really hit and miss. You have nice people, you have helpful people, you have silent people. Then you have the a-holes who queue as dps and healer although they are built for tanking/tanky pvp/healing and then you have two tanks or healers in group and one bossfight takes as long as the whole dungeon should. WoW implemented gear/spec checks to combat that, but there's none in place here, so you either have to deal with it or initiate a kick and hope it goes through and you get a proper replacement. Running with 3 dps and a healer or tank is usually a better option for dungeons..PvP is an abysmal burstfest where procs and set bonuses get you more kills when the stars align than active skill use. Sadly some of the skills you need to get for pve are accessible only by reaching a certain Alliance Rank, so you need to spam pvp for at least a bit, depending on what you need exactly.Crafting is pretty ok. It doesn't take long to reach 50 on a crafting skill line, but it will take ages to be able to craft all traits and whatnot.In game stores are pretty abysmal. Yes, they are immersive, but if you are after a certain piece, you need to use a online marketplace website outside of the game, where people send information through addons. You need to find out which guild merchant in which area is selling what you need..I'd recommend to try it on a friend's account and see if there's anything that's your cup of tea in the game. If not, it's too much of an investment since you need a bunch of DLCs or subscription to access all the content. Disconnects still happen once in a blue moon, but have almost totally disappeared for me. If you've thought about returning, I'd at least give it a go."
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online is your average mmo. It’s a game I play while listening and discovering new music and listening to podcasts or videos in general. The thing that made me want to try it out over all the other mmo’s out there is it's set in the elder scrolls universe so I already know a lot about the world and even some of the gameplay mechanics going into it from having played morrowind, oblivion and skyrim. It’s a very chill game to play, it doesn’t do anything to make it stand out or makes me want to pay full attention to it which is why I think it’s average. If you like the elder scrolls in general i think it's worth trying out because it pretty much has something from every elder scrolls game like all of the iconic races, the city of daggerfall, the morrowind expansion where you visit an updated looking morrowind, the ayleid ruins from oblivion and the deadric lords and gameplay mechanics from skyrim. 5/10 (Average)"
Positive,This is a chill game fun give it a try
Positive,I like it :p
Positive,Pretty good game if you have people to play with
Positive,This game fun.Game Good.Love Game
Positive,"For those who played Skyrim, i highly recommend to play this as well. In truth i do not play it 24/7 but i do play it to relax, to listen to story line and enjoy the content it provides."
Positive,This game is great!It's a MMORPG but with the style of The Elder Scrolls.I like it don't have so much options like skyrim but it's very good to play with friends.8.123456789/10
Positive,"There is a variety of content both in the adventure and player-versus-player modes. I think the framework is there, but there are some painful missteps that are holding it back. MMOs are a constantly evolving ecospace, so it’s possible we’ll get there, but for now I’ll cautiously say…maybe."
Positive,"Dragons? In your own homeland? One of the best MMOs out there. Abundant stream of content, excellent level scaling.I just pray the devs work on updating the animations (esp. movement and combat) as they are starting to look really old and janky. ALSO please add the option to switch classes."
Positive,"Okay so this didn't run amazing on my pc so I got it for Ps4 and I have played so so much more through it.I have been playing WoW for ten years, this is the only other MMO that has grabbed my attention, and thats mostly with me playing it as a single player game with other people running around. The PVP is great fun, the dungeons are average while the guilds are usually pretty fun, the community is also a friendlier place (after years of WoW tarde chat being poison its a refreshing change). Now I've seen many reviews say it is like other Elder Scrolls games and many say that it really isn't. I personally play it often as a big ass Elder Scrolls game, I personally find it to have many similiar things to Skyrim and Oblivion. This game is also only a buy to play, while that ispretty true, all the dlc and the new 'chapter' (expansion basically) have to be bought. The DLC is free if you pay for a sub though, as well as many other bonuses, however, you can buy them all individually. I honestly would suggest all to try the game. But thats just my view/opinion from playing and enjoying it."
Positive,"Absolutely love this game! Hours of fun! You can definitely live here as there is always so much to do in the game, theres single player dungeouns and group dungeons, main quests, sidequests, vampire/werewolf quests, as well as dolmens, crafting, housing, furniture building, etc and a bunch of fun to be had! I recommend it if you enjoy adventure games!"
Positive,it should be free to play
Positive,its ok i guess
Positive,"I've heard very bad things about the state this game has launched in years ago,but I'm simply a fan of the Elder Scrolls series so I picked it up on sale and I coulnd't be more satisfied.You get a huge open world with many regions of Tamriel that we didn't get to see in any singleplayer game yet and it's very well made,looks really pretty with the exception of some rather blurry textures that sting the eyes if you walk directly into them.Most importantly though it feels and plays exactly like you would expect an Elder Scrolls game to play with every feature the single player game's have except modding of course.Perhaps the only negatives I can bring up about this game is the extreme lack of inventory space if you pick up crafting materials and don't have the eso-plus membership-exclusive crafting bag,which is a pretty big bummer until you get enough gold to increase your bank and inventory space.Also,the pricing for cosmetics in the crown store can be downright ridiculous.But even so,if you're looking for the biggest explorable and playble version of Tamriel,you got it.9/10 do recommend."
Positive,"Hello future Tamriel heroes,I have bought this game recently and absolutely love it! The story is great and there are lots of options and ways to play together with your friends (especially now that level does not matter so much anymore).In my 200-something hours that I have played this I have not touched all the content yet and have not been bored once! The DLC's are very fun as well as they give you extra skill trees and awesome cutscenes (especially the assassins guild :P).However, I would NOT buy this game via Steam though but as a single client. Pretty often when they do an update of the accounts etc it seems to go wrong with the users for the steam client (like right now its been over 24h and while I am paying for it my ESO+ has been disabled). Don't let that discourage you from buying the game though! Just keep in mind this is not Skyrim or any of the Elder Scrolls games, so dont compare it with that :) Enjoy the journey and every aspect this game has to offer and you are good to go :)"
Positive,"Definitely one of the best MMOs on the market. You can be a hardcore MMO player OR a complete casual player and you'll still like this game. It has something for everyone. Interesting storylines and a lot of quests for roleplayers, difficult end game content(dungeons&raids) for hardcore pve players (vMA made me want to kill myself the first time I did it..), open world AND instance based pvp areas for hardcore pvp players. This game has it all. Buy it. You're gonna like it.Also, the game is constantly getting new DLCs and expansions so it's always fresh and there's always something new and exciting to do."
Positive,ok look give this game a moment of your time again to all the people who were let down the lauch it's a very very enjoyable game now!
Positive,"Best MMO I have ever played. Great fun with friends.7,7/10"
Positive,One Tamriel was definitely a huge improvement a number of game systems and general quality of life stuff. The end game PvP is pretty great if you are willing top buy the DLC dungeons and it handles addons well. I would recommend it as long as you have friends to play with.
Positive,"This game is no longer the game that got awful reviews when it was released. It may or may not have deserved them then, but it surely doesn't now. As someone who played in the original closed betas, the game has progressed an extreme amount, and I would consider it one of the best MMO's currently online. The biggest change for the better in my opinion was the One Tamriel update, which was just recently released. The update removed leveling (sort of) and opened all three faction areas to all players regardless of their alliance. You can now create a character and go anywhere on the map, fight any monster, and party with any players, and the game will be individually scaled to each person. If you want to play this game with friends, there are virtually no restrictions. Other than that, crafting is good, combat is good, leveling is good, community is good.I really don't have any problems with the game as it stands currently."
Positive,"I am a huge fan of Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2. However, this is another excellent MMO that I can't stop playing. I compare all of my MMO experiences with Guild Wars 2 and this is on par or even a little bit better. Especially since the Dark Brotherhood DLC was released; now I can kill people willy-nilly. So satisfying."
Positive,I wasn't expecting anything out of this game but i was pleasntly surprised :)
Positive,As addictive as Weed. 10/10
Positive,"I picked this game up when it was at the end of it's Beta run and into launch. But there were many things I didn't like about it at the time--mainly because most of the MMO's I've played over the years have been similar to EQ/WoW's setup where you target and cycle through abilities to attack in a specific rotation. This was different and it didn't sit well with my playstyle. Because of this I went to play other games.I picked up the new remastered Skyrim about a week back and started really enjoying playing again. It had been quite a while since I played the first release of Skyrim and found myself wanting more. I picked up the free weekend and played for a few hours, and then a few more...before I realized it I had to head to work and had got no sleep...needless to say, I bought the gold edition while it was still half off and haven't looked back.If you're a fan of the TES series, then this may take some getting used to. The controls are different from Skyrim and some things you simply can't do that you can in Skyrim. Some are good where your horse can't die from a super long jump (but you can) amongst other things that I can't think of at the moment. If you're like me and you're tired of the same rinse and repeat from other games like WoW, Wildstar, SWTOR, and others, then this is a nice refreshing change of pace. It's not really a complete Elder Scrolls MMO, but it's really close, and that's what counts."
Positive,"I don't know who the Night mother Is, but she pays me to kill people. I wish my own mother loved me so…"
Positive,"this is NOT an elder scrolls game, it is a MMO RPG set in the world of Tamriel. Keep that mindset and this game will be amazing. The game is a vast landscape with tons of content and places to explore."
Positive,"I like this game.  It's kind of a mix of Skyrim with a bit of WoW mixed in, and the storyline and gameplay are quite nice.  I like the fact that there's no monthly subscription, and that you don't have to necessarily play the Auction House (there is none, although there are Guilds for crafting and trading) to make enough money to play.The free weekend's been fun for me and I'm going to buy at least the $10 regular game at least.  The 60gb download wasn't fun, and neither was the 200gb Install (best argument for keeping a regular 1TB or larger HDD or SSHD around I've seen in a while, even if you have an SSD boot drive) but since I have broadband and a big 1TB hard drive (it's an SSHD rather than a plain spinner-only) it wasn't SO bad for me, as I had other things to play while waiting.I like how the combat is real time and action based (similar to Skyrim) and how you can sneak and steal and pick locks and whatnot if that's your thing.  Magic, melee, archery and hybrids of all these playstyles are available so you can play your own way.  Plus, there's a lot of story and lore to immerse yourself in, or even skip if you don't want it.  If you like RPG's, especially RPG's with lots of variety and exploration and action-oriented combat, this game may be for you, particularly if you like story."
Positive,"If you are expecting something exactly like the jewel that is Skyrim, you may be disappointed. However, if you are looking for a MMORPG like WOW or SWTOR but better (most say) set in the elder scrolls world this is the game for you. It is fairly immersive, with a good story and relatable characters. Just to give you a feel for the speed at which you can expect to level, I have put 27.3 hours nto the game and am level 12. If you have friends or acquaintences that you can play with I would recommend it. It makes questing much easier. One thing I particularly like is the lack of lots of microtransactions. EA should take a note from this for SWTOR."
Positive,"My only recommendation is DO NOT LAUNCH THE GAME FROM STEAM.The launcher tends to crash or fail if you do so quite a bit, just start from the launcher itself."
Positive,Best MMO ever!
Positive,"+ Good graphics+ Interesting storyline+ Very wide variety to play as+ Regular updating+ Great combat mechanic+ Excellent game for group of friends to progress- Game-play repeats itself- Ebonheart's ""Hey! Fancy man!"""
Positive,"Great game, complex characters, nice blend of open world and mmorpg."
Positive,Good strategical game definitly recomend
Positive,best game ever !!
Positive,"I have the beta monkey pet. This game is easy to play, while also giving you lots of different ways to play it, for an mmo. You can play first person and third person, and these systems are done well. You can play with a controller, and that too works well in this mmo setting. The menus and ui are clean and easy to navigate, especially for an mmo. The story is pretty neat, a lot of voice acting that's well done, some kool enemy designs. Quests are generally well written and not annoying to do, even the repeatable ones. Crafting is very big and fairly complex, but not annoyingly so. The character and build customization is probably one of the best I've seen from an mmo, especially combined with how comfortable it feels to play.There is a fair amount of kool stuff tied to things you have to buy, but you kinda expect that from an mmo. Obviously, it could be cheaper, but it's typical for today, and generally fair even.There's companions, and pets, and houses. Plus the rpg system is legit. It's easy to level up most things, and the challenge is fair. The deep grind comes from really understanding what you're working towards, but that's really all about mastery.The only things I can think of that I really dislike is some stuff with dungeons is just bad, and pvp can get, in some cases, imbalanced. Still, there is more good than bad with both of these things. The dungeons themselves are enjoyable, just the group system and the occasional bad mechanic in a level. The group system either makes you wait, or puts pressure on players to really focus on providing that specific role and this causes people to a. play a specific way, b. be neurotic about how others play, c. enables bad players with poor social skills to play blame games. Generally tho, two decent players can make the dungeons pretty easy. There are silly things like in the middle of a boss battle a wave comes over the map and insta kills everything without any real warning. There's a lot of dungeon specific gimmicks that are tedious like that, some that are good, some that are both. Teleporting mazes, grapple hooks, and the lame stuff like random enemy level attacks that one hit.The PVP, very specifically the dueling, is just... you basically need to be kinda specifically built to duel, otherwise a battle can be basically a stalemate... or just take a half hour till someone simply gets physically tired of running their patterns. It can also really under power some players due to the, uh, level leveling between players. That said, I love the open battlefield between alliances, the large scale pvp. You can be a stealth character, you can be a general, you can team up, you can do a big battle, or you can engage with small forces. I just really like how it's done."
Positive,"Why the Elder Scrolls Online MMO is the Perfect Game for Those Who Hate MMOs:I am a Tomb Raider explorer, Mass Effect galaxy vagabond, and Witcher monster hunter type gamer. I love stories. I love rememberable characters, both on and off the PC. I have tried several MMO's, and have enjoyed very few of them past 10 hours of gameplay and usually quit soon after from boredom. More so, I hate subscriptions. I hate the very concept. If I buy a game, I should own it.So it was a great surprise to fall completely in love with Elder Scrolls Online (Tamreil Unlimited). Is it Skyrim Online? No, it is 10 x Skyrims. Maybe more? With nearly 50 hours under my belt, I have barely scratch the surface of the true shear enormity of the game. Each Alliance starts out at a different part of Tamriel (the game's world), with very different story quests, and unique characters. So even if you make a Nord and a Redguard, you will get a completely new experience with each character.The controls are vastly different from Skyrim. Perhaps the consol  versions will be more similar to the previous games, but for the PC you map 5 powers on the number line and a ""Nova"" power with the Q key. Performing sneak, pickpocket, and lock picking are all still available in game. Characters are allowed to sell up to 50 items to a fence a day (upgrading the limit is available through the skill tree). Unlike the previous Elder Scrolls, you choose a class at character creation. Each class is quite versatile and has access to all the armors, weapons, crafting, and magical staffs. Just because you choose a Templar, doesn't mean you have to play the group's main healer. You can be a Dragon Knight who sneaks around and snipes enemies from above, raining down a fiery destruction, or a Nightblade who charges headfirst into battle with heavy armor and a giant axe, invisible one moment and cleaving enemies in two the next. The choice is yours. Though some classes are obviously built better for certain styles of combat then others. One of ESO's greatest strengths is the ever changing world. If you save a king, each time you go back to that city you hear NPCs call out to as that hero. If you remove the curse of a ghostly army, the army becomes peaceful and the gloom lifts. On the other hand, It can be a little strange if you have completed a quest that changed the area and some in your group hasn't. They may start attacking peaceful spirits or pouring potions on a seemingly dull rock. For the most part this doesn't diminish the atmosphere.One of the biggest bonuses for me in ESO, is the ability to play it solo if I want. I have never had to join, or felt like I needed to, a group in order to beat a quest. In fact, the shear ability to do the whole thing solo makes helping random other players all the more purposeful. If all you want game with big groups however, ESO has the Alliance War function. The best part of this PvP  function is that you feel like you haven't left the rest of the game. If you are familiar with Oblivion, you might even see some familiar sites in the unbelievably massive map.With very few bugs and next to no loading time between any area, its a little hard to pin down a poor function of this game. You can even add your own mods from Nexus to the MMO. There is a built in function for player add-ons! The bottom line is: If you want a MMO, get Elder Scrolls Online. If you want an RPG, get Elder Scrolls Online. If you want a good game with memorable NPCs and amazing stories, get Elder Scrolls Online. Despite my effort, I don't enjoy many MMOs, but I love this game. No matter what kind of gamer you are, I'm betting you will too."
Positive,Perfect i like it very much
Positive,"I freaking love the game and go fangirling on chats every chance I get! Hell, I am fangirling now! And to those who might wonder, everything works fine on Windows 10. I usually tend to stay away from games that do not have controller support just because I prefer to sit back and relax while playing, but then this got into my library and pretty much got hooked by the first hour. 40 or so hours into the game I invested in a good Keyboard and mouse, not one iota of regret so far. I also get to explore Tamriel and be a badass murderer/slayer-of-thousands dressed in pink and baby-blue armour."
Positive,"Before I begin let me just make it clear that i have played this game way longer than just five minutes.When I first heard about this game I knew that one day I would get this game. At the time the only system I had was a PS3 but when i heard that it was becoming buy to play I knew, that I had to sell my ps3 and all my games in order to play this game. Anyway's the first thing i did when i set up my brand new computer was to buy it off of steam i downloaded it early in the morning and stayed up all night playing it. I had a laps after my character got to lvl 30 but have just gotten back into the game and i still love it. I know that some people are a bit apprehensive in buying the game because of the problems it had when it first came out, but they have fixed so many of the bugs. But just like any game there might be a few bugs that they missed they are on it though with updates that they pace at a reasonable rate of time.                     Now if you are thinking that this will be kind of like a Skyrim online... Don't, its not meant to be a Skyrim online it is it's own game but the lore is just fantastic!All in all i would say that this is a must get game. 10/10"
Positive,"After reading all the negative comments and reviews over the release of this game from the very start, I now purchased it to see how the game was doing  ( very risky yes ). Anyway, overall I have only played for about 8-10 hours but I can easily say I enjoy the game. Combat is smooth, interesting quests that keep me entertained and of course it is a very pretty game. I am glad I took the chance on this game, definitely would recommend but I do suggest finding a friend ( if you have one that already owns ESO ) to give it a try and see if you even like it, this game isn't for everyone."
Positive,"Experience tell you more than descriptions. The little time I've played in Tamriel, I've experienced so much fun with and without friends, once you step into the Elder Scrolls Universe, you know you've been missing out.This game has elements of the original Elder Scroll games, along with a huge storyline, that is crafted along with your faction that you choose as you create your character. And as you soon level up with or without the help of others, you start to love this game more and more. I've barely played much but I can tell you, I won't stop."
Positive,"One of the best games ever in my opinion. I guess some people didn't find the Elder Scrolls magic in this one, but I was the other way around. I loved Skyrim, but think this one is even more fun to play (as do others within the game). I go back through Skyrim now with a greater appreciation, though. Most of the gripes I had starting out have been resolved. I think some people will still have trouble with the end game being so far away (you have to quest through all three factions first), but with the subscription dropping, you won't find more game for the money. The questing is superior, and there are group dungeons, public dungeons, private dungeons, dolmens (like rifts kinda), mini dolmens, and lots of world bosses. Each zone has a pretty epic finishing quest along with the main story quests and two guild questlines. I've been playing over 500 hours and still haven't seen everything."
Positive,"No subscription required to play, although if you seriously want to do crafting, then you should subscribe, as subscribing gives you various options that help with that. A very deep game with huge amounts of options.Huge amounts of character customization options and builds etc.Looks quite pretty, but need a fairly decent PC to play it at max settings.I only play PvE really and it excels in this.Can't comment on PvP  by experience, but I've heard PvP isn't fantastic.Most monetization are cosmetic as far as I can tell, although you can buy extra chapters and areas, which is fair enough IMO, as you can often get the base game really cheap on a sale and you'll get 100s and 100s of hours play with just the base game.So if you like PvE , defo buy it. If you want to do a lot of crafting, consider that you might have to subscribe if you want to be able to do this easily.If you're into PvP only, this game might not be for you."
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) delivers a captivating MMORPG experience that excels in storytelling without imposing agendas. Set in the expansive world of Tamriel, the game immerses players in rich lore and intricate narratives, whether they're exploring bustling cities, treacherous swamps, or ancient ruins. Quests are more than mere tasks; they're engaging narratives that draw players into the world and empower them as active participants.Unlike some other titles, ESO refrains from heavy-handed modern political messaging or ideological agendas, allowing players to enjoy the experience without feeling preached to. Instead, the game invites exploration of diverse cultures, engagement with complex moral dilemmas, and decision-making that feels as though it shapes the world. In contrast to other MMOs where player satisfaction can be compromised, ESO fosters a welcoming community, with developers who listen to feedback, regularly update content, and prioritize player enjoyment.In conclusion, Elder Scrolls Online offers a narrative-driven MMORPG experience that respects players' autonomy and a team that values their playerbase. With its rich lore, engaging quests, and responsive community, ESO stands out as a compelling choice for both Elder Scrolls fans and MMO enthusiasts seeking a deep, immersive adventure."
Positive,10/10  worth for $10 this is super lit not even lying buy if you want to but this game has evolved since a year ago
Positive,"Okay so I need to temper my normal negativity.  I didn't decide to stick with ESO but it absolutely is worth a look.  The base game and and a chance to see the beautiful world they have made is worth a look for any MMO player.  Its a really impressive game and the leveling experience may be the best of any that I've played.Pros: Massive world, Looks great, tons of lore and quests, open ended approach to leveling,  horizontal gearing progression, diverse end game, casual friendly, large number of dungeons,  level scaling makes it friendly to people with vastly different engagement levels, Super alt friendly (to the point of being alt favoring)Cons: Dailies, FOMO tactics, I felt like their sales tactics were pretty gross in total.I loved the leveling experience.  There was a wealth of content and you can pretty much pick and chose what you where you want to invest your time.  Pretty much everything grants Exp and skills so you can quest, dungeon, pvp, whatever you want to get to level cap.  CP points are a cool way to make having multiple alts all benefit the one account.  I prefer horizontal gearing to treadmill as it will eventually promote variety in gearing rather than a constant progression that negates previous gains.My understanding of end game was that you have a bunch of alts you bang out daily writs and then use those to engage with the real end game, fashion.  In the end I felt the game rewarding daily logging and alts more than progressing my main by doing longer plays on fewer days.  Yes you can ""do whatever you want"" and just ""ignore the stuff you don't want to engage in"" but it favored daily logging and limited time events.  Even in those events it still wanted daily logging.  I love a good grind but i was both time gated and required to log in thus taking away my agency to engage with it on my terms.  Couple that with a pretty gross cash shop I both didn't feel good about paying ZoS, while feeling pressured to play or feel like i was missing out.  So no thanks.I feel like there's plenty of people that will love this game, if you just run around and have fun adventures and don't sweat it too hard its fantastic.  I have too much baggage that just doesn't mesh with this game, so I'll have to move on but I for sure got my money's worth and had a fun time while I was playing."
Positive,"I spent way too many hours playing this game; graphics are great and pretty decent combat mechanics. There are myriads of quests and I kid you not, I'm not even near to finishing them all albeit after 800+hours into it. Dedication and patience are definitely keys to being successful baron in this game, be sure to choose your role and focus on it and to also be sure to explore different combos and plays style to suit the individual. I'd recommend trying to upgrade backpacks as early in the game as possible, it does get pretty in-game gold expensive at late game. You can definitely spend real moolah to get upgrades but you can also not having to spend a cent to be decent players. Players community in the game generally friendly and willing to help you out if you're new, so don't be afraid to ask for help when you need one. You may get the occasional ""Kicked-out"" of public dungeon if you're under levelled to join group PVE, but very very rarely.PVE is so much fun, the only thing I didn't like about it is when you fast travel; it takes awhile to get anywhere. But it could also be the fault of my PC or my network connection. PVP can be brutal if you don't know builds, so be sure to read forums prior to learn mechanics you won't get melted in two seconds by other players. I do recommend checking out Deltia's ESO game guide for builds. I probably read more of build guides from his website than my entire life so far reading books.You can play this game at a slow pace or again, spend real money to speed up your levelling via purchasing in game ""helpers""/subscription to boost players. Not a pay to win, but definitely pay for convenience.Overall: Graphics - 8/10Gameplay - 8/10Soundtrack - 8/10Pay for convenience - 6/10Community/Support - 8/10"
Positive,Wow game is very impressive!!! <3
Positive,"Whilst I don't think this is a very good looking game and seems to be a bit unpolished here and there, its still quite fun to play especially if your a fan of the Elder Scrolls universe. I think it may take me a decent chunk of time to really get into the rhythm of the game as there is a lot of new things to learn but my initial impressions are good. I may update my review in about 10-20 hours of gameplay."
Positive,this game is addicting and fun lol
Positive,"If you wanna play an online version of Skyrim, it's gonna suit you well. Though there are also other provinces of Tamriel, the whole game is basically seems like a TES 5 extention with more Tamriel provinces added."
Positive,This game really makes you FEEL like an Elder Scroll.
Positive,"Love it: MMO with strong single-player content FTW. Excellent as a single player, not bad at all as a multiplayer. Full of lore, full of stuff to do, entire world is accessible without grind."
Positive,I played this game like in 2016 so I will play it again because it was fun.
Positive,"The game is really interesting and has a lot to do in it.The world might feel slightly too huge for new players and they might get lost easily, but I'm sure they can get used to it.Main story is pretty interesting and there is a lot of side quests too."
Positive,"Easily one of the best MMOS in my opinion. Thanks primarily to the gameplay. The combat is like Skyrim's but with MMO powers and abilities. No clicking on an enemy to target it, you have to actually aim most attacks. Sneaking and stealth isn't something you see alot of in MMOS and i'm glad this one has it. The quests aren't your typical boring fetch and kill this many things quests, Though there is some fetching involved. I have yet to come across a kill a certain amount of things quest.  Being a fan of TES lore, this game had me worried, and still does a little bit, but so far its better then expected. I mean, given the prejudice Argonians, Dunmer, and Nords have against eachother, it seems so highly unlikely that they would form an alliance, same with the orcs and bretons, but the game makes an effort of showing the prejudice and tension between races, suggesting alliances were formed out of necessity. Easily the worst part of this game for me, was the download time. It took 19 hours for the game to download from steam, and then the launcher had to download the rest of it, which I don't know how long it was, because it ran waaay off into the night and I didn't bother staying up and waiting for it. Even more annoyingly, I am on the American servers, and I have a friend who plays on the European servers. If I want to change servers to play with my friend, I have to wait through another excruciatingly long download for reasons I cannot comprehend.What I would suggest is to attempt to optimize loading times, if possible completely remove the download necessary to play on a different server, and add a facesculptor to the game.Overall, I give this game a 9/10, I can completely recommend it. To everyone who made this game, I erect the spine of gratitude"
Positive,"Lots of people hate on the game because they don't like the idea that a lot of content is locked behind a subscription, but to be honest, if you get the base game when it's on sale, you can easily sink over 500 hours into the game, leveling 8 characters that you can create by default and enjoying the already vast amount of content you get with the base game alone. The ESO Plus feature is not a necessity to enjoy this game simply because it's a sandbox MMORPG. Get the base edition to start, or perhaps an edition that includes multiple main story chapters, and see if you like it for yourself. You won't be disappointed if you love TES."
Positive,"Graphics are great, theres a good diversity in the builds and class types, and every class can (to a reasonable extent) take on any role. Good solo-play options and activities when you just want to relax, and easy to use group finders for dungeons and trial (raid) runs.Mechanics are friendly enough that my mmo-beginner wife can play and enjoy herself, but allows for skill/experience growth to have higher level competitive pvp or pve groups also. Overall a very well balanced and done game."
Positive,"DISCLAIMER: I love the game itself. The only reason I am giving a thumbs down, is because the system they have in place to download and launch from steam is absolute garbage. It says I have 25 hours in the game, but those are hours spent trying to fix the launcher, downloading patches, ect. I still cannot launch the game as it is. If you're going to buy the game, don't buy it from steam. Buy it from their website. Avoid the headache. Hopefully Zenimax fixes their system.Edit: I'm changing this review to positive because it seems that all the issues I was having with the launcher are resolved. This has become a really great game."
Positive,"Extremely fun game. One of the best Fantasy MMO's ever made probably the best but that's just coming from me. You won't find better quality in a MMO out there, but after all that depends on taste and what you may like.PROS:+ Great Quests+ Great Economy+ Amazing Crafting System+ Good leveling pace+ Great Graphics+ Tons of Character Variety+ Every NPC is voice acted+ Solo and Group content+ Giant Map+ DLC+ Updates and Bug Fixes+ No SubscriptionCONS:- Sometimes quests aren't dense enough in an area- Wood Elves have really wierd accents- Lots of horse riding in Cyrodiil- Half of Aldmeri's quests go like> help us fight this bad guy group> bad guys be like oh wait we're actually the good guys they're liars> nice plot twist, and more with all the dlc addons.Overall I'd say its an 9/10 this is coming from a guy who LOVES The Elder Scrolls Series, I have ESO also on PS5 with all dlc and still love the game 1 of the best MMO imo!**** PLEASE READ If you are having issues with launcher upon install and after you close game and decide to reopen the game, In launcher [popup] I found out where it was looking for the files. Based on my info just do the following if you have this issue:Copy vcredist_x64_2015.exe and vcredist_x86_2015.exefrom Steam\steamapps\common\Zenimax Online\Launcherto Steam\steamapps\common\Zenimax Online** Problem is it was looking for 2015 vcredist files to be up one folder level.* I found my own fix but have been waiting a while for this issue to get fix with a update."
Positive,"this game is perfect for the weekend, 24 hours non stop playin :p4 thumbs up for zos"
Positive,Its a fun RPG if you like a deep lore and story based RPG where most of the content can be done SOLO.
Positive,i love this game so much! >3
Positive,"one of the best mmorpgs i've played, but i don't have many friends that play it, so i haven't spent much time in it. cyrodiil is my fav! <3"
Positive,"If you're a TES fan, but you're not like the BIGGEST mmo fanatic out there, this is a game for you."
Positive,"Don't expect this game to be a multiplayer game of Skyrim! It never was and will never be a Skyrim Multiplayer Game.ESO is the first MMORPG game I've played and all I can say that it definitely gets a thumbs up from me from the dungeons and flexibility of the skills tree.Despite NA being the most saltiest region in the world, ESO has many friendly players that will help you in the game. I have yet to encounter toxic players in the game.Would totally recommend for people who are getting into the MMORPG field."
Positive,"Hey, this is a very good game! This game has many different types of game styles, whether you like manual, PVP, battle, task or decoration. This game is highly recommended by people who like to stay at home and don't like to socialize. You can play a lot of fun, but you can try to find a netizen to be with you. The online content in this game is great; NPC is also very cool. Every NPC has a dubbing performance, and some of them will surprise you. But for novices, when you enter the game, you will feel at a loss, because there is too much content in the game, but only in this way can you experience the value of the game."
Positive,"People not in my group can advance the quests i am doing  for some reason. This turns questing into a bad experience because someone can just rush in to that super secret dungeon the quest sends you to, kill the big bad guy that was supposed to be a challenge before you even get there and make you miss out on dialogue which makes you scratch your head wondering why the fuck you are even there. This is especially disappointing if you enjoy any sort of immersion. Look i get it, it's an mmo other people are going to be there obviously. But why let them advance my quest stages? That is frankly the worst thing i can say about this game at this time. Also the disconnects, the goddamn disconnects! Why so many?If you can get past all that there is so much content in this game you'll play it for months. I have played around 500 hours so far and i am only at summerset. PvP is very hard for beginners as there are a lot of veterans out there. But with time you get better. There is great variety in builds so you can try out a lot. The environments are also varied, some are boring but most look great and have interesting stories. ESO + is a must if you want to do any sort of crafting. It also gives you access to all dlc but you can buy those individually. If you don't plan to play the game for a whole month or do crafting you can skip it and buy the dlcs when you want to play themOverall i recommend this game if you get it on sale"
Positive,What i can say about the game it have lots of Content and lots of things to do the grafic is great and the challanges are sweet hehe i have very soon 2k hours into the game and i still love to play it shure there is some bugs that can frustrate one sometimes but its the raw expeirance of facing challanging enemys and meeting new friends that fight in your group/ small army hehe by all that i am happy to say our devolopers have been  doing a great job and i am exited over the next Blackwood chapter have to offer see you on the either in Overland or on the pvp battlefield ;) take care
Positive,"Solid MMORPG based on the Elder Scrolls universe. Hours and hours of fun (even with just have the base game) with many many options for different play-styles (I love exploring and questing, my gf loves doing dungeons and such).If you're expecting this to be Skyrim Multiplayer, then it's not your game; there are frequent free-to-play weeks so I recommend to first try it for free and then buy it for cheaper. Most of the bad aspects of the game you may've read online (for instance, monthly subscription is no longer requierd) have already been fixed.The game is quite CPU intensive and it takes almost 100GB of disk space (which they also working on reducing)."
Positive,"After all, ESO came a long way and it turned out to be a really good game after all. It has improved a lot after it's terrible launch and even if I had never experienced the launch of the game, I'm happy to play it now active. It is an epic experience and it feels so much like an Elder Scrolls game now. I have so much fun doing my quests and you feel the love the developers put into the game, honestly. I couldn't be happier in an MMO as I am now. And I come frome WoW. Here, in this game you are very busy and you even have fun to be it.  I would recommended for any MMO player and any Elder Scrolls fan. Much love and always support. <3"
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is a great MMO, probably one of the best on the market right now, but its not as good of an Elder Scrolls game as many fans had hoped. I have played on and off since early testing and I have to say, targeted to MMO fans ESO is a great experience, PvE or PvP, I find it has something to everyone. Compared to other Elder Scrolls games though, and it is lacking, the problem is not that its bad at being an ES game, its just that it was not meant to be the next Elder Scrolls installment. This is the Elder Scrolls you should play if you are looking for an MMO experience. I quite enjoy the game and recommend you give it a try if you are interested."
Positive,"God, I should have gotten this game earlier! I'm a fan of every Elder Scrolls game and if you liked Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim, you definitely need this one in your collection. You won't be disappointed!"
Positive,this is literally the greatest game ever made
Positive,I played for 69 hours. Nice.
Positive,Still one of the best MMORPG!!
Positive,If you love elder scrolls lore just buy it. The places in the game are amazing. Exploring tamriel is just a wonderful feeling.
Positive,"This game has got me playing it non-stop. the PVE/PVP combat system is very customizable and one of the most fun I've experienced in a very long time. Will definitively teach you about resource management. Voice acting is pretty good, storylines are pretty good, world is beautiful and immersive. To be honest, for the price I could not find a significant downside other than you have to pay a few extra bucks for some DLC, which imo is pretty worth it, stacking hours upon hours of gameplay, 11/10 it's a masta peece"
Positive,"I purchased this game after a bout of mediocre and hollow MMO experiences with Guild Wars 2 and Wildstar and wasn't let down. I admit I'm not the biggest Elder Scrolls lore fan but I have been playing them since Morrowind and unlike many others; Consider ESO superior to my time in Skyrim (Gasp! I Know!). ESO is the perfect MMO for people with solo and introverted tendencies (Oxymoron, sure but it's true for us hermits.) The voice acting is pretty high end but there is a small pool of skilled voice actors and actresses that cover many NPCs. I rather enjoy this game and will provide a short pros and cons list.Pros:*Voice Acted*Beautiful Visuals + Decently Optimized*Massive Open World*Mounts*Easy Crafting Profession Leveling*Ability To Actively Join Up To Five Guilds*No More Sub FeesCons:*Mounts Are Expensive And Many Are Cash Shop DLC*Questing is 90% Fetching Generics*PvP Is Overly Clusterbucky*Chat System Is Terrible*No Auction House In 2015*Dungeons Are Pretty DullOverall A great MMO experience, just not for everyone."
Positive,"I LOVE IT SO FAR, i am a daily WOW player, and damn. this game is cool. i'm playing a breton templar healer. and fuDge. haven't ever enjoyed healer in my life. but here i am. having fun lol."
Positive,Josh said this game is good
Positive,I love all the quests and loot to gather in this game! It keeps me busy for hours!
Positive,"A strong MMO that looks and plays better than any other I've tried.  Graphics are unbelievable, and combat is slick and engaging.  PvP is a struggle at times, but very rewarding.  The leveling of this MMO is fairly quick, max level is obtainable quite easily, but the game holds replay value by providing entirely different experiences with new characters you make, through the faction system.  The game is best with a group of friends, as the true challenges of ESO are found in 12-man trials, and 4-man dungeons, of which there are many, each with replayability.  There is little to no pay to win, only pay to convenience, as the PvP ends up balanced out by various factors, and all purchases are either leveling/crafting speed enhancement, (which I would not recommend, as rushing to the end, particularly on your first character, ruins much of the fun) or cosmetic (where there is a world of options).The quests are more complicated than the typical fetch quests of Bethesda's single player juggernauts, and more engaging than the brain-dead quests of other MMOs.  Every character, large and small is superbly voice-acted, and feels unique.  There is a decent amount of unique enemies as well, in particular most boss fights differ greatly from the last.  The storylines blend combat, stealth, and diplomatic options very nicely.  These mechanics in game are well-implemented, for the most part.  The stealth system borrows heavily from that of the single-player ES games, but quests where it is implemented often take place in public areas, where numerous unimportant NPCs will run around and ruin any immersion you gained from considering yourself a master thief/assassin/etc.  The justice system, however, is unforgiving, but fair.  All in all, I would recommend this game over any other MMO I have played.  For many people, such as myself, the grind itself is not enough motivation, and ESO's engaging stories, intense battles, and stunning graphics made the grind itself... an actual game.   Give it a try.Edit (Feb 2019) : Note on DLC/Expansions: Went back over my reviews realized i didn't really mention the DLC at all.  You can easily play to max level without any DLC whatsoever, and have a lot of fun.  There's enough content in a third of the vanilla game to last a full level 1 - 50/160 playthrough, and enough in the whole vanilla game to easily hit max champion points without it ever feeling stale.  The DLC offers some very enjoyable/creative zones, well out of the norm, but the real reason for getting the DLC is that it contains the most challenging and most diverse content in the game in its dungeons and trials.  These raids are pretty tough at max difficulty across the board, but can also be played on normal difficulty, and offer more interesting mechanics, locales, and npcs than most vanilla raids.  I would in particular recommend:-  Murkmire, a zone DLC with a 4-person trial-  Orsinium, a very-detailed zone with a notorious solo arena and great quests-  Thieves' guild DLC, a smaller zone/quest DLC with a great 12-person trial that is considered by most to be one of the toughest raids in ESO-  Horns of the Reach/Shadows of the Hist are smaller DLCs that do not add any zones to the game, but have a pair of high-difficulty, very fun dungeons apiece.  One of those can be fun to have. ** Note: If you get one month of ESO Plus for 15$ (US), it gives you enough crowns to buy one of the smaller DLCs, in addition to giving access to all DLCs for that month (plus other benefits)  If you are ever unsure what DLC you should get, try getting Plus for a month to try them out, and see which one you enjoy the most, then use the crowns it gives to buy it. When it comes to the expansions, Morrowind and Summerset, both are phenomenal, and give enough content to practically fully level a new character on their own.  Each has a trial attached with high difficulty, late game options, and an engaging story.  Summerset, in particular, is such a great experience/zone that I would recommend getting it as soon as you play the vanilla game and decide you like it."
Positive,"When Elder Scrolls Online was preparing to launch, and during it's launch, I was skeptical. I never got it, but my friends got it day 1, and played the beta. They were disappointed into oblivion, it wasn't what they were expecting. 2 years later, it was on sale, and I had money to blow.    So I picked this up for 10.00$ initially (No DLC, and I did play quite a bit of the free weekend before purchasing it). It changed monumentally from initial release, I immediately bought it for my friends, and I got the first 4 DLC's (Gold edition) half off. It was more than worth it, and I'm going to play it for a long time to come.  Just to cover some of my more favorite changes:     Level scaling: used to do it like World of Warcraft, where areas decided levels; however, they put a scaling system that affects everything.     Subscription fees: Completely removed. No longer do you have to pay for a sub to play the game. You buy it, and it's yours to play.          Beyond just the changes, they do a good job with lore as well. Just like in Skyrim, there are books everywhere, with tons of story to them. You have all your races, along with the fact that you can basically go anywhere in the game, that's in the lore (excepting some of the places, but I'am almost certain they are going to add everything, and some of the most noted places are there anyway). There's really only one important thing to note: Don't go into this game, when you get it, as it being Skyrim. It is not online Skyrim. This is the elder scrolls online, and MMORPG. That means things like combat, and stats have change a fair bit. Other than that, I recommend the hell outta' this game. It's one of few games that can keep me up till 7:00 AM on a school night."
Positive,This was a great game i recommend to anyone who loves RPG's or MMO's
Positive,i love it
Positive,I find this game entertaining as a game and do not believe it should be compared to other elder scrolls games
Positive,IDK i like girls
Positive,Great game. Not pay to win. The whole Tamriel Experience. Buy on sales that occur often.
Positive,Dungeon finder still broken...10/10 IGN
Positive,"Great story, nice gameplay, a tad bit repetitive with the character looks(escpecially on females), I can play this for hours.MAC USERS BE WARNED: DID NOT DOWNLOAD ON STEAM, HAD TO TRANSFER TO THE WEBSITE AND DOWNLOAD FROM THERE. I'd reccomend buying it on main website rather than here if you do use Macintosh."
Positive,"Honestly, an incredibly underrated MMO. Any fan of The Elder Scrolls, Home-Building, or Open World exploration would love this. Has the least generic quests (even at low levels) out of any other MMO in existence. Every single NPC is voice acted which is a huge plus for me as I don't like constantly reading giant walls of text.Only downside is the cash shop. It's not pay to win - you can't buy anything that makes you more powerful than other players, however, there is literally dozens and dozens of DLC that you're probably gonna end up wanting to buy if you get into the game. Theoretically, you could get them all for free, as you get store currency every so often via daily login rewards... but it would take so damn long to unlock even one of the DLCs that you'll probably just end up spending money anyway."

Positive,"If you were expecting Skyrim online you will be dissapointed. Its a good game if you like semi-open world exploration and is a great time waster. The skills can be a little confusing and you may just wander off into an area were the difficulty is 2x your characters level. This brings me to the second subject: Grinding, you will want to grind levels because the XP earned from sidequests is not enough to boost you into the next level,only problem is it takes forever. Story is pretty generic and the voices are recycled. I love the personalities of Nords and Khajit, hilarious. Its worth it.P.S. The Tamriel Unlimited update was what the game needed,Played the Beta: Got bored and didn't buyTamriel Unlimited: Infinitely betterGreat game, 9.3/10"

Here are the pros and cons of the game.-Massive game world full of adventure and culture-Meaningful and mostly exciting quests-Hundreds of memorable characters-Simple yet powerful character creation-Detailed crafting systems involivng styles, levelled crafting, traits, etc-Engaging combat consisting of a combination of skyrim's ""Hack n' Slash"" combat, WoW's hotbar ability styled combat, and a little bit of rolling to dodge attacks-Massive player made guilds with banks, guild merchants, and more-Player based economy for trading and guild merchants-Intelligent AI that can detect when they are outnumbered, cooperate with other NPCs, etc-Skyrim style skill-based levelling-Armor dyes that can be gained as rewards for completing achievements-Intricate PvP based in Cyrodil with forts, seige weapons, missions, etc-Players can become the Emperor based on the war in Cyrodil-Free-form classes that can use any kind of weapon or armor (For example, a sorcerer using a battleaxe)-The world basically levels with you, as to alleviate the ned for grinding-Hundreds of lore books scattered throughout the world to be added to your ""Lore Library""-Great dungeons filled with powerful enemies and unique loot-Many teamwork based possabilities in the form of ""synergies""-Great voice acting-Player emotes and animations-Mounts and pets-Dynamic weather and time cycle-Decent graphics-Polished UI and menus-Hours upon hours of content including lots of late-game content-Incredible framerate (compared to Skyrim)-World events like ""Daedric Anchors""-One of the best final boss battles in modern video games-A ""phasing"" system that changes certain areas of the world for certain players after they do certain quests in those areas to provide the feeling that you are actually making a difference-Epic backround music along with bards that play their own songs-Continous flow of new content and patches-""Crown Store"" filled with asthetic and conveniance items (Nothing overpowered)-Slightly buggy (mostly hilarious visual bugs)-Short ""MMO Style"" agro ranges for enemies (Kinda needed in most areas)-Very few mounts and pets you can get normally in game-No way to easily communicate during combat-Player-made guilds are account-based, not character-based-People can easily (and accidentally) steal your kills, and in doing so, steal your loot and experience-People aren't honorable in PvP, causing the fun and challenging character builds to be useless, stupid, and suicidal in PvP. Prepare for a painful amount of ganking in Cyrodil.-Lack of sweetrolls (Couldn't think of anything else)-1v1 dueling between members of the same faction (They added it!)-Player housing where players can either purchase upgrades or build it themselves (possibly using racial styles?) (They added it!)-The ability to lock your guild to certain factions (For example, a guild is locked to the Ebonheart Pact, so a charcter in the Aldmeri Dominion doesn't have access to that guild)-More mounts and pets that can be aquired normally through questing-The function to go through a certain instance ALONE-Some sort of ""Voice to Text"" system-More sweetrolls (MORE OF THEM)"
Positive,"I recommend this game but you must have a decent pc to be playable.I managed somehow to play it on medium settings 1080p (only textures were medium).I ran it with 2 ddr2 ram, gt 610, amd athlon x2 240So you should have at least 4 gigs of ram. Otherwise you'll be getting a lot of stuttering.And for the gpu you'll need gtx 750 ti or something equivalent. And the cpu I would go with i5-3470 or 4460. And if you are on a budget you should go with the g4560 pentium, like I did. (All these parts I said were mentioned for maximum settings 1080p gameplay)."
Positive,"I always liked MMORPG games but two things always held me back from sticking with them. One was not being able to play as you want having to stick to a certain amount of builds or choosing certain classes. The other was being forced to play with others if you wanted to progress. With ESO you have many choices to play as you want and be what you want having many build choices at your finger tips as well. Also if you get burnt out playing with others you can merely go on your own to do your thing without any regrets. With Blackwood coming this choice will be even more viable with having a companion to travel with that will fight or heal by your side. The choices in this game are almost unlimited from solo builds, to one bar builds for those that may have health or dexterity issues. I know MMOs are meant to be played with others but for some to be able to have both options to do so is a god send. Some may want to play with others but not all the time. Some may just want to have others around to talk to every now and then but want to just go on and do what they want. Or some just don't want the drama that sometimes can come with being to social as they may be an introvert in real life. No matter what way you want to play ESO has you covered. I cannot stress enough how many options this game has and wish I tried it many years ago. I can see myself playing this game for many years to come."
Positive,"WARNING!!! This review contains information that could be construed as a spoiler!!!Background:I've played ESO Tamriel for about 500 hours with the ESO Premium monthly subscription.Pros:* Is it worth the money? Yes, absolutely.*The micro-transactions? I like them because you can't buy OP weapons, skills or mounts to ride. You can buy more storage to haul and bank. You can buy new side-worlds. You can buy things that make playing more convenient. * The world? Good production values in voice actors -- especially the Main Story's actors are top-notch. The non-Main actors are good on average.* The Main Story line is very satisfying (there are Cons about this later)* The crafting and trading is interesting and helps rank up your player.* PVE is satisfying. * Multi-player is satisfying. I played with an experienced player as a guide.* Side quests are satisfying. Good stories with good acting that are sometimes comical and other times tragic -- if not, at times, horrific. Cons: SPOILER ALERT!!!!* Perhaps I'm naive, but the Main Story should have had resulted in a changed world that I have come to expect from other completed side quests. Instead, once you kill Molag Bal, and the cut scenes are done (and they are satisfying, by the way) you essentially exit into an *unchanged* world where Molag Bal still is a threat. It is either that, or get recast as a new soul into a different faction, to begin your quest over again, but at a higher challenge level.  You don't get that ""ticker tape parade"" you expected. To me, this was a great disappointment, made all the more so as earlier, there was a side quest where your victory had consequences and changed the world by working with Argonians to free trapped souls caused the gloom of Davon's watch to be replaced by sunshine and plant growing. I stopped playing the game after achieving the goal of the Main Story for this reason.* Training up and tutorials: They leave out a ton of stuff you need to know to avoid rage-quitting at the beginning. I had an experienced player guide me through those stages, until I could become self-sustaining. * The Main Story you are forced to go through in Solo Mode rather than be able to have your friends join you.*PVP: This is just me, but you do get a chance to fight other players in Cyrodil. As a mostly solo player it is an exercise in frustration because, by the very nature of the design,  you will frequently encounter vastly higher-level players who will make short shrift of you. Some, I'm sure, will enjoy that kind of punishing game -- I don't. * The ethical choices you make didn't have a global impact to the degree I hoped for. They, at times, did change a locale, but not the whole game world. I understand that could be difficult to program.* Having completed a locale-changing side-quest made multi-player difficult if another player hadn't played through that side-quest. For example, my evacuating Bleak Rock, when my friend hadn't yet, prevented us from playing together.Still, I found the game well worth spending 500 hours and $150 on, as it was like a good novel with whichI could interact and affect the plot outcome to a minor degree."
Positive,One of the best MMORPG's nowdays.
Positive,"Pretty good MMO, tried it in beta and didnt like it. played it in the free weekend recently and liked it and bought it."
Positive,elder scrolls but mmo and it good
Positive,The best game of the year
Positive,"A lot of people didn't like it because they were excepting Skyrim Multiplayer, but it is an MMO!I LOVE IT!I ♥ ESO!"
Positive,dead kinda but then not kinda
Positive,"This game surprised me. I first played it back in 2014 and almost immediately didn't like it. I think I was one of those players who wanted a Skyrim like experience and this game does not really fulfill that. There were a lot of issues with the mega servers and connections and the dungeon system. If you look at the negative reviews most of them are unhelpful as they are short and vague or super outdated or have to do with technical issues not being able to run the game. The game does take up a lot of space (massive amounts of content) and it can be intense to run, I will give them that. But if your computer is technically up for it, it's hard to come up with a good reason to not play based on the game's merit.I came back to the game after the One Tamriel update. It was a new game. I won't go into all of the details but they changed everything, for the better. You can adventure all over with your friends no matter what your level or faction. The quests aren't just stupid and grindy, they have interesting stories and some variations on the things you do. The crafting system is involved enough to be a meaningful addition to the game without being so complex that it's difficulty creates a barrier to entry. The voice acting is still superb. New content seems to be on a steady release pattern, with events and stuff in between. I am 550 hours into the game and still unlocking new things and having new adventures. Housing system is fun and gives a lot of options for decorating. You can quickly play through the main storylines and have an Elder Scroll style adventure to hold you over until ES6 (whenever that may be) or, if you're like me, this could be your new digital home. When I hear the calm music right after logging in, I instantly feel at ease. I've put the game down for a couple months at a time to focus on other games or things in life but when I come back it really does feel like being back in your digital fantasy world. You get to know Tamriel and the characters and the whole experience is really excellent. The combat is fun and action oriented and so you're not just standing around clicking skills like in many MMOs, although it isn't as visceral as something like BDO or a single player action game. There are dungeons, world bosses, an entire zone with dedicated group content, PVP, raids, basically something for everyone. The game is not perfect, and if you break down the features of this game you'll probably find specific MMOs that do it better but when you look at what they have created overall as an entire game it's truly amazing. One thing that impressed me is that I was part of a survey/focus group for the game and essentially every piece of feedback I gave them is something they have fixed/changed/improved upon since then. Not that I'm in any way important to them, but the fact that they listened to their community says good things about the direction they are going in."
Positive,Great fun to explore the world of Nirn and the Oblivion realms
Positive,Have played for over 1500 hours on pc and another 900 on xbox and i can say i have had a lot of fun playing this game and continue to even after playing it so much i always find more things to do
Positive,i dont have a life
Positive,its really fun mmo the mini map sux and it needs to be played with friends
Positive,"A really nice game to play after having experienced skyrim, morrowwind, and oblivion. Not to forget it is really immersive and would recommend this game to anyone who loves open world, first or third person and super epic alliance war."
Positive,"After 80 hours of gameplay i can highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys MMO's or loves the elder scrolls IP.I played through the whole base game and the Necrom DLC in my game time, I got my character to CP level 200 through mostly chilled gameplay like story,base game and dungeons.The only thing I can complain about is once you hit CP 160 thats end game as far as your gear score is concerned, you can't level your gear past 160 which I think is a big complaint from most of the community as you aren't really grinding for gear past 160 just certain gear sets with certain perks and traits you would want for your character build.I will be playing more as I want to play the other DLC's but it can be discouraging knowing my gear score won't be getting much better than what I have already.For the price of the game and for the ESO plus subscription it is definetly worth your time if your into this type of game."
Positive,"I played FF14 for 500 hours and it never clicked. When I played this it immediately connected and I really didn't play much Skyrim either. I played Morrowind back in the day ANYWAYS this game lets you FULLY customize your character. There are classes but they are just a few specials moves. You can make a class ignoring those and focus on all sorts of other stuff too. The class choices are great.I didn't play Skyrim but the interface here from that game is easy and intuitive.Really considering all the classes and achievements and level systems and pets and more, this game is a steal at it's current price."
Positive,"This game's stories teach me to live smarter..Unpredictable,impressive stories.MMORPG usually lets me do quest like chore.Elder Scrolls Online is good at telling me WHY I should do the quest or not.Good rpg games give me purposes throughout the game.I like this game."

Positive,"i would recommend The Elder Scrolls because this very overwhelming fun. Because I can killing Monster, Animals, i can earned armors, dagger, and something like that. So Stay Hunted And Killed"
Positive,great game to kill time on though it really relies on the craft bag as crafting materials take a lot of inventory space and bank space but still recommend it :)
Positive,I bought this game 3 days ago and I've played almost 45 hours. I'm addicted now.
Positive,great game one of the best mmorpg's i ever played
Positive,MREEEEEEOW MREEEEEEEEEEEEEOW - Pheesh when she's doing some hard hits 2021
Positive,4 günde 58 saat oynadım.başka yorum yapmıyorum.
Positive,"I love the ability to be able to explore the Elder Scrolls universe with my girlfriend while halfway across the world. I find the constantly expanding content, massive game size and excellent PvP options to make this game one which I think will be relevant and deeply enjoyable for many years to come."

Positive,"Lots of fun and great quests, lots of lore and stories to get lost in. Easily a game you can play a few hours a week and just enjoy questing by yourself, and then try and join in on world bosses etc. throughout the world with other players. Haven't gone much into the multiplayer as I haven't really needed to, been enjoying doing the quests and completing the map areas by myself. Pricing can be a bit crazy at time and the whole idea of the material inventory. Inventory management is really tough if you don't spend time looking into the different materials, armors, weapons etc. But for a casual MMORPG player who doesn't have hours and hours to play and dive into a game and just wants to hop on a few hours a week, do some quests and join in on a world boss or two, totally worth it when the game is on sale for."
Positive,Bad game for bad people
Positive,Delete Summerset and kill all elves.
Positive,10/10 dari anak seni
Positive,Lots of hot altmer boys 10/10
Positive,hi  nice
Positive,I need more eso friends to play with
Positive,"Says it for itself. My current hours while leaving this review are 93... all of which are in the last two weeks. Am i done with the game? Hell nahThere is endless amounts of fun, recent reviews have been getting worse due to the comments about the ""toxic community"". However there are more players in the game than just the ones that use steam. Distance yourself from the toxic players and stick with Elder Scrolls OGs. I recommend this game 100%"
Positive,"I honestly love this game. This game has brought me hours upon hours of fun, and I have made tons of friends during my time playing it. If you are a fan of The Elder Scrolls series, there is a lot of lore to be learned through this game. If you are a fan of MMO's, you'll definitely like the gameplay of this one. If you are used to fast paced MMO gameplay, this may be a little slow for you, but I'm sure the change of pace may actually be nice for you. The world and ability to explore the entirety of Tamriel is amazing and breathtaking in this installment. I can honestly give this four thumbs up if I had the extra hands."
Positive,"I was never a big fan of MMOs but i sure am a fan of the Elder Scrolls Universe so i couldn't pass by on this game.I have purchased the game when it switched to B2P model and i don't regret it. The devs put a lof of heart to the content delivered to the player the game can be played as a single player experience if you just want to quest and you won't be bothered by the mmo mechanics but there is so much to do for vets who reach the end game as well. Talking from a perspective of a guy who clocked 1000+ h in skyrim 300 in oblivion with mods so content wise you won't be disappointed. But obviously not everything can be considered as a honey experience in this title so the cons would be the servers that need some work regarding latency also the infamous bug that is occuring with weapon swap is still present basically when you switch the weapons there is a chance that your weapon will appear not in the hands of the character but on the ground beneath him hopefully the devs will fix this:Pros:- Quest and overland content- Community- Crafting and mats farming- End game content such as Trials for PvE and PvP Cyrodiil campaign with Imperial City PvP- Play how you want(mostly) each race and class can be either a viable tank, healer or dd if you want optimized builds you need to refer to guides and races that you want to play- Thieves guild and The Dark Brotherhood questilines- A lot of dungeons to play through- Game Addons on PC ohhh boy you really can't go playing without them a lot of them support trading damage indication and general UI overhaul with minimap which is essential in this game Cons:- Servers could be better- Infamous weapon on the ground bug when weapon swapping might occur you can fix it by reloading to another cell or instance"
Positive,"I have been a huge fan of The Elder Scrolls all the way back to Morrowind.  I can say without a doubt that you should give this a go. There is a ton of stuff to do and the areas all feel as if they have a reason to exist. Some MMOs I have played kind of feel like `wallop.. desert area.. ooh snow area.. look a forest` whereas in ESO it feels more like an actual living and breathing environment.The combat feels nice and solid and so far I haven't had any disconnection issues. There is some minor lag in heavily populated cities, which is shame and something I wish would be fixed.In short if you are a ES fan or just love a good MMO then this is one you should definitely add to your list :)"
Positive,"Without a doubt, this is one of the best themepark MMOs on the market right now. The base game alone gives you tons of content, and the optional monthly sub makes it easy to give the DLC a shot without having to invest a ton up front. Despite being built on an aging engine, the game still looks quite gorgeous and runs well. The combat feels ""floaty"" (for lack of a better term) but is still enjoyable. The quests are some of the most meaningful in the genre and are all fully voice acted. The level scaling helps take you away from the grind to endgame that most MMOs tend to push for and instead lets the emphasis fall on the journey itself.If you want multiplayer Skyrim, this is not what you're looking for. If you want a good, polished MMO set in the Elder Scrolls universe, ESO has a lot to offer."
Positive,"Actually I recommended this game is for gameplay, just buy the other one, Gold Edition,.your money is worth if you spend on that one, Tamriel Unlimited is lesser DLC than Gold Edition, even Tamriel Unlimited have cost a bit money than Gold Edition, but TRUST ME, buy the other one.Overall gameplay is out 10/10+ display graphics+ costumize things+ build your own storyline+ endless quest+ etc- buy CROWNS for additonal customizeIf you have enough Minimum Specification Requirement PC or Laptop, I'm 10/10 recommended you play this MMORPG game. but remember, buy the Gold Edition, it's like a Tamriel Unlimited + 4 DLC.Thank me later.."
Positive,not bad ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Positive,It's nice to play it from time to time I guess
Positive,This game has been amazing for me. Getting back into elder scrolls with it.
Positive,"One of the best mmorpg's rn. With over 9 million players, this game can go far."
Positive,menu navigation is absolutely cancerous and autisticgame's fun but if you're a support class you absolutely need others because spending 10 minutes tapping left click and running in circles only to walk up some stairs and come back to a full hp boss is absolutely unforgivable designuninstanced dungeons create an environment of extremely aggressive respawns where trying to run out of a dungeon means you re-acquaint yourself with every enemy on the way$10 is worth and $20 is too because it's big
Positive,Loving this game. Coming from wow this game has a refreshing pace.The pvp is easy to get into. Crafting and gear is also a totally awesome to play around with.Get ready for a massive download but it's well worth it. Running as admin gave me a large cut in loading times.
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited plays very much like a Elder Scrolls game (with friends!).You can play as you want with a large amount of solo and group activities, though as with previous Elder Scrolls games, you'll find that not all builds are equally good for all content. There are a lot of customization options that let you tweak your build to be how you feel comfortable playing, as well as many players dedicated to finding the best builds and gear for your chosen role.ESO's base game contains both PVE and PVP options. For PVE, there are the 3 faction story lines, 2 guilds, and the Main Quest (Though as is tradition for Elder Scrolls games, you can ignore the main quest entirely, you shirkers of destiny!) This makes for a lot of content across over 15 zones. For group PVE, there are 4-man dungeons and 12-man trials of Normal and Veteran difficulty. In PVP, you can enter the base game zone of Cyrodiil and fight for your faction. designed for groups of 8-24 players, Cyrodiil also supports everything from solo players and small groups to zergs. Be aware that PVP has a big learning curve, but its very rewarding to master.ESO has a lot of DLC that add very good content to the game. Imperial City is PVP/PVE oriented with a very underrated main questline. Dark Brotherhood adds a much needed stealth kill mechanic to the game. Thieves Guild improves the justice system and Orsinium has a rich zone with in-depth questing. Other DLCs add 4 new dungeons to the game.Just as previous Elder Scrolls games required players to look past the bugs and annoying parts (Cliffracers and repetitive Obvion gates, anyone?), ESO is not without its bugs, loading screens, and annoying parts of gameplay. It still has a lot of charm, well-told stories, and excitement for players who can deal with the issues, just as Skyrim, Oblivion, and Morrowind do.Unlike single-player Elder Scrolls games, ESO is still in the process of evolving. Several major updates hve greatly changed the way the game plays on a fundamental level. One Tamriel removed level-locked zones and opened up the entire map for exploration. The chapter Morrowind's base game update changed the way combat works. Future updates will undoubtedly continue to change the game further.In conclusion, ESO is a good choice for players looking for an Elder Scrolls game and willing to play an MMO. Its not a single-player Elder Scrolls game, nor an amazing MMO, but its provided me and my friends many enjoyable hours playing in Tamriel."
Positive,"A very immersive MMO. Great elder scrolls lore and the game is popular right now, not to mention morrowind dlc expansion coming soon,"
Positive,"Great game with many hours of gameplay, would recommend to others."
Positive,"played it now and then since release, it's a fun game."
Positive,"It's very enjoyable both solo and in groups, easy to make friends when there is a guild recruiting and if you like elder scrolls lore its a cozy place to explore."
Positive,Over 3/4ths of my hours are spent downloading GG.
Positive,"Well, that was a good surprise for me. I hadn't played TESO since the close beta years ago. The game is way more enjoyable now. Too bad you need to purchase I don't now how many DLC packs to access to the entire game. The vibes from Skyrim are surely there tho, combat, lore and even little details such as ingredients and well the environment. Probably one of the best MMORPGs for soloing out there."
Positive,"+Great quests (different endings in many quests depending on your choices+fully voiced)+very good combat for an MMORPG+skill trees, morphing of skills gives a huge variety of different builds+helpful community+beautiful zones+not subscription based-had some connection problems were i could not play the game for weeks, now that we can play through steam it's been fixed -crown system is kind of annoying (that said, even after buying all dlc's and some cosmetics you wouldnt spend near as much money as on some other mmo's)-/+some lore problems (it supposedly was needed for better gameplay and there's a theory that eso ""happenings"" can be still canon because of a thing called ""dragon breaks"")I definitely  recommend this game it's become so much more since release."
Positive,"I know I've only played like 19 hours on the PC version, I have way more hours on PS4.PROS:-Beautiful Designed World-Night/Day Cycle-Weather-Mass Amount Of Quests-Microtransactions Are Mainly Cosmetic-Good Combat System (NOT TURNED BASED)-Amazing Soundtrack-NOT PAY TO WIN-First And Third Person View-PVP Is Fun-NO PAID SUBSCRIPTIONCONS:-Character Creator Isn't The Best-Few BugsI'll give it a 9/10Best MMO I've played ^_^"
Positive,prepare yourself to spend some money on dlc
Positive,This game is epic! best game ever!
Positive,i mean its pretty good i guess
Positive,"It sure looks like I've only played this game for about 8.5 hours but that is only because it only counts the hours you spend on it if you open it through your Steam library.The story behind this game is definitely one of the main reasons I got this game, and why I love it. The characters all have unique personalities in both the main storyline and side quests. As you progress, you will need to complete side quests to earn xp and other loot. Some involve fighting monsters in dungeons and they don't get old after a while because each dungeon and side quest has it's own characters and storyline. Some side quests also involve retrieving something for somebody, or completing some simple task, but like the dungeons, they all have their own characters and unique task to complete.The overall performance in ESO is great. I have an average gaming laptop that I play the game on and I'm able to run the game fairly well. My friend has a better gaming desktop and he is able to run the game at max settings no problem. However I have found that it seems to be easier to run the game in third person rather than first, because first person feels a little bit choppier.ESO, from a gameplay aspect is a wonderful game. You can choose from 9 races, and one more, Imperial, if you choose to spend the extra $20 for Imperial Edition, like me. Each race has their own pros and cons, so some are better for different classes. You can choose from four different classes when you start the game, Dragonknight, Templar, Nightblade, and Sorcerer. I've only played Dragonknight and have only started at Nightblade. The combat system is great, because the five skills that you can choose from and change freely throughout the game and the blocking and bashing parts of it prevent the game from becoming a repetitive firstperson point and click adventure.The thing that makes ESO different than any other Elder Scrolls game is the fact that it's multiplayer. You can complete side quests, fight monsters, and explore the world of Tamriel with a friend, as long as both of you have a reliable internet connection. As I mentioned before, I have two characters, an Imperial Dragonknight and a Redguard Nightblade. The Imperial, I only play on multiplayer with my friend. The Redguard, I made to play solo, when said friend isn't around.ESO is an amazing and beautiful game, that I recommend to anyone that has a beating heart and a working brain."
Positive,"Became a fan of series from Morrowind, played through all DLC in 3rd scrolls, briefly played through Oblivion, was astounded by Skyrim, and now this... One of the few games, that makes me play this game, even till 3 AM, even if tomorrow is a working day, even on lunch breaks. Even dragged my director to this game :))10 Skoomas out of 10."
Positive,"Honestly ESO has the most helpful players in all MMOs and a really friendly community, I love this game"
Positive,"I participated in the eso beta and was very dissapointed. After the subscription service was removed I decided to give this a go, and I'm pleasantly surprised. The game plays and feels like an Elder Scrolls game. However, it is an mmo so you're not going to just get Skyrim online like many people want. Despite that, I highly recommend this game. I've tried a lot of mmo's but I feel this one tops them all.ESO: It doesn't suck anymore."
Positive,"having an absolute blast with this game! Love all of my favourite lore from previous games like skyrim and oblivion, mixed with the new multiplayer gameplay! My friend and I have been progressing through the game together and we're having a blast! definitely recommend :)"
Positive,It's good game.'nuf said
Positive,All the never-ending adventure of the Elder Scrolls series. God damn.
Positive,"I dont usualy like MMO's but this one is different, and actually fun."
Positive,"My favorite MMORPG at the time of this review. You can customize the colours of outfits to add a personal touch, and experiment with a fun crafting system. The Elder Scrolls lore is weaved into the game nicely. If you like playing as a Khajiit, I feel they look better here than in any other game."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) set in the fictional world of Tamriel, which is known for its vast open-world exploration and rich lore. As of my last update in September 2021, I can provide an overview of the game and some common sentiments players have expressed.Pros of The Elder Scrolls Online:Expansive World: ESO offers a huge and detailed world to explore, with various regions inspired by different parts of the Elder Scrolls universe. The game's environments are diverse and visually appealing.Engaging Storylines: Each faction and region in ESO has its own main story questline, along with numerous side quests that immerse players in the lore and history of Tamriel.Customization Options: The game allows for a great deal of character customization, from race and class choices to different skill lines that offer various playstyles and roles.Regular Updates and Expansions: ESO receives frequent updates, including new content, expansions, and events, which help keep the game fresh and exciting for long-term players.Multiplayer Experience: Playing with friends can be a lot of fun, especially when tackling challenging content together. Group dungeons, trials, and PvP battles offer engaging cooperative and competitive experiences.Cons of The Elder Scrolls Online:Solo Play Difficulty: Some players have found that certain parts of the game, especially group dungeons or tougher solo content, can be challenging when playing alone, particularly if you're not adequately geared or experienced.Combat System: While ESO's combat is action-based and provides more freedom compared to traditional MMOs, some players find it lacking in fluidity or depth when compared to other action RPGs.Loot and Reward System: At times, the loot and reward system in ESO has been criticized for its reliance on RNG (random number generation) mechanics, leading to frustrations with getting desirable items.Performance Issues: In the past, ESO has faced some performance and server stability issues, leading to occasional lag or disconnection problems.It's important to note that player experiences can vary widely based on personal preferences, playstyle, and the updates or changes made to the game since my last knowledge update in 2021. The inclusion of friends can enhance the enjoyment of any multiplayer game, but ESO may require some patience and adaptation for solo players looking to tackle certain content.Ultimately, if you enjoy the Elder Scrolls universe and prefer a multiplayer experience, The Elder Scrolls Online could be a great game to try, especially if you have friends to join you on your adventures. However, if you mainly prefer solo play and want a more traditional Elder Scrolls experience, the game might not fully meet your expectations in that regard."
Positive,"Hey Guys! I have played many MMOs in my time but honestly this is somthing different.1. I see that people are calling this game your typical MMO and in the interest of fairness I would like to agree and disagree with that comment. Yes I know why it could be you typical MMO due to harsh reallity that everything is hard to get stright off. But calling this game a goldsink isn't fair either, Just like every MMO to get a aid to help you quest you are going to need to put some effort, 17.500g (For a horse) isn't that much when you start questing propualy and you can easily get a horse before you hit level 30. I don't No Life this game, but im still able to have fun with being a low level.2. The game has got a nice story line (I'm not even big fan of the TES series but i still enjoy the story line) and also this game on max settings looks much better than any other MMO's I have played. I would like to point out that most MMOs follow the World of Warcraft kinda feel, what i mean is that you have a big ability bar with lots of abilitys that you need to use in order to get good at the game (Personal oppinion).3. You don't have to be a high level in order to have fun in this game, What i mean is when you are playing WOW all you do is rush to level 90 (Just using wow as an example) to have fun, sure you can stay at level 70 and become a twink but to fully understand the game you need to reach level 90 before you get to experience the full game.I hope that you find this small review helpful. Just remeber that this is MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION and I am not a hater of wow in fact i accutaly play wow and enjoy it very much. <3Also sorry for any grammer or spelling mistaskes i have made im not the best at english :/Thanks for taking into consideration.Sorry if i have missed any points that you were looking for im sure that you are able to find more helpful comments down below."
Positive,"What I wrote to steam: The Game wont let us in. It needs a Code. Game Says go the The  E S O Site get a account.But we cant give them the Code to get a properly working account. because we bought the game on steam. and Not over on E S O' site.  So Who is going to give us the code?  Steam; If you are selling it please contact E S O and work something out with them. We are not getting a code after buying this game. people are not happy..They have paid and can not play.I have wrote the (E S O)  support too. They tell us look in the Trash mail, we do. it not there either. ~ Steam E S O Please try to do something. Thank you.   Got a code mailed to me Yay! From E S O .>>>><<<<<Well I am still working getting into the game. I have gotten as far as the  Character menu. It does not yet save the Character. Sigh. Looks like I need to still Down load something. It is all very confusing.   lol  But it looks like fun if you manage to get it working. . I suppose."
Positive,"My first Elder Scrolls game was Oblivion, I was about 13 when that first came out. I didn't know anything about it, tried it once put it away and hadn't tried it again for a few months but once I actually gave it a shot I put 500 hours into it on XBOX. Then I bought the PC version and put another 500 hours into it. Then came Skyrim which of course I loved and just recently bought Skyrim Remastered to get back to it. Now I remember when ESO first came and I played it, my first thought was this was going to be Skyrim/Oblivion as a MMORPG, but that is not the case and went 6 years without playing it. I saw it on sale 2 months ago and decided that I would give it another shot. I am glad that I did because I really love this game. I cancelled my WoW Sub to get ESO Plus and have already put over 100 hours into the game. If you played this back in the day and did not enjoy it, I suggest giving it another shot because it is fantastic."
Positive,"Played this game during the beta and it was horrific. Now that it has had some time to grow, I'll admit it changed my opinion. It may not play like WoW, but that is part of its charm! In-depth story with recurring characters and interwoven plot lines. Controller support could use some love, but you're golden with mouse and keyboard. Certainly going to be sinking a great many more hours into this title"
Positive,"PVP is so so bad from Indonesia to the point it is broken. Playing with ping 400 in EU server without , paying $6.5 to Exit Lag only to have ping slightly lower (250). It's probably im a fan of the lore so i'm still playing. If you're an asian player. don't play PVP. It's bad for you Psychology and confidence. You won't kill anything with 400 more ping"
Positive,"Nobody will read my review, so I'll just say I'm gay."
Positive,better than cyberpunk
Positive,"The lore and quests just keep getting better and better, I love the story they're trying to tell but the combat can get a bit boring after a bit."
Positive,Game is super fun ESPECIALLY with friends!
Positive,"Beautiful diverse environments, lots of freedom in char customization and playstyle, a rich and interesting universe.Fun alone or with friends, if you are an Elder Scrolls lorebeard or a member of House Casu-el.Its cheap enough, just pick it up and go for a strut!"
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is (now) a very good MMORPG.I didn't like the game at the time of its release, when I tried the Beta in 2014, but now that the game is B2P, with many improvements, a lot of content and that the subscription is no longer mandatory, the game is really worth it especially if you are looking for a new story-rich MMO to play in solo.The map is HUGE and keeps getting bigger with the new expansions, there are thousands of quests to do at any time thanks to the level scaling system (now democratized in other MMOs, but of which it was a precursor)."
Positive,"Elder scrolls online is a game that wont let you sleep , its an addiction , hard to let go, hard to get bored of. so much to do in this game and every part of it is an endless fun, its a game that will let u come back every single morning just to keep playing more and more  and hating the moment where you dont want to log off but u have to , its something  that makes you think about it  all the time on what you youll do the next morning....i have never seen a game that will make you count the hours just to log in again.....its the best mmorpg ever"
Positive,"played it for a bit, seems cool."
Positive,Played it during beta - didn't like it.Bought it on Steam sale two years ago - didn't like it.Gave it another shot in 2019 - I like it.
Positive,"The graphics are kinda wishy washy, but I enjoy the many customizations you can do to your character :)"
Positive,"I have always been a fan of the Elder Scrolls from the first time I played arena. On my little clunky 386 with EGA video card. (Never did finish that game may go back to it.) I came over from Age of Conan unchained. It is funny I heard the same complaints on AOC as I do now with ESO. What it all comes down to is what are you looking for in a game? I have played ESO since Beta, since then this game has come a long way with some great changes and some not so great. If you are looking for an adventure with great storyline's, or maybe you would like to create a mage that wears heavy armor and carries a sword and shield and a two-handed mace you can there is no limit to how your character can be made. There are no limitations to how you choose to play your character.Tameral is a huge place lots of areas to explore and with now being one Tameral you are not limited to questing in your own faction. You can be part of the Daggerfall Covenant one of the best factions by the way and decide to go quest in the Ebonheart pact questline. You can now team up with anyone from any faction to quest with and it does not matter what level he or she are. PVP, however, you will still need to play with your own faction.With such stunning scenery, I find myself laid up on the shore of a river fishing away. For me it is all about the Story and questing, Role-playing with then NPC or with others players. I am currently leveling a crazy, happy, fun loving wood elf who find herself in a little trouble from time to time. Being a new member of the thieves’ guild, she has her run-ins with the law. ESO has one of the friendliest communities out there. The chat is not full of gold selling spamming or arguing with other players.If you are a solo player like myself or you play with a group there, is enough content to keep you entertained for hours on end. I have played a few hours since this game has come out and I added it to my steam account. ESO is always updating and adding new content. If I had, any complaint it would be that is there is no way to sell your items unless you are a member of a trading guild and nowadays you have to sell so much per week to stay in the guild or you have to sell your Items in chat. Coming from age of Conan where you could sell your items from your bank storage. I did find this a little disheartening.The PVP can get a little crazy and you will always hear complaints about zerkers when they are not zerking themselves. I enjoy it being a solo player it just makes it that much more of a challenge running the quests in Cyrodiil or the Imperial City. I ran into about 30 Aldmeri Dominion the other day while I was trying to navigate the sewer system of the Imperial City, I was dead before I could click my mouse twice."
Positive,Elder scrolls online.This game is wonderfull. Seeing that Zenimax made it instead of Bethesda it carries on the elder scrolls tradition. Whether you select a Nord to a dark elf you always end up with a different variety and character customisation. With millions of possibilities in the character you can make the prettiest woman to the fiercest Orc. Yes the game had a rough ride at the beginning. It had bad graphics a lot of bugs and it was even in beta! It has improved a lot and Zenimax has even implemented a crown system which is argued to be making the game buy to play. However the things are optional and it doesn't decide your rank among others. You can save 10k instead of spending realise money.The first while I played the game.To give you a backstory I started following the elder scrolls since morrowind. My dad had the game and I lend it from him. I felt in love with the game. It had mild graphics but that didn't matter. However I then moved over to oblivion on launch. I got it from my dad again. I loved the difficulties and game story. This brings me to ESO. After skyrim I had high expectations for the game. Yes it took me a while to save 70$ but I made it. I got the game and I dove into tamriel.The first thing I noticed was that the graphics were really bad. However I figured out that my driver wasn't synced with the game. I played a bit but it didn't feel right. It felt like a modified elder scrolls game. I played it for 73 hours now and I'm happy. However I would not consider this elder scrolls VI I would consider it a extension to a series but not part of the series.    Although to any buyer I would say this before they buy itElder scrolls online should be considered an mmorpg before considered a ES gameI hope this helped!
Positive,"I enjoy ESO. One of the better MMO's out there in my opinion. The questing with voice acted contacts can really get you into the game, especially if you just want to kick back and solo, take in some story and lore. Soundtrack is great, it's graphically enjoyable, combat mechanics are decent.  Some of the expansions have been a disappointment, but Orsinium was great. Looking forward to Morrowind.  In all, a very good game, I recommend giving it a look."
Positive,"[Before buying the game]Its on sale, i've wanted to try it for a while. Guess i'll buy it.[After 1 hour gameplay]Well, there goes my social life.Short verison: Game is ****ing great. Don't expect ""Skyrim: Online"" though, it is not. It might remind of Skyrim, sure, but this is more than that.Oh, and thought i lied with the ""after 1 hour gameplay"" part? I got 500+ hours in it already."
Positive,"I have never played a MMORPG before and was excited when I got in the Beta for ESO. Unfortunately, even though I thought it was fun, I got caught up in the ""WoW is better"" hype and didn't buy the game when it released. I finally bought this game when it became Tamriel Unlimited and I absolutely love it. I prefer single player games which is why this one works so well for me. I can join up with a group easily if I want to do something particularly hard then hop right out when I'm done. The UI was easy to get used to and the story keeps me wanting to play (which is why I loved Skyrim so much). I definitely recommend this game if you like solo adventuring. There are areas you will probably need to group with others but it's easy to do."
Positive,"If you are a MMO Fan or a Fan of The Elder Scrolls then this game is Def worth a shot, its a great all around experience for the casual or the die-hard pvp player or the guy who likes coming on and farming resourses and doing quests, the Main Story is Great on top of that there are 3 Alliences and each have their own main stories + its own unique combat system complete with crafting and tons more things to learn and do!!!! See you in Tamriel!"
Positive,"Obviously, how one idealizes a certain genre affects how one enjoys a game of that certain genre.  As a game?  ESO is great.  With the subscription cost gone and a MAJOR improvement to the gameplay, this game has the potential to be the best MMORPG.  The quests dont feel linear or mediocre, but rather capture the player with its depth and creativity.  The world may not be as expansive as a game like WoW.  But quality over quantity.  ESO paints the world rather than merely sketching it.  Crafting is now desired rather than dreaded, and gathering resources isnt too difficult.  However ESO fails as a core RPG.  The combat is bland, with only 5 skills and 4 classes to choose from.  When the enemies start to aggro, I start to sigh as the combat is very limited.  Personally, I feel the point of an RPG is to be able to become someone you arent in the real world.  ESO fails to replicate WoW's ability to do so.  While some people argue that ESO is supposed to be flexible, like a mage can be a magical assassin wielding daggers, the skill bar is still limited to only 5 combat skills.  There are a lot of passives that can make combat enjoyable.  But with 5 or less available action skills there is much less options available when combat begins, making fighting a bore.  With MMORPGs like World of Warcraft or Tera there are a lot skills which chain and interact with each other, while the bosses change their behavior making combat much more refreshing.  I am just giving my honest review on ESO.  All I want to do is help the conflicted consumer out with a two sided argument on the game.  I could care less what the fanboys have to flame about.  All in all, if you like the scenery, world interaction then grab it but consider the shortcomings of the game as well."
Positive,"This game started out very rough, and with the release of Tamriel Unlimited, it is a whole new experience and it will only get better.  I can't say much to persuade you but I will say this:  IF YOU LIKE MMO'S, THIS IS A MUST."
Positive,"This game is probably the best alternative to World of Warcraft. As a MMO vet, I would highly recommend this game."
Positive,"I'm not good at reviewing, so don't take my word, but here's my review on TESO: TU.Pros.1. It's mostly free to play after you buy the game.2. It gives a good sense of Skyrim, Morrowind, Oblivion, and all in between, mixed into the MMORPG Genre.3. It gives hope to those who wanted a multiplayer version of Skyrim, (and some of Oblivion.)4. It mixes well with the other games in the MMORPG genre, being one of the many open world ones, where you can do what you want.5. The faction war system. 3 races per faction, and each one battles with players from level 10 and up.6. The four classes are very fun to play as, decimating your enemies as quick as possible.Cons.1. The Crownshop has DLC, but you need to buy crowns to get it, instead of straight up buying the DLC.2. The Story Quests, go on for a long time, leaving little time for you to do sidequests, and by the time you are able to, you're too overpowered.3. Some of the dungeons you go to early in the game are way too hard without a friend, especially if you don't have friends.4. The game has a lacking of weapons that you can use, and some you get that don't fit your class.5. To play the game in a good way, you have to get a race that prefers to your class, instead of being what you want.6. There are a lot of mean people in the chat sometimes, so beware.But all in all, I recommend ESO."
Positive,"Excellent game, very fancy graphics and cool storyline.legit 9/10"
Positive,Only worth if you play 120 days straight until you get 60% mount speed and 60% mount stamina.
Positive,"There are a lot of people who are hating this game, calling it shitty and not an elder scrolls game and whatever. I have to admit that at the beginning of the game they might have been right, but the game has changed so fundamentally, since then, that it really deserves a second chance. So I decided to come back to it a couple of weeks to ago and I have to say I absolutely love this game now and it's becoming one of my favourite games ever.I simply love the elder scrolls universe: the people, the different cultures, the history, that's been created for and in the games is awesome. And this is definitely worthy of being counted as one of the elder scrolls games. Of course since it is an mmo, it has a different concept and who bought this game, expecting another skyrim might be disappointed. But that's hardly the games fault.In the following I'll show you, why in my opinion, this is a really great mmo:+ Freedom in Character-building: for example templar class can heal, tank and dps, depending on your build, you can choose which weapons you use, independent from classes.+ Many different areas all over Tamriel can be explored.+ Interesting story and characters and convincing world-building.+ No level restrictions: all areas will automatically scale to your level and so you have the freedom to go wherever you want, whenever you want...+ Long term motivation with veteran system and champion points: character building doesn't stop after max. level (50), questing in one alliance is enough to reach max. level, after that there are still all the quests of the other factions, you can do dailies, dungeons, trials and pledges.+ Interesting PvP-system: Alliance war for Cyrodiil, where the three factions fight for territory by taking over fortresses from the others.+ Diverse crafting system with lots of crafting sets and customisability through sets, runes, etc.+ No pay to win: stuff from the shop is either cosmetic only, can be farmed or gives you for example experience buffs. Although I'd highly recommend getting a subscription because of the crafting bag and access to all DLCs (not Morrowind and the upcoming Summerset though, since they aren't classified as DLC but as addons or expansions), the game can be played completely without money (well after you initially bougth it).+ Helpful and friendly community with lots of different guilds from trading guilds to social guilds, etc.+ Feeling of making a difference in the world: in some areas normal enemies will disappear after completion of the relevant quests.+ The game is constantly evolving with new DLC and addons/expansions.Of course it is rare, that things are completely perfect and because I don't wanna sound like a mindless fanboy, there are a few things that I have to critisize:- often generic quests like fetch this, kill that enemy. This is counterbalanced by the interesting stories behind the quests, at least for me and let's be honest, there are barely any mmo with unique and innovative quests.- if you want to become a master crafter, who's able to craft everything, it will probably take you about a year, because you have to do research that takes irl-time. Some will say it adds to the longterm-motivation but imo it's a bit excessive.- All the players running around, sometimes takes away from immersion, but well this is an mmo and not skyrim so I guess, you've gotta live with that.- It could be viewed as a negative that there is no ""auction house"" or something similar. So to trade with other players you have to join a (trading) guild. And then you only trade with the people in the guild or with others through special vendors which the guilds can acquire (most guilds have one trader somewhere in the world).So I hope my review is helpful and that people don't stay away from this game, simply because jumping on the hate-bandwagon is cool. I can totally recommend this game!"
Positive,"This game is a lot of fun but it does have issues. this is for people who want to buy but aren't sure.THIS GAME IS NOT SKYRIM! (This isn't a Dev issue but to many people think this way going in and get turned off when they find out it's not.)You will not be able to advance successfully through the game without addons. Some basic features this game should just have are availble through addons. A lot of quest are bugged and have been since launch. Devs seem more interested in updating their cash shop/pushing new content over fixing old bugs. ./RELOADUI sometimes fixes problems with quest but not always.Mail box is still bugged since launch. Logging out/in or switching zones will get your mail to appear but that shouldn't even be something you have to do.Daggerfall is the buggiest city in the entire game and has been since launch. enter with caution.Botting is a serious issue in some zones making doing some quest near impossible.Items you purchase cosmetic/mounts/housing/DLC items on NA server they DO NOT transfer over to the EU server which is just down right greedy so make sure you're on the server you want before making any purchases.Community IssuesDoing dungeons is a nightmare because of elitest players who will kick you from the group even before the dungeon has started. (I've not had this happen to me but while I was helping a friend learn how to tank it had happened to him on multiple runs) this is also a topic of complaint in zone chat often.Veteran players farm in newbie zones because, T1 is pretty much a joke making the world level with you so nothing is hard and making it so endgame nodes spawn in material rich newbie zones. So, good luck trying to gather anything until around the 3rd zone.Lots of Trolls (Which is a given for any MMO at this point) at least on the NA server there are decent players but the number of rude players outweighs the good. This moved me over the the EU server which from my experience has very few trolls compared to NA.Do I recommend this game? Yes, I do. If you can look past the negative (Of which I only scratched the surface here) you'll enjoy this game."
Positive,"I am going to keep this simple.  Great game.  Great fun.  Buy it, you will not regret it."
Positive,"This was my first MMO. I had never really been interested in the genre, but decided to give this one a try because of how much I like TES. I'm so glad I did. This is a great game. The community is actually really nice for the most part. Sure, there's the occasional idiot in the zone chat, but for the most part I encountered very little of the type of person that had led me to stay away from MMO's for so long. The game's got quite a learning curve, but plenty of people are willing to help out newcomers and answer their questions. Once you start to get the hang of things, this game has pretty much endless possibilities. Very enjoyable to play, for a very long time. I highly reccomend giving this game and its community a chance."
Positive,"I played WoW for over 7 years (Discipline priestess/ PvP-er), and thought I would share my opinion on ESO for those who are about to purchase their new expansion and also for those contemplating between WoW Classic (releasing in Aug this year) and ESO. I'm a dedicated MMO player to a degree that I had to quit WoW for a while as I didn't want to support how Blizzard was progressing my beloved game. That's how much I treated WoW like my real life, and that's a major part of an MMO as I see it as you can really reflect your style on your very own character, I mean *the Only* character in the universe.So during my break from WoW, I was playing some FPS, but then I start having this nostalgia of playing MMO, so I decided to give ESO a try. And here are some pros and cons;**Pros**1. It's really EASY to level up. You just need to farm quests and dungeons for experience with exp boost scrolls as there isn't much challenge or usage of your brain. The gear will drop for you, and there's only one gear set that you can equip, so no other complications there. There are no enemies (actual players) in the world, so you can very PEACEFULLY farm and do your quests without worrying about getting ganked by anyone. You can always be at zen when it comes to actual PvP in different zones other than in PVP battlegrounds. 2. As it's easy to level (I'm almost at champion level of 500 for only a bit over 220 hours), beginners to MMO will gain confidence.3. If you are lucky enough to be able to spend some money to unlock different DLCs and level fast enough (around about champion level 350), you get to play some cool dungeons that you have an opportunity to dust off that old brain of yours for some team strategy.4. In addition to its peaceful and relaxing environment,  music and the environment in the world is beautiful so you can play the game safely before bed just to soothe your senses. Sometimes I would just go around the world and take screenshots as a photographer without even worrying about getting attacked by any players.5. It's an MMO, but you are alone on ESO unless you've got some friends. Some may like to be alone, but trust me, if you want to do some dungeons quick, you want to be in a party.6. While not as cool as the Path Of Exile skill tree, ESO has a skill tree to boost your talents in a more basic level (eg. mana/health/stamina regen, armour strength etc). It's very much straightforward, so it doesn't really require much thinking as you will just know which one to invest your points in after recognising your play style.7. In game, you can switch your weapons easily, so you can also be a healer and damage simultaneously if your team needs help whether in PvP battlegrounds or dungeons. This is a huge turn on for me personally.****BIG BUT****1. Too easy to level. Whether it's for just simple mount speed or even overall quests, it's just way too easy. I like to play MMOs, thinking that there will be an enemy (actual player) nearby, hence I will be always ready to 1 v 1 or even do group fights when I'm out in the world alone or with my friends. In WoW, I would sometimes just look around the world to look for enemies, which was also a huge part of fun in game outside PvP battlegrounds.2. My character doesn't reflect my style properly. For dedicated MMO players, character personalisation is a huge thing, yet ESO kinda ruins it. It doesn't even let me to change my character's hair colour or hair style in a way that I want (ie. no in-game hair dressers) and the only option is to make other alts or you pay to get a set hair style that they sell in their crown store. 3. The gearing system is way TOO SIMPLE. I always carry both damage and heal staves for my 2 talent bars, and it only lets me to have one gear set. Ok, so I have 2 talent bars and I can also switch in between during the battle, then I only have one gear set fit to only one? Logically, it doesn't make any sense to me. If you have 2 talent bars, then you should offer 2 gear sets minimum. On top of that, there's no way, I would share the same gear with PvP  and PvE settings. For this reason, it leads to the next problem.4. Bag/ Bank Space is very limited. I equip my heal set and carry 3 other gear sets in my bag all the time so I always ran out of bag space. If you don't pay for the subscription, then you will basically need to sell the majority of your crafting materials. This is a huge turn off for players at any level. I've seen some people quitting game as it's literally a pain if you need to sort your bag and bank space out every time you log in. 5. Obtaining gear/mount/pet is way too SIMPLE. There's no rare drops through dungeons and also no rolling system. I personally like to have a rolling system in dungeon as it shows that you actually earned/won the item as your performance was better than other players. On top of having to pay for certain DLCs, not even offering rare drops don't seem to make any sense to me at all. After all, this plain system just keeps dungeons only experience farming, there's not much more to it. Personally, I don't get motivated or even intrigued through those as I know that the outcome will be always the same.6. PvP battlegrounds and Dungeons are NOT BALANCED. Though there are 2 difficulties for dungeons on ESO (normal and hard), the group forming system isn't very balanced. Very often (almost always if you don't actually queue as a group with your friends), you will see this pattern of low level players matched with high level ones, and just carried by the high level ones. Or if you are the only high level on in your group (out of 4 people), then you basically need to do most of the damage to finish the dungeon, otherwise it takes way to long. In PvP battle grounds, until you get to skill level 250 or above, you will most likely be dead by one or a few hits by enemy players. The skills and talents are not auto balanced, so I see why PvP isn't so popular on ESO, which explains the next point. Unlike dungeons, it doesn't require which role you are checking in as either healer, damage or tank, so it is one sided most of the time.7. PvP maps are very limited and nothing special. I've noticed that in ESO, allies seem to be scattered most of the times with very little or almost no communication amongst teammates unlike WoW. I see this due to very plain easy maps as it sometimes doesn't even need a healer as you could just sneak past or the high level guy in your team will simply just carry you. There aren't really blind spots that you even need to be aware of, so you don't even need to strategise for the map. I used to study maps for WoW to see which class suits best for what roles depending on the maps, but ESO PvP battlegrounds don't require any of those, you just need to do face to face battle and just capture flags/orbs and hold. You just need a simple push, that's all.8. Talent selection is very limited and requires least finger movements. Though they offer 2 talent bars on a character, you will only need to press a few numbers, R for ult and Shift for sprint, nothing really much there. You don't need to worry about cooldowns and key binding unlike WoW as it's very straightforward and there isn't much complication. It's great for beginners, but I personally find it not fun enough as I like to strategise the skills that I use. Regardless, on ESO, all I need to do is just investing all on magika and spell crit as there isn't much that I could do due to lots of limitations that the company hasn't solved.9. No flying mount?  Omg, I felt deeply ripped off finding out that there's no actual flying mount or even 2 person mounts, whereas their trailers were all from flying view.  </3"
Positive,"This game is amazing.  I am never bored. So much to do! Quests, fighting, decorating your house, crafting, scrying, etc!"
Positive,"The elderscrolls online is a massive quest filled world.The lookation are well and beautifully made. Prettier with every new DLC.The only down side is that on the weekly update day, all servers are on fire. In a bad way."
Positive,"Free week review (just under 30 hours in - level 15)First off it seems like a bunch of you need to take a class on time management, I started the download while I was at work for the day and when I got back, it took maybe 20 more minutes to get it installed and patched, I have an SSD and a 25mb internet speed connection, nothing crazy but seriously I don't understand all the complaints people are having with download/install time.I have a GTX 970 and decent enough hardware to run everything at max and get a steady 100 fps in the world and about 40fps when in town, even when it drops to 25 during big battles I don't really notice any frame skipping, it's actually pretty impressive whatever they're doing on the server load here. I've never experienced any lag or rubberbanding (I've also not partictipated in any of the big alliance wars though yet) The most people I've seen on screen probably 20-30? during a portal fight.Gameplay - It's still taking some getting used to, but I'm having a lot of fun with it. It feels a lot like any other elder scrolls game and again, I don't understand all the hate here, it's not going to be the same ""quality"" when you're talking about a MMO compared to the single player games, so stop comparing them. But honestly I have no qualms, it's scratching the itch I've had after beating Skryim awhile back and I couldn't be happier. It feels really easy right now still, but I've died a couple of times when 3-4 mobs start attacking me or I try to take on ""Group"" bosses. Which I later figured out that is what they're called, who have their own place on the map that are just chillen waiten for people to kill. The game does allow you to play alone or with friends, I've tried to play with 3-4 of my friends together but they all play at different speeds, I have one that has to search every freakin crate and barrel and steal everything, while I have a friend who races through the dialog and wants to get to the next area ASAP, and another friend who has to spend 10 minutes wondering if he should change his skill set because he just got a new weapon that does +1 more damage... But when we do get on together we can move through areas much more quickly, plus even if you are alone, most of the time (though this may be rare because of the resurgence of the free week) there are a some people around you doing the same quest so you're inadvertently helping eachother out because most of the quests aren't really ""instanced""World - My first character is a wood elf, who is apart of the Aldmeri Dominion Faction. I've been through the first little island (which can take 2-10 hours) to clear depending on how immersed you want to get. I've been having fun on the 2nd area exploring and picking up all the side quests. The environment might not be as Dark or enriched as the single player games, BUT AGAIN, we're talking about a freaking MMO, you have to understand that there is going to be some trade off of quality here for stability, but even with that said, I'm still really impressed with towns and the world that they've put together, the voice acting is top notch and even NPC's that have one lines are all voiced. I don't even have a mount and I'm don't mind running around the vast area because everything looks great.Story - Not Great, but also not horrible. The side quests are ok as well, nothing like (go here and kill 10 of this), more like Go here and talk to this person, and go to that cave and kill something. But again everything has a little backstory and you get to decide who lives or dies most of the time.Bag inventory/Crafting supplies - Inventory management is frustrating but I also don't expect to have the ability to pick up and hold onto everything. This game encourages ALTS when I was reading up on Champion Levels. I really don't expect one of my characters to have MATS for every profession, maybe 2 or 3? I'm doing all professions right now (but havent invested any skills points yet other than woodworking) and I have had no trouble completing all of the daily profession quests (6 of them) so far. (My bank is constantly full haha)Honestly though I don't understand all of the hate this game is getting, maybe it's people who got burned when it first came out or before it became subscription-less. IDK - all I have to say is stop letting some of these people sway your opinion.I will definately be picking up the GOLD edition for 30$, hell even if I never play it again I've already gotten my monies worth.But really, what do I know?"
Positive,This game is definitely fun to play. The main quests are super fun and playing with friends is a huge bonus. Can get a bit lonely if you got no one to play with but if you want a cool and fun story driven mmorpg then this is the game for you. The graphics are not the best but I still enjoyed it.
Positive,"I played this game for beta, and it felt clunky, blocky, and it didn't feel like an elder scrolls game to me. I wasn't a fan of the combat then and, after beta, I didn't return to the game.About two weeks ago, my brother convinced me to try it again and wow is the game different. A lot has changed. It's smoother, combat is a lot of fun. Very active. I can steal the most ridiculous things and that's the best. Quests are fun and I like that I can just run around and trip over them. It really does feel like an elder scrolls game. So much improved. So much fun.// EDITAfter almost 600 hours into the game, the only real complaint I have are the damn loot boxes. I absolutely HATE rng loot boxes. While they don't give anything that's game breaking, I'm one of those that collects cosmetics. It's frustrating that some are locked behind these damned rng boxes. Even if I can 'save up some crystals' to buy things, they're still insanely expensive.Beyond the above complaint, I'm really enjoying all the quests and classes. It feels like an Elder Scrolls game. The quests are actually enjoyable and don't feel like 'go fetch' quests. The voice acting is great ( and there are some familiar sounds in there, which is awesome ). All in all, this is probably one of the better MMO experiences I've had.Just get rid of the damn loot boxes."
Positive,"Aside from the occasional login problem, everything is kinda fine and fun. Lots of helpful guild for new players, so you won't really be left clueless on some important things like quests and builds"
Positive,10/10 best game ever its just i spent 5 hours figuring out wich if my quest lines are the main story so in conclusion 10/10 IGN  Oprah Illuminati are in on this
Positive,"Before I played this i had a small penis, no girlfriend, depression and absolutely no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
Positive,I just Love ESO <3 i'm big skyrim fan :)
Positive,"This game has consumed me since I started playing it about 8 months ago. I have only played one other game for about 4 hours since then. Buy it. Get addicated. The content volume per dollar spent is unmatchable anywhere else in PC Gaming. I have not loved a game and enjoyed playing as much in years.I now have almost 9,000 hours of gameplay. Needless to say....you need to get in ESO if you aren't already"
Positive,"I have spent hours and hours on this game, half of them through my ESO account before I linked it on Steam... Not tired of it yet! Expansions and new content come out all the time, and it's nice to quest and have in-game goals, while also having a PvP aspect to the game. There's something for everyone!"
Positive,"Ideally, this is best played with other people. But, even alone, it is damn fun.Also, it's ideally played if you have a strong and stable internet connection, unlike myself... Having to mooch off other people's internet to play kinda sucks a bit of fun out of it."
Positive,"Pro's:No month to month subscription fee, although you can still choose to pay for premium membership and get some nice perks such as extra bag space for crafting, and ""crown points"" which you can use to purchase premium cosmetics from the ESO store.It doesn't have that same ""grindy"" feel that you get from normal MMORPG's. At the time of this review, I'm about 30 hours in and it hasn't felt too repetitive yet. YOUR CHOICES MATTER! One of the staples of Elder Scrolls games is the fact that the choices you make in game affect the game world. This carries over into the MMO as well. Be careful what you do, because your actions may close certain quest lines, but can open up others that wouldn't have been available otherwise.Level scaling. Now, I've never been particularly fond of level scalling in MMO's, it works pretty well in ESO. There's no push to go play through a boring area or questline just because you need to get levels to go to a new area. This really helps to reduce the grind, and opens up the game world.Cons:Overall the game is a bit shallow. The storylines are just OK, and they don't really draw me in. Don't go into the game expecting story and character development equal to that of Skyrim, and you'll probably be fine.As with any free to play games, there are a couple of paywalls. A good example of this are the mount prices, which are pretty expensive when you're a lower level. Unless you want to farm gold, you're better off just buying it outright from the store. If you pay for the premium subscription, the paywalls pretty much go away.A lot of the quests are ""go here, kill this"", which are pretty standard for an RPG. Again, it doesn't feel too grindy, but it could use some more variety .It's a bit too easy for my tastes. Now, I'm still a lower level so this may change once I hit the higher tiers, but questing in general isn't very challenging. If you're playing in an area and there are other people about, chances are most of the mobs will already be dead, so you can just walk in, do what you need to do, and walk out.Overall:I'd still say go out and buy it. Wait till it's on sale, or get it from Humblebundle like I did. It's best when played in short sessions, which is great since it doesn't require a subscription."
Positive,"Good.What else to say... It's not a superb game but it'll do... Lots of stuff to do, pretty fun at some stages, huuuuge playerbase, huge map, lots of quests, dungeons and other stuff you can do.One of the better MMO's nowdays."
Positive,"I like this game, it reminds me of Age of conan-Unchained, Its a tad bit better to play while teaming up and doing quests and stuff together. I will keep playing this game for a good while as it takes a while to get tired of it ;) i like the Spell bag that comes with the ESO plus."
Positive,"MMORPG in Elder Scrolls flavorDecent looking game, with lots of different enemies, bosses and dungeons to conquer.Action-oriented, has a few different classes and roles to play, and some fun dungeons.Lots of different options for combat skills on each class, and a good amount of non-combat skills as well (e.g. Enchanting, Woodworking, Blacksmithing, etc.)Gameplay is fun and skills are easy to understand after trying them out.Housing system looks interesting. There is a cash shop, usually with pretty decent deals on more important things.If you adventure in a group, you get more EXP and can share quests to do them together.Reccomended if you are looking for action oriented MMORPG to play, and have a friend or few to start a group with!"
Positive,"With 20 hours behind me I can really say that I'm enjoying my time in Tamriel. The graphics are good, the voice acting is good, scenery, athmosphere and even most of the quests seem to be good when compared to other MMO's. Ok, they are still fetch this and kill those, but it is a bit more subtle than that. Not so obvious run there and kill. There seems to be also a huge amount of lore hidden here and there. Being completely new to Elder Scrolls I am a bit overwhelmed.I can definitely recommend this game if you like MMO's (no it doesn't invent the whole genre again, but what game does) and even if you don't know anything about Elder Scrolls you will get into the game quickly.I bought the Gold Edition and the description here on Steam is a bit misleading. The game does contain all of the DLC's (minus the newest one) AND a free horse from the start and 500 Crowns. These were not advertised when I bought the Gold Edition."
Positive,"Like the size of World of Warcraft? Like the simplicity of Skyrim? Then this game's for you. It's better balanced than WoW in lots of ways. No class is ""OP"" because each class is just one part of how you play. The combat is fast paced and simple, so you're not going to spend the whole time loooking at your keyboard and mastering your DPS Rotation. Your eyes are focused on the beautfiul world that bethesda and zenimax have reimagined. The community is also wonderful, no one takes the game too seriously like they do on WoW, everyone is pretty friendly for the most part.  9.5/10: Would, and probably will, trade in my WoW subscription for the subscription option here for extra goodies."
Positive,"I've played many MMORPGs and this is by far the most in-depth, immersive, and just fun to play MMORPG I've come across. The combat system is a nice balance between what you got in the other Elder Scrolls game and MMO combat. First Person in an MMORPG may not be the best thing ever, but I find it fun to travel around with it. Crown store where you can pay for stuff is only cosmetic and rare motifs that you can still find in-game. Crafting is really fun, a nice passive break from combat. Quests have incredible voice acting and storylines, minimal ""kill x of those, collect x of those"" kinds of missions. Overall a really good MMORPG, definitely my favourite out of the countless I've played."
Positive,"Really fun MMO. Great for those who enjoy questing, deep lore, exploring, group dungeons. Pros: Voiced dialogues Decent size world filled to the brim with content. No place feels empty. Quests aren’t just your average fetch quests. Usually with a lot of back-story. Large skill tree. Lots of solo content. There is a cash shop but, I haven’t noticed any pay to win. Combat system is decent. A  lot of content in general.Cons: Saw a lot of copy paste areas in delves(which are like small dungeons). Not enough skill points to unlock all skills (Combat & Crafting skills are not separate). Long trait research times (crafting). Crafting & Gathering system is underwhelming. Payed crafting bag (Unlimited crafting material storage), Inventory unmanageable without it if you want  to craft Only 6 toolbar slots for abilities, (6th for ultimate ability), could be more, 9~10 like in most mmo. Game crashes every now and then. Needs a lot of space on your storage drive.Note: Highly recommend Subscription.(Unlocks all DLCs (except Morrowind), EXP+, crafting bag for materials)"
Positive,A very underrated MMO. A terrible bug-filled beta gave this game terrible reviews. I absolutely love the game. I put well over 100 hours into it (not on steam). Pros:Incredible Elder Scrolls LoreAmazing combat with no restrictions on combat role and lots of customizabilityBeautiful quests (no kill 10 cows quests like in WoW). Mostly not as great as Skyrim though.Huge amounts of Content. You will most likely never run out of things to do.Immersive graphics that put a smile on your faceMassive map and tons to explore. Actual enjoyable exploring in this game. Easy to travel around.Well designed craftingRefreshingly fun PVPAddonsNot pay to win... and now you don't even have to pay a monthly SubscriptionIt won't appeal to everyone. I suggest everyone tries it. It may be your next gem.Cons: Steam integration is crap. I can't get the steam overlay in-game unless I add the game as a non-steam game. People have been complaining about this for 2 years!It's more of a single player MMO. Not a bad thing for some.It's not SkyrimNeutral:DLC adds a lot of content. You either pay for the DLC (one time cost) or subscribe monthly
Positive,I fear those immortal guards more than Molag Bal!11/10
Positive,"I cant say that im all that happy that they made this game an mmo but i still love it. Plenty of content to go about and a fair community. I recommend this game to all the elder scrolls fans, trust me you wont be disapointed."
Positive,"Aight so there's a lot of things to cover when talking about a series like the Elder Scrolls games and opening it into a vast MMORPG filled with many other players and different factions, and I want to cover a brief few of them.The main concern I've heard with some people is that it doesn't really feel like an Elder Scrolls game.  I actually disagree on this regard.  The multiple factions and storylines you can play out help to shape and shed light on what Tamriel was like wayyy back into the Second Era.  If you were expecting Skyrim Online, I'm afraid that this isn't it, but instead, has its own charms, much like Skyrim had its own as opposed to Oblivion, and Oblivion had its own to Morrowind, and so on.PvP is neat, I definitely really like it.  And whether your character is a lvl 10 or within Champion status, it scales everyone appropriately so that no one side has a blatant advantage due to level and capabilities. You'll still want to keep up to snuff on your equipment though.  And SNEAKING IN PVP IS A THING.  When you go into stealth, you are invisible to enemy units, which is REALLY helpful for making some sweet ass ambushes or jumping an unaware enemy, and you can pick up PvP missions that make it actually feel like there's a war going on.In terms of how the game plays, yes, its not like Skyrim or any of its predecessors.  Yes, the mechanics for combat are watered down some, but a compromise like that should be made when dealing with a system inside of an MMO.  But while the system feels simplistic in nature, it allows players to have truly unique abilities that are quite so their own, so each class can do just what that class can do without fear of other classes stepping on their toes, so to speak.It's definitely worth a play.  If you're still skeptical, however, wait for it to go on sale. Then you'll be happy you did."
Positive,"This is probably the best MMO I have ever played (and I'm a big MMO guy). Now the thing is, most people come into this game expecting it to be somewhat like Skyrim. Let me tell you right now, it is not. It is literally a World of Warcraft but with the Elder Scrolls lore. The only reason this is an ""Elder Scrolls"" game is due to the lore. The game is nothing like Skyrim or other Elder Scroll games. So If you are expecting an online skyrim, prepare to be disappointed. However, if you like MMO's this game is truly one of the best. Theres so much to do. If you prefer PvP theres tons of building up to the perfect PvP build and fighting in Battlegrounds (4v4v4 matches) or Alliance Wars (Which is large Faction Battles between 3 different factions). If you're not into PvP theres also a ton of content to bring a great PvE experience. Including but not limited to: Dungeons, Trials, Arena fights, and much much more. There's just so much content in this game that I cannot explain it all in this. Another thing I'd like to mention is the story telling is absolutely FANTASTIC.Finally, if you really want to experience it all, I do recommend buying ESO plus. The Crafting bag itself is worth it. Your inventory is normally on average 80-100 slots. However, the crafting bag will hold all your crafting materials between all your characters. I myself can say I have a good hundred thousand crafting materials if not more. The crafting bag is just great and makes ESO Plus worth every cent. Obviously you get more, including all DLC's (not expansions. Expansions are large additions to the game where as DLC's add a few quest lines and a few more dungeons and areas) monthly crowns (Premium Currency) and loads of more boosts.I'd give this game a solid 9/10"
Positive,"Great RPG MMO... I am a WoW veteran, who is now wowed By ESO, its absolutely great!!!!!"
Positive,Very funif you have friends
Positive,"i love this game, and i swear i thought i already reviewed it. but maybe that was the dlc, anyways its good but if i could have some friends or friend to play with, that'd be freckin great!! x'("
Positive,This is by far one of the best MMO's out there with one of the friendliest communities that I have ever encountered in any game. I HIGHLY recommend giving this game a fair shot.
Positive,Endless things to do and places to explore
Positive,"It's the best MMORPG I've ever played. Beautiful world full of (mostly) original and entertaining side quests + all the characters are dubbed, which i f*cking admire. The community is the nicest I've ever seen, fighting system is awesome and the crown store is just a noob trap, so it's not a cash-grab like the other MMORPGs.Skyrim multiplayer, 10/10."
Positive,"Best Game for MMORPG! but for any die hard fans of elder scrolls especially Skyrim will be a bit sad bcos there still missing in ESO such as u cant buy your own house, no killer cam, when u take equipment from dead npc the npc will be naked will skyrim and if u drop u item its mean u destroy it FOREVER.. but still its a good game!! :D Leveling up system is the same as other elder scroll games where u leveling up your skill when u use it, armor you can wear any types and combination regardless what class you are and the are 10 racial with their own skills (racial in this game is really important). You still can become werewolf or vampire but with positive and negative effect (depends on your character build). The graphic i nice and you can do what ever you want to do, killing NPC, stealing and etc but you need to remember there is JUSTICE SYSTEM like other elder scrolls games. The PVP is the best part for me in this game, if you join an active guild, you can see a tons of people siege on a Keep with their trebuchet, ballista and ram.. Pro-play at your own style-new generations of mmorpg-almost like skyrim-tons of thing you can do (searching lore book, crafting and etc)-PVP is great and awesomeCons-there is no house that can buy like skyrim or others MMORPG-Price tag maybe quite high for some body (but if you love games and wanna try MMO this is you choice!)-You will addicted with this gameIf you are looking for new generations of MMORPG this is your game to play! with combination of skyrim and MMO."
Positive,"This game has a lot of content, hundreds of hours worth of content. But recently it had a lot of problems with the log in system, mainly when through Steam.This problem started getting worse and worse (longer and more frequent downtimes) until it reached a point where of half a day downtime on a weekend, and to make it even worse that weekend had an event promoted by Zenimax in which the players had to log in each day. No surprise that many Steam players were unable to get the reward from that day.Zenimax claims that this problem comes from Steam side and therefore any type of compensation for the downtime has to come from them. It's amazing how they fail with their system architecture and then send their clients elsewhere when it is their game!Apart from that there are a few bugs here and there. Beware that when depositing and withdrawing from guild bank you can loose items if you are too fast and the system too slow ahah.I had the opportunity to try the DLC content on a free week and really enjoyed it but right now I'm glad I didn't invest any more money into this game and this company...Summing up, good game, lots of content, a few problems, you're buying Zenimax's game and if you have any problem they won't take responsability for it.I recommend thinking twice on the service you would like to expect for what you are paying for.EDIT: updated review to positive, will update text later"
Positive,"im a free trial user from the Nov 17 event.. and well... look at my hours. im addicted. i love this game. it feels like an elder scrolls game just on a lesser engine we are used to, but with all the countries. now i like to play a mixture of first person and thrid and i feel like they captured the feel of that nicely in this game, not as great as its single player tittles but its there.i often just find myself playing like im playing skyrim or any other elder scrolls game out there. like one time a guys house was on fire and i went in to get him out so when we finished that dialouge option and he ran out i instantly went into sneak mode and went to searching in his drawers and so on. IF THAT DOESNT SOUND LIKE SOMETHING YOUD DO then i dont know what to tell you bc it was at that moment i realised that i loved this game for just its perfect meld of the elderscrolls and an MMOI also find a big plus being that there are no nameplates on top of players or npcs. just the health bar and their name next to your compass (just like on skyrim). i like this because its immersive, and most often if its just a few people around standing still they will often look like elite gaurds or just fit in as town folk. its amazing.i dont know why this game gets so much hate or dislike now but ive been looking for an mmo for a couple years and thanks to this free trial period... they have a loyal ESO Plus member."
Positive,"I am a recovering WoW addict!  Many of you have traveled the same path that I have, personally I played for the most of 11 years including beta and did everything from farming 48 hour AV sessions to hardcore 8-10 hour 40-man raiding sessions.This is my nicotine patch. 1) It is Buy-to-play so I do not HAVE to spend anything monthly on it (including gold), this alleviates the feeling that I HAVE to play and gives me the opportunity to log in and play when I feel like it. 2) It's enjoyable as both solo and group play and neither are really required to have fun! 3) At least at the moment, the community isn't as toxic as say LoL or WoW, that's not to say that there are not trolls, but it is a much cleaner and nicer environment than most Free-to-play games I've experienced.The game isn't perfect by any means, but if you're looking to spend a few hours on the computer without getting sucked into a world like WoW then maybe this'll be your nicotine patch too.  I can hop on here for a few hours and just take a break and relax instead of getting worked up about my ilvl, artifact power, and what raids I need to clear each week!  Hopefully if you're in the same situation I was you'll make the jump too!"
Positive,"This is an awesome Game. I recently decided to pick it up on Steam, after playing it in their own launcher. You just connect your account and keep your Characters and DLCs and so on. worked perfectly. Story is very scrambled and you don't really understand it since once you have a DLC you will play the DLC Story. Alas the Story is pretty good. If you like the Game you should really think about the subscription tho, it's way better with it. All DLC Access and Crafting Inventory make it just that good. Although it is really sad that without the Sub its just way worse.Play it if you are okay with these, if you aint then dont play it."
Positive,"ESO offers a way to expand on the elder scrolls lore through it's new content that gets released each year, I have put in thousands of hours of enjoyment (more hours outside steam). Recently, however, I have found myself spending less time on ESO due to moving onto other games and the current state of monetization has been putting me off more lately. At this point I mostly only really stay interested in ESO is for new elder scrolls lore additions. If you want some more elder scrolls content to hold you over until TES6 then I recommend this game due to it having tons of lore content to explore that keeps getting expanded on each year. If you are not really that interested in elder scrolls content and just want a new mmo to play then I would recommend just finding a newer and better mmo instead."
Positive,I was dragged kicking and screaming to this game about 18 months ago and now I can't stop playing.
Positive,"I started actually reading the quest dialogue and I'm sucked in, help"
Positive,"werry gud i like tha gamm bueath as wurld uf worquaft, gavlan wheel gavlan deal-Gavlan"
Positive,This really helps me get my Elder Scrolls world fix with a little sprinkle of social stuff
Positive,"It's cool, man."
Positive,"Captures the spirit of the Elder Scrolls franchise, offering classic hits and new ones."
Positive,"It's a single player game, with MMO aspects."
Positive,not an mmo person usually but ESO is becoming one of my most played steam games. Love Skyrim and ESO is like Skyrim but more so
Positive,I still haven't played it but the launcher looks lit.
Positive,From Launch this game has come an exceptionally long way and i love it.
Positive,This GAme Is GOLD! Truly awesome! :D
Positive,"cant say anything about the game here, everybody know this is best game ever !"
Positive,"I've got 400+ hours clocked on this game and not once have I ever dealt with login issues on Steam, I have 2 copies (One Steam the other CD). I can't really say I'm in the right when it comes to the login issues because there's a vast majority of people complaining about it, so it might be that I'm just lucky that I've never dealt with it or login at the wrong time. Me personally I love MMO's that you can interact with the NPCs that have their own voicelines and make the world a little bit feel more alive. I've played WoW and in my opinion it's one of the most pay to play games, not in terms of store content but in terms of actual play. You have to pay for membership in order to play above level about 20 if I'm correct and you can't play continously without paying for membership, while in SWTOR you can play up to level 60 and pay to get to level 70 and it's end game contents, then in ESO's case you pay once and pretty much can max level. In terms of DLC content there's always the choice of purchasing them with a combined combo pack that's cheaper than purchasing them on the Crown Store, hell even cheaper when it's on key sites. People that say ""I feel and look like a hobo, why is the crown store so expensive"" should really look at themselves and think for a moment. The only pay to win stuff on ESO is the mounts, cosmetics, crafting styles and a little boost of potions or housing.The only MMO's that I play as of now is ESO and SWTOR since the NPCs actually interact with you and have decent enough graphics to make the game feel fun to play. Yes, I'm one of those people that love game based on graphic wise, when I played WoW I legit yawned 5 minutes of playing it but did so because after a mate convinced me, I decided to play it to max level with a friend. My god was that the most wasteful game I've ever played in 2018. Just a little tip for mentally challenged people, when you purchase the game and it doesn't log in especially on Steam. Don't keep the game on, it builds up game time and if you haven't realized there's a 2 Hour game policy on Steam. I've seen countless people complain about ESO logins problems and say can't refund it due to this. Just remember smart way? Launch it the first time to see if it works, if not. Find a solution on the internet. Use the support lines as last resort because there's a lot of people experiencing the same problem if you only RESEARCHED. Again, don't keep the game on if it doesn't work the first time. Exit the game, find a solution, relaunch to test said solution. Repeat if it still doesn't work."
Positive,This game is amazing! I would recommend this game to anyone that loves mmo. The learning curve on this game is kinda insane but after the first 8 hours you will be hook.
Positive,"Who likes MMORPG and Elder Scrolls games ESO is indispensable, a huge game with a huge world that give us a fantastic experience."
Positive,"ive played elder scrolls since the beginning but, the whole mmo thing i cant say i agree with.I loved the other elder scrolls games but as an Mmo it seems to take away from the immersion of the series.  Soundtrack is awesome in typical elder scrolls fashion and the game play and combat system are satisfying. I dont like that every character can use any weapon they find and I dont like the UI.  the game runs beautifully but I have this odd probelm where everything starts fine and after playing for about 2 hours or so, ill have some frame rate and performance issues. The system is not overheating according to all of my temp monitors, A simple restart of the game.. or even leaving the lobby and joining a new one will solve the problem.Other than that, its a great game. I dont care for the mmo zone chat and only recommend getting into the game if you have people to play with. playing it solo is not like playing a single player elder scrolls game, this one was designed for groups. If youre a lone wolf gamer, i suggest you stick to skyrim. Buy it when its on sale. Enjoy the free subscription.7/10"
Positive,"ESO is an excellent game. It's graphics are well done and it has a lot of good story lines, but even this game has a problem. It is very hard to get past level 15 without a friend to help. It is possible, but you should expect to die... a lot."
Positive,"During quarantine I degenerated so much I can't recognize in which world I live more lol. Perhaps this was the true goal of the governments.Anyway, Five stars"
Positive,never bought the game or played it but might be good
Positive,Approved by Gustavus II. Adolphus.

Positive,"I wasn't expecting this to be any good after a few friends tried it at launch and hated it. However, after playing it on the free weekend I ended up paying for the gold edition and have no regrets.The game is absolutly fantastic!"

Positive,"So after reading a lot of negativity about this game I found some hidden positive information and decided to take the plunge on ESO and got the Imperial Edition when it hit steam. I have not been disappointed. Trying to push all preconceived opinions out of my mind I approached ESO with as much of an unbiased opinion as I could muster and let the game speak for itself. The combat is a decent mix of the traditional MMO style skill bar and what I've experienced in Oblivion and Skyrim with point and click via the cross hair. The environment is nice. The ambient noises from the volcano that seems to dominate the area I'm in now really help the environment come to life. The music is nicely done and hasn't gotten tiresome for me yet. The maps are pretty big and there's plenty to explore. I found myself at a point where the main story is a couple levels above me now so I know I missed content somewhere and I'm exploring to find what I've missed. Yes, you do have to explore to find content, not everything is handed to you on a silver platter.I haven't done any dungeons yet. The first one starts at level 12 and I've split my time between my sorcerer and a melee Templar. The sorc being 11 and the temp is now 10. I wanted to try ranged vs melee and right now I seem to be favoring the Temp which is unusual because I normally like ranged and healing characters. All in all I hole heatedly would tell people on the fence to take the dive and give it a try. I've been burnt by games in the past and have lost decent money on plenty of them. That's the gamble we take as gamers. This is one title I'd put in the gotten my monies worth column, and I still have three weeks left in my first 30 days."
Positive,For the first time I'm proud of the character I have made!The game is fine I guess...
Positive,"This game is relativelly young. It doesn't have all the things that 10 years old WoW has, and also has some bugs (which gets fixed over time). Yet I recommend this game. Quests are original and all conversations is voiced. World is wonderfull, immersive and full of detail. Overral it is one of the most single playerish MMORPG. The best things in game in my opinion is its maturity. NPCs are old, dirty and ugly. Armors and weapons are modest and realistic. If you want an adventure in mature world full of interesting stories, dont hesitate and start play now ;)P.S.: I've played a lot more hours than displayed on my steam profile. I'm using SweetFX to enhance game graphics even more."
Positive,fun rpg good gameplay a bit laggy at times and  a few bugs here and there but if you loved skyrim you will love this
Positive,"Haven't bought Morrowind expansion yet, but definitely plan to. If you are a fan of Elder Scrolls, I think you will love this game!"
Positive,Khajits not furry kysGrinding the game
Positive,"This review will, necessarily, be a bit long, because the game tries to be all things to everyone without quite pulling off any one thing.Coming from BGS's TES series (Skyrim, Oblivion, etc.), I expected more personality to this: though, given that this game is more like WoW than a Bethesda game, perhaps I should not have, Often it shows in the little things: the loading screens, much of the soundtrack, and most of the writing and voice acting are weak compared to a BGS game.Fundamentally, this game struggles with identity issues. Is it primarily a multiplayer RPG, or a single-player one? There's plenty of content for the single player, but resource instancing means you are competing with other players to mine ore, for example: though loot drops from bosses are available to all. Doors in dungeons that need to be opened by puzzle may need to be opened by EVERY MEMBER of a party, which is truly one of the game's bigger puzzles.Conversely, the multiplayer content is mainly endgame, for guilds and people who have been playing most or all of the game's 10 years. And the bulk of the MMO parts of the game is PvE, so even if there are multiple PvP modes, most of them feel neglected.Then there's the issue of DLC and the ingame economy.Anyone who doesn't subscribe to the roughly $20 CAD/month ESO Plus service is at a severe disadvantage when it comes to build optimization especially for PvP, game progression, and particularly crafting. Inventory management is, bluntly, a nightmare. The game throws contrived and arbitrary limitations at you which often can only be solved by spending real-world currency. You will see more people at any given time managing their inventory or in a bank, than in a dungeon.That being said, is the community mostly good, other than the obvious scammers and the odd troll? Yes. Are there hundreds or even thousands of hours of content in the base game that don't require DLC? Also yes, although much of it will feel like cheap copy-paste of all the other areas and dungeons you have been to.The game feels like it's on its last legs. Most of the updates for years have been uninspired cosmetic updates, not new game modes or kinds of enemies, abilities, etc.Still, if you can get this on sale (as it is right now), it may be worth it for the sheer amount of content. Just don't expect the game to last much longer, and remember that since it's a live service game, when the plug is pulled, all those fancy cosmetics and player homes that people have spent real-world currency on, will just vanish. But give it a try if you like fantasy RPGs, because although it doesn't do anything close to perfectly, it does enough stuff well enough."
Positive,"Not really much to add that hasn't been said about it already. I've played a LOT of mmos, and this is by far one of the best. Yes, the crown shop is overpriced, but you honestly don't need any of it to enjoy yourself. There is always something around every corner. If you love exploration and discovery like me then you'll love ESO."
Positive,"So far, a couple months into the game and loving it.  Don't get me wrong, it's a Bethesda game so expect the glitches typical to their games; but the game itself is beautifully thought out and very enjoyable.  Even as a non-ESO Plus member the game feels fully open to you.Definitely worth the investment and exploration."
Positive,"Great game, love the model and the cash shop isn't game breaking. Don't like that you can buy bag space upgrades and in game vendors but its ok. Its a really fun game though brings back feelings of EQOA to be honest."
Positive,"It's a beautiful game but it's technical quality is kinda bad. Bugs, bugs everywhere. Thankfully, it got out of the absolute abyss it fell into on Greymoor release (seriously, that season was just The Bugged Heart of Bugrim)Still, a ton of content for every taste, a lot of enjoyable repeatable activities, and, well, it's an Elder Scrolls game and Tamriel is home. And in the art/design department it's just soooo good."
Positive,"Great game that i have invested into heavily. My personal MMO of choice. The expansions coming out can be a bit annoying due to their price and putting you into a bit of a cycle of paying every year, however to be honest, you don't need to get the expansions even if the devil on your shoulder tells you you need to (tho if ur buying the game, i recommend you get the version that has all the expansions so far). What you can also do is wait until you need expansions and buy the most recent one and get all the ones before it. It is certainly a game that you will not run out of content with due to its exhorbitant play time (reflected in the GB needed to download) you can play it like a solo game or you can focus on multiplayer. it is NOT skyrim online, however it does still feel like an elder scrolls experience. Strongly recommended."
Positive,Steam screwed up launcher at level 49.11/10 would (try) play again.
Positive,"This game is good fun, but prepare when installing this game, as I got a barrage of errors"
Positive,Well  game is good but donot buy on steam you can get much better deals from other websites and if you are lucky you can get Gold edition at the price of Unlimited edition
Positive,"very good, very nice, very fun i like it."
Positive,"A fun MMORPG if you are an Elder Scrolls fan. Combat is a bit janky due to the translation from a single-player RPG into an MMORPG, but nonetheless, it's still enjoyable!"
Positive,"Probably the best Elder Scrolls experience right now.BUT in 2023 there is no cross platform, that mixed with the subpar dlcs as of late and the store's lack of new items spells out a lazy dev team. You guys could still milk this for more money, just combine the servers for console and PC and make some more style packs. I love this game and want to throw money at it, but I also want to play with my friends on console and it seems like a waste to throw money at something for only a fraction of my friend group to see."
Positive,"Ten stars from me. This game is made with a lot of love. Its really well done. I have played WOW for many years. My son recommended Elder Scrolls. I was surprised when I tried it. The story is fantastic, the gameplay - I love it. Really well done."
Positive,"This game is quite awesome. There are lots of things you can do and you can be. You might be a swordsman vampire with using magic or maybe an Orc that using dual wield. My point is there are many things to do, see and kill. In this game you can kill a god with another gods' blessing (not killing daedra, it isn't mortal) but winning aganist them. The cons of this game are: The DLCs.They are very good designed, playable but cost more money than game forexample Morrowind. Maybe someday they make some free updates that improve the game like a map that you can go freely and do some quests non-paid. 9/10"
Positive,The game is ok i guess...
Positive,I like it
Positive,"good game but, as a new player, the Dungeon Finder feels like everyone is speedrunning every dungeon and wont let new players learn mechanics."
Positive,"nice mmo rpg, sucked alot of my time and money. 1 weeks into the game and had 100+ hours, had to stop myself after 2 weeks, as i had some irl stuff"
Positive,"My life is over, the earth is a place far, far away. The girl I used to be is no more. With each waking hour that I spend in the Elder Scrolls Universe, my past memories fade, and all that remains is the shadow of who used to be. All that exists is Tamriel. This is a cry for help. 10/10 highly recommend"
Positive,I had played this game in the past but I had uninstalled it because I thought I was not going to play it again but of course I went and changed my mind and I reinstalled it and this is when the problem arised when it got to the white box saying ESO is installing/downloading it would it 100% and nothing would happend the white box would disappear and it would close or something
Positive,"love the stories the scenery even after they destroyed pvp they have a tendency to really buff something a skill a class an item etc then they nerf it to the ground to the point it is not usable anymore its a bit sad but i guess that's how they keep you grinding, over all I love playing for the stories, the scenery and the friends have met along the way.there is  always something to do in eso! <3"
Positive,"True StoryI decided to kill a world boss at CP level 88, I couldn't, so I wrote down on the chat to find people who would help me do it. Waited for ten minutes, and nobody showed up.Then I switched to my Level 3 female elven mage hunter and did the same thing. Sixteen seconds later, I saw a guy crouching inside my character, and the other one was waiting for him to finish it so that he could get on that too."
Positive,"Casual gamer when it comes to The Elder Scrolls Online, only played Skyrim prior to this.As someone who is new to the TESO, the game has a lot to take in at the start. TESO is incredibly fun, the combat is fluid and feels great. The skill tree options are vast, this allows for many different playstyles which keeps runs fresh. A little part of stories didn't interest me and was too short, like Psijic.I really enjoyed it, one of the best MMOs."
Positive,"ESO is the strongest MMO I've ever played, and I've played DAOC, LOTRO, Rift, and WOW. From what I've read, the game used to be different--much weaker--but now that every player can play in any region, and all levels of friends can run together, the game is super. Variation in characters is not as obvious as in games with many classes, like Rift, but by mixing the classes, racial passives, weapons skill lines, guilding lines, profession passives, and world skills (e.g., vampire, werewolf, soul), the variety available is impressive. For a large MMO, the graphics are beautiful and the world is very large. I've heard players of the small, bouncy physics, far Eastern MMOs complain that the graphics aren't better, but this is a much larger and complex game than those toys. This is the real deal with lore that goes on forever, player housing, and different furniture, weapons, armors sets--of all weights--for every single race. It's wonderful and immense. If you like MMOs, ESO should probably be your next stop."
Positive,"I bought and downloaded ESO from their actual website, and it is a very fun game.So I wanted to leave a review.You can play this game like it's an MMO and have fun, or you can play it like it's just an Elder Scrolls Game.Such as: Doing quests, going fishing, go mining and woodcutting, craft your own armor and weapons and clothing, enchanting, you can buy and decorate houses. Or if you want to interact with people, you can do dungeons and quest together and fight bosses and so on. I recommend this game to Elder Scrolls fans and MMO fans. If you are both, you will love this game."
Positive,"Yoooooo....PVP in Cyrodil, amarite??"
Positive,Couldn't get that WoW kinda feeling for an MMORPG but all-round it's a decent game.
Positive,"[⭐⭐⭐✰✰]_______________________________________❤  Audience  ❤- ☑ Casual- ☑ Average- ☑ CompetitiveAs a MMORPG, it caters to a lot of people: from casual players who wish to complete quests and explore the world... to the hardcore kind that prefers to hunt achievements and overcome challenges.The game can be treated as a single-player experience if preferred, seeing that it shares similarities to previousThe Elder Scrolls titles and other games within that genre. Interacting with other players isn't really necessary, but joining a guild and get to know a couple of people is always a good thing in the long run after all.The game might be a little overwhelming at first to some players, but those who are already familiar with the concept of a MMO or with the series should have a much easier time with the game.Honestly, just take it slow and have fun. Rushing will get you nowhere._______________________________________☼  Graphics  ☼- ☑ GoodThe graphics are alright and aren't all that demanding (for current laptops as well). Just make sure to tweak some of the graphical options and even try out different resolutions just in case you wish to boost your framerate.Although the character models might seem generic to some people, the environments are quite gorgeous to look at. In time, you'll notice that it has its own style and identity._______________________________________♬  Music  ♬- ☑ GreatIt's no Jeremy Soule, but it does its job. It resonates well with those who know the series' previous tracks. Most locations have their own theme, and the ones that play during combat make the experience all the more exciting._______________________________________☠  Difficulty  ☠- ☑ Easy to learn, but hard to masterAs I mentioned before, the game works for anyone. However, do not take the 'hard' content lightly. You will need a competent build and good communication skills with other players in order to invest yourself in hard PvE and competitive PvP content. Otherwise all it takes is simple logic in order to work on your character's build. The game does offer tips and suggestions as you play, and there are plenty of guides available online._______________________________________⚠  Bugs  ⚠- ☑ Few BugsIt's a MMORPG, so it's bound to have its fair share of bugs. I haven't encountered anything serious, though. And when you do, you should always contact Support (Zenimax, not Steam) through the official website._______________________________________✎  Story  ✎- ☑ GoodThe story isn't breathtaking or anything like that. The singleplayer titles still do a much better job with what they're given, but The Elder Scrolls Online manages to do its own thing without having to sacrifice much of its content.Every single questline has voiced NPCs that will interact and guide the player. There's plenty of throwbacks and references to previous games and the voice-acting is splendid._______________________________________⚔  Gameplay  ⚔- ☑ Possibly fun or frustratingThis is subjective, though. I certainly don't mind the gameplay, and find it enjoyable at times. However, a lot of people seem to have issues with how ""clunky"" the combat can feel and the fact that the meta is centered around ""animation canceling""._______________________________________۞  Length  ۞- ☑ Extremely Long (100+ hours)One area alone can take up to a week to complete. There's plenty of story to do and all sorts of items and achievements to collect. It's safe to say that a newcomer is in for a treat._______________________________________✃  Modding Community  ✃- ☑ ActiveThis game has an active modding community that constantly works on graphical enhancements and all sorts of add-ons that provide the players with a much better experience._______________________________________$  Price / Quality  $- ☑ Full price- ☑ Wait for SaleI never bought The Elder Scrolls Online for a full price, but I believe it's worth it if you have the means to. The game is often put on sale anyway._______________________________________❒  Monetization  ❒- ☑ Mixed BagThe Elder Scrolls Online uses the Buy-To-Play revenue model for a MMORPG, similarly to what Guild Wars 2 and Black Desert Online do. This means that you're able to buy the game once and have access to most of its features permanently. You are not locked out of it or are forced to pay a subscription fee in order to be able to log-in and play with your characters.The prices of the expansions are quite regular for the genre. And since they're occasionally on sale, I'd say it's not too much of an issue. However, the in-game Premium Store (aka Cash Shop) is nothing short of a double-edged sword. The game naturally sells DLCs, cosmetics, boosts, convenience items and loot boxes. Many people claim that the prices behind these items are atrocious, and I have to agree with that. Twenty bucks worth of their premium currency isn't exactly enough to purchase one sole mount. Fortunately, all of the items within the store are account-wide.And there's also the matter of DLCs. They're sometimes on sale, but honestly, only the ones that add new areas and a whole new story arch are worth the bother. Most of them are focused on a few new dungeons (which are hard and annoying to go through).It's also worth mentioning that The Elder Scrolls Online has an optional VIP system similar to how a subscription plan works. When the player becomes VIP, they'll receive free premium currency per month and gain access to all DLCs until said subscription expires.Like I said, it's a a double-edged sword. It won't really ruin the fun of the game, but it's worth keeping an eye out._______________________________________℁  Verdict  ℁The Elder Scrolls Online is a game worth checking out for fans of the series and for those looking to try out a MMO that can provide an immersive journey and challenging content.Rating: _______________________________________"
Positive,The game feels very different from other commonly played MMORPGs.
Positive,"Very grindy, typical mmo so great if you're into that sort of thing. Still not a great Elder scrolls game but worth giving a go if you can get it cheap, which these days it is. I love exploring the, quite frankly stupidly big, world of tamriel"
Positive,"Game is good.Subbing gives massive QOL bonuses but not unfair to non subbed players.Game is mad expensive to aquire everything,or sub for one month and unlock whatever you need unlocked from the DLC areas and continue with the normal version after the month ends. Or whatever its your money.Game is good tho."
Positive,"edit: the game crashes a ton during character creation, idk why but it drains your memory during this, I've had several crashes when making another character, same goes for my boyfriend (5 crashes) and two of my other friends (at least two crashes), again only happens for character creation, no crashes while playing the game itself outside of that O.othis more of a ""first impressions"" then an actual review as im not where near done with this massive gamethis game is HUGE, each zone is like big ass island with loads of quest chains and the quest is extremely good. You'll have places within said island zone based all around a quest, sure its kill this and/or fetch this but there's its own story within as to why you're doing it all dialogue full voiced too for more immersion. Some quests even have branched choices drastically change the outcome of them and they aren't always so black & white. You won't know to trust of the characters within them as there's usually more to their stories then just first glance. I'll have dungeons and other various places made just for said quest so it feels far more important when doing them. Even after you're done with said quest you made run into one or two of the characters from one in the town or city of said island you met them on either thank you for helping them or telling you to f*ck off if your choice ruined their lives haha. You'll near banter from other NPCs convos with themselves mentioning briefly some had happened from one your past quests, just adds even more immersion for the game. There are 4 classes in the game, Templar (healer tank), Nightblade (Rogue), Sorcerer, and Dragon Knight (magic base tank). Within each of these classes they have 3 skill trees, each skill gains experience and when it's LV4 you can use a skill point to ""morph"" it to new skill that either does more damage or can heal/support buff and it starts at LV1 again. Each time you ""morph"" that same skill it takes longer and longer for it to level up. Every time you level up you get 1 skill point which you can spend for skills of course. Another way to get skill points is from collecting 3 skyshards which automatically turn into a skill point. You can find sky shards in specfic places within a zone, they'll have a huge beam of light reaching the sky from them, pretty hard to miss lol. Best to look them to bolt straight for them when going to a new zone. There's also weapon skill trees of, one-handed and shield, two-handed, dual wielding, destruction (magic damage staff), restoration (healing magic staff) their skill trees work just like the class skills they get experience and can ""morph"" into other skills when LV4 etcGet this, any class can equip any weapon or kind of gear of light, medium or heavy armor. You can be a heavy armored sorcerer or a healing based nightblade, i love the variety this allows There's crafting and gathering as usual for an MMORPG but the gathering spots don't glow, no markers for them, you'll actually need to keep an eye out of where they are when exploring which i love. As for crafting very simple straightforward, just refine your materials and add more of them for whatever you're gear you're crafting to suit said level. Higher tier crafting requires special items that will increase the ""RNG"" percentage of your resolve. Nice you can make it be 100% if you put effort into it then just getting screwed over like every other crafting system by RNG even if you did everything right >_>"" The game has an excellent sense of exploration, you'll gain exp from being in a new section of a zone. I always looked at the map of said zone feeling the need to check out various points to see what this town like place of what quest could be in store for me. There aren't any quest markers all right there from the start on the map, you'll have to be within range for the game to keep track of a discovered quest. So its just another reason to force you to look every where to find everything and it is all worth it, rewards galore y'all my goodness. There will be highlights on the map saying to discover the problem with said section of the zone so really its asking you to find the quest giver for it to fix it, decent hint. no idea what end game is like, just that there's PVP sieges apparently which you have access at LV10, look for it in your menu and takes you to a different zone for it The cash shop is full of mounts, costumes, not sure if its P2W but based off what ive seen of it doesn't seem like it currently but the in-money needed to get a mount is a ton, better off just buying one with real money. I have yet to aquire a mount, just been running on foot, i don't mind it.honestly i'm not a fan of the elder scrolls main title games and i love this game surprisingly, even reading the quests and like crafting and gathering, those 3 things i just do not do in other MMORPGs ever, thats how good it is for me. Sorry this was so long for a ""first impressions"" :S"
Positive,"This is the full MMO experience; complete with nerds raging in dungeons, cheesy role-players, tedious grinds and excellent PvP.If you're a masochist looking for a good time, this is the game for you.12/10"
Positive,HELLLLL YEAH THIS GAME FUN AS HELL.
Positive,Game sucked at launchDoesn't anymoreDlc costs to much9/10
Positive,I don't understand why so many people still hate this game. After the tameriel unlimited version came out this game has improved considerably.
Positive,TES..But Online (〜￣▽￣)〜
Positive,"Great Lore. Meh combat. Nice interface. Not much uniqueness in questing. The graphics are subpar and most armor looks like it's just something painted on the skin. Overall. A nice mmo to play for the lore. Everything else? Meh, take it or leave it."
Positive,Probably one of the best mmos I have played! So much to do and so little time to acomplish things! They added housing into the game making the social aspect of the game so much more amazing! I highly recomend getting this game but spend the 60$ and get the gold edition! Trust me you will not regret it! If you want to hang around town and play instruments go for it. If you want to work on crafting do it! If you want to participate in huge pvp events for you faction.. you better bet you can do it! Or just walk around and quest while ejoying the beautiful land scape and amazing music! There is so much to do you can simply not become bored with this game! Morrowind will be coming to the game in june giving you a huge new area to explore as well as 30 hours of gameplay. now let me put this into perspective. i have 44.5 hours on record as of this review and I have not even come close to completing even a tenth of the quests in this game nor the main storyline. The game doesnt feel grindy one bit like other mmos ive played as well as each quest is so different from the last. you can simply not go wrong by buying this game!
Positive,"Cool Story Bro- needs more dragonsNo in all seriousness, when i first looked at the game, i wasnt impressed, and so didnt even bother, later on i asked my friend who had the game and all he said was, ""it isnt worth it"", and so the subject ended.,then later tamriel unlimited came out, and i thought, cool, no subscription, it could be great. so then i went and bought the game, and i tell you, there are no regrets. I started playing with my friend and at first i thought that it was a bit daunting, thinking the grind took ages, howver after a day or so i figured out that quests were a much easier and fun way to level up and get cool gear.the game has come a long way from the hollow shell that it used to be, and i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good mmo.One final note however, if you are looking for skyrim with  friends, you have come to the wrong place. and if yo are looking for morrowind with friends, keep on dreaming."
Positive,"Logged inMaking character for 1hFinally get into the worldDone introRealise I can pickpocket, kill NPC and steal itemsWas stealing everything and killing NPCGot 500 gold bountyAnd killed by two guardsThen team up with friend who also have gameTogether pickpocket and steal everythingMade on stealing 10k gold and bought a horse10/10 would steal everything againAbsolutely recommend this game, I'm played only 20h, but so far it's very good and fun"
Positive,"This is a beautiful game. The play is great. The quests are fun, as there seems to be a myriad of them to tackle. The combat system is good too. The world is very immersive.   Now that there is no monthly fee, you don't have an excuse to put off getting this game. I realize there is a cult of trendies that are trying to make it cool to bash this game. But, their real concern is perpetuating a trend. These developers have worked hard on this game, and I think it's apparent."
Positive,"My favorite part of this game is the story, dialogue, and NPCs. The characters are hilarious. And as a player who loves RPGs like Dragon Age, this aspect of the game made me really happy. Even without the MMO aspects I feel like I've gotten most of my hours more than worth it just by running around questing and talking to random NPCs who aren't even a part of the quests.As for the MMO aspects. I've never been super huge into end game PvE. Doing dungeons with my friends is fun, but otherwise queing up and doing it with randoms feels more removed, like I'm farming or grinding.The PvP is, well, interesting. There's two versions. The open world version of Cyrodiil kind of feels like a massive slaughter fest when you're part of the raid group where one side steamrolls the others. Unless you're playing at night or roaming around the area alone doing side things, I don't feel like any one individual really matters all that much aside from the person calling the shots and trying to lead.The other PvP is battlegrounds, which I enjoy much more. There's a bunch of different types of games and each individual character can and does matter, so to me it's just more engaging.One of my biggest peeves about the game is that the Thieves Guld and Dark Brotherhood are DLC. (It was a key factor in all the Elder Scroll RPGs, why do you suddenly have to PAY to get it in ESO? Money grab.) So there's that, just as a heads up to anyone like me where that was always their favorite part of their other games."
Positive,Played it a bit.Was okayish.
Positive,BEST 144 HOURS WITH MY FRIENDS EVER!!! This game is a 10/10
Positive,"One of the few MMORPGs that leave a really good first impression when you start. I was skeptical of this game at start, but having a good sale on it helped to decide."
Positive,Recommended for anyone that likes Story line Questing or Player vs Player or Graphics and special events.
Positive,"I absolutely recommend this game. It mixes everything you love about The Elder Scrolls (The vast, open world and the beautiful spontaneity we've come to know and love in the form of bizarre encounters with Daedric Princes like Sheogorath) and the flawless MMO environment we have seen in games such as World of Warcraft.I definitely rate 9.5/10Also, no one stole my sweetroll, so stop asking."
Positive,"I entered this game expecting disappointment but was very surprised by what I found, some aspects are of course different (Argonians (lizard people) aren't going swimming underwater and can die in water too deep, but they can outswim anyone else). Others are very familiar (well most others, nobody's called me ""boot"" yet....).There's enough quests to keep you busy for a very very long time, or just go exploring if that suits you, discovery alone can net you a few levels.Now for the fighting aspect, I have no idea how they did this AND made it work but you can go almost everywhere fight almost anything (Disclaimer:HEY I SAID ALMOST!!!!!!!) and do equal damage as they guy/girl/attack helicoptor next to you who's been playing half of forever. Damages scale, rewards scale, everything scales with you as you advance (or don't advance if that's your cup of mead)The bad parts... yeah every game has a few, you're crushed for inventory space, you can buy more in game or cash shop (WAIT ON THIS, I bought cash shop way too early and now get charged a lot for trying to expand in game, save your money until it's near impossible to do in game THEN pay if you want). The best guilds, Assassins and Thieves are also locked behind pay to use (I'd hiss but it's too sterotypical of a lizard so nobody would be sure if it was a good hiss or a bad hiss). You can also pay for the monthly premium (crafting bag is a total game changer, should NOT be locked behind Pay to Play!!!!)Despite the above, still got the love(and the reason it was free is a friend bought it for me) Thanks bro (name not added so you wont get spammed by a sudden rush of ""new friends"")"
Positive,"It is an Opulent free roam world with a rich tapestry of historical Lore and Flourishing Community along with continually updated content.  The community is highly diverse and generally companionable for an mmrpog. There are hundreds of (player run) Guilds to join which aid in customizing your experience.  Game Play / PvP : is fairly typical for this style of game now (2021).  It is easy enough for beginners to learn while enjoying and for seasoned players to also to have fun- especially at the veteran levels. There are periodic special events to gain mounts, pets, armor and weapons not usually available any other way.  Much of the game can be run solo, though there are 'dungeons' made for teams of 4 or groups (often whomever shows up at that time).  The team and group evens are far more difficult to handle solo if you get that chance.  There is a robust PVP system including a team system which has some larger team events than you can find in other games.  True hard core players may run through the core story lines quickly and not find over much of a challenge.  That being said however...World / Crafting / Housing : If your a player who enjoys exploring well created environments, crafting, or housing elements, you may love this game even if you find the game play itself easy or difficult.  You can choose to raise your character through  almost all crafting and little else.  Housing does not require more than one or two simple quests. Of course, having the experience, gold and materials to craft items and / or fill your homes is far more easy when you actually play at least a little of the story line and some quests.  Some houses can be earned for free through quests.  Most can be bought without furniture after you complete certain quests with game you earned from questing.  And of course, crafting allows you to make the items you want to fill up your houses.  RP : The Elder Scrolls RP is about as intricate as any game can get for this type and allows you a good amount of freedom as well.  The NPC's will even comment on things your character has done And some of the Choices your character has made which lead to a better experience.  There are many Guilds that are oriented towards the RP aspect of the game and add to this element.  If you stumble into some of them in towns and choose to engage with them 'in character' many will rp with your character on the spot as well.  Economy :  There is an ever growing economy in the game thru vendors of the various guilds and the Crown Store's content.  The Crown Store uses 'Crowns' which you purchase using real money to buy goods and items from ESO itself.  The content is updated regularly and has a good variety of useful and aesthetic items.  The Guild Vendors sell items the guild members, such as myself, have put up for sale from our characters.  Items such as potions, materials, armor, weapons, furniture, maps and more for in game gold.  Many special event and crown store items make it to the vendors for sale as well.  You can also make personal trades by talking with other characters/players directly.  Crafting for other players can earn a decent amount of gold and/or special items.  Cost and ESO Plus :  Normally the game is on par with others of it's type; a few times a year it goes on sale for about $10 USD which is a Low Price.  Often you can purchase the base game With a lot of DLC (Down Loadable Content) together for a good price.  ESO Plus is absolutely Not Needed.  I Do Recommend it especially if you plan to do any crafting or housing with your game.  On top of doubling your carried and bank inventories (great bonus alone) it gives you a 10% exp bonus to raise your character faster and doubles the amount of furniture/items you may have in your houses.  There are also some Crowns each month or when you pay in advance based on how many months you bought, some items given to ESO Plus members for free in the Crown Store along with a good number of random temporary discounts.  The best thing about it however, is the Unlimited Craft Bag.  You get unlimited storage of All Crafting Materials.  You can have 1,000 unique crafting material items and you're alright with it where as your standard bank inventory may only be 600 items.  With different crafting materials for each level from 1 through 160 for 3 categories of armor, about 7 'metal' weapon categories, about 5 wood weapon categories, shields, jewelry, 4+ types of drinks, 4+ types of foods, potions and Then housing items for each type of room from conservatory to lighting to tools I'm sure you can see how helpful that unlimited crafting bag becomes.Conclusion:  This is a well laid out, beautiful to roam through and play in world with something for almost everyone.  The game moderators and community have kept it a nice place to game and ESO updates content continuously.  Even if you leave for a while, most players end up returning.  I highly recommend ESO."
Positive,"It has gotten so much better since release and continues to improve! Best Money for content an MMO has ever offered. Subscription is actually worth it from the crowns you get alone, never mind unlocking all content except the current chapter! If you love Elder Scrolls and love MMOs, you are going to love this!"
Positive,You can play as a cat girl. Pretty good.
Positive,"Best MMO around, not a money grab not a unfinished product just a solid MMO with an amazing lore"
Positive,"Never got into WOW, but i'm trying to get into this, but I like it alot, all the single player aspects of it are super sweet."
Positive,its good but is a pain in the ass to set up
Positive,"The map is a little difficult to work with but i'm old, 70  so I'm having immense fun with it. I'd recommend  this game highly! I no longer recommend this game. There are too many mistakes that are no longer getting any solutions. Fix the  mistakes instead of making some more."
Positive,"Though, personally, It feels a bit strange since I love TES from its lore/story point of view Now I know why ppl not recommended it if you're looking for the lore-friendly, lined, or whatever it called, as from previous TES series. Well its not broken....it just kinda weirdBut as MMORPG, this game is really good. Greatly recommended to play with friendsThe controls are a bit complex comparing from previous TES but still easy to learned and kinda fun. Its MMORPG after allMy only complaints are 1) I've spend like 3 or 4 hours to downloaded 60's or 80's Gb (CMIIW), I still need to spend another couple hours to download patches, etc etc. That is...I don't know...around 90+ Gb or 100+ Gb in total???? 2) Crown system............just to open Imperial race -_-"" Overall its still......acceptable"
Positive,"Let me first say, I have about 3K hours on the Xbox version. I spent 8 months away from this game, trying to find the best MMO out there for me. BDO, SWTOR, GW2, WoW, Neverwinter, ect you name it. And after those 8 months I can happily say.. That Elder Scrolls Online is still my favorite. This is one of the only MMO's that feel quality to me. It most certainly has the best PvP, and has alot of very nice PvE just as well. Half of MMO's these days only care about the PvE.. Where as this one cares alot about it's PvP (Probably half the players mainly play PvP) It is very much so alive and well, community is great. One of the highest quality MMO's currently. My personal recommended. I look forward to many more years of the best MMO, ESO.    Ps, please add voice chat for PC.. I miss it greatly from the console versions. Everyone does. <3"
Positive,"After about 180 hours of playtime in this game, I finally feel i should do a review for those players out there who dont know if this game is worth its price... So let me get this straight, it is definetely worth it.So you might have heard alot of bad things about the game but that just come from people who used to play the game back when it was buggy and pretty much not worth it.. So I am going to write why I like this game more then any other MMORPG out there. - Fluent and immersive combat system- Epic Storylines ( Havent skipped a single dialog)- Stunning graphics ( considering it is an mmorpg)- Not pay to win- Interesting PVP/ PVE systems- Opened customization optionsIf you love the elder scrolls story, you'd love this game considering it is set a thousand years before skyrim. You should try it out... really"
Positive,"Got killed by a random filthy khajiit nightblade in cyrodil 10/10 would recomend Gets boring after a while sadly Like most mmos, end content becomes just grinding and farming dungeons or the ocasional pvp At least its getting updated regularly"
Positive,Love the fact you can play this game without a subscription and not feel limited.
Positive,"Great play, stories, quests, dungeons and delves with many public events. Great fun.."
Positive,"Decent game, it's hard at first because you can't explore the whole world, there are different levels of enemies that will just destroy you if you walk out."
Positive,"For the record, I know that Skyrim was an amazing game, but I am not a single player game kind of guy so it wasn't really my thing.  I loved the combat and the story was cool but I wanted a multiplayer version of it.  This game is a perfect fit for the multiplayer skyrim thing I wanted.  It's story is interesting, the character creation is complex, and the combat system is good.  I highly recommend this game."
Positive,"If you are looking for a game to have fun, if you have friends/family/couple to play with, if you like MMOs or you really want to try one, that is the game I would recommend to play. The game beside having the good graphics, has a lot of content, even if you don't buy dlc s. Let's not even talk about the music, it is amazing.In the game you have 6 nice classes, some racesAnd it doesn't matter what or who you choose, you are going to rock it.Super enjoyable, very interesting, you really want to pass all the missions.For me, the game is 10/10. Really worth it"
Positive,"This game is a lot of fun and definitely my favorite mmo to date. It has so much content and almost every quest I have come acrossed has good voice acting (something not a lot of mmo's can comprehend nowadays).This game can easily be played by yourself or with friends because enemies scale with your level and it's not an extremely grindy game. It takes some time to get to level 50 and get your champion level 160, so you mise as well listen to what the quest giver has to say, otherwise you will wonder why you're in a new zone called couldharbor with blue fire all over the place. Here's some gameplay with me and my friends:All in all I think this is a great game with lots of promising features. Just don't fall into the money trap like I did.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT putting any money into crown crates for any apex radiant mount, they are extremely hard to get and the only way to get them is through RNG.Here's a website to get a generalization on your chances of getting a radiant apex mount:https://www.crowncrates.com/EDIT: 7/13/20They took away the ability to queue with friends in battlegrounds (BG) making BG's not fun to do. Instead of them taking BG squading away, what they should've done is add a separate  queue for BG's. I would've been more than fine if they added solo and a squad queue, but that's just too hard for zenimax isn't it...EDIT: 5/19/21I want to revisit my review because it is outdated and some of these things are not true anymore.First off... Battlegrounds re-added group queueing. they also added a seperate queue in battlegrounds for solo players. Even more exciting news is that radiant apex mounts are no longer obtainable by only peer chance. They can be obtained the old fashioned way still, but now you can buy them with crown gems (which in my opinion should have been a thing from the get go)."
Positive,For 20$ this game is full of content that even if you are champion 130+ you will still have a lot to see and explore so i absolutly recommend buying this gameBut please fix and optimize that ridiculous space this game takes on the hard drive
Positive,"Great game, with flare, but don't expect a online version of skyrim. This game is more like a real mmo rpg...maybe like WoW but with more of a story I guess (pls don't hate me for that statement, only played it for a few hours once '^^)"
Positive,"I bought this game when it first went F2P. It was frustrating, grindy, pay-for-convinience out the ass, and all-in-all a terrible game in my opinion. I had little hope coming into this expansion.Holy f****** shit did they improve this game. Everything is better, easier to use, you feel much more powerful as a character even in lower levels, the amount of character customization and builds is insane, everything feels very balanced, the world feels much more alive and accessible, and the leveling experience is enjoyable to say the least.I have never enjoyed leveling in an MMO. In MMOs I do 2 things, min/max for competitive play and role play. Role play is alive and well but I never felt the urge to really research into min/maxing my character because of how much fun I was having.Even if you've played this game before when it was terrible, give it another chance. You wont regret it."
Positive,This game is increadibly addicting. The maps are beutiful and the quests are fun. Love how random bypassers can help you finish of a taugh enemy.
Positive,Tamriel Unlimited is no the full game. if you have the money just buy tamriel gold Edition
Positive,"In this game I get to travel back in time more than Dr Who,The Terminator,Marty McFly and Doc Brown put together"
Positive,"I'm speak for the TES Fans here.Definitly you should buy this game because if tells the story between oblivion and skyrim. In every steam sale the game become discounted so buy it when you see the good price. And also consider this you will get a game with 3 differen story, so its like buying 3 different TES game. also graphics are great animitions are very good and its standart is not below the standart TES games so DO NOT think being MMO will not reduce your TES pleasure.For the MMO player who likes for the good story and some fun (WoW players or other  PlaytoFun Online games) I'm  going to recommend the game you will understand noting at the start of the game because I assume you know nothing about Tamriel. But by reading books and reading wiki you will understand.For The Competetive MMO players (Knight, Silkroad, etc.)I WON'T recommend the game you and people like you make eso look like crap game. So STAY F**KING AWAY !!Update:I definitly recomend buying with new DLCs, this  DLCs hasa a story and a new region in the game  and they are awesome."

Positive,"Great game , great loading screen artwork but too muck disk space, and too expensive crown...."
Positive,"I am rewriting a review I had already written since I retried the game and I, quite frankly, like it more now.I figured out a few things as well so here are the pros and cons in short:Pros:~Cheap to get into~It's Elder Scrolls. Big plus for that~There are people playing, contrary to a lot of MMOs. Not that many, but enough.~Incredible world. Not as big as it should be, but, one of the best in ANY game.~Incredible Open World PvP. It's restricted to one massive zone, but it's absolutely breathtaking.~Great music, average graphics, optimized well enough, quite a few options and addons~Above average character creationCons:~Bad classes~Unbalanced PvP~Absolutely Horrible grind to get to max level and to get gear~Lots of usefull things are locked behind a paywall even to ESO Members~Terrible leveling experience for the first time~No sense of factions or races or classes~Combat is revolutionary but annoying~Tanking below averageAt a bit more length:First things first, the classes. To any MMO veteran, you will be confused as to what class to pick to suit your role (Tank, Dps, Heal) as there is actually no discrimination between classes. You can pick whichever class you want, whichever race you want and do what you want to do, which might sound awesome at the start, but the fact is the game gives you literally no information as to what each class is like. That means you have to resort to third party sources.Once you level you are supposedly allowed to play your class however you may. Which is not true. You can start building however you want but eventually you will get to the point where you do 0 damage compared to everyone else, you will have no survivability and your resources will probably be botched. So, by the endgame you need to resort to builds that are used by the community, so there goes the personalization aspect.In all MMOs I have been a tank. Not in this one though cuz tanking is boring. I like the fact that you need to taunt targets and its not like in WoW where u can keep aggro by pressing 1 spell every 10 seconds, but having to taunt EVERY SINGLE target OVER and OVER and OVER for the whole fight is just absurd. There is absolutely no way you will ever keep aggro as a tank through the threat table so you are resorted to taunting everything, or just be lazy and stay on the boss and let the healer deal with it. That just sucksHealing in dungeons is super easy but on open world PvP for someone who is not an expert healer its just impossible. I was never that good at healing so I cant tell you much.I do DPS now though, on multiple classes on multiple builds and it's fun enough. Rotations are complex enough to divide players to skill groups. Only issue is that most classes play exactly the same and revolve around the same 5 or so skills. And 5 out of 12 skills common on all characters is too much. That means that all dpses using the same type of damage (weapon damage) will have some abilities in common, and again you only get 12 so having 3 to 5 abilities in all classes is just not that great. And that goes for both types of damage.The first thing that you will see when you enter the game is the world, and it is marvelous. I am a huge TES fan and I know plenty of the lore and what the map should look like. And I can tell you that quality wise it is perfect. Places like the Black Marsh, High Rock and Morrowind are spot on but for one thing. It's not up to scale. It would take you at least 10 minutes to walk from Seyda Neen to Balmorra in TES 3: Morrowind, but it takes you literally seconds to get there in this game. Therefore the island of Vvardenfell and many other zones are criminally not to scale.Leveling is one of the worst things in this game. It is the reason I quit the first time. You start off doing barely any damage, and as you level, all the way to level 50, you deal more and more damage. But, once you hit max level you fall into this pit where you are so underpowered a new level 5 player can easily 1v1 you. That is because of the way the world works. Everything has a set level and health, no matter your level everything will be the same, so the game has to compensate for that by making sure you are not too weak but also not too strong. They failed so horribly at that, it makes the game so frustrating you have to struggle to get out of that hellhole that is low level Champion ranks.And there are at least 1000 Champion ranks right now, and you can get max 5-6 per day for each character. That is at least 5 months of playing EVERYDAY for at least 2 hours just to hit the real level cap. You can start doing endgame content a little bit sooner.But once you get to around 200 Champion ranks stuff gets a bit easier, and now you can go make your first alt, and they will be way more powerful since the Champion system is account wide.But that happens only the first time you level. The worst thing about this game is the loot system. I did the same dungeon 24 times (I counted) just to get 5 pieces of armour. And it was one of the most played dungeons so it was easy to get a group. And I still didn't get the whole set. That's how ridiculous the RNG can get. You can literally get the whole set in 1 go or you can probably never get it. And that is the reason I stopped playing this MMO and probably won't play it again. Getting gear is absolutely stupid and one of the worst grinds ever.At least the grind in other MMOs is progress based. Every minute you spend grinding you work towards your destination. But here, you can spend hundreds of hours doing the same content over and over again and NEVER get what you want. So that's the main downside of this gameYou can roam around the world and quest freely anywhere at anytime, which is nice but it kills any sense of belonging to a faction or a race. You can be a member of any of the three alliances which are at war with each other but still go questing in the others' territory which is stupid in my opinion. The main quest is mediocre but for some fucking reason, you can't chain complete the quests. Every time you finish one, you need to run out of the stupid cave you start them all from, walk around for a few minutes before this dumbass comes to tell you that you can do the next quest. Why on earth would you do that?Open World PvP in Cyrodiil is super fun, since its huge battles with dozens of players at any given time, but Battlegrounds are horrible at the start due to the whole class balancing issue and leveling experience.Dungeons are quite fun and you will end up doing them for most of your time.And lastly there are a lot of things to do around the world, like collecting, crafting, exploring (which rewards with experience which is nice) and a great many other things.The game is 20 euros right now, so its very cheap, and you dont need to be a member to enjoy it, I highly recommend you give it a shot, and you just might like it enough to keep going."
Positive,Hell of a fun game.
Positive,It's great for people new to MMOs. Just don't go in expecting multiplayer skyrim.
Positive,"Love this game.  No, its not an MMO version of Skyrim but still very good, and I'm glad I played Skyrim so much because it at least made me familiar with the names, places, and general storyline.Really like that there is a first person option - I wouldn't have played it otherwise.I've had very little to no trouble with glitches, lag, etc.The only thing I don't lilke is that Craglorn is meant for groups.  I don't play in a group much so that area is pretty well inaccessible to me, kind of sucks.  The players I do group with on occasion are a number of levels behind me and can't play as often as I do so I'm stuck waiting for them to catch up before I can even consider going there.All in all I  have very much enjoyed it, and haven't yet been sorry I've paid my $15 for the month.Update March/2018 - been a long time and so much has changed... Craglorn is no longer just for groups and I love that.  I enjoy the addon DLC that is questing zones - Wrothgar, Morrowind, and soon Summerset.  Not so much the DLC that is comprised just of a few dungeons that need to be done in a group.  I get access to everything being a subscriber but if I ever quit subbing I would not purchase the DLC that is just dungeons.Being a ""Plus"" member is still worth the $17.99.  You get Craftbag, which holds unlimited crafting materials - being a crafter/collector/farmer that alone is worth the money to me, but  you also get a slight XP boost for levelling and for some crafting areas.  Plus also gives you some Crowns each renewal that you can use to purchase items put out in an ingame Crown store that is Zenimax run.  Mounts, costumes, potions, houses, furnishings.. the list goes on.  Thats the potential money-pit there as you can buy Crowns with cold hard cash too and it can get addictive.  But hey, it IS a business.  Thats a pretty thin update but worth noting that 4 years into it I am still playing every single day and still loving it."
Positive,Better then i tought it would be.
Positive,"Really good MMO RPG recommend it to wow players, and or anyone who is interested in fun and  challenging gameplay and  strategy!"
Positive,"!!DISCLAIMER!!= NOT A TRADITIONAL ELDER SCROLLS EXPERIENCE!Firstly I have to say since the release last year this game has made some improvements. And it is a fun game if you're playing with your friends. And its about to drop it's subscription requirement so that is why this game is ""recommended"" in my case. But it is a typical MMORPG and it does not really capture all the things we loved about Skyrim and Oblivion. Enjoyable yes. Dissapointing, yes as well. I'll list the games highs and lows and you can decide for yourself. I am a huge fan of the past elder scrolls games. I've played them all and fell completely in love. This game holds the elder scrolls name, but that is where the similarities end. Don't get me wrong. I'm not dissing the game. Its a good game. I'm just being honest. So many reviewers on other websites and youtube channels (ESPECIALLY AT RELEASE) danced around the differences, not really telling you what they are. If you want a elder scrolls experience, this is not the game for you. However, it's not your typical MMO either, and is a little more fun than most.Lets talk about some of the differences between elder scrolls and this game:The combat UI: The health, Mana, and Stamina bars are the same as they were in Skyrim; however the rest of the combat UI just doesn't feel quite right, it doesn't feel as smooth when hacking and slashing as it did in Skyrim, and it holds a little more of a typical MMO type combat, similar to the KOTOR online combat. This is especially true with the archery, where as in Skyrim and Oblivion archery was realistic and a little challenging to master, In ESO you basically just draw back, point it in the enemies general direction, let loose and the arrow will simply find its mark.The graphics: The graphics differ alot from Skyrim, but they are not bad. The character graphics are good, you can tell little things and aspects of your character, very clear and crisp coloring. However I feel like the graphics slipped a little from the realism of Skyrim into the un-realism of some other MMO's. It is only slightly though, they luckily don't even come close to the cheesy WoW graphics. This also depends on what graphical setting you run your PC on.The questing system: The questing system itsef is actually really impressive. The entire game is fully voiced, by wonderful voice actors. And the conversation with NPC's has a similiar look to Skyrim (just to give you an example). That being said, some of the quests are pretty boring, typical MMO ""go for"" missions. But there are several fun quests, and the game leans moe towards exploring than questing anyway.The weapons: I have to touch on this because a part of me was super dissapointed. I really dislike the way most of the weapons look, especially the one handed swords and bows. They just look cheesy and un-realistic. Now that being said, some of the weapons are alot easier to use than in past games, take a two handed sword or axe for example, in skyrim you were limited because they were so incredibly slow. They move alot quicker and alot more fluidly, which gives you the power of a two hander without a huge speed reduction.The PvP: Now this feature I like, I wish there was more of it. When you reach a certain level, you and your friends can besiege a castle controlled by other players, if you win, you keep the castle and get rewards. You can also gain and use siege weapons (like catapults and ballistae) If you control all the castles around the imperial city, you control imperial city and the highest scoring player on your team becomes emperor. There can be hundreds of players in PvP which makes it daunting, but fun at the same time.I hope you can see that this game is its own type of beast, if you want a elder scrolls experience, you're out of luck; if you want a typical MMO experience, you won't really find it here. This game is enjoyable but after playing it, I have to say I wish I would have waited for full ""free-to-play"" instead of paying 60 dollars for it. But if you've got the money, and can't wait to try this out for yourself instead of reading about it, go ahead. The subscription fee is about to be dropped anyway, but who knows how big a role in-game purchases will become. It may end up that we were better off subscribing. Just remember all the things I told you in this review, know what to expect so you're not dissapointed, and enjoy. I hope you found this review helpful."
Positive,"So lets talk the Elder Scrolls Online and take note of the date when I decided to write this as this is an MMO, therefore there's a good chance something changed upsetting the community. As ya know, MMO's tend to make some kinda change that upsets most of the community.Lets talk basic making a character and basic game play. Character creation is very nice, there's more in ESO then games like WoW or SWTOR, so in general you can make a fairly good looking character. I'll even go as far to say that it beats Skyrim somewhat. Note much like the games race each race in the game has a number of skills of their own. All of the races are there but I believe you still have to buy Imperials. Then it's picking a faction and class, and thankfully faction only really matters in PvP, this isn't WoW or SWTOR where if your friends picked Horde or Sith and you didn't you can still play with them. Class wise you have four classes from the base game, Dragonknight, Nightblade, Sorcerer and Templar. With Warden and Necromancer from the expansions.ESO uses a level/skill system, when you level up you can put a point into a skill and there's a ton of them. You have class skills, weapon skills, armor skills, guild skills, race skills, there's a crap ton of skills to pick from here. But that's sorta a nice thing. Want to be a Sorcerer but you wanna run around in Platemail while using a Great Sword? ESO lets you do that. Want to barge into someones home and lockpick chests and steal stuff off their dressers? ESO has a Thieves Guild that you can sell that loot too. Hey want to be a Vampire or Werewolf and I'm talking where you really are one not Role Playing one? Ask someone to bite ya.Gameplay wise it's less WoW and SWTOR, and more Star Trek Online or Neverwinter. You have only about five 'specials' along with a big ultimate in the hotbars. Remember they made this so one could play it on Xbox/Playstation so it's much more action based. I'm going to say right now it's not for everyone, I've noticed people love or hate that system. And me personally? I like it, I don't feel like I'm being given hotbar bloat like other MMO's tend to do.The game looks just pretty, my main character a Warden I got to level on Summerset and it's just a very pretty area and the game has a number of them. Music wise I've found myself enjoying the soundtrack, really the only time I'll flip on the Power Metal is when I'm PvPing.Now lets talk what may turn a lot of you off. ESO is a buy to play game with a subscription. You can buy the game and expansions and play without having to pay a few bucks every month. Getting a subscription however does unlock all of the DLC areas for free, lets you carry around every you want for crafting without having to worry about bag space, you get about 1500 Crowns the in game shop money every month along with some freebie as well. And yes there's microtransactions and the 'dreaded' loot boxes. However there's nothing pay to win about it, and you can turn anything you don't want into gems allowing you to buy something you may want down the road. Crowns can also be used to buy in game houses, however you can also grind up the gold to buy them.The next expansion is due out pretty soon as of writing this, and it's going to have in game companions that will join you as you run around, and will let you pick where you want to level a new character. And if you are thinking the game is going to be shut down, well now Microsoft owns it and it's clear they wanna keep ESO and other Bethesda games around for a long time.So over all? I think this is a good MMO for someone who's never played an MMO before. It's a good middle ground game that may not have the insane amount of content like WoW does. Nor does it have SWTOR's story telling. But it's got a good amount of content that will keep you busy for a while. Pick up the core game when it's on sale and try it out."
Positive,Nearly 800 hours in and feel like I am still a noob.Absolutely my favorite MMO.
Positive,"I have to say, this is the best MMO that I ever play. The alliance war is really awesome and exciting. If you love PVP, this is the game. I am playing from Indonesia. Whoever has problem with latency, I suggest you to use battleping. Do not try WTFast. I used it for while, it didn't help. My normal ping is 300-400ms (My internet speed 20Mbps), battleping reduce my ping to 270-300 which is really good (at least your latency is not red)."
Positive,I started playing on December 13th and I've already logged nearly 400hrs in this game. It's alright I guess. :P
Positive,One of the best game of all time very good
Positive,good for an mmo
Positive,put your money into this
Positive,married my wife in game and irl
Positive,"Ride a dog alongside your pet dog while solving mysteries with a stray dog, dog."
Positive,One of my favorite MMORPG games! I just wish I had more friends who played it becuase it would make the experience a lot better! It really is a great game and they continue to build upon the story and the world which just helps you get more invovled with the lore of Elder Scrolls!
Positive,"I haven't played MMOs very much so I'm not sure how this one stacks up against the others, but if you're a fan of Elder Scrolls, you will find a lot to love about this game. Even if you are hesitant to buy due to the MMO aspects, you can totally just ignore any multiplayer mechanics and just play it like a singleplayer Elder Scrolls game and it works really well. The graphics and environments are gorgeous, the quests are fun and interesting, and the combat is very engaging and varied. You can dive into the complexities of combat, crafting, etc. or play the game as simply as you like. If you're even slightly interested in this game, I say go for it. It's only 20 bucks and it goes on sale fairly often (I got it for $6 during winter sale but I'd gladly buy it for much more). You get a metric assload of content for such a low price. Sure it has microtransactions and DLC, but you can totally ignore all that and still have hundreds and hundreds of hours worth of content to play. You also get to have up to 8 characters for free, so there's lots of replay value in making a new character and choosing a different class, role, weapon style, etc."
Positive,"*EDIT: I came back for the period of the ""free to play"" event for people who've not bought the game yet. Was fun starting a new toon with people that are new to the game. Game is just so choked out by the genius lack of inventory space and such. Seriously, there are ""cash grab"" devs putting some sawed-off games out, but this is like a ""cash choking incident"".*EDIT: And another edit. I paid for another month of ESO Plus. I'm having fun now. Throwing my money into a digital pit, but I'm having fun. Join the BeamMeUp guild and some other trader guilds and you'll be set.*Edit: the Elswyr upgrade is worth it."
Positive,This is my review for the badge
Positive,Honestly the game sucks.
Positive,Fun game with friends.
Positive,"After only a few hours of gameplay I have barely scratched the surface of what the elder scrolls online has to offer. The elder scrolls online feels and plays like a traditional elder scrolls game. However it incorporates the qualities of a great MMO. I was able to really immserse myself with my favorite race and alliance. (High Elf, Aldmeri Dominion). The game offers a stunning immersive experience where you can explore all across tamriel. Even though the launch and initial beta was horrible, now it is a game worth purchasing. I recomend this to anyone who enjoys the Elder Scrolls Series."
Positive,"I played the beta and god damn it was awful. This didn't feel awful at all. Far, FAR better than I remember.If I was looking for an MMO to play right now I can imagine myself getting into this a lot. I only tried it because it was free weekend and I knew I owed the game another chance after all these years."
Positive,"Like all the other reviews, the player should think of this game as a MMORPG first and a Bethesda Elder Scrolls game second. Regardless, I've played a lot of MMORPG's and this is hands down my favorite. Everything is so easy to learn, the people are nice and willing to help, and every quest is exciting."
Positive,"Some angles about how I am reviewing this product...-I read a lot of complaints while it was sub-I read a lot of stuff was fixed when/around the time it went non-sub-I never played this game prior to it being non-sub, only after Tamriel Unlimited-I was never a 'hardcore' Elder Scrolls guy, though I did play Skyrim as a Thief-like class-I prefer PvP focused games over PvE (strange for an MMO player right?)What I think about this game I purchased. I am glad I did. I have been thoroughly enjoying this game. It engulfed me and I was starting to lose hope years after WoW. GW1 kind of did, but I played WoW during that time, so I had high hopes (and a long wait) for GW2 and was highly disappointed (though its fun, its missing all the things I loved about GW1). I haven't had an MMO grab me like this since WoW (I was like two weeks in when BC was released, and was mezmerized). I have played a lot of other MMO's, sub, free, pay once, etc. This one is the only one where the PvE has actually pulled me in. I think its due to the Elder Scrolls leveling system. It looks great. Feels good. Feels big. Lots for me to do. I think I have a long life ahead with this game. If the PvP is awesome, I will be on this for years possibly. I am a PvP guy not PvE at all."
Positive,"single player gets boring fast. when your playing with other people is when i gets fun. there are solo missions that make it so only you can play them, but they are few and far between, and their pretty fun as well. the group dungeons are fun even if you dont survive the first few hundred times you it makes it that much better when you finally do beat it. the emotes are funny at the best and worst of times. the game can be a little confusing at first. one you get the hang of it and start level grinding it can get fun in no time"
Positive,"The error ( Troubles with loggin in.) has been solved and therefor  I do encourage to play the game.  as  a non eso plus member with 140 hours in the game  I am now considering going for eso plus as the game gives a lot for free allread, No one needs eso plus to play , its just if you are a mats hoarder then you need it .  ifinitive mats bags rule :DThey continue to add DLC's als for free with as price just log in daily for example which most people do anyway., and much more gifts, gold, xp scrolls etc , free mounts,pets and even crowncrates."
Positive,"it is fun, fighting abilities are super customizable and you get to chose how you make toons/characters look with sliders for ;thiccness or thinness and stuff also has khajiit in it so that's awesome pawsome"
Positive,it is a game.
Positive,99% of the time Ihave no clue what im doing..
Positive,My cat died
Positive,"I got this game after 10 years of playing Skyrim (Mods included)Thought its gonna be similar but it wasn't.If you are new here you will be lost (get a friend who knows to tell you around, you can still play solo)"
Positive,"Definitely a fun MMORPG. My recommendation is to take it slow and enjoy all the game has to offer. It's not like Skyrim, but you can definitely treat it as a high quality single player questing experience.Also, when you are given a choice of tutorial, pick the Coldharbour one. This will prevent the main story from being given to you out of order."
Positive,"so I have played an additional 22 hours in this gameI believe I am only level 7 or 8 right now? I did some quests in the morrowind chapter, but then learned that the game actually starts in the alliance area called Daggerfall? which looks amazing. so yeah I learned how to do crafting, I have done side quests, but I have yet to play through the Base game Main story.I was simply impressed, the more I play this game, the more I like it. I think it is a decent MMO, and no video will ever do it justice.I will update this later when I have more hours played"
Positive,"ESO is a wonderful game with the classic TES atmosphere. I have not played a lot, but I already love it.+ It has good optimization while saving nice graphics.+ The quests are amazing and all are fully voiced.+ That charming music in taverns can compete with DA:I.+ ESO world is very beautiful and despite I do not like all this things about ashes and mushrooms, the Morrowind is my favourite zone.+ Crafting system has many interesting features.+ This game has nice friendly player community.- PvP system is interesting too, but Cyrodiil feels empty. It has all to have epic battles, but for unknown reason people do not use it. - Dungeons are a bit boring. I have not tried the new ones yet, but the old classic dungeons do not give that feeling of doing something great.Anyway, this game is wonderful. It is definitely worth your time."
Positive,"[DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THROUGH STEAM. You're setting yourself up for hours upon hours of login attempts and fails.]Fun, lots to do. Easy to get suckered into hundreds of hours of gameplay. Can be played individually if you're not into the whole multiplayer element - it gives you lots of opportunities to go your own way. (I am one of these people. Catch me swerving to avoid dungeon dailies.)HOWEVER, there are some major issues - 1 being the obvious, insistent, frustrating cash grabs. Buying the base game is required, which is to be expected, but after that you will be greeted every time you log in with the option to purchase a membership (the only way to get an unlimited inventory for crafting materials), crowns (in-game real-money currency), crown crates (loot boxes with ridiculously low drop rates for anything that's actually useful), AND ""story chapters"", which are a separate category from ""other"" DLC and is not included in the membership anyway. There is no corner of the game which you can turn to in order to escape from it wanting more of your money - the ""crown store"" and ""crown crate"" menus are always right in your UI.PvP is also sometimes super broken - a glitch exists (may have been fixed, this was a couple weeks ago) wherein about 20 opposing faction members appeared in our keep and camped our respawn point without having sieged at all. Servers are either fully crowded and super slow OR dead as night and super slow. Not sure about battlegrounds- I've never entered it because of how frustrated I've become with PvP as a whole in this game.That being said, I really do enjoy playing. It's relatively faithful to the Elder Scrolls lore while still being friendly to the MMO side of things. Again, plenty of stuff to do - I'm personally a crafter and have really enjoyed the systems involved, especially the recent update to craft jewelry (HOWEVER, it is only possible to get ""certified"" in jewelry crafting unless you've purchased the applicable ""story chapter"", see above cash grabs). There's a great community (especially when compared to other MMO's) and someone is always willing to help if you're stuck or need a hand."
Positive,"Someone who play multiple mmos though out the years i find ESO enjoyable and sense of adventure. it a love and hate for the leveling system but man it feels refreshing to go into zones that suppose to be higher level then you and explore and do quest or just watch other players fight monsters. downside is you have to replace your gear often or regrind the gear you are using. basicly higher you level the weaker you become but in exchange you have more skills, passives, and potions. so think of it more of a growth of understanding the game then being a one man army. when you get into the game dont think of it as skyrim think of it as a mmo. for someone who just recently started these two week it fun going to dungeons and being with highbies. most games highbies/soloers just solo the whole dungeon and you just leech or not contribute. but here it like playing with a glass cannon they do damage but they get blown away if they dont see red markers as a threat.the bosses in the game are punishing but very intresting and fun to figure out - it could be a female warrior who uses AoE orbs on the field and teleport into them summoning minion (you can die by them if you are careless and dont deal with them cause they dont despawn) , to a 3 boss fight where they can revive each other if you dont take all 3 of them out, or maybe a spider who has a deadly toxin in which your tank party member have to run to the center to turn it off or everyone dies, to a mage who pulls everyone in puting a instant kill debuff and u have to roll away from the red zones to survive. even tho there late content, when playing the game, take your time and enjoy the game no need to rush to end game when in fact you can pretty much go anywhere."
Positive,"Too much focus on crown store, combat could use a lot of improvements, feels old already. Would be great if they stopped limiting the game because of old consoles. Still a great game tho"
Positive,One of the best MMOs
Positive,"Love this game,but I also love the Elder scrolls lore which helps alot. If you are thinking of buying this game,dont have the mindset of ""skyrim online"" cus it's not. It's an mmo in the elder scrolls world and you should treat it like that.The game have improved ALOT since it's release,it's basically not the same game. Since the ""One tamriel"" update the game feels more like a ""normal"" elder scrolls game,in the sense of exploaring and stuff. You can pretty much go and do whatever you want,since the game is scaling to you.The game is alot more fun when you play with friends,if you dont have any who are playing,I would recommend making some in-game. There are plenty of friendly players out there!"
Positive,"An absolute joy to play.After 5000 hours in Guild Wars 2 i felt i neededanother MMO to play around in for a while.And i am very impressed. I bought this game after therelease of tamriel unlimited, and as far as i can tell, mostpeople that felt the game was bad when first released,changed their minds when this expansion was added.The music and the atmosphere in the game is fantastic.The graphics are awesome, the optimization is awesome.The community is very friendly and social.I have played this game for about 50 hours so far and barelyscratched the surface. The world is gigantic with hundredsupon hundreds of missions.And all this without monthly payments. Thank you!I really love playing this game.Highly Recommended."
Positive,Amazing game as long as you remember its not supposed to be Elder scrolls 6. Best played with others
Positive,"So I bought this game and wait 2 and a half hours for it to downlaod (56 GB). After waiting this time, as you can imagine, i was hyped to play it. Opened game, client put up and started dowloading patches. This took a futher 30 minutes. Finally after 3 hours of waiting and watching this game download, I was finally able to play, or so I taught. Created an account signed in and went to go finally play the game.*pop up* ""The European PC/Mac megaserver is currently unavailable while we perform maintenance.""10/10 would download again, great game!"
Positive,"MMO aspect ruins the feels. But still Elder Scrolls in most aspects.If you dont want to miss out on visiting the rest of Tamriel, you are out of options. Bear with the other players randomly running about and killing your experience, literally."
Positive,"With the new updates they gave the game it made it the game people wanted, whatever you initially heard about the game, forget that and read reviews that are recent after the updates. The game really feels like I took any of the elder scrolls games and put it on multiplayer. With the justice system and ability to steal and murder, the great combat system and ability to customize your character, I have to say this game is worth the one time $60 payment and you should really give this game a try, it has become the elder scrolls online people wanted!"
Positive,"I'm not sure what everyone's problem is, but I am really enjoying this game and haven't had any problems signing in or anything and I bought it here on Steam when it was on sale. I have played every Elder Scrolls game since Daggerfall and though I may be a little biased, I will try and give an even review.This game isn't perfect and I will agree with some reviewers that it lacks in some depth. It doesn't have as much depth as its predecessors, however I feel it has more depth than most MMOs. I've yet to join the fighter's guild or mage guild, yet so I'm not sure how far those take you. But, this game has a deep back history that is revealed in the books you can read and the class/race story line type quests. You can really feel each area is uniquley designed for the races that live there and they are fun to explore. The ambient sound, typical Elder Scrolls voice acting, and great music are all there to draw you in along with some good graphics. I only say good graphics, because I feel they are a little dumbed down to MMO proportions.Quests: Do you like to group? Go ahead. Do you like to solo? Go ahead. So far, I feel the quests have been a lot of fun and refreshing from the typical MMO grind and collect type quests. I cannot say for sure how it is in higher levels as I have only put 11 hours into the game so far and have tried creating multiple classes/races to get a feel for each one. I keep waiting for the typical quests to pop up, though and I've yet to dive into any PVP action.Gameplay/Skills: I like the idea of selecting certain skills paths and having those morph and upgrade. Every class can use magicka type spells/skills and/or stamina type weapons skills. The downside is that you can only have so many skills on your skill bar at a time, but this leads to some strategy as to how you want to build and play your character. The other fun aspect is actually fighting in typical Elder Scrolls fashion: click the mouse to attack, hold down for more power, right click to block, and so on. No auto-attack! Also, the mobs move around, dodge, and block. I feel like I am actually playing the game instead of hitting numbers on my keyboard at static enemies.Crafting: Get ready to loot every box and barrel as there is a whole lot you can do with crafting. From cooking some food to give you stat upgrades, to smithing weapons/armor, and to alchemy, crafting has something for everyone that lends to better equipment, etc. You can also craft/wear any style of armor you want or use any weapon. Each type of armor also has a skill tree that provide help for you character.Character creation: As in Elder Scrolls fashion, there are almost too many options! But this leads to some cool character designs that can help everyone stand out from each other. Although as I've said and the game description says that you can play any character how you want, there are some drawbacks as each race has certain strengths in certain areas. LIke the Redguard lend themselves to fighting or the High Elves to magicka. But a magicka shooting High Elf could use a two-hander or a Redguard sword and board tank could throw some magicka skills out there.The only caveat: Pay to play... Sometimes its hard to bite down and pay per month when there are some good free to play MMOs out there, like Rift.I agree with the metascore at 71/100 and could say that it could go a little higher to 75/100. If you like the Elder Scrolls series and enjoy playing with other people, then give this game a try. If you're new to the series, I think this game will provide a lot of fun and interest for an MMO that lends itself to play a character as you want. Not to mention, a strong history with a series that really laid the groundwork for many RPGs and MMORPGs today. If you're still not sure, wait until it is on sale again and give it a try and if you still don't like it, cancel before the free 30 days is up."
Positive,This game still gets updated regularly and it deserves more players.This game is such a masterpiece and it shouldnt be ruined due to a mistake at their launch.
Positive,"I stole an item from someone I killed, who also caught me trespassing. When I entered a town, the guard asked me to pay my bounty and they confiscated my stolen item.10/10."
Positive,"First thing I have to say about this game, don't expect it to be like Skyrim.It's not Skyrim, it's not Oblivion or Morrowind or any other Elder Scrolls game for that matter. It's a freakin' MMO, and feels like any other MMOs. So only buy this game if you really like MMOs or the such. If you'd rather not buy it to try it out, see if a friend has it and try it out. Then buy it if you like it.Now, for the actual review. ESO is pretty fun if you can get into it, and even more fun if you have friends to play it with. There is a MASSIVE amount of content in it. Many areas to explore, multiple dungeons to clear, and several playthroughs to be done. Questlines are different depending on which faction you side with, and all have a good amount of things to do.Characters feel like they have a lot of personality, and you will definitely find people you love and hate. Areas look pretty and are diverse from one another.Basically, if you like running around and killing things, you've come to the right place."
Positive,"To anyone considering trying and may ask for refund later cause it's sales time, download their launcher at their site so steam won't record your gaming time, for you will spend more than 2 hrs of ""gaming time"" downloading the game and it is stupid. If some other games like smite can download without launching why not this one. I personally won't ask tho, don't worry dev you have my money.So ok I've played outside of steam for more than 10 hrs or so and, well, it's a Elder scrolls themed MMO. If you know what MMO means you know what you should expect, also some back tracking which I don't like but could tolerate. You can't just go to any place you like, like every elder scroll game, but it provides a good amount of things to do, ""plot"" they may say, while leveling and building your character, and it's not bad to me. Maps are well built and it is fun looking around. Exploring every corner rewards you so called skyshed, you collect 3 and gain a skill point, but well, almost everyone on PC just install skyshed mod see where they are and take them directly lol.Still my character is too young to participate faction fight, will update if I am not getting tired of it when I got there, I mean if I get there eventually."
Positive,"Just buy it, you will love it! :D"
Positive,The only people who say ESO sucks are people who cant fathom playing other games besides LoL and WoW
Positive,"very good game, dont buy the steam version tho steam has issues with login in sometimes"
Positive,"Legit one of the best MMORPG  games out there imo, so if you're a fan of the elder scrolls series.  Then this game is right up your alley."
Positive,"This games amazing even with a potato pc I can get 50-60 fps sure when battles contaning large amounts of particles occur it drops to 20 but thats on my end, I haven't experienced any login problems with the steam version as of now and for every hour I've spent on this game its been pure enjoyment I'd highly reccomend getting and playing this game if you're concerned about the reported login issues buy it from another platform to be on the safe side. If you do buy this game I hope you enjoy it, and if you'd like you can add me @Hrnytinoker when in-game."
Positive,"This game won my heart since 4. April 2014. In that time the game was really different. Every zone was based on lvl difficulity. But everything has changed with huge overhaul called ,,Tamriel Unlimited'' which made ESO (The Elder Scrolls Online) very more replay-able when it is coming to the storylines, zones, grinding, dungeons etc. This game has good balance between PvP and PvE in my eyes. Yet PvP needs changes or update with new content, i could agree, but let's get back to story. This game offers so much lore and stories in each zone. I mean it's prequel to Singleplayer games. If you love Bretons, you can do Glenumbra and Stormheaven to know more about your race. Which is exciting. Each zone has to do something with race or religion or class. I love the depth into the lore specially lorebooks, there are thousands of them. If you are into this, you will love it! What i also like about ESO it's the exploring side, each zone is very unique and has amazing points and it is worth to take your time if you are doing some zone for the first time (I do not recommend skipping main story!) . I met such amazing people in this game thanks to guilds, you can be in 5 guilds! Which is very cool. So you can join for example housing guild, dungeon guild and have little bits of everything. Which is unique. I never saw that in other MMO Before. Let's go into Pros and Cons to make result! Pros:- Almost unlimited experience in world of Tamriel - Very good replay-ability - Very friendly community of players on EU- Housing is addiction - Exploring zones are fun, specially Expansion ones- Soundtrack is masterpiece - Main Story is very very interesting - Chapters system, ESO+ gives you almost all content (Except last released Chapter)- Companion system in Blackwood- Gearing, Many skill lines, you can make hybrid if ya want - Championship system, aster lvl 50 you have like 2500 another lvl, where you spend for passive stats, very handy! Cons: - PvP could need new content, honestly - Some bugs, which was not fixed since beginning - Some prices for houses via Crowns can be very expensive when you start the game - In the beginning it can be hard to make currencies (By the time being, it's get easy, i recommend ask players for tips!) - Grinding furniture is sometimes never ending story - Some things would welcome QoL improvements like older skill lines with neewer animations etc. In the total, my experience in ESO since 2014, is very great, i love coming back every year. And now, im not going stop play, as there is so much to do! Im giving in the whole result 9/10, because this game is very worth, if you are into TESO games and love to play with friends or solo! There is always something to do."
Positive,"I have issues with this game, but I also love it!"
Positive,It's a good game!
Positive,Great open world MMO with a lot of content and fun combat. PvP is absolutely atrocious and I would not recommend doing that.
Positive,"This is my first MMO, but I have to say I loved. I was really hesitant about it because I didn't know if I'd like it or not. But it has proven me wrong. It is now my top three favorite games. I recommend getting it!"
Positive,"Got a cat here. Friends passing by can touch her and click Like to pet her once. Award for good luck, Take My Points for infinite pets :)⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ＿＿　　　　　／＞　　フ　　　　　| 　_　 _ l　 　　　／` ミ＿xノ　　 　 /　　　 　 |　　　 /　 ヽ　　 ﾉ　 　 │　　|　|　|　／￣|　　 |　|　|　| (￣ヽ＿_ヽ_)__)　＼二つ"
Positive,"So, I own Skyrim on: Xbox360, PS4/PS5, Switch, VR on PC, PC standard & PC Special Edition, and while I only paid full $60 for the first version I owned (360) needless to say i'm just burnt out on the game. I come back every now and again, mod it, and play with said mods installed. But The main quests and nearly every side quest has been completed several times. I remember hearing about ESO back when it launched. I was 15 and saw the gameplay trailer, looked cool but the subscription aspect of it made it impossible for me to play. Fast forward to today (01/28/21) and I had NO idea the game abandoned the subscription model. Saw it on sale with all DLC for $20usd and picked it up. And HOLY SHIT it's so refreshing to have a new story in the Elder Scrolls world. I'm absloutly loving the game, especially since we won'y see TES6 unitl 2024 or later since B is working on Starfield atm. But I really am enjoying what im playing, even more so with friends. If you love skyrim but just want more, pick this up on sale... it's 100% worth the asking price at a discount!"
Positive,"is a great game, combat is great, my opinion the best of all other mmos. the story is all voice acted and good story! (most of the time) cash shop is very expensive to me but nothing is really needed from there. there are alot of DLCs which seems very expensive to catch up on after so long so ESO+ subscription feels more needed short term. My only issue is that all the best gear comes from DLC dungeons so you have to get them or just be weaker than everyone else. DLC dungeons are fun but cant be done with randoms due to the amount of mechanics in them and people refuse to learn themAnd ""Weaving"" a animation cancelling bug devs decided not to fix and has now become a feature thats expected in the end game."
Positive,"This game is one of a kind, it brings over so many of the amazing things that make The Elder Scrolls so unique and blends them into a mmorpg PERFECTLY. The combat is the best in the series, i went back and tried to play Skyrim and Oblivion and the combat feels like you are just slicing at paper compared to this. I bought this game about a week ago and I've almot put 40 hours into it, which has been all of my free time. Every night I keep playing until I look at my clock and say to myself ""oh shit its 4am"" which hasnt happen to me with a game since Legend of Zelda. There is SO MUCH LORE for you to delve into you could spend hours just reading things around the world if you wanted to. The quests for the most part are way better than Skyrim's thank god, everything you do feels like it has a purpose. The graphics are superb for an mmorpg in my opinion and I only play on medium with long draw distance, there are some technical glitches here and there with textures and other players' characters not appearing for a long time but nothing game breaking. I have yet to play pvp because I'm scared so I have no comment on that yet. My ONE gripe with this game is more of a personal one with me being an indecisive whore it took me 5 characters to find the perfect race/class build. (Breton/Templar) If you love Elder Scrolls games you'll love this. 9.5/10 indecisive whores.Seriously though, this is my favorite Elder Scrolls since Morrowind and I feel like over time it will even top that. Bethesda is going to have to step their game up for Elder Scrolls VI."
Positive,"As an avid fan of The Elder Scrolls series, I was excited to dive into The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) and explore the vast world of Tamriel with friends. After spending countless hours in the game, I can confidently say that ESO offers a unique and immersive experience, but it does come with a few drawbacks.One of the highlights of ESO is the sheer scale of the world. From the snowy peaks of Skyrim to the bustling cities of Morrowind, there's always something new to discover. The rich lore and attention to detail in the game world are truly impressive, and the ability to explore it with friends makes for a fun multiplayer experience.The gameplay mechanics are also enjoyable, with a variety of classes, races, and playstyles to choose from. The combat system feels dynamic and engaging, and there's a wide range of quests and activities to keep you busy. The game also boasts a robust crafting system, allowing players to create their own gear and customize their characters.However, ESO is not without its flaws. One of the main issues I encountered was the occasional lag and server instability, which could disrupt gameplay and make it frustrating at times, especially during peak hours. The game also has a steep learning curve, with complex mechanics and systems that may be overwhelming for newcomers to the MMO genre or The Elder Scrolls series.Another aspect that I found disappointing was the reliance on microtransactions. While the base game offers a substantial amount of content, the additional DLCs and expansions often come with a hefty price tag, making it feel like a pay-to-win model at times.Despite these drawbacks, I still found The Elder Scrolls Online to be an enjoyable adventure overall. The vast open world, engaging gameplay, and rich lore make it a worthwhile experience for fans of the series or MMO enthusiasts. However, the occasional technical issues and reliance on microtransactions can be a downside, and the learning curve may be steep for newcomers. With some improvements in these areas, ESO has the potential to be a truly outstanding game."
Positive,If youre interested in starting the mmo gaming genre this is a good game for you. It's a simple yet rewarding combat system with even more rewarding treasures. I've played in pc and laptop and haven't had an issue with startup in-game mechanics or graphics. This game gives you a lot of liberty with how you want to finish and play through the game by being widely open to add-ons. It's an mmo game you would have to try to have a true mmo experience.
Positive,SHORT SWEET REVIEWMY OPINIONOK so The Elder Scrolls Online is a great game.-graphicly its pretty darn great looking esppecially if you got a GPU with 2gb VRAM i makes the game look great.... for an mmo-Gameplay. well the gameplay IS ok THE STORY I wasnt that imppressed i played games that are better but its wasnt the worst.-levling. leveling under 50 to get to 50 was very boring for me honstly i got to 50 and been playing sence theres no longer VET ranks( veteran ranks) its now champion points(CP) and i went from CP 45 last week so the first week of june  and play here and there now im at 101cp so roughly vet 10 now SO ITS very addctive after 50-PVP ohh man pvp is awsome i do pvp everyday its really awsome you have keeps and forts and the enemy can take over by seige weapons its very impressave for me at leastALL IN ALL its a great game i got the imperial eddition for 35 bucks on steam sale so i didnt pay that much if i were you i would A get the normal one on sale OR do what i do and get the imperial eddition for 35 when the reg eddition is 29 so DO IT PAY THE EXTRA 6 bucks IF YOU can
Positive,"I don't get all the dislikes towards this game. This game is a MUST-HAVE for all the fans of The Elder Scrolls franchise. Considering the fact that most MMOs today have pretty boring storylines, this game is SUPERB! Its storylines are engaging. The execution of the dialogues are wonderful!The gameplay is fantastic too! You get a mix between action-combat and targeted combat, which is great. Do you wanna play it like Skyrim in first-person? Do it. Do you wanna play it like other MMOs in third-person? Do it. It gives you a lot of options.Also, there are a lot of content to be released through time so your money will NOT go to waste. It's buy-to-play now, so buy NOW to PLAY!"
Positive,"I have played this game on and off since it was in beta, and I also developed addons for it.I have to admit, that once you get used to the extra stuff that comes with a plus subscription, then it's very hard to live without (I always end up subscribing, when I return to the game).The game seems endless in regards to stuff to do, and it has very well made storylines.Voice acting is generally very good (I especially like ""pothead"" (Sir Cadwell), played by John Cleese).MOST of the game can be played solo, if you want to, but a few areas requires groups.I could keep writing, but want to end with this: Try it out on one of the free weekends, if you are not sure, or just start with the base game. Have fun ;)"
Positive,"daggerfall is back, with online.>we are watching you scum>>mmm...sweet mooon sugarb2p 10\10"
Positive,"Tbh I only played Elder Scrolls Online For the lore, the multiplayer aspect was ok"
Positive,"Although ESO is apparently not Cannon, it appears that they have more of an empowering story than the majority of storylines Elderscrolls have given us over the years. As much as we'd like to say how fun Skyrim was.... yeah, and this just seems to do it better. I've played as an Argonian dragon knight, and an Imperial mage, and ESO has been very fun to play.I've tried out the guild system, where you get a guild bank, guild trader, and your guild can take castles in the alliance war, upon where you become King, and if you're very good, you can become emperor.The sieging system is so fun, you can use catapults, trebuchets, ballista, burning oil, and a few other weapons to attack your enemies, and destroy their castles in the process. It is a brilliant side to PVP where you get that 'Feel good' moment when you ride with 24 of your friends/allies through the battlefield.As for the game, I haven't reached a veteran level, but at times it can be a little grindy, but overall a fun game, you can share your quests with your party members, so they don't miss out and everyone is caught up. Also - If you're in the same room as your teammate, when they pick up items for a quest, you do as well. Which is very nice when it comes to how long it takes to complete a quest.I would definitely, without a doubt, recommend this game. As for the lore side, people have given some bad reviews on the link to ES, but... with a game that by level 10, i've come across 90+ books, it can't be that bad, can it?"
Positive,Bought for $24 on sale.Downloaded SweetFX 2.0.No regrets.
Positive,"Run, shoot and kill everything what moves. Jump and run. Don't think too much. This game is faster than SKYRIM. Biggest disadvantage when compared to SKYRIM."
Positive,"This game is my favorite long term binge game. I have like thousands of hours, only 350 recorded on here because i owned it off steam first. The game is amazing and a blast to play with or without friends, although friends do make the boring aspects more fun, like gear grinding and queues.There's something for everyone. PvP in both small and large scale, PvE in large and in small groups, questing in a huge continent (base game has hundreds of hours of quests, dlc areas give u another couple hundred [per toon btw]), the story lines are almost fully voiced and most of the acting is spectacular, outfit styles are excellent, housing is like sims but with a lot more creepy/gross/cool furnishing items. Just want to RP in cool outfits? Literally what the elder scrolls series is best at. Sometimes I'll even just mute everything outside of the game and just walk through a zone I like because of the nature noises/music/immersion.Please though:If you can help it, if you're reading this before you buy the game. Pls do yourself a favor and buy it off steam. buy it from the official site. Steam servers are a huge issue and people can't connect to the game, often when theyre a steam user. It's always the same price as here, sure you don't get hours logged and don't get trading cards, but you'll actually be able to play the game.The devs care about eso, I care about eso. I want people to play this game and enjoy it. Nothing sucks more than enjoying a game and not being able to play it. Luckily I owned it off steam first but if I had gotten it from here I'd be upset and I don't want people upset at my game for an easily avoided problem. If you want to get it from here that's cool, just be aware of the problem first. <3"
Positive,2 many 2 do no friends 2 do with
Positive,Really good looking. high amount of quests and nice community. However you need a friend...
Positive,Did you know having the launcher open counts as running the game?
Positive,If you like Elder Scrolls and World of Warcraft this is the game for you
Positive,"fun game when it works, lots of bugs!"
Positive,11/10 I want my horse armour DLC
Positive,"After 2K+ hours of play time, i can honestly saythis game is funlyris thick af too"
Positive,This is a great game. I've played many hours. The mmo community is very friendly and I have met some really great friends along the way.
Positive,this game its best and I like it  recommend all who its not play it to try it
Positive,Much better now. Buy.
Positive,Best RPG games ever <3
Positive,"So... I played ESO while beta and had an imperial edition pack alas somehow it didn't strike me well. For me that was a bugged and mediocre product which has promises but not there yet. So i sold  my account to a friend of mine and walk away. Now 5 years later thanks to humblebundle i though i should gave another shot. I'm kinda suprised how much they developed the game, there was literally no bug in my seasons and game seemed much more fun than before. Great game if you,love single player experience,atmospheric games with intense immersion,lot's of customizations (skills, character, house etc.)crafting,roleplaying.Also i should mention they got really amazing voice actors and some really well made musics for your enjoyment. For downside, i can only point 5 slot skill system and ESO plus.Even game had tons of skills (active weapon skills, class skills, guild skills etc. etc.) you got only 5+1 lot to use them. I literally google it if i get wrong and nope it's just like that. For ESO plus i'm gonna explain at below.Now lemme give you a fair warning. Even ESO is free to play, ESO plus gaves you so damn much. First of all this game has huge amount of loots and normal players should manage their inventory (which is really low slot even if you upgrade quite few time) but ESO plus solves this problem as it gaves you unlimited amount of bag for your CRAFT Ingredients. Also it doubles your furniture limits as well as exp, money, craft bonus etc. etc. So for me it's litreally a must to have it. And downside is, it nearly cost double most of mmorpg's monthly subs. so it's pretty salty. Gonna thumb up for being a good mmorpg but i'm really torn apart due to it's high cost subscription."
Positive,yeah it's fun
Positive,"While not perfect, it is both a solid MMO, as well as a good-great Elder Scrolls Game"
Positive,"If you're a bit skeptical or on the fence like I was before I bought this game then wait till it's on sale and try it out - you can always refund it if you don't like it. A lot of people on here complain saying this game is disappointing, that it isn't a ""true Elder Scrolls game"". Well I disagree completely!This game IS a proper Elder Scrolls game. At its core it is everything you would expect from a proper TES game - freedom to explore, freedom to forge your own character and playstyle, freedom of choice and freedom of approach to situations - do you go into a dungeon shouting battlecries and swinging your battleaxe, or do you take the stealthier approach? Both can be done, and are not mutually exclusive at all - you have total freedom in skill choice. It plays very similarly to the older titles in general, and you start off as a prisoner, escape and then go on to explore the world as you see fit. There is no linear progression path like in other MMOs. You could start in Morrowind for example but run around the entire zone in an unrestrained manner, killing monsters and exploring dungeons and ignoring quests if you so choose.You can do almost everything in this game that you could in the older titles: Sneak around, steal things, murder people, join factions, make choices that affect the world, make your own unique character build, play in FIRST PERSON with the same / similar combat system to the older games with great new features, find hidden dungeons, secret lore, uncover mysteries etc. Even better is that more features will be added as time goes on.But what this game does also is enhance the experience by adding new features from other MMOs. This makes it feel fresh and new, because it combines the best aspects of the singleplayer TES games and MMOs like WoW - you have an action bar associated with your weapon, with abilities hotkeyed to the number keys, which you use alongside your standard attacks, power attacks, blocking and bashing. It breathes new life into the MMO genre I think by having a unique combat system that is addictive, intuitive, much more tactical, and above all FUN. It doesn't feel grindy at all either because the quests are all genuinely interesting and fun, the stories are meaningful and touching, as you would expect from an Elder Scrolls game, and the world is one I am deeply fond of and immersed in already from playing the older games for thousands of hours. Plus you can explore areas that haven't been available in a TES game since Arena or Daggerfall, like Summerset Isle and Valenwood - games which you can't exactly call high-tech. The music is another strongpoint of this game, because even though it's clearly been designed to be as ambient and non-intrusive as possible for the MMO format, you can still hear familiar themes rise up from the pleasant ambience from time to time, like Watchman's Ease from Oblivion and Blessing of Vivec from Morrowind. The theme is also excellent and was composed by none other than Jeremy Soule, adding to the authentic feeling of the game.Then of course you have the multiplayer. I have yet to experience this, but from what almost everyone else has said it is supposed to be excellent. Time will tell for me, I've only scratched the surface of this beautiful game.Speaking of beautiful, the GRAPHICS in this game are excellent and miles better than Skyrim's. The colours are vivid and rich, the shadows are excellent and free of striping that plagued the older games, all the animations are wonderful and smooth, the scenery is amazing and the flora / fauna of the world is highly consistent with older games - giant mushrooms, Alits, Netches and more in Morrowind for example. On top of all this, we get to meet characters that have always been mentioned in books in previous games but whom we never met -  Mannimarco, Molag Bal, Sotha Sil in the upcoming Clockwork City DLC, to name a few. Speaking of DLC, this game is constantly being updated. They frequently add new areas, such as the recently added Orsinium, and factions such as the upcoming Dark Brotherhood. Eventually I hope they will add every last area of Tamriel, especially Vvardenfell!I think ultimately that the reason someone would dislike this game is not because it's objectively ""bad"" but simply because it isn't their cup of tea. I however love it - I would go so far as to say that it ranks alongside the older, legendary titles."
Positive,I saw a dragon
Positive,"In the days of WoW, this kicks some serious butt."
Positive,"I'm no expert in this game, only about 150 hours into it, which isn't much at all for an MMO. As a casual and a novice, I can say that I enjoy the game. It's not the same type of game as say Skyrim, but it's still pretty fun overall. There are a ton of quests, and they are all actual quests. What I mean is, all the quests are a story you progress through, this game doesn't have 'quests' to go kill X number of Y like most traditional MMO games. The quests are fully voiced and most of them are actually pretty cool. The character building is pretty unique too, it's true to Elder Scrolls form meaning you can pick any class, put your points into anything, wear anything, use any weapon and select the skills you want. You want to be a Necromancer in Heavy Armor using a Bow? Ok.. you do you. It's highly unlikely anyone else has the same build as you unless you copied it from a site. All classes are viable, at least for Single Player PVE.. you're not going to pick a class then find out later that it's terrible. They're all good.Now the downsides, first would be potential cost. You have to be careful with this one, you can get the base game cheap and on sale it's practically free. This by itself is an amazing deal with a huge amount of content for very little money. If you stop there, you're getting huge value. Once you start adding in DLC areas though, things can add up fast. The easiest and cheapest way is to get the base game and then subscribe to ESO Plus to get access to DLC Areas. Even then though, you don't get access to characters like the Warden, you don't get access to Blackwood either. Blackwood was just on sale for dirt cheap, so you just have to be mindful and patient. Second would be, I am not a huge fan of only having 2 weapons with 5 skills each. You get a lot of skill options and a lot of interesting abilities, but you just can't slot most of them because you can only use so many. When you level, you only progress in skills you have equipped which is something to keep in mind. Slot the skills you want to advance in and make sure that weapon is active when you turn in quests. I haven't done group content yet, but I can say that this game is absolutely packed with players. If you're worried about joining a dead MMO, you don't have to worry with ESO there are players everywhere. Overall, given the content for the money, I would recommend the game. Just don't expect it to be exactly like Skyrim, the combat isn't quite as good but the game is huge, the customization is amazing, there is a lot to do and plenty of people to do it with. Overall, it's good value for the money."
Positive,"I personally don't like MMO's but this is a pretty good game nonetheless. Everything feels fluid and nice but also feels like an Elder Scrolls game, with WOW elements of course."
Positive,- This game looks great- This game plays great- This game is awesome for all ages- This game will suck up all of your time- This game is very rewarding
Positive,"So far, so good.  Only level 7!"
Positive,"As a fan of the magnificent world of The Elder Scrolls, this game brings me ultimate joy and happiness. And last but not least yes Lollygagging!"
Positive,Fun game.Not big on the combat system but I enjoy the richness of the stories and the depth of customization that you can employ.
Positive,"This game has a nice gameplay BUT THE CROWN SYSTEM IS FUCKING TRASH THEY DONT DESERVE ANY OF THIS SHIT , THIS MICROTRSA MUST STOP NOW !!! YOU NEED TO FARM EVRYTHING LIKE MOUNTS AND OTHER SHIT THIS IS AN MMO NOT A STOTE DONT 7 EUROS FOR 750 THATS TRASH ....... THANKS FOR YOUR TIME B"
Positive,"I used to hate this game when it launched, it was full of bugs, performance issues and it didn't really nail the feeling of a true Elder Scrolls game. But now, after trying it again after High Isle has launched, it caught me by surprise, big time!So first up, the game optimization is finally good, no complaints here. But the best thing that has improved, is the very game itself. They really nailed the feeling and captures the magic of a true Elder Scrolls game. Of course, this still isn't the mainline series, since it's an MMORPG after all, but that is what makes this game great in its own right. Elder Scrolls games are known for sinking a ton of hours into them, and so are MMOs. And this game mixes the best of both into one. And while I still prefer the mainline single player Elder Scrolls games, this is the game I wanted when I was thinking of playing Elder Scrolls with friends. I can have both now, and it's wonderful.The game takes a lot of inspiration mostly from Skyrim in terms of combat, interface and progression. I definitely prefer playing Elder Scrolls in first person for the immersion, and it's what I do here too. The third person is flat out better than any other Elder Scrolls game out there, so that's a huge win. It comes in handy for dungeons or when you want to see your characters, but while questing in the open world, I prefer playing in first person. But the ability to switch on the go works great here as well.The graphics look nice, especially in the expansion zones. Considering this game is from 2004, it still holds up pretty well. But God, the music is so beautiful. Many favorite themes of Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim are redone in this game, and they sound just as great. The combat is simple but does the job, and you can really customize your own build and similair to Skyrim, you get better at what you do. And many different zones from all of Tamriel are playable now. Even though the maps are smaller, it's great to discover many great different areas.But the best thing about this game, especially compared to other MMOs are the world, story and quests. Everything, and I mean literally every NPC and quest is voice acted, which is insane for a MMORPG. This really helps with making the quests and story even better. And the quests aren't your typical ""gather 10 bear pelts"" quests, even every side quest has a small story going for them, which is really immersive. But the story and zone quests is where things get even better, and tell even greater stories with in game ""cutscenes"" which is really worth playing on its own.I love playing this game solo and with friends, and you can really play at your own pace. You can go anywhere from the start and play every zone in every order. It even scales to your level, so you can flat out play with friends and newcomers as well. The community is the best I've ever seen in a MMO, and I literally get stuff daily for free from other players. They're really welcoming and helpful which made my experience so much better. So it's great to play a dungeon with friends, visit another player's house, to go back questing solo for that true Elder Scrolls immersive experience. Since vanilla, I always played World of Warcraft and not a single MMORPG has beaten that experience for me. But this may legit be the first time I have more fun and a more magical experience in another world, just because it's so similair how WoW used to be. A truly open world full of adventures, many great quests to discover, and a welcoming community. Things have changed there now, and all the old content is ""outdated"" besides the latest expansion, making the playable world really small.Elder Scrolls Online works hard to stay true to that experience, since everything is viable because of the scaled content. I keep discovering new beautiful places, engaging quests and friendly players in the world. If you're a fan of the Elder Scrolls, whether if you only want to play solo or online, I recommend this game. If you love MMOs and the story/questing experience the most, I also recommend this game. For me, it's both and that's why I fell in love with this game.This is now at the moment of writing this review, my favorite MMORPG of today. This is the first time World of Warcraft has been beaten, but only because it reminds me of the magic it captures WoW used to have. It's a Elder Scrolls experience with a ton of content, but then online, as the name suggests. Even though you trade in some of that true magic the Elder Scrolls games captures to play online, it's a worthy trade off to play online with friends/other great players. It's great in its own right and both experiences can live side by side. And how great is that we have both now? It's truly a great game to play if you played all the other mainline series and are waiting for Elder Scrolls VI. There's literally so much content that it can keep me busy for a very long time. If the game is on sale, it's basically a must have. You only pay €6 for the base game and €20 for the entire collection, so you get all expansions. So again, I can't recommend this game enough, especially for those prices. Just try it, it's amazing."
Positive,"This is probably one of my favourite games of all time. I love the sound design and scale of it. PvP and Solo play both very fulfilling endeavours. It's got the gameplay immersion level that Skyrim offers with the voice acting, story elements of Oblivion, a skill upgrade system that satisfies both rpg and action adventure fanatics..  don't see myself ever getting bored of this game! Would strongly recommend."
Positive,"Shortly the game is purely awesome. I was always a huge fan of MMORPGs and played many over last 15years but I must say this game is something special once you get into it. The first impression might feel a bit clunky and floaty movement but this goes away fast. Combat is very well dan and a bit fast paced. Quests are better than any other MMO I've played so far and are a real joy to read and go through. It is a great experience if You are solo player as well, the world is massive and active with players. I've been looking for a great MMO after I stopped playing WoW and GW2 and this surpasses them on many levels. PvP is awesome, PvE content is amazing and really the only serious flaws I can find is the Interface, that in some areas feels a bit complicated and not very intuitive at first but that goes away as you get used to it. The second flaw is the price of all DLCs you need to get in order to fully experience the game. That again can be solved by monthly membership fee if you don't want to buy all DLCs separately.Anyways to conclude, This game is a must for every Elder Scrolls fan out there and definitely worth playing if You are looking for MMO to fill your days with quality content."
Positive,Great game...big piece of art. 10/10
Positive,"This game is insanely fun, and a lot of the quests suprisingly are actually unique.(I own the steam version of the game.)"
Positive,its good with friends without them its very lonely as you would expect from a bethesda game
Positive,"I have spent the past year of my life on this game, i think it's amazing. Love it so much. HOWEVER do not buy it through steam! There's so many problems during updates that are not a thing when you buy the game directly from Bethesda ^^"
Positive,"Not sure why I keep seeing reviews stating ""remember it's an MMO though"" All you've got to do to make it feel like a single player elder scrolls game is turn off zone chat and bam, you're alone, adventuring across tamriel, doing fun quests and killing enemies in a huge variety of locations, which by the way are beautifully done. This game allows you to interact with the daedric princes like never before. The pvp aspect of it is very fulfilling, it feels like I'm actually acomplishing something by raiding then capturing keeps, elder scrolls and resources, all with the help of giant trebuchet's, catapults and ballistae. Oh and flaming oil, who could forget dumping a pot of flaming oil onto a room full of unsuspecting enemies? It's great and if you've been on the edge of whether or not to buy it the best time is probably right now with the sale going on and the new update that is coming next month."
Positive,"I was a little harsh in my first review of the game, probably becuase of it being only just released. now there have been massive improvements to just about everything (or atleast I think so) also,very important, make sure to raise the graphic and textural settings, it makes quite the difference. perhaps not the best Elder Scrolls game, but a pretty solid game none-the-less."
Positive,"ESO is a captivating story-driven MMORPG set in an expansive and immersive world. The narrative is exceptional, particularly for enthusiasts of TES lore, while the gameplay is engrossing and interactive. Every quest is voice acted so you can fully enjoy the game's quests and delve into the world without having to read extensive amounts of text. Surprisingly, the quality of the voice acting in ESO even surpasses that of other Bethesda games (e.g. Fallout 4)."
Positive,i like itfirst person could look better
Positive,Don't verify the game cache on steam. Just don't. Please.
Positive,"Pros:7 million playersVery active YouTube and Reddit communityVery, very friendly community. Probably the nicest playerbase I have ever seen for a gameNot at all pay to win. There are microtransactions, but it's all for DLC and convenience type stuff. (i.e. mounts, storage)Great graphics, especially considering the genreEvery single NPC is voice acted. That's why the download is so hugeInteresting storylineVery little grindingLevel progression is very niceEqually fun to play by yourself, with friends or with strangers. Cons:(Not really a huge con, but) ESO doesn't have quite as much of a sandboxy feel as Skyrim.(Also not a huge con, but) with the huge amounts of character customization, this game can be a little daunting for new players. But then again, the community is so helpful and active that you shouldn't have much trouble having your questions answered on Reddit, or even in game."
Positive,"I'm an MMO newcomer, and I enjoy this a fair bit. It is a pretty damn good adaptation of the Elder Scrolls games into an MMO. It's VERY solo friendly, which is awesome, and some great UI mods make it immersive and exploration friendly. I use Wykkyd's Immersion and True Exploration (by Shinni) which help make it less of a follow-the-quest-arrow experience, and more like roaming through a strange, distant land. Combat is pretty fun, and rewards positioning and light tactics, way better than just managing cooldowns. Your character yells a lot in combat, making it sound like she's falling down stairs. It's also remarkably easy to join a friendly guild, group up, and find a dungeon to run through with others. I found the level 1 dungeon I did pretty rote - the boss fight was about whittling down a health bar, and barely engaging - but the level 2 version of that dungeon, the Veteran dungeon, required close teamwork to get to the boss, and I still haven't beaten her, after perhaps 15 attempts with two different groups. That's cool, and shows the high level play can get interesting. 9/10 would listen to my character fall down stairs any day."
Positive,Best MMORPG ever created.Best lore ever written.Best soundtrack ever composed.Best character freedom ever made.Best universe ever created.
Positive,this game ruined my lifehad fun tho.
Positive,still investigating if it's worth playing
Positive,I liked it. Fun game. Wish it had a auction house. I tried a few guilds but it's so limiting. It has the graphics that I wanted. I like crafting but end up selling all my excess gear for measly gold pieces at a merchant. Maybe I'll try a different genre for another year.
Positive,"Really great MMORPG with a lot of single-player features. Gameplay is immersive, so watch out you don't lose track of time (as I have done COUNTLESS times). The community is the best I've experienced in any other game I've ever played, hardly any toxicity at all. Everyone is very welcoming to newcomers and is willing to help if you need it. If you're looking for an MMO to lose yourself to, here it is!"
Positive,Love this game alot! hope content gets better than it already is
Positive,"Ok so before you go all ""OMG YOU HAVENT PLAYED MORE THAN 1874658716587613 HOURS YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOURE TALKING ABOUT"", I just want to point out that this is my initial impression of this game. I also want to point out that I was part of the beta so the hours i got in then aren't being properly represented.The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited on its face (which is just about all that I've seen of it) seems to me like it's pretty simple and uncomplicated. This can be both good and bad things depending on how you look at it. For example, the main hotkey bar has a total of 7 slots (5 primary abilities, 1 consumable slot, and your ultimate ability) This is a good thing for people who don't have a lot of experience with complex MMO's as the UI is very simple and very easy to understand. However, I'm not new to MMO's and frankly, the small hotkey bar is really frustrating to me as i cant have a macro for everything i want to have in a particular character build. Although I feel that this might have been part of the design as this game will soon be coming to Xbox One and PS4 this summer. I have a bunch of other points that i could touch on, but I'm going to try to keep this review short and sweet.Pros+Excellent Graphics optimization (you could play this on a toaster and it would look great)+Very Simple UI (great for people who are new to MMO's)+Intercharacter Storage (something they don't tell you that you should probably know about, if you make an alt, you can access everything that your other character has in its bank. I didn't know about this and when i went to the bank on my alt, I thought i was losing my mind.)+LOTS OF GUILDS (your character can be a part of 5 guilds at any time which is nice because you can be a part of a noob guild, a trade guild and an rp guild if you're into that all at the same time.)+Crafting!!!! (naturally, this is an MMO and there is crafting. Unlike a lot of MMO's you can choose a racial motif which changes the appearance of a weapon or armor which, in conjunction with the excellent graphics, can make you look like a true badass.)  Cons-Very easy to pick up (you would think this is a good thing, but as time goes on the difficulty curve doesn't change much. You will find yourself taking on gangs of higher level enemies at once and barely taking a scratch.)-Crafting (what I should have mentioned about crafting armor and weapons is that any weapon or armor you make for a particular level will have the same stats as any other weapon or armor you make for that level. E.X. If you make a two- handed sword for a level 10 character in a nordic motif, it will be the exact same as any other two-handed sword that is level 10, different only in appearance. However, you can change the stats of the weapon by adding runes or traits, or upgrading the weapon by using hard to find materials that can raise the power of your weapon, but I don't think the extra effort is worth the reward.)-Repetitive (Go here, kill these things, REWARD, go here, save these people, REWARD, go here, stop this ultra powerful being that threatens the existence of all life in the universe, REWARD. I'm not saying this is necessarily horrible, but it will wear on you very quickly.)-Absent Minded (?) (I'm not sure if this is the best term to use to explain this, but it feels to me like there are more problems than there should be in the ESO universe. I understand that Molag Bal threatens the world with eternal damnation and hellfire and clearly cant learn from his mistakes he made in the last zone event in which he ""knew"" he would win, but i can't help but think that if there is an infestation of harpies just outside your castle wall, you probably would have known that was happening before the harpies amassed an army large enough to rival the US military.)-GG 2 EZ ( like I said before, the difficulty curve doesn't change much. On my main character, I decided to focus on Blacksmithing to make metal armors and weapons. About 9 hours in, I had made enough money from making armor and weapons for people to have been able to buy all of the initial racial motifs 1-9. I was then able to make even more money, bought a horse, shot some guards in the knees with a bow and arrow, took on the rest of the local police force in a one-man riot, paid off my bounty because i was so loaded, and rode off into the sunset as a reputable member of society.)In the end, I do recommend ESO, but I recommend it for Xbox One and PS4 users. If you are reading this and are wondering if you should buy ESO for your PC, I wouldn't recommend it, as there are better MMO's on the market today. I wanted to recommend this for Xbox One and PS4 users as there aren't a lot of MMO's on consoles today, although i don't own either of those consoles and i haven't tried Neverwinter yet, so to my knowledge (which isn't that grand) ESO would be great on consoles. But mostly because the 9-year-olds that inhabit Xbox live will gawk at anything with bright lights and flashing colors. 7/10 Cookie-Cutter MMO"
Positive,It's been awhile since I've played an MMO.  This one is great!  The customizability of character is really nice and gameplay is always stable.
Positive,"Well, I like it"
Positive,Purchased It only to be a vampire
Positive,Like Elder Scrolls? Like MMOS? Play this.
Positive,"(NOTE:)This game is not what you expect from playing Skyrim. Mechanisms are totally different from Any other ES: games.Lets start off with ratings. 7.8/10Why? (Negative)The fact that its a mmo rpg game, I dont feel more of an Elder scroll game elements aside from SkyrimThere is still some ridiculous warp stuck bugs.Some contents are Useless for begineers.Begineers that take about 4 to 10 hrs of gameplay dont really get to use all of the great things, like pvp or raids, looting is really bad.Tutorial was kind of bad, They didnt teach how we can unlock lockpicks properly, didnt teach us How we can really have fun seeing alot of players, Prophet was a **ckhead.Not much of books/lorePositiveGreat mechanism when fighting you can almost dodge every attack with any opponent Classes are UniqueFactions are Greatly explainedGorgeous graphics and plenty of things to do NPcs are really greatNo need actually in game money currency to pay aside from DLC which is preferredAND ITS MUTHA F*CKING ELDER SCROLL GAME WHICH IS ALWAYS GREAT AS F**k I rated 7.8 because of lack of Elder Scroll elements kinda rip off"
Positive,"Don't play this game thinking its going to be Skyrim online, if you do then dont even bother, even though ESO shares some similarities with Skyrim it is mainly an MMO and  a damn fine one at that. I've been playing this game for 40 hours plus and im still in the first zone because of all the things there are to do besides the main quest, like steal from NPCs and shops, kill guards, crafting, PVP, and a TON of other stuff. The only real complaint that i do have with this game is the size of the PVP zone Cyrodiil which is massive (like all the other zones) and it takes forever to get anywhere even with a horse and waypoints. So yeah i love this MMO definitely my favourite at the moment."
Positive,"Like many other fans of the Elder Scrolls series I was expecting this to be like Skyrim but online and in a sense it is but its also much more than that. The questing is always interesting and still has the random stranger quests plus more, you get random events that happen (will not explain more as to not spoil the game). The crafting system is one of the best I have ever seen and has a lot of depth to it. The exploration is perfect, there is so much to see and always something new around the corner (Don't forget about those random events)But most of all, you are doing all this with your friends (sorry to the lonely losers out there who have no friends, its still fun on your own, honest) run around, kill things, explore, do quests or just make up your own story and get lost in the beautiful scenery.9/10"
Positive,"- Highly recommended.- If you are fan of the Elder Scrolls series, you MUST have it. - There is no need for much words."
Positive,No monthly subscription required to play.
Positive,Intense downloading session for 20 hours10/10 would download again
Positive,"much like the vestige, your soul will be stolen once you get into eso. akatosh cannot save you now"
Positive,Everything you could possibly want in an MMORPG. I played the original offline games with my kids 15 years ago and was not disappointed with the rich lore content and rp value of the online version. The ESO plus is well worth it if you like crafting because there is a separate unlimited space craft bag available to subscribers. Thumbs up.
Positive,"not your typical MMO but enjoyable and challenging. a real fun grind to lvl 50 and then getting your cp up, dungeons are fun and crafting is balanced but enjoyable. overall a well rounded MMO, very good character system and fair leveling."
Positive,After a four years break back again and absolutely excited. With all the extensions and DLCs  the game world is huuge and they add new content on a regular basis - still the F2P design is very fair.If you loved Skyrim you should give this one a try.
Positive,Just getting into the game but so far its great. No sub is a big plus for me. The world seems large and lots to do.
Positive,i like it
Positive,Skryim World of Warcraft
Positive,"Do not play this game if you want to enjoy other games, time outside or even time with family and friends."
Positive,I'm really impressed with this game after a lot of negativity i been hearing about. I think people were expecting skyrim online and thats really the whole deal. This is Elder Scrolls. Im not going to lie it's a bit dumb down but it sure is fun and the community is awesome. people just help you or help each other. I've only done a few hours but i sure am enjoying it. The steam sale is a good price just to experience the 30 days.
Positive,"A very much alive and exciting MMO taking you across the continent of Tamriel to explore the lore and world of the Elderscrolls games. Set a few thousand years before the events of the Elder Scrolls RPGs in a time filled with turmoil and strife. This should be the default staple MMO for people. The developers are constantly bringing in further and more in-depth updates near annually with plenty quality of life updates being introduced, I see this game easily doing another 10 years of extreme activity.If you only have room for one MMO, I would make it this. Plenty of content to keep anyone engaged for thousands of hours and it is free to play, however I would suggest the monthly subscription is worth it, and if unsure; purchase the expansive DLCs on their routine sales. This game can meet almost every level of playstyle from casual, to competitive and has something for everyone.  Gameplay 8/10Story 9/10Replayability 9/10Graphics 7/10Soundtrack 7/10Modsupport 9/10 Overall 8.5/10"
Positive,"I personally haven't gotten to endgame or anything, but I'm having a blast questing. There is a lot of content in this game to play around with, even in the base game. There is a LOT of DLC, but you get all of it if you have the subscription. Make of that what you will. I'm enjoying my time a lot currently."
Positive,"I have only been playing about a month, but I've enjoyed the game so far. I like to take my time in games exploring and doing quests and this game goes at just the right pace for me. I don't feel like I've ""powerleveled"" just by doing such things, which for me is a plus. But if you are that type of player that likes to level up fast, there are various ways to do that too, and they also provide bonuses like experience items etc.This game for me feels very much in line with other elder scrolls games in terms of story, exploration, questing etc. I think the one thing which is somewhat disappointing is feeling as if there is really limited role-play, where you can't necessarily answer questions or make decisions based on how your character might (usually something which would probably alter an entire questline if it were available, so I understand why it isn't in an MMO where individual players don't normally have that much sway on the outcome of a story). For instance, I made a bosmer character who would more likely sympathize with the rebels than the Aldmeri Dominion but I have no choice but to do everything against her character.In terms of combat I think the game so far is decent (I'm currently only level 37). Not really my favourite but it isn't terrible. I much prefer the combat from games like Guild Wars 2 (pre-2014), TERA or Black Desert, but Elder Scrolls is okay. I do find myself missing having more available skills on one skillbar at a time, but maybe that will improve as I have more skill points to distribute and thus more options. The limitation of 5 skills per bar doesn't feel quite intricate enough for me, but I think it's just personal opinion and not really a mark against the game. The things I do like is the ability to equip pretty much anything and build your character as you'd like to. But this also feels limited in different ways due to racial passives, which peoples' guides seem to put a lot of weight on. I'm not used to the race I choose to play bearing that much weight on the build of my character but it seems to matter a lot here (which for me is rather irksome, I don't want to feel forced to play a certain race just because the passives are better for it).Overall though the game has been decently fun and I've been enjoying it so far. I'm mainly a solo player right now though so I have not tried any group content, I can't really comment on that. I don't know if I see myself sticking around on this game for too long, but I'll probably pick it up off and on when I'm in a mood for it (as I do with most games)."
Positive,"I'm sad to say lag problems are making this game unplayable for me, but that's all on my end, nothing to do with the servers.  My internet is crummy, that's all.  Shame, too, because it's a lovely game with lush scenery, lavishly designed cities, flashy mounts, challenging combat, involved PvP culture, better-than-passable character customization/progression, a flourishing player population, and new content always on the way.  I played it some before Morrowind, and it was decent then, and it's still decent now.Drawback:  Each zone is visually a little monotonous.  What I mean is, for instance, Summerset is a lovely place, but every little nook and cranny in Summerset looks like every other spot on Summerset.  It's a common problem with Elder Scrolls games.  Fortunately, if one zone gets boring for you, there's absolutely nothing stopping you from just packing up and heading to a different zone, and I'm happy to say this problem doesn't continue from one zone to the next.  You can go to the frozen north or the desert or any number of enchanted forests.  Then there's Morrowind, which is full of giant mushroom-trees and lava flows and cool shit like that.Another Drawback:  The crafting system is involved, which will delight some players, but, to be a good crafter requires investing lots and lots of skill points.  And these are the same skill points you have to allocate to actual combat skills in order to actually do anything stabby and fun in the world.I think all that about covers the most salient parts of this review.  I'll refrain from verbally describing all the game's features in detail.9/10  Enjoy!"
Positive,I've always remained a faithful wow player but I have to say I have found a new love in ESO and cancelled my sub. This game is so dense in things to do. It doesn't feel like you are being babysat throughout. It has something for everyone.
Positive,"I am a Khajiit, a bipedal cat, riding a panther, a big cat.Also, i have a pet house cat who follows me around and watches me kill things.Cats/10"
Positive,much better then when it realeased
Positive,Very fun game.  Better than WoW.
Positive,Good Free Run MIght Buy iT iF iT Actually Get A Good Sale Prize
Positive,You can be a goblin...Yeah.
Positive,I killed a chicken in town at level 3. City guards approached me and said I must pay a fine. I have no money.I flee. I cannot quest for 25 minutes due to bounty and guards killing me. 10/10 would kill chicken again.
Positive,"you know i kinda expected this game to be real shitand it was for the first couple of months/years it was outbut zenimax has gotten their shit togetheri think the story, despite being a bit cliche, is great! the gameplay how you'd expect it to be- it's a mix of elder scrolls combat with hints of MMO sprinkled all over it.one thing I recommend though- GET ADDONS they can literally save your goddamn lifethe biggest problem i have with it the dlc but honestly we're all still gonna buy the dlc nonethelesstl;dr daggerfall covenant rules aldmeri domnion drools"
Positive,"This game is so good! Although this game may have been bad upon release it has changed a HUGE amount. Playing with friends is what really pulls ESO together because it means you can enjoy endless adventures together. However, all good things come at a cost (not just the price), I have speant countless hours trying to fix the game and make it playable but there where many people in the ESO community that helped me and in the end everything turned out amazing. To conlude, I would highly recommend you to buy this game if your thinking about it."
Positive,"Not as good as an MMO as WoW (Vanilla - WotLK) and not as good as a single player game as Oblivion or Skyrim but it still manages a good balance at both.Bad game at launch , better now.Do use the Zenimax launcher though , the steam version has been known to cause issues. It won't tally your time played but at least it will be bug free."
Positive,"I had a pretty bad first experience with this game, but I'll admit there is a lot here to enjoy. I originally bought it during High Isle on sale, thought I still didn't get what I paid for because I was late to learn that ""all episodes"" didn't mean all DLC. A lot of side chapters and some areas are locked to some crown store DLC. I quit playing after around 20 or so hours because I couldn't move beyond my inner salt. But I took time away, I did other things, and then Necrom dropped. I bought it because I'm a fan of Morrowind, and it doesn't disappoint. It's a very good chapter, with some great side stuff to do. I couldn't tell you anything about the new class, I haven't done any PVP, and I haven't done any party or guild stuff. Really, I've just been wandering around questing as I would in any other Bethesda RPG, and that seems to work out fine. It isn't as free or customizable as other Elder Scrolls games are with things like stats, classes and the like. But really there is a lot of freedom here, and plenty of different regions to explore. I think what really is keeping me is the ability to just move freely from one province to another. If I get tired of looking at Morrowind, I can wayshrine over to the Gold Coast or Western Skyrim or something. I would love to see the entire world map complete one day. The game is 10 years in, so I might be late, but it's still time to be early for that second half of the world map."
Positive,10 пророков из 10
Positive,"The game is ""GOOD"", but only is better if you manage to buy ESO Plus.GOOD STUFF >-- Good PvE content (if you have Plus active).-- Good story from most of the zones maps regions and dungeons.-- Cool crafting system.-- Many builds you can create on your character making it dependent of magicka , stamina or health for a tank. (even a sorcerer that needs stamina to cast spells).-- Not requiring a lot of time to grind for an item.-- More easy to learn than most of other mmorpg's out there.-- Much lore on the game. ( there are many DLC's because Elder Scrolls lore is huge and devs are greedy.)-- No hentai BS like many other mmorpg's.-- Not P2W.-- Good community.WHAT I HATE >-- You mus buy ESO+ service or you will not have the full experience of the game.-- People say if you get the ""Plus"" acess you will get all the content but unfortunately it's not true, you will get most but not all. -- Buy2Play users there is only the PvP , Basics PvE dungeons , and base quests for these players.-- Bad optimization.-- Very long maintenance durations. (after they put a new patch on the game , players will have issues trying to login)--  New DLC's comes kinda expensive and that takes almost 1 year to enter on the Plus service.-- They are gonna beat PAYDAY 2 DLC number.-- This game demands 120GB+ free space because when you finish donwloading from steam, you will need 20GB+ for the launcher files.-- Slow launcher when applying new patches.Rate: 7/10"
Positive,Excellent game but don't buy it through steam.
Positive,"horrible launch, they turned it around. gud game"
Positive,"If you are looking for a game like Skyrim, DO NOT GET THIS GAME. THIS GAME IS NOT LIKE SKYRIM. However, if you are looking for possibly the best mmorpg game I have ever played and you probably will ever play, this is for you.Very good communityExcellent questing, story, and PvP.Very detailed scenery and LOTS to exploreUI customizeableHundreds to thousands of hours of things to doPay once and play (with a subscription option and premium currency, which i will talk about later.)Leveling is somewhat of a grindThere is a premium currency and dlc's but really, if you love the game it is DEFINITELY worth the buyAnd if you are more of a sub kind of person, eso plus speeds leveling, covers the dlc issue, AND adds gives you 1500 premium currency per month, covering that issue as well.I sincerely reccomend this game to anyone interested in TESO lore, and just looking for an all around, good mmo.Thanks for reading!"
Positive,I... what... this isn't skyrim...
Positive,"Don't have too many hours in it, but so far I'm enjoying ESO.Pros:- One time purchase- Cheap when on saleCons:- Leveling can feel a little tedious/slow.- Guards are invincible Dedicated to Ping, quit pestering me. :^)"
Positive,"The game has immensely improved after its launch. It is worth the buy especially now that you do not need the subscription fee. The game isn't pay to win in any manner if you are subscribed, and its great. Don't expect it to be Skyrim 2.0 Online because it is an MMORPG before it is a single RPG. If you are looking for it at a single-player value, its quite good, but not as good as the other ES games. PVP is very cool, although it can get dull at times when It just feels too repetitive."
Positive,"Don't expect Skyrim multiplayer experience. Otherwise, it's an incredible game with a lot of content and well written quests. It also allows the community to develop mods (on PC) which can be used by players to customize their user experience."
Positive,it's pretty good
Positive,"Totally addictive, thought my days of wasting my life on an MMO were over."
Positive,A great way to wait for Elder Scrolls 6
Positive,Feels like a generic Skyrim. good to wait for TES VI.
Positive,"Big Sean once said, ""she put that thong on my groin-groin and then it go boing."" That's it."
Positive,"I no longer play ESO, but it was a very magical game for me for a very long time. The game has all of your basic mmo elements. The combat system was great. There's a ton to explore, and there are enough quests to keep you occupied for years. Towards the end of my time playing, I got really into the pvp side of the game. The pvp was both frustrating and fun, depending on how the servers were performing."
Positive,This was my first game on my first Xbox 360 when i was a kid and its been on every device I've ever owened that it could be on. I've put so much time into this game over the years and I'm still finding new things to do. I think this is one of the best games I grew up with
Positive,"Tamriel Unlimited attempts to bridge a difficult gap between the MMO experience and the Elderscrolls.  If you love the Elderscrolls world, exploring every nook, discovering ancient lore, and experiencing content that has not existed since Arena you will enjoy this game.  If you love high paced castle destroying intense PVP and combat you will enjoy this game.  If you are looking  for Skyrim the MMO you may be disappointed.  If you are expecting the most amazing MMO experience ever (because it is Elderscrolls)... you may also be disapointed.  But as it stands Tamriel Unlimited is beginning to shine as long as you reel in your expectations a bit.  My praise lies in the the fact they have managed to craft a world that looks and feels overall like an Elder Scrolls.  My ventures into Morrowind had me tingling with that old feeling of romping through the cliffs of Vvardenfell.  Finally the quest lines in ESO feel much more epic and important than any other MMO I have played.  Not to mention that nearly every quest you encounter is in someway related to the main plot line, it sometimes may not be immediately apparent but I find makes it a much more immersive experience.  Finally combat is what you would expect from an Elderscrolls MMO, The feel of Skyrim as most reliably done on a Server client system.My complaints are simple and for the most part superficial.  Hair... why oh why can't anyone over at Bethesda or Zenimax (and many other american game companies) make decent character hair.  A few extra polygons and texture resolution on such an incredibly important part of your experience is worth any kind of performance penalty I may suffer.  TES has squeaked by this since Morrowind thanks to the modding community but you don't have that in ESO.  Also no barber or character appearance changing ability at all which means if you choose a hair style you later find god ugly you are stuck with it.  I truly hope this gets changed later.Finally my one and only complaint.  The Character class system is amazingly limber, but in my opinion not necessary even in ESO.  You must choose one of 4 classes that imparts a set of class based skills and magic.  Your choices in constructing that character's abilities as it levels can turn them into a tank, a healer, a powerful magic damage dealer or some combination of the above.  But I can't help but feel it is unnecessary.  There are plenty of skills you acquire throughout the game world, why can't a similar system be used uniformly throughout the game.  Weather you are a Templar, Dragon Knight, Nightblade, or Sorcerer you can be any role you want to be, use any weapon and armor combination you want to use, but a Dragon Knight can never learn the Sorcerer skills.  It is the one aspect of ESO that to me still feels out of place.  What if I want to gain the Sorcerer abilities even though I am a Dragon Knight?  The original Elder Scrolls never put any kind of restriction on your ability to use or learn skills and it is the one aspect of ESO I would love to see changed.Zenimax Online Studios (ZOS) is new to MMOs, they have definitely made mistakes.  But they have also been adequate at improving the experience of ESO in attempting to bridge that gap between the elements that make the Elderscrolls and the elements that make a great MMO.  It's not all there yet but If they continue down this road I can foresee an MMO unlike any other set in one of the most beloved settings of any game that will making it worthy of being called an Elder Scrolls game and I believe that is what all of us who are fans of the series wants to see."
Positive,"I burned out on WoW and LotRO and Rift...basically all fantasy MMORPGs...but this one dragged me right back in. Gameplay is different enough to hold my interest, and the grind--while there--is not enough to turn me off. Definitely a large player base, and most are tolerable. Most.One thing I don't like about subscription-based games is the subconscious ""I should play more to get my money's worth; I'm paying for it, I should play."" trap. I spend enough time playing games already; I don't need the subtle pressure to play more. So...all that said, I plan on playing a few more months without a sub...but it's totally worth it if you have the time. It's a fantastic game and the developers put a tremendous amount of story and visual details into it."
Positive,"Its a very good game, with awesome graphics. I really recommend it for mmorpg lovers. However i only could play 30 days, i wont pay por a monthly subscription :/. I suggest to elimate the monthly subcription and make it free (this not means make the game a FTP)."
Positive,I'm Jarl Balgruud and I be ballin'
Positive,Fun to play online with friends! The story is pretty engaging. Overall I'm enjoying myself and get excited when more expansions release.
Positive,"I didn't know what to expect before I played The Elder Scrolls Online. I heard both positive and negative things about this game. Due to the fact that I played all the other ES games thoroughly and needed some ES content to satisfy my hunger while waiting for the next installment ES 6, I decided why not give it a go.From the beginning I got quite excited, you really get sucked into the story the minute you enter. It is of course different to the other Elder Scrolls games, however I found this Online installment to be quite satisfactory and interesting enough to quench my Elder Scrolls thirst.There are a surprisingly huge amount of things to do, from the main quest to the side quests. Another plus about ESO is despite it being an MMO RPG, it is fit for any desirable playstyle, whether you want to explore Tamriel with your friends, or prefer to wander alone. Zenimax really had both types of players in mind here. From the fans from the offline series to people who are keen to play with others. As I prefer a solo playstyle this is perfect for me.  When I played the main questline I would often get so immersed in the world that I could not resist the temptation to explore and do other quests around me as well.  I noticed there are a lot of unique npcs as well, which for me personally is something that I enjoy seeing in an ES game.The music was spot on in all the areas and really made me feel something wherever I went. The actual story is interesting and for those who have played Morrowind and Oblivion in particular you will often see a lot of connections in ESO which makes one feel nostalgic yet something fresh all together. Certainly this expands the world of Tamriel as we know it in a beautiful manner.  I also like the fact that you can make choices which can effect how people think of you and how the story plays out. Now for the cons.I acknowledge that the enemies have improved in the sense of combat. The patterns are a little more varied in ESO compared to former ES games. However there were quite a few times where I felt like I was grinding just to get to the next quest. But that's not really a major issue, overall it was fine. To conclude ESO is a good game for any playstyle and may even surprise some of our hardcore ES fans. It's not as good as the usual ES game style but no doubt will satisfy the hunger of those eager for more ES content. And can be enjoyable to experience exploring all of Tamriel."
Positive,"everything about this game is great, from bosses to houses is amazing. I enjoyed every second of playing this game."
Positive,so far so goo!
Positive,"Fun as hell, I love it!"
Positive,I don't want to start a war but for me this is better than WOW. However I would like to see the follow feature for questing characters and the map could use some tweaks :P
Positive,It has improved alot recently.
Positive,"A friend of mine recommended that I give this game another try after my disdain of the early access BETA. Boy he could not have been more correct! This game is SO much fun! It is nothing like it was in the BETA. There is SO much content and such excellent attention to details. If you gave this game a chance at one point and didn't like it, try it again. If you've never played this game before but you're turned off by the older negative reviews, do consider checking it out. The game has come a long way since all the negativity."
Positive,"This game has such a wide range of things to do, different activities, and different quest paths. I have enjoyed every moment with it, playing with others, or alone.I find the Premium features to be great, and am willing to pay for the subscription while I'm playing a lot, but it might not be for everyone."
Positive,"Good game, been playing for years. Very much lives up to continuing the story, lots of lore here that will be appreciated by those keen with the series since DOS access."
Positive,Jit ah mane play orc look mane quit big ah orc omm

Positive,The best MMORPG I've ever played
Positive,"after 479 hours of playGood Things : -game play pretty good-great quest line and story-lovey graphic-big map-you can steal an equipment and aquire a lot of stuff almost everywhere-challengingBad things :-they put a limit of skill you can put on the skill slot, compare to a dozen of skill you've got.-you can only do a pvp in a spesific map (cyrodiil) <--- i hate this so much!!!!-you cant kill a guard-challenging but boringconclusion : Good PVE system, Bad PVP system"
Positive,"Hi, my name is Gabriel and i just got done with all Skyrim quests 100%  and wanted to try something new, so what i did was i bought this game and i must say at the start i didnt relly like it, but after some time i started to like it and i just want to say to everyone else who is going to buy this game, Give it a chance."
Positive,I went into the river and my ass started to bleed and it was because of a bandit 10/10
Positive,THIS GAME IS GREAT
Positive,"While I always think the gameplay itself could use some updating, I love this game so much. I'm in it for the story first and foremost, and Elder Scrolls always delivers."
Positive,good mommy milkers
Positive,game is really fun with or without friends but friends are preferred to me
Positive,Seems like a unique MMO experience. Feels like skyrim had kids with a blizzrd game
Positive,"hands down my favourite MMO out, nothing except new world feels like it and i won't talk about that game here, new patch is pretty noticeable imo which is lovely ! just wish there was a OCE megaserver, the ping is pretty solid tho still, i personally rarely notice it unless pvp then i'm unsure. for a questing MMO it's beyond immaculate"
Positive,"I'm shocked how much this game improved. I played the open beta and it seemed like a spammy theme park MMO with nothing going for it. Now? Only the graphics are the same.If I had to describe it, I'd say ESO is an open world ARPG/MMO hybrid. You know the deal: go anywhere, do anything. Get yourself to the nearest enemy and start wailing on it for weapon experience, or go into sneaky and increase your legerdemain through thievery. You will have to do questing, PVP, or dungeons if you want to make any real progress, but it's up to you if you want to be a battlegrounds terror or a solo quester.The combat is a lot closer to something like Diablo than it is to WoW. There are no cooldowns, many classes only have a loose rotation, and there are dozens of viable builds for each class. Even though you only have two sets of five skills, the sheer amount is huge. And many skills are universal--your Nightblade can make use of the Fighters Guild tree just as much as a Dragon Knight can.The rest of the game is competent. Quests are all voice acted. None of them are incredibly memorable, but they're entertaining enough. Some even have branching paths to choose from. The dungeons are a lot more story driven than a WoW veteran might expect, but it still amounts to four jerkoffs bashing everything they see with a stick. Battlegrounds have a bunch of goofy modes. They might be interesting to you; they annoyed me.Lastly, the cost needs to be addressed. You gotta pay for the base game--expansions sold separately--and there's mini DLC, cosmetics, AND loot boxes, AND an optional subscription service. This is just too much monetization, especially since there's clearly a best option. Membership is $15 and it gets you all (but the most recent) expansion, all the DLC, XP boosts, a bag to hold your crafting shit in, and $15 worth of premium currency. There's literally no reason to buy currency when you get the same value with an ESO membership plus benefits. Get the game on sale and buy an ESO+ membership if you want to give it a shot."
Positive,"Don't listen to the hateful children, the game ran into a minor technical error and people downvote stormed this fantastic game. Give it a try, its fun. Just know a sub and Summerset is quite necessary if you plan on playing."
Positive,"good game, but not worth 55 euro."
Positive,"you can be a crazy jester and stab everyone, good times"
Positive,just get it
Positive,Best MMORPG I've ever played
Positive,"Very fun, very worth it for the low price of $8. One of my friends said this game reminds him of Grand Theft Auto except its not and he likes to go around pickpocketing and stealing swords and all types of jewelry and treasures. You can quest, find resources around, and a tip is to wait until your level 10 to use your crown experience reward you get early in the game, and then hit P to open the dungeon queue menu and you'll get tons of xp and loot doing that. Just get it."
Positive,"I'm still unfamiliar with certain content in the game, but I'm absolutely sure it's worth its 10 bucks if you bought it on the sale. Still not sure if the DLCs from the Gold Edition are good enough, but maybe it's just me, I really don't like those guilds they give you an ability to join, like Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild. Anyway, in my opinion, $10 is just the right price. 7.899/10"
Positive,"The map system is a bit irritating, it would be nice to be able to zoom out and see all of the world so you know where you were and where you're going. Other than the map system the rest of the game i like. no issues with anything else."
Positive,"I know it says 0.4 hours played but i had run into an issue with it running at the same time as the steam software trust me i have logged a lot of hours playing . Once the bugginess with it has gone (i have a gtx 660 and had the screen freeze etc when i first started playing) its been one of those few games i can play a lot and so far im  not bored at all , there is always something new to do and they are constantly adding DLC which is pretty cool . Its def worth getting if you are a fan of elder scolls and a fan of mmo games . I had before this been playing SWTOR and this blows it out of the water !!Pros: Great Story Pretty good graphicsAmazing Crafting SystemGreat DLC Going Premium is Actually worth it Extenstive Crafting system Cons: Can be buggy (but not always )"
Positive,"Now that theyre not being total goblins about it, its a pretty good mmorpg. Pretty in between Guild Wars and WoW."
Positive,The game is totally worth a one time payment of $60 if you like mmos.
Positive,"A beautiful world in the Elder Scrolls universe, unlimited amount of things to do in this MMO and it keeps me interested! Can't wait to see whats in store for the future os the Elder Scrolls franchise."
Positive,"Once you get passed any learning curves, you'll find yourself comfortable, and excited to be completely immersed in the world of Tamriel. The world is accurately depicted, across all areas, with nostalgic music to match. The voice acting is superior to most MMORPG's and helps keep you immersed within the world. The community is pleasant as well. I am very pleased to have this game, and would have to say it's the best MMORPG available today. Would highly recommend."
Positive,"Played during free weekend...i'm impressed...interesting game, combat, skills...runs beautifully, it's pretty...if i didnt pre ordered WoW battle for azeroth i would defiantly play it as my main mmorpg. maybe when WoW slows down."
Positive,"This game is a great game and definitely worth the purchase now that they removed the required subscription. The combat is great and it still feels like an Elder Scrolls game while also feeling like an MMO. The only warning is the misconseption people have that his is Skyrim. THIS IS NOT SKYRIM. I can not stress this enough. This is its own game and if you enjoy it for that you will have a great time. The working with friends system could use a decent amount of work but it is still great. You can manage to play alone or with friends, both work. They also manage to have a premium store without it being a pay to win game. I would rate this 8/10"
Positive,"Bethesda really know what they are doing.This game is one of those that you can easily waste weeks on and have no idea that the time has past.You can choose how you build your character, choose to PvP, grind or quest, even all of those options.And the community add-ons that are openly accepted by the creators and community gives it the ability to extend its life span to no end.A mandatory title to everyones collection.***Just a quick edit to explain something to those users who nit pick at something in my reviewYes I do know Bethesda did not release this specific Elder ScrollsAnd No, I have not stated that they created or released it, the comment says...""Bethesda really know what they are doing""as in, they did not let some stupid company or label turn their remarkable franchise into crap, so on and so forth.Apologise for the vent***Recommended : YesReplayability : YesDrawbacks : You will waste a huge amount of time with this game-Universal Gamer"
Positive,"It's alright. The game doesn't have enough to keep me playing though, by that I don't mean content wise, I mean, it just feels bland and overall feels boring to me. This game really struggled to pique my interest, I tried so hard to get into it, but I feel this game just isn't for me. It will definitely satisfy other people, but this just isn't my type of game, this coming from someone who loved Skyrim. This game is just a hit or miss for certain people honestly, the lore seems interesting but the missions just feel very annoying for some reason. I'll recommend it for people who want to try it, if you feel you're not getting into it at first, definitely don't force yourself to continue, it will feel the same no matter how much you play."
Positive,"The game is awesome! It starts out seeming EZ , however as you go it gets tougher until you start figuring stuff out with gear and skills then it gets fun !!!!......  Very skill orientated game , just mashing buttons doesnt get the job done in this here game !! DEFINATELY worth playing ! the graphics alone blow WOW out of the Fing water!"
Positive,this game is the best i love it
Positive,I think The Elder Scrolls Online is a good MMO.
Positive,"My favorite MMORPG so far. Maps are huge and colorful. Tons of missions. Nice fan base. Usually hate buying DLC; for this game I don't mind, wouldn't want the fun to end."
Positive,"I'm angry that it says recommended space is 85GB but what it does to me is first it takes like 75GB to download , but then after you  need to install another time which takes 85GB, now the problem is i only have 60GB left so how the fk do i fix this. It wasnt like this before , it only took 85GB before not 85+85"
Positive,"Do you like Skyrim?Do you like Runescape or WoW?do you like games with great story, tons of characters and a huge world?Who am I kidding? by the time you read this you'll already have 80 hours logged and never leave your basement again.Enjoy!"
Positive,"The best MMORPG  i've ever played  and i've played them all including WOW for 10 years , this is laid back and has so many stories and activities and ways to create your character to suit your play style , whether its running a dungeon with a group or just strolling along the hillside collecting herbs and ore , this is far improved since i last played on PS4 2 years ago where I have multiple max level characters. They have introduced a LOT more content and a skills guide which allows you to choose a spec for a class and assist you on which skills etc to choose if your new to the game. It can get expensive so get the base game which is cheap and then subscribe as you get all the content / DLC for free. It works out much cheaper than buying them individually and the XP boost is worth it."
Positive,"THE RECENT INFLUX OF NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE FROM SKYRIM PLAYERS WHO DOWNLOADED THE FREE WEEKEND AND THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE THE SAME!I would NOT have reccomended this game back at the stage where it was £10 a month. But after the release of Tamriel unlimited, i'm 100% certain that this remains the best MMO out there,Once you hit level 10, you will unlock cyrodil and can play around in the pvp running back and forth taking forts and outposts from your opposing factions.subscribing to ESO PLUS is completely optional but gets you all of the DLC excluding the newest expansion at the time as well as increased inv and bank space, a crafting bag, increased gold and xp gains etc. so buying the base game for £15 and then paying for eso plus is the best way to experience the game."
Positive,"Great game. Gigantic map. Hours upon hours of game play. Mostly PVE but offers a lot a PVP too. Very good character customization but, above all, very console controller friendly..."
Positive,"If you liked Skyrim, you'll like this as well. It's pretty much the same as Skyrim but with seriously huge amount of content to go through, plus the MMO elements"
Positive,Got murdered by a slatterfish at level 30.
Positive,the game is really cool . a real mmo rpg dungeons . battle field . to many quests and ... all things a rpg game needs the problem is .... the crowns are expensive af
Positive,Spent an hour coming up with a character name I wouldn't regret. Still regret it.
Positive,This is the reason I'm failing school. 10/10.
Positive,"Took me a couple of tries to get into it, I've never really been a fan of multiplayer games. 1000 hours later... Ya, it's pretty sweet."
Positive,Tried it now since its free trial week. I was surprised it had such a good class and combat system and the Elder Scrolls universe is a favourite of mine since Morrowind.  Guess ill be playing it a lot in the future :).
Positive,"Excellent so far (~100 hrs of actual gameplay), will update upon reaching endgame."
Positive,"Very fun to run around and be a murder hobo, even if it started as an accident :D"
Positive,"3 hours so far, very overwhelming but very fun!"
Positive,"I hate MMOs, but this one is ok."
Positive,"I think this game suites all play styles, PVE, PVP, grinding, casual play. Map is very huge and has a lot of content"
Positive,all is well
Positive,"its fun for around 20-40 hours alone easy, and with friends you can easily throw in 100+ hours. if it is on sale, it is a must buy"
Positive,"Extremely fun with friends :) game is a little easy for most creatures you find but bosses and dungeons can be a great challenge, VET Hardmode dungeons are extremely difficult from what I've heard. Only have 11 hours currently but i'm sure I'll have much much much more eventually."
Positive,"I love this game, it is incredibly well made. There are some glitches but that is to be expected in such a massive game.Getting into the game as a new player is slow and difficult, and the game does not explain all it's nuances for you. One year in and you will still discover new elements to the game that you'll wish you had known when you started. My recommendation is to join a social guild as soon as possible after starting, and don't be scared to ask questions.ESO plus makes the game infinitely more enjoyable, but is not necessary to play. It's also not horribly expensive.All this being said, the price of crowns is absolutely awful. The game would likely be more profitable if they lowered the price point to something more players could afford, as it would lead to a huge increase in sales.All in all, I now have more than 1000 hours in this game and I'm still learning and discovering new stuff every day."
Positive,"Highly recommended for depth of storylines/Lore, quest chains.  Lots of PvP, if thats your bag or even Crafting, decorating housing, pet collecting and more.  Raids/Trials, group dungeons or just solo content to your hearts content.  So much to do & such a variety of ways to play.  Beautifully crafted.  10/10"
Positive,Solid and entertaining MMO. Keeps you coming back to enjoy it's content again and again!
Positive,Still have yet to see a quest that didn't have an interesting story. By far my favorite Elder Scrolls game.
Positive,Offers occasional entertainment.
Positive,"Great game, great new Greymoor chapter (especially if you enjoy the new skill lines - scrying and excavation) and I would recommend it to anyone who is in search of a good MMORPG, even though it has sometimes lag issues. Well but to be honest not every game is perfect and has sometimes its own problems, just deal with it. REEEE"
Positive,"It's a very well polished game. Good graphics, huge world to explore and good community. I find quests and voice acting pleasurable as well, but, combat has it's drawbacks. It doesn't feel right and there isn't big variety in terms of attacks. Many people also have issues with optimization. It doesn't utilize CPU cores at it's fullest and is heavily dependent on a single core power. Even with my quad-core i7 i have CPU related issues. Other than that, it's a good deal."
Positive,"Great game. The characters, the world, the music, the graphic, everything is great in this game.Almost.The only thing that's really really awful is the PC/Mac EU Megaserver, which breaks every hour or so. Long loading time, inability to login in the game, continuos disconnections, and the Dungeon/Battleground Finder often broken are the weak points of a game that could be otherwise almost perfect."
Positive,"Played the closed beta, didn't quite enjoyed.The game feels gives that Skyrim feeling, most of the soundtracks remind you of Skyrim itself.The grind is actually simple but yet tiring, it does feel great when played with friends.The game forces you to spend most of your money to buy additional spaces of backpack and bank so you have slots to grab items from dungeons and all that stuff.Overall 8.5/10"
Positive,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM...GO TO THE ESO STOREAt $20 ESO is definitly worth it. I'm actually surprised at the amount of detail in dungeons and general landscape. Combat is more fun than other MMOs that I've tried thanks to being in 1st person. Unfortunaltey, this game has server connection issues if you buy it through Steam. Im only a few days into this game and already I can't log in (an i just got hooked!). Apparently people who purchase the game through the ESO store do NOT have these problems as often."
Positive,"I think 24 hours in game is enough for the first revew.So first of all I'm the Elder Scrolls fan, and NOT an MMO fan.Second - I'm not the native speaker, so sorry for my English.So let's get started.+ World. This Elder Scrolls for f** sake! It was really nice to visit some familiar places (like Vvardenfell and Windhelm), as much a the new lands that I've never seen before (especially Hammerfell and Black Marsh). Everything is very beautifull and well made.+ Outfits. Separate cuirass/robe/jacket, pants, boots, gloves, pauldrons and helmet/hat. Lots of styles for each one, all can be dyed and combined in any way you want. Though in the beginning you can craft only your racial style and have no dyes, but it all can be unlocked (dyes come from achievements and styles are found in random loot)+ Solo play. You really don't need other people to complete most of the quests. Just walk around, explore, have fun!+ Leveling. It's interesting. You've got differen brenches of abilities - race and class related, guild related and so - when you use the ability, it levels up untill you can upgrade it in one of the two ways (for example increase the ammount of damage or add AOE). The system is very flexible and you can build your character as you wish.+ - Lore. Not gonna talk abot it. Cause it will take too long. I'll say.. sometimes it's cool and smetimes it's suddenly screwed up :)- Fighting mechanic. It's maybe not like jeneric MMO, but still very MMO. It's targeting. You can't lock the target, but once you klicked it - you can't miss. Yeah, the battles are more active then in other MMO's, but they still end up in pressing abilities over and over again while dodging enemie attacks. Becomes boring pretty fast. At least you can turn off that ugly red glowing around the targeted character.- ""You are the chosen hero"" thing. It just doesn't work in multiplayer where the world is swarmed with such heroes:)- ""Not the same TES"". Yeah, I mean sometimes it's the same, and sometimes not really, and then suddenly compleetly not..  It's not about the different engine and stuff, it's about the atmosphere, it's just.. sometimes doesn't feel the same. So it's a really good spin-off, worth playing  while you're waiting for new REAL TES, but I recommend taking it on sale."
Positive,"Bought this game 2 years ago, back then i would give this a bad review but after deciding to come back to this game in 2017 to play with a few friends, i felt that giving this a bad review is nonsensical as this is a great game and a decent mmo,although i rarely play mmos,i really like this.I find myself having tons of fun doing quests and getting loot.I agree that this game can get expensive fast as the dlcs are pumped out but i would not mind if i have fun with friends.Edit: 2 years later...My opinion of this game has not changed at all, in fact its getting better. Somehow ESO became my most played game in my library. My time for productivity always gets taken away for some ESO play time. Really, dont be put off by other comments,this is one of the best games i have ever played. Can't believe i almost got a refund for this gem.NOTE: As much as i love ESO, i wouldn't say its perfect,the craft bag (too precious to live without) definitely puts off new players. However, the amount of pleasure i gotten from playing this non-stop, as well as the friends i made, really softens the impact of the paying occasionally for this game."
Positive,AWESOME crazy Graphics and world
Positive,10/10 seen a Khajiit orgy in Elsweyr.
Positive,Game got a lot of hate when it was first released. (for good reasons) but now it is a surprisingly good game I would definitely reccomend.
Positive,It's not Skyrim 2.0. It's a Skyrim + Oblivion + Typical MMO = ESO

Positive,"This is an awsome game,  it has many aspects of TES lore and let one play with one's friends as well.   At time of this writeing, I had over 21 game days  (many hours) already in the game and has not run of content.  ZOS has big plans for new content a nd it is coming soon.    Like all games,  there are bugs, but ZOS fix them fast.It is not a ""Skyrim 2"" and the ""standard MMO Clone""  (aka WoW clone),   it is a good game on it's own and it is highly recommand for anyone who TES games, but feel lonely in the single player version of it.  There is so much pointless hate of theis game and it is unfair.  Give it a try, reall it is a great game on it's own."
Positive,One of the greatest MMORPG's I ever played! Love this game :)Big plus: It also runs on machines with less power!
Positive,I used to have this game as a negative review but a lot has changed since then.I believe ESO is the best MMO out right now as the updates that added housing and the justice system bring it to a true Elder Scrolls feel. The devs of this game are actually listening to fans and the game just appeals to me because the questing and exploring is fun. Not to mention it's in my favorite fantasy universe.
Positive,"So I been playing it for a while now and this game is in the top 3 right now together with WoW, FFXIV. You can play it at your own pace, fun exploration, many quests and populated world. Much better than those pay2win free to play mmos you have nowadays. The main con is the crafting bag and overpriced regions, but of course you can pay monthly fee to pass it. All in all recommended until something better comes out."
Positive,I love elder scrolls its my favorite game ❤️
Positive,Fun game and great community.
Positive,"the game is exactly as it says, its a MMO thats set in the Elder Scrolls world"
Positive,"ESO is a successful game on its rights, but it just falls flat against Skyrim, Oblivion, or Morrowind. The difference lies in its plot, storytelling, characters, and overall writing. The single-player experience has the level of…well, an MMORPG title."
Positive,"Great game that is story driven more than combat driven. There are a ton of quests which all have voice overs and competent voice actors, and most are written very well. If you love storylines this is a great mmo to get into, if you are after combat I felt ESO was a little lacking in that area. It mainly comes down to their auto scale system. Meaning everything in the game is scaled to provide an average difficulty, so if you are good at mmo's this game will seem very very easy. The scaling system makes it so you can go anywhere and do anything and nothing is ever out of your level range. It also sadly makes every battle against a non boss mob feel exactly the same. They all have roughly the same amount of hp do around the same amount of damage, you are never resisted, in trouble for mana or healing or fight anything that is so resistant to one type of damage you have to switch to another. In short, you fight every mob the same way you fought the last which is ZZzzzz. Also your spells are broken into 2 hotbars which just feels like a lot of needless button pushing to go back and forth between the two, most people dont want to put in that much effort and their second bar collects dust most fights. The selling of items is also a big downer for me. If you want to sell on a market to other players you have to join a guild with a merchant you can sell on. These guilds pay a lot for that merchant and thus you will be expected to pay about 25,000 gold a week to be in one. Again at level 47 that is a fortune to me. Were I to join a guild so i could sell my items it would turn this game into a job for a casual player like myself trying to make dues. Thus you will see guilds with 500 people in them and not one of those guys can sell items on the market to other players. There is a lot of good to this game and I definitely still enjoy playing, but combat is Zzzz to me. Most fights i can cast 2 spells and call it good, and they are over in under 10 seconds."

Positive,"Elder scrolls game but its online. Well for me the greatest thing here is to see and explore whole tamriel, revisit my favorite places such as Vardenfell from morrowind, what gives much fun is to see some familliar places from previous games. Game is not Pay to Win but having ESO+ surely makes the game even more enjoyable because of things such as a bit faster leveling and infinite crafting bag space for resources, so you mostly dont have to worry for inv. space. TESO has various classes, races, character customisations, alliances and guilds a player can choose thus giving your character some uniqueness. When you get tired of exploring, quests and adventures you can always try yer luck and skill in PVP battles, or Cyrodill (war of alliances). Game is one of the greatest mmo rpgs and both people new to elder scrolls universe and those who know previous TES games will have lots of fun."
Positive,"Cadwell best npcEdit(main quest)seriously who the hell is Cadwell, why is he so heroic and funny.10/10 recruited Cadwell to stand by my side and fight with mehe showed up again, saved the companions from the daedras, and is now serving meridia, my respect to him was already high to begin with and now it's way higher.Cadwell best npcSince this joke review somehow managed to get attention, i'm going to patch it up a little bit so that it could be useful to potential buyers, here we go.ESO is an elder scrolls game made into an MMO, it does have most of it's feature from elder scrolls games, but had to give up a few to accomodate with the MMO part. You will be assigned to a faction after making your character, and each faction got their own main story line, there are so much zones and quests, finishing the main story line would definitely cost you at least 100 hours or so, but it doesn't end there, after finishing the main quest, you will be able to travel to other faction's starting zone, and be able to do their main quests as well, basicaly tripling your main quest line gameplay(not counting dlcs and special zones).--Story--While people does argue a lot about the story, and some parts of the community said that the story is so bad, i think that the story is... okay. It might not have the best wriitng, and some voice acting doesn't really go well with the dialogue and situation present, but i think that the story doesn't deserve to be called the worst, it's not great, but it's not that bad either.+Hundreds of hours worth of main story gameplay.+All dialogues are fully voiced.+Choices do matter, you can save or kill some quest npcs.+Memorable npcs(CadwellBestNPC).-Bad voice acting at times.-Weird voice acting at times.-Story might feel generic or boring at times.-Will feel linear at times.-Gameplay-Gameplay is very nice, it has a lot of ESO elements, but had to give up a few to lessen the strain of it being an MMO, such as ragdoll, all killable NPCs, etc. Also, the game allows AddOns, and most of these AddOns are very effective to make your gameplay dozens time better.+Intense gameplay, filled with dodge, block, and weaving.+Gameplay carries a lot of depth.+Highly customizable, with champion points bringing more customizable elements to the game.+Great level scaling, lowbies could be as contributive as a high level player on dungeons together.+Good group finder system.+Intense pvp with sieges.+Game changing AddOns-No ragdoll.-Doesn't feel much like a sandbox.-Aiming doesn't really matter since projectiles will auto track like in those generic MMOs.-In game mails often requires the player to change zone before being able to receive them.--Optimization and Service--The service and optimization for ESO is great, recently they have done an optimization patch and it enables the game to be playable even on my potato laptop which costs like 400$, and the customer support does answer queries and help players.+Highly optimized.+Customer support is not bad.+Not much server problems.-Recurring launcher problems.-Huge game size(70 gigs).--Community--From my hundreds of hours of experience on this game, the community is fairly nice, i've rarely seen someone being toxic on this game, people would help each other if they could, and lots would give advices to newer players such as which addon to pick, and how to play the game properly.+Can join up to 5 guilds.+Mail is very straightforward and easy to use.+Guild is account wide.+So much things to do in group.-Trading is very... bad without the help of an addon.-No proper serverwide auction house.-Even with the help of an addon, trading is still very tedious.All in all, ESO is a very good game, it's not perfect, but it's still very fun to play with a lot of contents and ways to play the game.Wish there were ragdolls tho."
Positive,Join this beautiful land!
Positive,The best MMORPG on the market at this moment. I now have 700h on record and barely scratched the surface of the PC version. On PS4 I also have an account with approximately 1000h playtime.
Positive,An MMO with an Elder Scrolls skin. Not The Elder Scrolls that is online and is massively multiplayer.
Positive,I've had it for a week now and it's still downloading all of the patches. Patch simulator 2015.
Positive,Its pretty good but with the the key you get use it on the website and instal the launcher via that to save a ton of space.
Positive,"Lets me state this so it is simple for everyone, one of the best games easily"
Positive,"I woke up in a terrible place. I was a Nord Sorcerer. I met others and we all gleefully ran around the wondrous volcanic geology of this new world. Sometimes I would discus getting my soul back with a homeless man. Other times, when I was sad, my friend who liked to wear cooking pots on his head would sing to me.Someone actually bit my one Argonain friend and he became a vampire. I never saw him again.In the end there was a Disco Party. I had a pet monkey. We vibed hard on a fountain in Davons Watch.10/10"
Positive,"I am having a great time playing ESO on my iMac despite occasional crashes (@once every 90 minutes). I have played single player more than 500 hours and am looking forward to multiplayer at some point.  I enjoy the crafting, the combat and character progression. All the character dialogue is wonderfully voice acted. Using the auction house is a little clunky and I'm probably not using it to good effect. I have played WoW and then Guild Wars 2. But ESO is much better than earlier games. I am the kind of player that loves to take it slow and explore and poke around the terrific environment. I have three characters all about level 20 so I have a lot to look forward to.UPDATE: No crashes over the last six months. Having a great time playing single player.UPDATE2 (10-24): Not working with iMac Catalina. No warning on the main page. I wonder what this means? The game updates within the game. How can I update it now since the game won't load for me. Gads, I don't want to reinstall the entire game.UPDATE2 (10-26): Deleted and restored the entire game. Loads with a white screen. Went to ""Documents/Elder Scrolls Online/live/"" and deleted ""UserSettings.txt"" (after saving it). Now it loads fine after it created a new ""UserSettings.txt"". IMPORTANT: Save game as a window, not full screen. Seems to be working, though now I have to wait for the regular update to be completed. Of course I'm hoping that all my characters will be restored after the game runs. Hope hope....UPDATE2 (2-22-21): Runs great on my iMac with Big Sur OS."
Positive,"pretty good game, not a good wait if you download at 19kb/s"
Positive,It's pretty good
Positive,My Favorite Game Of All Time Its just an absolute Dumpster Fire they bann people for anything an cant get the server fixed for 7years but all in all nothing like it on the market.
Positive,New Hardware. Better
Positive,"Coming from WoW, I enjoy the fact that the game is playable without needing to buy game time or addons."
Positive,A well designed game seeped in a couple of decades of rich lore  - great stuff.  Layers upon layers of simple mechanics provide a great combat system that is both easy to get the hang of and seemingly substantive.  It is also huge.WARNING:I would NOT purchase this game through Steam.  Purchase it through ESO directly.  Steam has continued to have periodic login issues while the direct ESO client seems far more stable overall.
Positive,Probably one of the most consistent games I have played in the past. Was sceptical at first since I thought it didn't fit into the franchise but I was wrong there. The stories are all great and that's frankly the only reason I play it. I don't really care about the group aspect that much but I would recommend until the next elder scrolls releases...
Positive,"The game is like, a larger, better graphics version of previous Elder scrolls games, with some multiplayer added in. The PVP battlegrounds are fast and fun. The larger zone PVP battles are different and the Imperial City zone PVP gives you a chance to experience world pvp as well. You get a very well rounded experience from the game as a whole and I would play it for JUST the story alone and the amazing, all-star voice acting. The rest is just icing on the cake. I played a lot of MMOs and RPGs over the years and this one is definitely one of the best complete experiences. The game is as hard as you want it to be with different levels of difficulty and Veteran Trials can be pretty rough, but not soul crushing. The ""real end game"" of ESO is frequently used in reference to the housing and character outfit / looks. There is also a significant and dedicated Role Playing community, if you are into it. The ability to modify your house extensively means that your houses can be used for some great player driven Role Playing experiences. The ""pay to win"" aspect of the game is very low, especially in modern day standards and I would suggest the game to anyone, even as a free to play. There is a gacha mechanic with the crown crates, but it is MOSTLY cosmetic and you quickly are able to craft stuff better than the consumables that you can get from the crates.Overall, I rate this as the best MMO out for me, because it gives me a bit of everything and if I feel like being hardcore, i can go do that and if life is busy, I can be casual without feeling like I am missing out on much either way."
Positive,"Not into Final Fantasy? But enjoy Medieval fantasy or just a fan of Elder Scrolls?Try this game.. you do NOT need membership or ANY DLC to start. Try it on sale for $5 IF you happen to enjoy this game be sure to subscribe to the ""Elder Scrolls Online+"" membership for $15 per month. With this you get ALL DLC packs and from my understanding all expansions other than the latest one.The community is very kind. Extremely social game [Whoa a modern day MMO that is social?] I came back after trying it in 2017. [2024 at the time of typing this] ... Game hooked me. 8.5/10"
Positive,my dad beats me
Positive,"Enjoying the game, allows me to disconnect from reality :)"
Positive,"Having logged some hours on ESO and only reaching about lv25, I have no idea why many people hate this game."
Positive,"Pretty good game to play casually on the side, ESO Plus is recommended if you do want this as your main MMO."
Positive,Wills reviewed this game
Positive,it's pretty good tbh
Positive,"God awful game, would play it again though."
Positive,"Great MMO with a lot of content. If you are a big fan of TES and MMOS like WoW then you will love this one. Also great, that they removed the subscription. They still add content and keep the game alive and there is also a big community. I recommend to wait for sale and get also the DLCs."
Positive,"Soooooooooooooooooo much to do. I bought ESO with Morrowind, so had to do some googling so I could figure out how to start Tamriel storyline. Basically going in playing blind/learning on the fly. Really fun! I have already come across so many different people that have helped me. Voice acting is so awesome btw, combat feels great. As a huge Skyrim fan, I'm just happy to be playing an Elder Scrolls MMO! Can't wait to put 1000 hours into this game!"
Positive,"Recently, I finally finished the final non repeatable quest in the game. This character had a total of over 950 hours on it. Completing all the base content in the game still takes around 800 hours.This game is filled to the brim with content, over 800 hours for just 20 dollars. The stories the game tells are interesting and engaging, and while some of the base game zones can be a little bland at times, the majority of the game is still beautiful.Pros:Again, 800 hours of content for just 20 dollars.Despite having a store with cosmetic microtransactions, the game is NOT pay to win. The subscription plan, ESO plus, does give subscribers a 10% boost for EXP, but the game constantly throws free exp scrolls at players every time they level up to the point that it doesn't even matter whether or not you have the sub boost.The voice acting and stories for each zone are generally extremely good. The game has extremely memorable characters, genuinely surprising plot twists, and expands on the worldbuilding and lore of Tamriel in a way that hasn't been seen since Morrowind. Speaing of Morrowind...Morrowind and Summerset, the current chapters, are probably the best zones in the game right now. Zenimax has only improved over time, and has continued to create memorable locations and characters, fun questlines, and beautifully crafted locations.Combat isn't anything spectacular, but it's more entertaining than swordfights in Skyrim. You have 6 skills on a skillbar to mix things up, and enemy mechanics that actually challenge your abilities. Leveling has been adjusted to match other elder scrolls games, so now enemy difficulties don't change depending on what zone your in or what level you are. A wolf is a wolf is a wolf, the only thing that makes a difference is your own level and abilities.PvP is fun, there are a variety of modes. You can duel pretty much anywhere just by challenging someone, fight a WvW battle against the two other alliances, or compete in 4 person teams in Battlegrounds sports.House decorating is way too addtiving in the game.Cons:The base game suffers a little with each DLC update. The original zones can seem bland when compared to Summerset or Vvardenfell, and with the One Tamriel update, zones stories suffer dramatically now that they can be done completely out of order. For example, you can kill a lich in Greenshade, then go meet someone in Auridon, watch that person become the lich in Grahtwood, and then go back and kill their wife in Auridon before they even met you.Combat is still pretty meh, but it's a definite improvement over Skyrim. PvP is fun, but PvE can get repetitive over time.Lootboxes exist, though only cosmetic.The UI can be a little annoying sometimes, it has a lot more information than the other Elder Scrolls games, yet also doesn't have enough information for people who like to MinMax. It basically satifisfies nobody.Considering the game is only 10 dollars right now, and there is over 800 hours of content in the base game alone, I can't see any reason not to get it."
Positive,Someone.... spoke to me... D: And it wasn't just an NPC!!
Positive,"Decent game, best with friends and guildmates."
Positive,My love for Elder Scrolls brought me here and i was not dissappointed.It is not crazy after your money unlike some *cough* Star *cough* stuff.Got it on 50% off Sale.Worth it.
Positive,I'm writing this honest and exhaustive review for the sole purpose of fulfilling the summer steam quest.It's a good game.
Positive,All the fighting And The Dolmens Dragons EVERYTHINGAnd The Arena
Positive,Currently a better game than WOW
Positive,Good all around and the fighting style is more in your face then point and click like most games in this style that are open world online.
Positive,"As an avid fan of the Elder Scrolls Games, I actually really enjoyed this game! The character customization, a really big factor for me, is absolutely fantastic! The only things that I really don't enjoy is that the graphics are slightly worse than other Elder Scrolls games and that each update to the game takes FOREVER to download onto my PC. Other than that, this is the perfect game to tie me down until ES7 comes out!"
Positive,This game is amazing
Positive,"The first mmo in my life, I love it"
Positive,Game is amazing its addictive to and alot of fun to play with friends and alot to do
Positive,Great game however you must try to find a good guild early that will help you get the hang of the game. It's really hard to get into with out a consitant group of people to play with. Also do not go into it with the idea that it will be similar to skyrim because its not it any way shape or form.
Positive,I feel that if they doubled the number of player a guild could have then add cross play and then cross save(Warframe a game that is older did) then add - ons for console (like Fallout 4 and Skyrim has mods) . then poeple would be more likely to continue to paly the game and they would see a large number of new players. and made the game run on the hand held platfroms(like steam deck. that asus thing and the nintendo switch.)
Positive,I heard al lot of crap about this game at launch.I waited until the TU update came out before purchasing on PS4I don't play the PS4 much so as much as I enjoyed it I mainly stayed away.I bought this on PC becuase I wanted to play a good MMOAnd I did
Positive,"This game just gets better with every new patch.  Too many players got it when it first came out, rushed to 'end game' and got bored, sad for them.  If you take it slow and just enjoy the ride, you really can't beat this for a MMO.  Don't belive the 6 month old reviews, the bugs, gold farmers, and group sink problems are all for the most part gone."
Positive,"I never played the elder Scrolls series before and didn't know a lot of things about the lore. However in my honest opinion the game is very decent and it is best played with friends. Also if you intend to keep playing regularly and want to buy stuff from the crown store, the eso plus membership is probably the best option."
Positive,"love it, i'm a big fan of elder srcolls.. my favourite on was oblivion"
Positive,Lost all my friendsGained 20 lbsFailed out of college10/10
Positive,Started this game on Xbox and re bought it on PC because it's such a good game. Would highly recommend if you are a fan of the Elder scrolls franchise and like MMO's I only wish they would implement cross save.
Positive,It is a yes because I can use KBM but would MUCH rather use the PS5 controller natively like I can on the PS5. Like why cant you just port the controls over? Really lame. Game is fun enough though
Positive,"The only MMO that filled my old WoW PvE itch. I like it, but I also realize the gameplay isn't for everyone since it's much more Elder Scrolls like than it is MMO like, plus you have limited abilities you can use at one time to compensate for players using controllers.It's solid, easy to get into, and has plenty to do."
Positive,"This is a great game, as long as you don't go into it expecting ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim""The gameplay is much closer to that of ""Oblivion,"" so those that enjoyed ""Oblivion"" will enjoy this as well.The game has leveled items and several special abilities that can be unlocked with skill points, which is new for an elder Scrolls game, but by no means bad.+Good gameplay+Decent story+Excellent crafting system (doesn't let you make super weapon by getting ""increase enchanting"" potions then making ""fortify smithing"" items, and going back and forth with that then making a ""fortify smithing enchantment."") keeps he game fair. although you can improve items.+Sheogorath loves cheese+Best online community I've ever known+Nobody can buy a high level+Can make one forget reality+Awesome immersive music-A lot of in game items cost a ton of gold (the game takes place before Tiber Septim, as far as i can tell) the only thing I didn't like about ""Oblivion.""~Graphics quality (doesn't really factor in into wether a game is good or not)Also, there are giant ### patches for it, but that's probably not an issue for people with good internet and a nice rig(I have neither).--UPDATE-- I built a new computer, As well as my internet.And just like all other Elder Scrolls games, enemy npc's are ###holes.On a positive note, it is possible to see aspects of the game which have been influenced by mods, such as ""Immersive fast travel"" (I actually never liked the whole wayshrine thing, but a lot of people do, so I won't knock it for this) and ""Shields on the back."" *There are more that I haven't mentioned.It also adds a lot more to the Character of Mannimarco, which Oblivion lacked.Overall this a great game that will keep you entertained for long time, and give you sense of accomplishment.--UPDATE--GET THE GOLD EDITION!"
Positive,"Different than Rift, WOW or all the other type that perform the same thing over and over again, kill this than kill something bigger. Cost of expansion alittle pricey and with crowns used to buy certain things like the new merchant or banker that is alittle step considering 50.00 when the game itself has dropped to 39.99 on steam. Heck you can become a vampire or werewolf alot cheaper at 15.00. They need to drop some of the prices for in game alittle to make it more affordable."
Positive,"Amazing game. One of the very few MMOs that can boast true skill based gameplay other than just ""mastering a rotation"". Ive played most MMOs out their and there is far more here than just crunching numbers like you get with most MMOs. I bought into the bad hype early on and didnt give the game a chance until recently. Dont make the same mistake, this game is worth every dime and I will continue my subscription even when the game goes buy to play."
Positive,"Coming back to this game after a year and I'm super impressed. They ironed out so many bugs and quirks I couldn't deal with at launch.Most important however is the near flawless controller implementation.It's the first MMORPG where I can literally lean back and feel perfectly comfortable on the couchwith a controller. The UI changes based on your input so no need for awkward mouse-pointermoving with the analog sticks. Best in class and I wish others would emulate. Also, the game is really good and it might be my least buggy Elder Scrolls experience since Daggerfall."
Positive,definitely does more for the franchise than recent mainline entries
Positive,"Out of all the MMOs I've played. ESO is one of the top MMOs right next to SWTOR. Every other MMO to me at least, boring and not that engaging as SWTOR and ESO. Love it!"
Positive,Do you know how long I've been looking for you?
Positive,World of Elder Scrolls but feels nothing like an Elder Scrolls game. If you are a big fan of MMO's you may still enjoy it. This game has changed immensely over the years and can be enjoyed in groups.
Positive,fx-83208gb ramr9 390can actually get a stable 60 fps compared to the 30-35 fps in skyrim se
Positive,This game caught me offguard how much fun it is. A bit hard when you start but once you get it down its one of the best MMO's ever! the game is insanely fun and the quests stories are all voice acted and amazing.Great game would recommend!
Positive,"This game has had its ups and downs, but lately its only been going up. This game is very friendly for players who aren't fans of MMOs, or the genre. The gameplay and combat is decent, but where the game really shines is the worldbuilding, the writing, the questing, PVP, and last but not least the community. This has the most helpful and least toxic community I have ever played with on an online video game. Guilds make everything easier, and are handled very well. The quests are written well, and every zone has a completely different feeling over arcing story line. EVERY NPC IS VOICED. That is an amazing feature over many other MMOs, and I think for PVE that's why this game does it best. If you haven't gotten this game yet, get it, it's only 10 bucks. There are many expansions, true, but there is enough content to progress without it and not be slowed down. My biggest gripe with this game is that if you want to be a serious crafter, you must have ESO Plus for the craft bag. I hope you buy this amazing game, and enjoy it as much as I have."
Positive,"played this a lot off steam (rebrought on steam to have a second account and the morrowind expansion)This is overall a great MMO, the combat reminds me of a combination of skyrim/oblivions real time combat except blocking and well timed attacks actually matterskills/progress reminds me kinda of WoW/Borderlands, typical MMO classes with different skill trees which is great if you're a fan of older TES gamesExploration reminds me of morrowind, it's not bland like skyrim/oblivionand the quests remind me of oblivion where there are actual twists and somewhat thought put into them rather than skyrims ""go to location and kill X amount of enemies""Overall if you're looking for a great TES themed MMO with great first person you deffinately want ESO (and that's coming from someone who hated skyrim)"
Positive,"i've played since 2017 on PS4 and i must say that comming over to PC was the best choice. everything is improved and better.However i would like to say if you aren't interested in doing Endgame PvE content and solely focus on PvP you might have a hard time getting a build completed, so be prepared, i also highly recommend joining guilds for PvP and PvE as it makes it all the more fun and enjoyable.  i give this game a 10/10 and i highly recommend it! -AzureDraxion, NA server. Former CP400 on PS4 now Lvl 40 on PC at the time of posting this review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          -Update 9/16/2020-Having played this game on PC since the time of this original review. i will say this game is again really amazing. sure it has it's flaws and ups and downs. but Zenimax and Bethesda keep pumping out new expansions and updates to keep this game lively. Once you hit CP  rank in the game. things get better for you. and you level up really fast so you can get right into the action when you hit 160, which is the maximum gear level cap in the game. but don't fret once you hit 160 as you keep gaining CXP and leveling up. You are also greatly rewarded for participating in Dungeons And  in Battlegrounds. Battlegrounds the more team based version of PVP which can if you are an experienced player or just a new player comming in. can be slightly irritating when you get bad teammates. but even then it's worth it because you have fun.9.5/10 - The Bugs and Connectivity problems in open world PVP can be a problem and sometimes straight up annoying. i highly recommend avoiding Open World PvP in Cyrodiil unless you have a powerful internet connection.-AzureDraxion, NA server. Former CP400 on PS4 now CP rank 110 on PC at the time of posting this updated and final review."
Positive,"An MMORPG that can accommodate those of us that can't dedicate every waking moment to it. Plenty of things to do; questing, dungeons, solo dungeons, battlegrounds, Cyrodiil, house decorating, character customization."
Positive,"Excellent game, i really recommend if you are looking for something between WoW and Skyrim.Positives:- I played the beta and the game has improved drastically.- As a solo player, this is great + you can interact with other people in PvP and Dungeons, which are very unique and well designed.- Freedom of chosing how your character develops is very refreshing.- I play without ESO Plus and have a great time, but think it is worth having for all the commodities.Negatives:- Bugs here and there. (Not too many though)- Steam connectivity has been down 2-3 times last couple of times- Not enough communication from Devs when services are down and expected ETA."
Positive,"I remember playing the open beta back in 2014, and it was rather underwhelming. Fast-forward to this past April, and I join on a lark during the free-to-play event, curious how it's survived the half-decade. After a couple days, I buy the game.Lo and behold, I'm still hooked, and have even dragged friends in after me.It's not unlike a multiplayer Skyrim, except the story feels more involved, varied, and reasonable (no, you can't be grandmaster of every guild at once). Like GW2, you can solo most of the content, but if multiple people run together (grouped or otherwise) they all get loot and XP individually. The playerbase is active, and pretty helpful. The benefits of subscription more than pay for the monthly cost--though if you can't afford it, you'll probably run into a lot of inventory management issues and miss out on the DLC. The combat seemed clunky at first, but now that I'm used to it, it has its own special charm. Solid recommend."
Positive,"ESO is everything an Elder Scrolls series enthusiast wants with the challenges of being an MMO where you can battle and explore the world alone or raid with a group of friends. Instances are open which is a plus. The new Morrowind content was fun to play through. Questing will always be one of my favorite things about this series. The downside as with any MMO is where to go once you hit end game, luckily on the horizon is more content ""Summerset"". I do appreciate that this is a beauitufl game with good upkeep, content and it's free to play once you've purchased the game. You can choose to have a Crowns sub or not. It's up to you."
Positive,Great MMO in Elder Scrolls lore.
Positive,There are quite a few bugs.Attack them then press E to scavenge and then R to take all.You can use them to fish.
Positive,i find this game fun to play. if you like roaming in a game to do what you like this is the game for you.
Positive,"Been playing this game since Beta. Loved it from the start. I've even bought it twice just to have it on steam. This game is in my opinion simply epic. The visuals are stunning, the gameplay is great and the content is rich. Thousands of hours can go into this."
Positive,Pretty dank game! 10/10
Positive,I grabbed this when it was free for a week. Middle kid and I fell in love with this game.  I bought us each a copy and we've been playing it almost every night since. Highly recommend.
Positive,"TESO has the best game community, people are so nice <3"
Positive,As a huge Skyrim fan I have to say this game is just like any other game in the franchise; pure art
Positive,"it's like skyrim, but online I also have no clue what I'm doing but I'm having fun anyway"
Positive,"This game is fun, but its kinda fucking ridiculous in the sense that i bought it and downloaded 50gbs and then two days later i had another 25gb patch to download. Like what in the actual fuck..."
Positive,"DO NOT BUY THE GAME THROUGH STEAM!I innitially marked this as a negative review but I don't think the game deserves that. I love the game but having it through steam is very frustrating. It's pretty common that Steam users are unable to log into the game, while non-Steam players can log in no problem. I'm unsure if this is a Valve or ZOS issue but most people seem to blame it on Steam."
Positive,"TL;DR: If you're going to buy this game, buy it through the official site, not Steam.Combat: GreatGrapgics: Pretty goodStory/Lore: As good as any other Bethesda title(F76 excluded)Character progression: Grindy but bearableIMO, this game, both as a MMORPG and TES title, is pretty phenomenal. The only downside is that after every big update, the Steam client goes down for hours on end and you cannot log in via the native client. Until ZOS does something to permanently resolve this, I recommond only purchasing through the official webside."
Positive,"Most likely, there will be nothing new in the comment, but I will say a few words.These are not the scrolls that you and I are familiar with,apparently, it is difficult to combine a single company and an mmo and leave everything in its place.As a result, you expect to see TES gameplay and get disappointed, but if you try to delve into it, the vast world will capture its diversity, and gradually you will begin to learn something native.For the mmo component, everything is classic and fans of the genre will appreciate it.As a result, we get an open world with a lot of opportunities, if you get tired of one thing, you can do another.Of the minuses, this is paid content, even for the thieves guild you need to buy DLC, they don't need stealth to get into your pocket.7/10."
Positive,it's alright i guess
Positive,PLEASE add some kind of overworld difficulty slider :)
Positive,Immersive and gritty with great stories. The classes are flexible and the combat satisfying. Crafting is important and rewarding.
Positive,If you loved skyrim or oblivion... You will love this.
Positive,"I do  not love MMO's but this game has me hooked. It has enough familiarity of the Elder Scrolls feel, and of course its amazing lore! This is one MMO I can enjoy."
Positive,changed a lot for the better from it's original release state nuff said
Positive,"Solid MMO, great Elder Scrolls experience. If you like the series' lore, you'll love this."
Positive,"The S&S - Plenty of fun with friends, great mod support. Huge download though and a lot of the satisfaction from leveling up has been taken out. Roles are pretty blurred making a lot of what doesnt involve PVP feel the same. Doesn't emulate the elder scrolls feeling so don't expect Skyrim Together out of this, but its definitely more involved and interesting than other MMO's."
Positive,"I'm glad that this game is positive reviews now that it has gone to F2P.  I played the beta and was so unimpressed, but they have made a lot of improvments.  I finally feel like I'm playing an elder scrolls game.  The environments look excellent. especially the layout og the cities and their focal points.  Buildings look amazing.  Quest lines are really fun and not the typical farming quests from traditional MMOs.  If you love both Edler Scrolls lore and MMOs, just go ahead and shell out the money for this game and prepare to not be dissapointed."
Positive,"So, it's been a long time since i wrote this review thought i update it..it got so much better over the years, for one and i think most importantly, to people like me; modding it became so much easier. It now has it's own mod manager and all that..Don't take that lightly, for an mmo, modding it's UI is extremely important, some just didn't want to deal with all that manual installing, now it's suuuper easy, in 2019 especially there are tons of great stuff you can color your eso experience with, hotkeyed emotes with their own emote menu even.Anyways about the game itself;So, i'm not too surprised to see an increase on the negative reviews, for ESO this happens regularly, after sales or whatever people get really into this and they become regulars and leave good reviews, it soars after that, but over time the negative ones take over :DThese negative reviews are mostly about the crafting bag thing, which unfortunetly they are correct, having to pay for a crafting bag, not to mention monthly, is absurd :p For those of you don't know what that is it's a bag that's separate from your main one, thus making you have so much more free space for other things, just so happens the world is fiiillleed with stuff you can take, flowers, runes, ores, fish etc etc... all have different kinds too, which is nice but.. well takes too much space. i agree with those reviews something else can be done i think, however they do not make Eso much justice, under that lies an actually fun thing to be in.The rest of the negative ones are your usual crap and are pretty irrelevantSeriously the only bad thing about this thing is the crafting bag and absolutely nothing else, the subscription is pretty neat it gives you all of the dlcs and much more, as i said my friends i agree with the crafting bag thing but this is an actually awesome game.Consider trying it for one month you can cancel it through your ''Account Details'' (its right under your name after you click it top right of the steam client) from there you stop the sub.Or at the very least follow/add to know about if it's a gets a free weekend or whatever judge it then."
Positive,It's like Skyrim without Skyrim11/10 IGN
Positive,It's okay i guess
Positive,many people dislike this game because it is not like skyrim.... ESO is an MMO of course it's not going to be like Skyrim. This game is fun if you play with friends and if you enjoy exploration as well as quest lines
Positive,Is good game
Positive,"in my opinion this is the most beautiful, fun and interesting MMORPG i've ever played. ...but it has a bunch of bugs... and lags now... (zenimax, FIX YOUR GAME).but still... i love The Elder Scrolls series! travel, kill, explore the world! AND don't let anyone shoot your knees!HAIL SITHIS! ✋"
Positive,"Top of its class for action-MMORPGS combat: no cooldowns, dodging, interrupting and blocking. A majority of issues can be found on console platforms or low spec PCs, I've crashed once, literally once on my new 4K rig and I was encoding at the time lol.Buy to play with a decent, mostly cosmetic cash shop. Four content updates of varying sizes each year. Morrowind felt smaller than it should be, Wrothgar and hopefully the fall's DLC region are meatier. All in all, this is one of the few games that I can't step away from. It's polished. It's got great voice acting and more and the possibilities for gear and customization are almost endless (unless you're a meta-sheep and need someone to post a build for you).I can see myself playing this for another three years, catastrophes notwithstanding. Solid 8.5/10"
Positive,"Absolutely have a blast playing this game but every game has its ups and downs. In ESO's case it's more good than bad.Pros:+ Being able to colour armour and clothing is by far one of my favorite new features+ Being able to spawn your mount out of nowhere is a great change of pace+ Love all the mini bosses, there is just the right amount of them+ If you're struggling with a tough boss in most quests, you can literally just wait a minute or so for another player to come along and help you finally defeat that pesky powerhouse of a boss+ The membership is worth it in the long run if you're a highly frequent player. Being able to buy creatures, mounts, and boosts for your character with the allotted crowns is great. The 10% boost in everything is quickly apparent as you do your business throughout the world.+ Never gets boringCons:- Quests can get repetitive, although they all do have their unique attributes- Friends can do the same quest as you but you can't actually do it together. For example: You're doing the same quest and each person has to complete the same objectives seperately alongside each other.- Leveling up crafting skills and leveling up the many passive skills of each crafting skill also gets repetitive and it's mostly worth it in the long run because you can make some pretty awesome armour"
Positive,"If you like mmorpgs, buy it.If you expect it to be like the earlier elder scrolls games, don't buy it.It has no endgame like other mmos but i dont know about the expansion content and havent bothered buying it since the vanilla dungeons and whatever bosses are boring."
Positive,"At launch, the game was quite unplayable because it was full of bugs, beta was even worse. Now it's flawless, have encountered only a few bugs. Very enjoyable game for Elder Scrolls fan."
Positive,"damn it I bought it at full price, still worth it."

Positive,"Really enjoying this game. Tried it out for a hour on the free weekend and ended up buying it on sale. Was worth it for me. I was apprehensive to play it due to some negative comments I have heard in the past, and while I can see how they might not have enjoyed it, I love it. Take advantage of the free couple days and give it a shot. It just might be something you will enjoy. :D Plus if you like it, and buy it for about $10 on sale right now, then you also get 500 Crowns. That's enough to get a starter pack and get a bunch of goodies including a pet and mount!"
Positive,"I really like the game a lot. But... every time a new patch comes out or, even worse, a new DLC is launched, there are major issues with logging in for Steam users.It is a wonderful game with a huge open world and about a million things to do and enjoy yourself, but the log in issues stop me from recommending the game to anyone.----A few months later I am happy to say that I have not have much issues with logging in after patches or new content releases. Therefore, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to wander through a seemingly endless world full of adventures."
Positive,You want Skyrim online? this aint it. its a whole other beast. If you can jump in and not expect Skyrim online but treat it as a take on Elder Scrolls that happens to BE online. Its actually not bad. 3.5/5 stars solo . 4/5 stars if you can play with some buddies.
Positive,"At the start I hated that game beacuse i thought it can be way more when i wrote my last reveiw I played only 7 hours but know I gave it a second try learnd more about the game and it's fun not like the previous ES games I think its the worst Elder Scrolls game I played but Elder Scrolls game are amazing and trying to publish another one and to be good like the last one is probably hard as I said this game is still fung and has a lot thing to offer. but what I hate about it is the combat it's ok when you start getting used to personally I prefer Skyrim's combat. The second thing that I hate is that are a lot of DLCs I know that you can put a lot of hours into the game and  still can't complete the whole game it has a lot to offer but if you want to be an assassin you can't stealth kill without the Blade of woe which is only in the DLC the dark brotherhood that costs 2,000 crowns which is around the 16$ but it is the only DLC out of many. afte all I'll give this game a rating 8/10"
Positive,Very funn if you have friends that plays it with you. If not it's fun as well
Positive,This game is awsome I defenethly recommend it.
Positive,Very fun and engaging. Tons of quests and you will never run out of stuff to do. Only issue is the bs microtransactions.
Positive,"Im really surprise how good that game is... and in this momet for 10€ is like must have. Cant wait to late game and more game mechanics, but exploring world is grat. It looks really awesome for MMO. Combat is fast ant energyful. In this mometn i just dont know, if i will buy all the expansions or i will pay the gamepass :)"

Positive,"Specs belowUpsideThe game's performance is pretty decent on my rig. 95% of the time my framerate is 60+, which is great.The graphics aren't particularly spectacular, but they're not terrible, either. They're good enough that you don't really think about them much, if at all.Lots of missions and quests, so you always have something to do, despite the rewards being a bit underwhelming.You can loot everything, just like in Skyrim - crates, pots, etc. If you see it, there's an 80% chance you can loot it.Some character customization. Nowhere near as good as Skyrim's, but I guess it'll suffice.Downside - It's an MMO after all, so it acts like one...Equipment is either overpriced (vendors) or crap (found). It's an MMO, so you won't find good stuff easily like in Skyrim.In-game services are way too overpriced. Ex. Bank -> 1000g to get 10 extra slots. 1000g is not easy to get until much later.Expanding on the last point, this game is not for looters, because both your inventory and bank are going to fill up way too quickly, and as I said before, it's expensive as hell to expand your space.The graphics, as mentioned above, aren't too terrible, but for this day and age, and this price, I expected something better.While I do appreciate you having the choice to be bad - ex. killing innocent people and getting a bounty - I feel like stealth wasn't considered, so even if no one is around, you'll still get a bounty and be globally wanted, which defeats the purpose.SpecsMobo: Asus m5a99fx pro r2.0CPU: AMD FX-8350 4GHzGPU: MSI R9 390 8GBRAM: 8GB DDR3-1600OS: Windows 10 64-BitPSU: Corsair CX600M (600W)"
Positive,"I have played this game for almost 900 hours at the time of this review (11.16.2016).  I pre-ordered when the game came out, and am now purchasing it on Steam (so that I can have it on my Steam profile).I came from to this game from WoW, and this was the first MMO since WoW that had captured my attention.  I still have fond memories of my first few hours in Elwynn Forest, and I have similar memories with ESO in Bleakrock Isle (part of the Ebonhart Pact).The combat is wonderfully rewarding, the voice acting is superb, and the world is vast.  I have only had a single character since April of 2014, and I am still discovering things in the world like they are brand new.  I also played Skyrim as my first Elder Scrolls game when it came out originally on 11.11.11.  This game is not Skyrim, nor is it anything like it.  It is an MMO set in the same universe, and it is wholly unique in that regard.  Give it a shot and see what you think.  If you like it, then maybe we can group up and fight against the forces of Oblivion!"
Positive,I have a fair amount of hours on this game now and can only recommend it. I am still progressing through the story after 300+ h and it doesn't get stale to me. You also don't need to play everyday and can advance at your own pace.
Positive,"The story is what kept me playing as long as I did. You can get lost in the story. Almost like reading a great book but you decide what happens.The game itself looks good even for it's age, but the game play gets very repetitive and boring.I would recommend it for those who love lore and story. The game play is kind of dated, but the dev team continues to add content and improvements constantly. In a world where 90% of what gaming companies put out is garbage, this is still a gem in the rough if you ask me."
Positive,"Bought the game to play with friends, its a good game, lots of places to visit, things to do, enemies to kill. Base game is good on its own but if you want the full experience, you will have to buy DLCs that are not that cheap and even then you dont have access to full game, only way to do that is by paying monthly subscription or buying all the little DLC expansions. My recommendation is to buy base game, see if you like it, and only then get subscription, as i hear that many people have problems with unsubbing. DLCs are good but not really worth the money, you get like few more missions/quests and thats it. Monthly sub is also not that good and all the stuff you get for it should already be in the base game, like that materials bag (need to worry less about looting sacks and chests), the rest you get is only 10% exp more, so for a price of 13ish euros, its not worth,  at least they give you access to more places but that stops when you stop paying the sub. But aside from huge amount of money required to play this game as intended, this game is pretty fun to play with your friends, even if you dont have friends it can be played solo. Just wish they made solo mode for places and dungeons, like, I went to a dungeon and the story of the quest was that I alone was chosen for this certain task, so no other person can do it but me, and then, as you go deep into dungeon, there is 10 other players with their shiny bloody pets and all assistants  just bloody standing in the middle of the bloody room, like come on, ""Only one who can do this task and enter this room"" ""This amulet is the unique and it will bring you to this place where you can enter only with this amulet"" and even more frustrating is when you are in that same dungeon and there is enemy boss you need to take out, and you dont even come close to it because some other player, the second ""only one in the world"" already killed this boss. As of now, there is no way or even a slight hint that solo/story mode is in the game nor that it will be added, which really grinds my cheese, and i mean really grinds my cheese. Overall, its a good game, if you skip all the paytoplay parts and focus on the good story that will be ruined by high level players that rush dungeons, kill your npcs and such. 7/10 would recommend."
Positive,Why i can review this? even though I don't have the game?

Positive,Most of the negative comments are from before the b2p update. It is better now.
Positive,"despite being an OG fan of the elder scrolls games, and not considering it really all that similar to the ES console games, I still find this game incredibly entertaining and addictive in its own charming way. highly recommend if you are into mmorpgs and related"

Positive,"Very enjoyable games. DLC release at a reasonable pace, and the game is honestly enhanced tenfold when you find a guild that you're comfortable with. Off the top of my head, the only complaints I have are very, very minor things that more often than not, are remedied with mods/add-ons.Find yourself a nice guild, have some fun, and see what ESO has to offer."
Positive,"MMOs get boring for me fast, but Elder Scroll Online is different for me for some reason, i always find myself coming back to it even after i stop playing it, i like a lot of single players, you can play this like an MMO or single player better then WoW imo, i like that NPCs actually have a voice over having to read dialogue, your class isnt stuck with a specific weapon, you can use any weapon, and level up the skill trees to your liking, the only trees you cant get on different chracters are class skill trees"
Positive,"this game is pretty great, but 2 of my biggest concern is that 1. quest is really fun and all of them are voiced, but the reward is terrible. 2. I feel like im not progressing, it would take me the same amount of time to kill a creature when I was level 1 with crappy weapon and crappy ability than a legendary weapon with top tier ability and very high level, because the enemy progresses with you aswell. so if you don't mind that. then try it out."
Positive,"re-edited out of sheer boredomESO is one of the most frustrating experiences to me, because it does some of the coolest shit in the MMO space and it also fails spectacularly in others.IMO the combat looks and feels like trash. Animations are stiff, and the combat requires clipping animations and shit to be competitive. Skills are not super fun, and the way they've built the game almost everyone FEELS sorta mage-y and the melee combat is just floaty and unsatisfying. And class skills feel a bit tertiary to weapon skills, and with the limited skill bar it makes it feel like there are actually 6 classes in the game (Resto, Mage, 2hander, dual wield, sword/board, archer) with a bit of flavoring from the actual class being played.Beyond that the game is a technical mess, server issues that have persisted for years and only been exacerbated with the rising player counts in the pandemic. Their mass-pvp feels completely underdeveloped but most importantly it doesn't even function properly and hasn't (for years) due to massive lag/desync. And then when you mix the combat issues above with the 'weaving' animation cancelling that is very required in pvp, and pvp generally looks like a muddy spastic laggy mess and no serious pvper is still in the game.All that being said, jesus christ does it do some things fantastically. One Tamriel gives unprecedented freedom in where to go, and while it creates a little bit of weirdness with gear scaling its a small price to pay for being able to do anything, at any time, and be rewarded for it in character progression. Massive win for this game.So much good, quality voice-acting. All quests are written like 'main quests' and I've honestly never seen an MMO that gives so much story impetus for every quest. The stories are also pretty engaging and the world is semi-reactive to things you've achieved or done in the zones (much better than even Skyrim was).There are loads of dungeons, I mean loads. Almost all of them are really good fun, and they are all always relevant.The gear system, as noted above, is the best I've personally seen in an MMO and had me theory crafting sets like a fiend. Being able to look at what gear was available, throw together a combination that worked with what I was trying to do with my character, and seeing it work so fucking well in practice was an immaculate experience. I got to run dungeons and do quests in certain zones to hunt for gear for my sets, working with players to take down world bosses (from newbs to maxed players, all in the game world working together due to One Tamriel scaling), etc. PVPing to get the good enchants, hunting for treasure chests in nooks and crannies of the map, participating in general world events for the gear.... list goes on.The gearing system is genius. It combined with One Tamriel means that there is a constant need to do all content at all times. It is the horizontal progression that people on this board complain does not exist in MMOs... ESO has actually done it. And it works! Yes, there are always 'meta' builds or whatever. But they are NOT needed unless you are leaderboard chasing and then if you are, you can work on crafting yourself a set specifically to push time! You literally are encouraged to forge sets for different activities. That gets you in the game world participating in content. Its a self-perpetuating loop and its so so good.So anyways, this game pisses me off. Because the core experience of interacting with the world, the combat, is laggy and spazzy and terrible. It doesn't feel great to actually play.But the content there is so good. Ugh."

Positive,"Pros+ Rich lore, best storytelling mmo i've played+ Gorgeous landscapes+ Awesome soundtrack+ Good skill progression+ Versatile builds+ Lot of content+ Good optimazition and good graphicsCons- DLCs are quite expensive- No PvP server, only on a certain location- Without expansions the game feels ""empty""this is a review of someone that is in love with the actual state of the game and thinks that is the most underated mmo out there"
Positive,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
Positive,"It has lots of the great lore and world building like other elder scroll games, but because it is an MMO at the end of the day there a few choices, gameplay is good and endgame can be very complex at times, but with a few videos and build guides it is ok. Great DLC's if a bit overpriced, as your basically forced to get ESO Plus to play the DLC's. overall its a great game and well worth looking into.Looking back at this several hundred hours later I only have more praise"
Positive,"I honestly went into ESO not expecting much.  I got it for cheap during last year's ""free week"" promotion, and I figured it would be a decent time waster.My playtime should be a good indicator that it ended up being FAR more than I thought it would be.Taking place in the Second Era, well before the events of even Arena, players are thrust into a two pronged war.  On one side, three Alliances vye for domination of Cyrodil and Tamriel as a whole in the wake of the Emperor's disappearance.  On the other side, Molag Bal, the only Daedric Prince who can accurately be called evil, has launched his own invasion of Tamriel, seeking to enslave everyone.  As a member of one of the three Alliances, you must not only bring glory to your Alliance, but also combat the forces of Coldharbour.The general gameplay of ESO is very similar to Skyrim's, but expanded to an MMO scale.  There are now distinct classes, each with their own abilities, but in proud ES tradition, you can truly play the way you want to.  Want to be a Templar who dishes out fast damage while also healing?  Go ahead!  Want to be a juggernaught in Heavy Armor while also dishing out massive damage with dual weilding?  Go right ahead!  The customization options are staggering, and whatever your preferred role in combat is, you're bound to find your niche regardless of your class.The game world itself is massive.  Easily twice the size of Oblivion and Skyrim combined.  There is so much to do, so many quests to undergo, dungeons to explore, and secrets to discover.  And this is just the MAIN game.  There is also a plethora of excellent DLC that add massive amounts of content.I'm over 200 hours in, and I still haven't even touched the DLCs and the Morriwnd expansion.  That's how content rich this game is.  If you're willing to give ESO a chance, you will not be disappointed.  I know I wasn't."
Positive,"Been looking for a good mmo to sink myself into, ever since Runescape became as boring as it is (and that was a long time ago). And I think ESO might be it, I'm happy with my purchase and look forward to the years of content it will provide."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls online is an electronic MMORPG, for me it's not better than the previous games that were not MMO ( Skyrim, Oblivion, etc) but still a good game. Is like the other games of the category, you can make your character, you can choose your class, customize it, do quests, pass level, get new equipment and powers,etcGraphics are cool, the story and gameplay too."
Positive,"Really enjoying this game, however it seems to be sucking a lot of money on a regular basis as much of the paid stuff is quite expensive"
Positive,best game ever
Positive,My primary MMORPG.
Positive,The best Elder Scrolls Facebook GameGraphics : Drakan + 3dfx card /10
Positive,"Amazingly immersive game. It's great to play solo but keep in mind you will need to group up to complete aspects of this game. If you don't personally know anyone who plays, the zone chats are pretty helpful when you ask them and the dungeon finder will queue you up with players to complete those as well. The crafting aspect of this game is pretty limitless. It's very easy to get lost in all the aspects of this game and it makes a great tool for detaching one's self from the stress of society."
Positive,"FIrst of all, Dont compare this game to skyrim or other bethesta games.This is Zeminax not Bethesa.This is just MMoRPG set in Elder Scrolls Universe loong before dragonborn even appeared.And it's perfect. First of all you might get angry on all money it wants you to put it. But you don't need single DLC to enjoy this game.I played this whole time without single DLC and there is still so many things to do.Every quest is voiced, quest give you choice how to finish them. Character customization is great as well.Game gives you chance to win store item for free from time to time. Events are great and unique.It's notching like other MMORPG you ever played trust me. Skill system is unique. Your character is not bound to specific class you chosed. You can make him anything. Just pick up weapon you want to use and train skill in it. Combination are endless.Try it. Make friends people are social. Guilds are on every step you make.There is even strong Roleplaying community present.10/10"
Positive,"I've played it for some time and so far have pretty much no complaints. It's what you'd expect from an MMO modification of the Elder scrolls franchise. Some good:Map size, its pretty damn big and only a fhew regions are locked behind DLC.Combat, ofc this part is important and it does involve some thinking to really maximize your outcome, from doging to blocking to magic attacks its all thereCrafting, Suprisingly not the biggest pain I imagined its quite easy to use and actually not even necessary to useQuests, there's actually alot of quests and all NPC's are fully voiced! The tales are interesting and the rewards are good too.Very fair priced DLC with abundant discounts and expansive content, you get alot and quite often a sale will save you alot :0Seals of endeavor: special daily/weekly challenges that award the player a special currency to be used in a diffrent version of a ""premium shop"" but as to be expected may be a tiny bit grindyThe Character creator: Posterior dimensions, any questions?The bad: The game can easily be quite overwhelming to newcomers even returning often leaves me stumped as to what is what and what to do.Crowns the games premium currency used for buying mainly cosmetic items cannot be earned traditionally only via purchase or player trading.The map can often be problematic and confusing to useAs with any MMO the player will often be rewarded with items that are essentially useless to themMaking any extensive cosmetic change to your character or even changing the hairstyle requires a special token that is purchased trough premium currencyPretty much sums it up, its quite fun to play casually and do yourself a favor... Be cautious around guilds, I've often seen them behave more like scams than fun groups"
Positive,"Don't buy it expecting Online Skyrim.Buy it expecting a fresh take on an MMO that adds a lot to the story of The Elder Scrolls that we love, because that is what it is. I'm at 200+ hours and haven't even completed the quests in my faction. Let alone the other 2 factions that you can visit freely. I also can't wait to try out the pvp, once I'm skilled and confident enough. I don't think there's anything I dislike about this game, other than guilds spamming their hiring ads in the zone chat."
Positive,"You will need ESO+ eventually to really get the full experience of this game, but damn hell its a good one.The base game is passable, its a solid introduction to the world, but its real strengths show up in the later DLC. If you like the TES world already or are looking for a reason to invest yourself more into it without browsing the wikipedia page or playing morrowind, this is a great place to start with mountains of singleplayer content. Afterwards just play morrowind anyway"
Positive,"After the end of World War II, the world was split into two - East and West. This marked the beginning of the era called the Cold War."
Positive,10/10 would sell my brother for this game again
Positive,"It's ""The Elder Scrolls"" online... pure Roleplay, massive Story and Adventure!"
Positive,"if you enjoyed Skyrim or Oblivion, this is an excellent addition to the Elder Scrolls collection.  If you are a crafter at heart, I highly recommend a subscription as the crafting bag is a life-saver."
Positive,"This game is one of the only MMOs, that has withstood the test of time in my heart. Regular content and events continue to build on the story and keep my interest. The PvP is like no other, and the community is a bit more mature than most MMOs."
Positive,"i Love this game, i did buy it when it was 19.99 and im glad i did, i have played other mmorpgs recent one was swtor and this game excedes everything about it, its fun, graphiccs are nice on ultra settings and the customization of your character, only thing i dislike is that there arnt alot of options in the character creation but besides that everything else is great, i would recommend this to anyone and as for the download if you have a good fast internet it shouldnt take longer than 2-5 hrs depending on the speed, took me 2 hrs to download the installation and it didnt take long at all to patch so if you are willing to be patient and wait for it to finish, but ill be playing this alot more than any other game, also if you like skyrim then this is not the game for you, this game plays nothing like skyrim so if thats what you are looking forward then look else, besides that the game is fun."
Positive,"Only the best MMO in world but PVP however is really laggy and not balanced because some classes are pathetic some are OP but most cases u will be just using your class pasives with weapon skills what is sort of stupid cuz u lose all class personality. but thats not all they also have wierd very strong Sets that can make your build most OP or most pathetic. And don't even say anything about necromancers. they got good passives but they got only 2 good spells bone goliath and blastbones, and blastbones are little anoying to master but thats beside the point. They don't feel like necros in any way. they feel like necro wanna bes. Just pathetic not even decent undead summons. just 1 for 15 sec and 1 that blasts. even sorcerer is better in that way WITH PERMA 2 summons. like WTF is that.does zenimax know what necromancers are ? like in lore they build army in hopes of taking whole tamriel over. in practice u summon single skeleton and call ur self a necromancer. so its just a mancer. no necro. But thats besides the point PVP bad classes are unbalanced and almost unimportant. worst Necromancers in whole game library here they indeed lost necro and are left with just mancer. But hey. Still love ESO just hope that they will fix these issues."
Positive,"Not as good as oblivion, but far better than skyrim, atleast that's what i think. The thieves guild and dark brotherhood expansions are awesome, and its a first mmo im actually playing in 1st person rather than 3rd person. Overall id reommended atleast trying the game, when its on discount its worth the price."
Positive,"1000 hours ... hmmm ... it's taken a while to get there ... this is a game that I pick up every now and then ... I love the voice acting & the detail of the questlines ... for those just starting, I'd recommend doing a bit of online research ... there's a good guide on completing quests in a chronological order that helps with absorbing game lore.  All the best!"

Positive,nigga its good
Positive,Amazing game. I have played it since beta and is still among my top games.
Positive,"Biggest Pro: Being able to go just about anywhere from the beginning, plus the scaling system, means that this game is great for those who have a friend that just can't commit the massive amounts of times MMOs generally call for.Biggest Con: Without a subscription to get access to the Craft Bag, inventory management is a fucking nightmare"
Positive,"Highly Recommended Game. I have been playing this game for many years now. I will pop off and play something else but I will always come back to this game. You will enjoy this game if you like the following:1. Open world2. Immersive Story3. Non-linear Avenues - Some days I want to quest or seek skyshards or dungeon or group dungeon or pvp. 4. You want to make more than one character but do not want to 'grind'. In this game, once one character levels to champion point stage as soon as a character hits level 50 it will be like it was the same as your first high level.5. Mid to High-level graphics6. Add-on plugin mod-ability. There are players who have hundreds of add-ons adjusted to their ESO account based on taste.7. Guilds of all shapes and sizes - Most games if you are gone from a game for more than a couple of weeks, you are removed, in ESO, you will find many guilds understanding that ESO is not your only game and you will always come back.8. Not pay to win but buy to play. What you invest in the game is up to you. You can play with just the base game or buy DLCs or Expansions.9. The ESO subscription plan is optional. Unlike FF XiV online, you do not have to pay for the subscription. If you do, use the official website not steam.ESO Subscription Benefits1. access to all DLCs whether you own them or not2. Free crown points every month (they equal to more than if you bought them instead of getting a subscription (a little over $15 worth)3. Access to Craft Bag - a bag that separates out all crafting supplies and does not count against your inventory4. Double bank space5. progression bonuses- 10% Exp gains, 10% gold increase, 10% crafting inspiration gains, 10% trait research times6. extra furniture space in homes that you own7. Exclusive Crown Store Sales - often there will be a sale and free items every week or so like free furnitureCons to ESO1. This is not a fast-paced game. While it is not a ""grind"" so to speak, the game is aimed at PVE rather than PVP. If you dislike questing or open worlds, I would not suggest playing2. Updates are large. They usually are pretty quick to update, but if you have add-ons be prepared to handle add-on errors till the local community updates them3. Cost - If you are planning on playing the game beyond the standard edition, it will cost. Once per year since Morrowind, ESO implements an expansion. The expansion is not available to try on ESO plus so it will have to be purchased if you want to explore. On average the Expansions cost $39-$59 depending on what edition (only buy upgrade editions if you have the base game). 4. Learning Curve - ESO has a higher learning curve than most games. It has beginner's training but most of the time you will need to find out for yourself how things will go. Like with games like Path of Exile, you may often pick the wrong weapon, gear, or skills and have to readjust accordingly.5. PVP Lag - as of Mid/Late 2018 when I last checked, the PVP areas are still pretty laggy6. Party Que - For as long as I can remember, the Party Que for Group dungeons rarely works. If you want to do the daily group dungeons get a guild and group up because if you are a DPS good luck finding a random party."
Positive,"The game has come along way since the beta which is when i played the most in.Pros:1.amazing story, the game will immerse you in this and it will make you want to do at least 1 playthrough the build up toward the boss is amazing and is not a let down when you fight him.2.Lore, its elder scrolls lore so ye enough said.3.content, holy crap tons of content and its all voice acted which is amazing!Cons:1.Feeling like you have to pick this race cause powers, i hate that certain races have this or that id like to be able to build around with all clases into one race personally like a elder scroll game and even most modern mmos. 2.Very few classes, the game simply has 4 classes im sorry i get you will argue that you can mix alot into them but guild wars 2 and many other modern mmos do the same with more than 4, for me personally i would love to see more.3.dungeon finders seem to still not work? Idk if this is 100% true but even in beta and just recently i tried again, the dungeon group finders seem to either not work at all or take 2 hours to find one, you're better off finding a guild or waiting for some people at the undaunted place to get players. (least in the brovenant)4.optimization, its terribly crazy terrible im sorry but the fact is u cant even run this game on anything but high otherwise the game looks like the sun a very pixel sun and it hurts, it would be nice if players could play on even medium without their eyes burning away from the particles.Short and sweet only posted this to maybe improve the game sense i see it still hasnt been optimized even now from beta..... also the load times and the patch lengths are pretty insane probably the biggest in mmo history."
Positive,"Honestly a great game! I love how its not a pay to win game like most other MMO games and If you want to spend months on a game this is definitely the one to play. The only problem is that the DLC's are really expensive, but that doesn't really stop you from enjoying the game because they aren't really necessary, but if you do get them I can guarantee that you will have spent your money well. Its well worth the hours you will put in DLC or not."
Positive,I just love it. I love them all. Haters gonna hate ;)
Positive,This game has gotten so much better since its release. I just find myself mindlessly wandering around talking to NPC's and learning more about my favorite game universe.
Positive,Best MMORPG to me
Positive,This game has taken my life---*maintenance starts* welp time to go play another elder scrolls game for 2-6 hours.
Positive,this game is great and you dont need a good pc to run it
Positive,This is the best MMO download simulator I've ever played.  First you download the game over steam.  Then you start playing the game and download again.  It's great.  Sometimes I'll invite my friends over and we'll download as a group.  We'll sit together and just watch it download for hours.  Simply amazing!
Positive,"This has to be the most fun MMO I've ever played.  The world is huge, there's lots to do and the game seems to be well made (after lots of improvements).  I became a fan of The Elder Scrolls when Skyrim came out.  If you love Skyrim you need to play ESO.  Unlike WoW you don't have to pay a subscription.  Shortly after playing ESO I was addicted.ProsVery fun MMORPGLots to do, lots of questsLike Skyrim but betterGraphics are great!SoundtrackYou can have up to 8 characters per account.Haven't encountered bugs or glitches. They've patched it up good.Subscription is optional (but you get perks if you do).There's more pros but I don't want to write too much here.ConsCan't re-customize your character.  Make sure you customize your character the way you want because you can't change it later.  Hopefully in the future they'll allow this.The set up was time-consuming.  It's a big game so this is to be expected.  Download, start ESO account, put game key on your account, then download any necessary patches, etc.  MMOs have more stuff to go through to play but since I've not played a lot of MMOs I found just getting started took up a lot of time.  Still worth it.  Other than that I can't find any issues with the game."
Positive,"One of the best MMORPGs I've played so far and that's coming from someone who played WoW for like 12 years. Great lore, great gameplay and you can really get yourself immersed in it if you start going through the story, listening to the music and taking in the scenery. One of the few MMOs that has a strong single player experience, while still offering that high tier group PVE and PVP content for those who want a challenge. Progression is also balanced, you don't feel the pressure of leveling up to experience the content, nor the pressure to gear up and keep getting gear to stay relevant, you just hit the level cap (50), gain some champion levels (the end game progression levels) and craft or farm some gear and you are done with the entire process, you'll never change your gear with every expansion like in other MMOs, unless there is a particular set that catches your fancy. For those who want to invest real money into the game, the price is fair and you can experience hundreds of hours with the DLCs and expansions, on top of the other hundred hours of the base game content, while you don't feel like you're shafted for the amount spent.I play on the ESO Launcher, not on Steam, so my actual hours are around 4k across 9 characters."
Positive,Really good mmo none like the ones i played
Positive,"Honestly, I was skeptical of this game since it was announced. I had no intentions of buying it, but after trying it on the free weekend I quickly bought it. I wish more MMOs were like Elder Scrolls Online."
Positive,"I played WoW for a couple of years. I love MMORPGs, the feeling of adventures, playing with others. After quitting I played open world games like Skyrim for compensation. I was stunned by the story of ESO which I never heard of before (never heard of Morrowind, Daggerfall, Oblivion). TESO - Elder Scrolls Online, was a little bit the best of the best for me. And I am not disappointed:- A huge, open world- Amazing graphics- Good spell animations- Interesting story lines- Good and different quest types (no collect X of Y quests)- An acceptable amount of players- No abonnement (!)You can chose your alliance, your race, your class. But without having problems of chosing the wrong: Be flexible and wear heavy armor with a mage. Become a healer not by chosing one, become a healer by chosing mage and use healing scepters. You change your mind? No problem: Just stop using healing scepters, start using destruction scepters. Or swords. Or whatever you want.Negative points:- You level extremely fast (good for students without much time, not good for bored pupils wich much time)- The amoung of gold you get for quests etc. is way too less for some items. You have to trade with higher players.- Sometimes the landscape seems to be a little bit boring (in general not)- High Elves are highly boring: Their architecture is as stunning as hot air."
Positive,"I have been searching for an MMO that would rekindle my love for them ever since I finished GW2.  This is it, the love of my life (but don't tell FF14 that). True to it's word, it really is a culmination of all the Elder Scrolls games and more.  You won't want for lore, won't want for all the crafting skills, and the community is fantastic.  My only problem with the game is once I play it, I can't stop, and I have a regular job so pls, Bethesda, spare me. Of course, as someone who played almost every Elder Scrolls games, I can see the faults of the game but you have to keep in mind that this is an MMO; it's harder to build and harder to maintain.  The fact that they have almost everything down pat is something remarkable, and it's really a great bang for your buck. So buckle up, explore Tamriel, get into one of the roleplay guilds and live a life of anything you want to be in this great game."
Positive,"A complete time sink, but damn it keeps me coming back.  THIS IS NOT A ROLE PLAYING GAME, but this is a great MMO.  It's not role playing game because your character almost never has real options.  Basically, almost every quest assume that not only is your character good, but that you have a particular view of the situation which is the same as the developer.  If you are coming from other TES games, this can be a harsh contrast.  There is no true equivalent to the daedric quest lines from other TES games where your character does something complete beyond the pale like become a cannibal or murder an entire town, though daedra are present in many quests.  In general, the quest design is quite weak and boils down to collecting x objects, killing x enemies, or defending an ally while they do something.  There are quests which break this formula and those really stand out. The game truly shines in its dungeons and trials.  There is lots of cool enemy design and running random dungeons is fun and rewarding.  The biggest problem is excessive queue times as DPS, which is the role of the vast majority of players.   They need to do more to encourage players to spec as tanks instead of DPS.  The wait times as DPS are simply to long when compared with queue times in league, Overwatch, or really any other popular multiplayer game."
Positive,Buyer beware. Those of us steam client users in NA are having issues logging in. This is apparently only affecting those of us who have our ESO accounts linked to our steam accounts.
Positive,"grindy , but it is worth it"
Positive,"The good: -Elder Scrolls has an incredible lore, and I mean it. As a fan of worldbuilding, the amount of complexity and thought put on Elder Scrolls lore is astounding. -ESO allows you to go to a lot of the places on Tamriel and also some places outside of it, and choose which one you want to go to at all times, allowing for you to learn about the lore of specific people and places at your own pace.-ESO community is good and helpful and a lot of people are willing to lend you a hand at all times. I've met wonderful people there.-ESO also gives you complete control on when do you want to participate in PvP, so you are safe to roam the world having a completely PvE experience if you want.-The sense of humor is on point and I genuinely laugh at a lot of the content.-Sun-In-Shadow is one of the best written characters I met and I hate her.-If you choose to buy the ESO+ subscription, the amount of crowns you get with it cancels the cost of the subscription entirely (you get more coins with ESO+ monthly than you will get with the same money separately). It also unlocks all the DLC except for Elsweyr, and all the rewards that come with them, so if you can pay it, it is quite worth it for that alone.The bad:-ESO has a bad case of implementing things without testing them enough. Half of the live events broke something in the game when they go live, to the point that one of the latest ones had to be cancelled entirely.-I didn't had that experience personally, but it seems that the customer support is quite bad.-I am lucky that the ESO+ subscription is quite cheap where I live. If you want to be a crafter, ESO+ is almost mandatory.-Elsweyr is... misleading. It is advertised as a chapter and an upgrade and it is quite expensive, but to be honest, besides the dragons (which is basically 99% of the selling points) I found other DLCs like Murkmire to be equally or more interesting.-The system for selling items to other players is tortuous. If you want to become a merchant, you need to either advertise your items in the chat incessantly, or join a trader guild, list your items in the guild without a (built in) reference of how much you should sell them for, and pray your guild can afford a good stall so you can sell to users outside of the guild."
Positive,"Great game, Just don't get on steam"
Positive,Played for a bit. It's been a'ight.
Positive,"It's okay. It plays well, looks decent, but the game world ultimately feels hollow and empty and I personally find the gameplay kinda bland. Perhaps I have been spoiled by the superior battle mechanics and immersive atmosphere of great Single-player games that offer a better experience and I am judging Elder Scrolls too harshly. Here's some of the main reasons I didn't like it:Limited inventory storage, the entire game is a loot fest, throwing you weapons, sellable items and crafting resources and here you have 60 inventory slots to carry and offload things to a vendor for profit. The npc storekeepers can usually only be found in the heart of big cities and can't be found in the wildness, so I would usually have to delete my less valuable loot to make space for the new drops I got that are more valuable.The skill leveling system is a bit confusing. There is a progress bar for leveling up abilities, but it doesn't seem to fill up through ability usage during combact. Sometimes I get the random ability level up whle reading books or finishing a quest despite said ability xp bar being empty, sometimes I defeat a monster exclusively with sword strikes alone and my Summoning skill or Dark Magic spells level up upon the foes defeat. Still, my most spammed abilities refuse to level up and I can only guess there is some unexplained milestone system where I have to unlock more advanced abilities to level up my basic ones after a certain point. Don't know, ability level up seems random.No immersion. This is the worst offender for me, no matter how good the writing, the level design or the quest line you are following, there is a constant influx of other players jumping around beside you in unexplored dark crypts and desert dungeons, fighting the bosses you have arrived to slay, interacting with the items you are supposed to investigate, emptying the enviromental loot nodes spawning at the location and clearing all the mobs all the way to the boss room. You are talking to NPCs during quests while other players are slaying mobs beside them. You don't have the chance to be immersed in the game while all this is happening around and even worse, to counter the constant mob slaying the monster respawns are set on a very low cooldown, meaning that you either have nothing to slay because the dungeons are crowded, or that you have to rush through every location you clear to avoid fighting the mobs that will respawn beside you around 20 seconds after you kill them.Empty world with just a handfull of available quest (5?) at major locations. The worlds of Gothic 3 and Fallout 3 felt more populated and alive that this and their locations felt more unique. Old WOW did this better back in the day, that's how empty this world feels.The combat is nothing special, but here I admit that I have played Dark Messiah resently and nothing can compare with its hack and slash first person combat system.To sum up, if you want to explore a vast medieval world this isn't the worst you could do, but there are better fleshed out worlds out there like Warcraft, and if you really want to be immersed in the lore and story of a fantasy world and aren't here to play co-op with your friends, I would recommend you go for a single player title like Gothic 3, Dragon Age, Dark Messiah and so on."
Positive,love eso soo fun so much
Positive,"if youre a fan of elder scrolls lore, this is for you, plenty of solo content here for solo players, plenty of everything to be honest. pvp pve dungeons social its all here"
Positive,"Best MMO available imo... It has its faults, but it's overall one of my favorite games ever. It's really easy/cheap to try out, so I'd highly recommend you do! Pros:Questing is A+ and there's an obnoxious amount of it.PVP can be exhilarating when servers are running wellPVE content is super fun, with accommodations for hardcore and casual players alikeCons:Server performance continues to be an issueSome of the best cosmetics are locked behind a paywallTaking the game seriously requires ESO+ (Monthly Sub)EDIT: I'm returning after about 1 year off. The game has its up and downs but it has a solid player base, and I truly miss it. This is an imperfect, beautiful experience. Come try it, it's super cheap and worth a go!"
Positive,"People will tell you not to go into this expecting Multiplayer Skyrim, I think that is only a half-truth. while the mechanics are obviously tailored to an MMO, the mood and writing are all classic elder scrolls.Playing in first person with a controller is a viable and fun way to play the game. I find the story interesting, the quests are engaging and the dialog is well written. One thing this game definitely has over a ""true elder scrolls game"" is that the dungeons do not feel as copy pasted and repetitive. I have played several characters, mostly up to level 20 so far and I would definitely recommend this game."
Positive,"ESO to me is one of the few MMOs I've played that can manage to keep pulling me back, and I've played everything from Runescape, TERA, Forsaken World to World of Warcraft and a small attempt at FF Online. ESO to me has something that has become a must for any MMO and that's active combat, unless it's Runescape I simply can't enjoy the click and wait days anymore, and that's exactly what WoW and FF Online are, and to me that's the most boring combat in existence these days. While the combat in ESO isn't perfect, it's something you have to actively participate in rather than just push keybinds and wait for casts, if you're not weaving in auto-attacks or rolling away from boss attacks you're gonna have a bad time.In my opinion ESO also probably has one of the better communities of any MMO, sure there are still rude people but more often than not I find myself with rather chill people, who do their best to help me if I ask a question and who are usually all for a little chat after a dungeons over. This is a massive contrast from the current TERA community which is 90% veteran players that just insult the newbies, which is a pretty good way to make sure your dead game stays dead. The community is actually shockingly older, with the majority of the people I meet being in their late thirties, or in some cases even their seventies, only in ESO have I had a 70 year old Grandma as my Guild Master, who I was certain could beat me down in PvP in one rotation.ESO nowadays also makes the correct choice of not slamming you with everything available in the game right away, when I first got on FF Online I had so much crap around me I had no idea where I was supposed to start or what I was doing, while an MMO SHOULD introduce you to every feature the game offers, it shouldn't do so with eighty ""HEY QUEST OVER HERE"" notifications the moment you spawn it.I'm not saying ESO is the most complex and riveting MMO available, but it's chill, and honestly that's what I want in an MMO, I wanna be able to do some dungeons or raids and not have to try hard mode just to get anywhere, much like any Elder Scrolls game you can just chill, quest, and occasionally hit some Skooma."
Positive,some may call this junk me i call them treasures
Positive,I suggest this sets the benchmark for multiplayer games - although ESO needs some performance improvements to reduce how often users are disconnected from their sessions
Positive,Best MMO out there! Incredible! It's been around a long time and it get's better with age! Graphically looks Great and the Music Score is tremendous! So yes this is a Positive Review
Positive,Simply the best mmorpg I have played in a while...Idk why all the mixed reviews concerning crashes and not being able to log in. bought this game about a week ago and havent had any issue
Positive,Loving this game. Only thing is i wish the endless crafting bag could be bought instead of having to have the plus membership bc it comes in handy when just starting out.
Positive,"Hello everyone, I got ESO with the monthly humble bundle, although, it was the reason for buying it in the first place. Wanted to check the  game for ages, but as I am playing WoW and EvE, it never felt as giving money for the game I don't even have time to play.As you can see, I did not spend many hours in this one, however it was quickly added to my ""Favorite"" list. The pretty standard MMO experience, everything you expect and probably more. I think this games free to play version is good for several months of pure fun! Its free system is so much better then any other I have seen in the other MMO-s. I believe that those who are in love with Skyrim and all other Elder Scrolls games would find this even better! P.S. I should make a new review after having 2000 hours streaming. Will happen soon. One thing is for sure, this MMO has the best ever community!"
Positive,"When I think back to the BETA days of this game I remember it being a mess of poorly implemented (though interesting) ideas and mechanics. I was put off for a long time due to the paid subscription fee and my poor experience with the Beta, in my mind it really couldn't redeem itself in my eyes.Oh how I was wrong &#9834;Personally it takes me a while before I'm willing to sink time into a game, unless it's something I've instantly clicked with then, guaranteed, I'll let it fade away into obscurity along with the rest of my bargain bin, steam crap.HOWEVER!I bought this game for £6 on sale and ME -O-MI, my opinion has taken a full 180 turn.I might even go as far as to say that this is one of the most elder scrollsy elder scroll games ever.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The ability to travel across Tamriel as you please is very exciting as previously we've been bound to Cyrodil, Morrowind and Skyrim, personally (yet again) I've never felt like these games feel as alive as they should, somehow, ESO manages to make it work, baffling me as MMO's are usually stupid fucking shit nonsense cunt grinding fuck fucking world of warcraft. It achieves something that every other MMO lacks in, the sense of adventure. Being able to step into the shoes of your character, travel as you please whilst the world scales to your level (Mostly) so you'll usually be able to handle anything thrown at you and giving you the option to avoid combat entirely and focus on other skills is a really handy feature.An example of this is you could legitimately spend all of your time crafting items and furniture, sell it off or trade it and become Tamriels sexiest vendor. As far as NPC'S in MMO's go, ESO has it nailed down. remember running around breaking into houses? pickpocketing unsuspecting strangers and going on chicken murder sprees?? Well ESO has all of this, stealth works well, random NPC's can be killed just as in previous games and guards will be sure to let you know that you've VIOLATED THE LAW! which can be paid off though any items you've ran around stealing (also making a valiant return) will be confiscated unless you visit an outlaw's refuge.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ [h1}  K-K-K-KOMBAT [/h1]I really have no qualms as far as the world goes, its by far my favourite as far as Elder Scrolls goes and it really feels like its your adventure and not a forced story for  THE CHOSENNN ONNNNNNE   *Guitar solo* Combat wise it's pretty great too, it would be hard to implement Skyrims combat into ESO or any previous installment's combat for that matter so the alternative is; give the player the ability to attack with a click and give them a list of skills to use like in every other MMO.The one thing that grinds at me regarding combat is that bows don't work like bows, the draw is incredibly slow and doesn't seem to affect anything at all so you're much better off just spamming the left mouse for a series of quick blows, if you enjoy getting sucked into the world then this can definitely put you off as it did me for a while.really not much else to add here, a rough description of combat overall can be summed up as  SKYRIM MEETS WOW which is just fine!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Crafting is really fun, has its flaws but fundamentally its on solid foundations.I'll condense this as there isn't much to say:1: Go get certified at the guild2: Go look for some crafting stuff, sometimes the spawns for certain items are ridiculous. You could be surrounded by trees, looking for wood but you'll have to go to the beach to collect driftwood instead...  rigggggggght 3: Go  craft  at a  crafting  table for  crafters . You have a seperate level for each crafting skill (as you do with every skill) so feel free to put all of your time into being a jack of all trades if you like, fuck it, why not eh? remember, this is YOUR adventure! play as you wish.Crafting also allows for some great customisation, you can choose how much of a material you'd like to use to boost the level of that item, enchant them and even alter the style to your tastes.Sounds great right?  RIGHT! but then theres the bad...Y'see kiddies, to enchant weapons or armour you need to find an item almost identical to the thing you want to make, deconstruct said item or research it (which will destroy the item anyway). This can be a grind as looking for exact items in an MMO can be a real pain, especially in lower levels.Something  ELSE  that sucks? If you want to research a trait, get ready to wait 6 hours while it does so, I've looked into this and there is absolutely no way to bring that number down, I was at least expecting that it would be some  B U L L S H I T  pay to win type thing, nope. everyone has to suffer.Also you're tied down to one style at first (I'm a wood elf so I can only use bosmer bone or some shit) and this is fine, but jesus it is WAY to hard to find style books, plenty of materials, don't get me wrong but let me use them  DAMN IT Well that wasn't condensed at all, but heres a summary! Want to make a bow with a trait allowing an increase of EXP? Go find a bow with that trait Research that trait (Destroying the bow in the process) Apply trait to new bow Attempt to increase the quality with an item item breaks (FSSSSSSSSSS)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fig 1.1  It's an MMO dude. Certain traits allow you to gain EXP slightly faster but at the end of the day... {REFER TO 1.1}I will say though that because the combat is enjoyable and enemies generally will scale to your level (AS FAR AS I KNOW MEGA GEEKS) I don't mind grinding, if you've ever played an MMO then you know what to expect.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[h1[ IS IT GOOD? [/h1]Yeah, really, reaaaaaalllllllly  good, so far I've sunk maybe 40 hours into this over the space of a few weeks and thats more than I would ever put into any game never mind an MMO.also an issue I want to address quicklyI was sure that ESO PLUS was going to be a scam to steal my money, but for around £8 a month ( NON-SUB BASED ) you're getting access to every DLC which has its own set of new items etc etc, You get alot for you're money is what I'm gettiing at here.In conclusion I give this a 9 out of 10, by far my favourite ES game (SACRILEGE) but not without it's flaws and by god it can be flawed. At least it's updated as much as possible.TL;DR??? great game, not enough boring fetch quests."
Positive,"First, don't look at my playtime in this game, I've played somewhat actively since the game was released but not had it on steam. The gameplay is that of an MMO taking heavy influence from the classic Elder Scrolls. Once you get past that you got a good game that the developers have worked hard on since its release. Most of the problems from its release have been fixed by now and a lot of base gameplay mechanics has changed.I was never a big fan of MMO's and their very static gameplay, lack of movement in combat, cooldowns, being able to phase right through enemies. Classic things like that. ESO was the first MMO I've played that really wasn't like that. Using the classic Elder Scrolls resource system of being able to use your spells or attacks as fast as you can, only limited by the speed of the animation etc.That on top of a world full of fully voiced NPCs and varied quests makes for a good MMO in my opinion.The base game at its price is by far worth it if you like these type of games and the added ""DLC"" adding large expanses of land or even new gameplay mechanics that can change the way you play the game if you want it to.I've spent a decent amount of time in the PVP part of the game as well and my experience has varied a lot so take that as you want.The game does have cosmetic things available to buy and a few convenience items but nothing that will make you stronger than other players in any direct way. When I say this I mean things like consumables that raise the number of experience points you get for a limited amount of time or lets you access your bank from any location. But nothing that I would consider pay to win.All in all, it's a good game, it has its flaws but your money won't be wasted if you know what you are paying for."
Positive,"Itza dumbed down version of Skyrim with no dragons. Multiplayer brings the game to life, even if the questing system can be a bit aggrivating."
Positive,"Calling this a cash grab, is an unjustified accusation, the effort that went into this game is staggering, but nonetheless for me it does not capture that vanilla elder scrolls mechanics and sensation, combat feels mmo-ish but I guess that was the scope, I reccomended to people who first tried it and like it, if you play like me poe, smite, hearthstone, the secret world and othe mmos, I do not reccomend it because you will get some nasty grindy bits like all mmos have except poe which manages to keep you on the edge of your seat when you are  attacked by scores of monsters."
Positive,"ESO is one of the few MMOs where I've actually sat through dialogue and consciously followed quests for the storyline - it is one of the better MMOs that give you, although slightly shallow, depth in terms of moral choices you character makes.  You end up in somewhat comical situations - like replacing a young noble's servant's soul with that of a ghost you run into while trying to rescue artifacts for her. You have several situations where you have to choose who lives and who dies - or if you give someone their sanity or walk away with a tome of knowledge...Beyond that you have a fairly larger MMO world with plenty to do and plenty to explore. Skyshards help you build out your character and you dig search for them everywhere. You can help the Mage's guild by exploring and finding books and lore. You can build experience by stealing and pick-pocketing. If you're a serious MMO player, ESOTU is well worth the investment due to the sheer volume of content available to you. And even if you're a one-toon kind of person, you will still have the opportunity to touch *all* of the main-line PVE content.In PVP and the new Orsinium DLC, your level scales so you can join your guildmates who may be at a higher level.Some considerations to keep in mind::: Inventory management is a game of its own - pack-rats looters have been warned:: Join an active trading guild - with no conventional auction-house, you still need to move your goods lest your bank and bags are always at 100%:: The game is, for the most part, fairly easy. However you *will* run into at least one, possibly two, quests where it can be Dark-Souls-smash-controller-rage-quit difficult - it will be a wtf?!?! moment given that it isn't even the final boss when you run into it.:: If you like to explore, the interface is pretty bare-bones. If you like to be a completionist, be sure to get addons to give you a heads-up if you've missed stuff. In fact, get addons regardless because they make the game that much more enjoyable:: If you find that you tend to spend money on DLC and/or experience/inventory boosters, consider the subscription service. DLC comes with the subscription and you get Crowns to spend in the Crown store monthly (or at the beginning of the pay period you choose to subscribe to):: Imperial edition isn't neccessary. It gives you a couple of perks - a horse and the imperial race which can join any faction at creation."
Positive,"I bought the game pre-Tamriel Unlimited, but only played during the first 30 days before I had to pay to continue playing. And to be honest, it wasn't a game that was worth the subscription. Now that it's free to play after purchase, it's definitely a great MMO. I have to agree with what others have said about this game: you have to remember that it is primarily an MMO, and and Elder Scrolls game secondarily.There's a lot of diversity between the classes and play styles. You can be pretty much any type of character you want, using whatever class you end up choosing. Don't get too caught up in the fact that it's an elder scrolls game with a class system (and only 4 classes at that). The game rewards you pretty early on with plenty of skills to choose from (including unique active and passive skills for werewolves and vampires) and skill points to spend, and you continue to reap those rewards as you get higher in level.The game is pretty unique compared to other MMOs I've played. It's refreshing to see an MMO that doesn't have a cooldown for class abilities. It's also nice in that you're actively acomplishing tasks/earning achivements as you train your character, so you don't grind as much in the game, even at lower levels.Some styles of combat can get a little glitchy. Spamming the attack button while using the bow or some staves can cause enemies to stand still and stop acting (because you dropped their health to 0) but are still targetable to attack until they drop to the ground dead. It doesn't happen all the time but it happens often enough that I really wish Zenimax works on fixing that.Overall, it's a great MMO. It's best played when you're on a mic and partying with a friend (like all MMOs), but it's absolutely a fun game even on your own."
Positive,"If you like Elder Scrolls games and their lore then you can easily get immersed into this game (as long as you can pay 15$ a month).  The sounds and graphics are excellent, and more options are being added with new game updates."
Positive,1 of the best games i ever played !I keep playing since 9 years now
Positive,"taking a break from FF14. Saw it on sale. Huge Bethesda fan, why not right? so far so good. having fun."
Positive,"I've played many MMOs, and this one is by far the one I've enjoyed the most through the years! It just keeps getting better!"
Positive,"Game is Incredible, gets better every patch."
Positive,"Fantastic game, 10/10.Do however NOT buy this on Steam, the login is bugged and during my month in this game I had a dussin times not been able to login, this is apparantly only thru the steam launcher so i repeat myself, DO NOT buy this on Steam, buy it on Bethesdas webpage. Extremly annoying.Wish i known about this."
Positive,"Those anime series that have people stuck in the world? yeah, that's me with this game. And this game has come far for what it started from, some people love it, some people hate it, and some people love MMO's for their own personal reasons and to each their own preference.I don't PvP as much, so I can't really say where that's at as any time i've tried to i've met hostility and toxicity, in which takes builds of their own and would benefit a bit from team management.Not a lot of my real life friends play, but I love Elder Scrolls stories, the housing each game has given us, the mounts this game serves. I do make my houses beautiful, and this game is beautiful in itself for an MMO.The classes have been interesting as each class can either be a TANK, DPS or HEALER or, if you wanted a HYBRID of TWO or ALL roles of that class. There are build guides that signify which skill your role would benefit from, but many comes from guilds or other weapon types. Companions can be set up to quest with you, but beware some have likes and dislikes and are mildly annoying, just turn them off and they didn't see aaaanyyything, which is lame, but works. you can equip them with companion gear and set their skills for their class the higher they are. They make the game feel like lonesome (for me :p ) as you always have an extra role helping out in the world.There are so many zones, and so many quests to do as you have an any start point at any time, which is a huge benefit to the game, and makes all the content feel more unified and you never really out-level your zone.The controller to me is so strange, It's so much easier to enjoy an Elder Scrolls game on PC, controller is DOABLE but it feels more feature rich.If you see me on NA servers, don't mind saying hi as this game is more enjoyable when people enjoy the game for what it is. It doesn't have the greatest combat, but it does well comparatively to some."
Positive,"Advantages:- the elder scrolls online has a much more dark themed ""mature"" world compared to other shiny hello kitty styled rainbow unicorn asian mmos.  - nice grapich and wellmade lightning effects 10/10.- classes/skill lines are very variable wich results loads of good end game builds, technically u can be anything with a class, for example as a nightblade you can play an archer, rogue, 2h weapon berserker, spell caster or even tank.- crafting system is perfectly suited for lazy guys such as me becouse u can actually level professions simply by deconstruct the items wich drops from monster during adventuring.- thanks to the mega server system there are many people everywhere (but that doesnt cause you any inconvinience during questing)-the story is just awesome & has a huge deep lore behind everything. This is the first mmorpg game for me where I was not bored level up my character. I have never found leveling repeatitive and even the side quests are fairly entertaining.- you can actually become a vampire or a werewolf wich comes with it's unique skill line- as far as I see, the devs putting a lot effort to make new contents for the game. The Thiefes Guild DLC was just released and the Dark Brotherhood is already under motion wich is expectable at summer of this year.Disadvantages:-If you are not playing the game with ESO plus membership you will have to buy the existing DLC's to get access to new contents (fortunatly the DLCs are not too expansive)- wether you consider it as a disadvantage or not, things in this game could be very time consuming. For example every craftable set items has a requirement of some unlocked traits (traits are optional stats to a selected item during crafting). To unlock traits you need to research and researching takes more and more time with each unlocked trait on a selected item type (for example for the 6th trait on light chest armor takes 1 week to complete the trait research and the 9th takes 30 days)-if you don't want to spend real money in crown store then you will have to be patient with your riding skill becouse you can only spend 1 improvement point in every 20 hours at the stable. You can improve mount speed 0/60, mount capacity 0/60, and mount stamina 0/60 (if you spend 1 point every day this takes 180 days to completly finish improving your riding skills)Putting all the details together overall i still find this game very worthy of my time."
Positive,"I am a simple bosmer, I see an argonian, I snipe. Don't be a horse eater dark elf. Eat argonian, it tastes like chicken, good protein, good vitamin.If it breathes, we eats #justbosmerthingsBest in-game trading game :|"
Positive,"For me, the only minus of this game is that it doesn't have Russian language, but it can be easily changed. All I wanna say is that if you wanna play TESO, you need to play past parts of TES to understand everything that happens in the game if you didn't. The game is pretty good, gameplay is long enough for each Alliance. It's nice that Bethesda is still making updates for the game that was released 4 years ago."
Positive,You can play this game for a few hour.Wait what happened to my life?!
Positive,"I have played all the major (and many minor) mmo's since Ultima Online. I can say without question that this one is now worth a shot. Atmospheric, engaging, and fun.....lots of fun."
Positive,i play too much
Positive,if you are a fan of the elder scrolls series this is a musttt
Positive,not skyrim with friends but still koot
Positive,"Best MMO I've played: gorgeous graphics, deep and intuitive crafting system, almost no class limitations, well-written and occasionally funny stories, very little grind, huge, freely explorable world, stisfying combat, you name it. Optional subscription or buying the related DLCs also give you repeatable randomised missions of stealthily assassinating or robbing someone, similar to Thief missions."
Positive,"Can't believe i haven't wrote a review about one of my most played game, so here we go.ESO is MMORPG set in world of elder scrolls, set in 2nd era, way back before morrowind, oblivion(3rd era), and skyrim(4th era), making it earliest game chronologically.Pros(+):+ Almost infinite quest to do, added more every years with expansion. Not exaggerating if all of them could takes 1000+ hours.+ Fun playing with random people across world.+ Great customization, make your own character build with weirdest gear effect you can get.+ Play any role with any class.+ Enemy level scaling, making sure newbie still having fun playing with high level player without being carried too hard.+ Can run on potato PC+ MMORPG where you can play as casual as you like.Grey(*):* Bad business model, most of the time, year after expansion released, the expansion will be bundled on collector edition at next year with cheaper price in bundle.* Pretty lonely to play if you don't have friend to play together.* Game kinda intimidating with how big the game is to new players.* Only has EU and NA server, but ping doesn't matter much.Cons(-):- P2W as heck, most good and interesting gear locked behind DLC and expansion.- Tons of material for crafting, merged on your normal inventory unless you paid for premium to have separate inventory.- Most base game dungeon are copy paste tank and spank strategy.- Everyone playing DPS, good luck queue as DPS alone to dungeon.I find myself always come back from time to time to play, until i burn out and leave the game for some months and repeating. At this rate it's more of lifestyle than game."
Positive,"The “No Apologies” Award....This game is my perfect choice for this game ...The game's combat is simple, the story is so-so but who buys an MMO just for a story when it's main focus will be online play.I could go on and on about what I do and don't like but hell plenty of people have already done that work for me.I will keep this simple if you expect a deep RPG like Skyrim or others in the series than go play them.If your looking for an Elder type game that has online then this really is your only choice I think if you go into it looking at it as a lore like Elder MMO and not an extension of Skyrim you might find the game not that bad.One last thing is warned that you will not get a refund for this game due to using ESO launcher to download the rest of the game and so it will put you past the 2-hour mark.You will be all in on this game hate it or not.It will download a portion of the game from steam the rest with the ESO launcher all total it is around 80gigsit's best to try it on the console if you can or get it on sale.If you have a local GameStop they have a 7-day return policy for used games that should be more than enough time to know if you will like it.Just remember nothing carries over from the console so don't invest any real money into it if you really want it on the PC."
Positive,This game is my home away from home.
Positive,Excelent adition to the Lusty Argonian saga.
Positive,"I never like mmos before, but I gave this one a try.  I loved it so much i bought ESO Plus."
Positive,"Lemme start with the fact that I really enjoy playing this. And unfortunately it's 99% on my own.This is a big outlier in MMOs.I understand that their direction is to keep everybody on the same relative level so that everyone can play everything whenever they want to, barring dungeons and raids and endgame stuff. The level-up from 1-50 is relatively fast, not extremely, but much better than a lot of MMOs. Essentially though, you're getting equipment that gets you back to the power you were at in the previous level. The real feeling of levelling up is getting skill points and putting it in everything, but the base power for your equipment feels very empty for a while.Combat is pretty okay. Simpler, little janky, controls like a typical first-person or third-person game, depending on the camera. Still has that auto-aim hit thing MMOs have. So it's a bit weird but it works. Buildcrafting is a lot of fun. There are so many things you can combine, despite what the ""meta"" says. Powers/classes generally feel unique.Stories/quests are mostly handed to you via text boxes to click through. They're voice acted, which is nice, but oh my gods there are so many text boxes. Sometimes it's given to you through ingame nonsense but it's pretty much 99% text. They're interesting if you want to read through them. Extremely not interesting if you don't.Crafting is really dang easy to do compared to a hell of a lot of other MMOs. Getting materials is easy. Putting them together is easy. The menus are pretty easy to understand (which goes for most of them). It feels a bit grindy if you aren't buying things but I personally like wandering around the worlds getting stuff.Worlds, by the way, are gaddamn gorgeous. They aren't the best in terms of textures and models, but everything's arranged nicely and there's a shitton of environment packed into each area. They feel really nice to run through.Also the premium currency is tradeable and the DLC can be either subscribed for everything at once or bought separately forever. Neither required.Overall, if you aren't looking for a typical MMO, highly recommend. If you prefer FFXIV or WoW styles of MMO, probably wouldn't."
Positive,Elder Scrolls Online is a great game great mechanics and hours of fun
Positive,Great game. Combat's been improved so it feels satisfying. Crafting is easy and robust. The justice system adds a lot of dynamics. Tamriel Unlimited is a major improvement over the previous version.
Positive,Deep and story rich.Worth it.
Positive,"Get it when it comes on sale and when they drop the sub fee in March, 2015...."
Positive,"Probably my favorite TES game. Love the setting of the Second Era, the lore, the characters, the exploration. The classes are really flexible and it's possible to build anything you want to with any class, even when you're a casual like me. Speaking of, PvP content isn't necessary which thank the Eight, because I hate PvP in general. Not to say it's bad, I think it's pretty good, just not my cup of tea. It's possible to somewhat survive in PvP areas without a PvP build but you're not gonna get top of the food chain! I really recommend getting a Plus subscription if you can, the craft bag is a life saver. It's also pretty easy to mod to make life easier for yourself.All around great game, really recommend!"
Positive,"This game has slowly become one of my all-time favorite MMO-RPGsIt has great mechanics, and the grinding is fun."
Positive,needs more nude mods in my opinion
Positive,Great MMO with tons of PvE and PvP content.
Positive,"I love the game but get bored easily and find I am bored when playing. I tend to chock that up to me playing far too much TES in general.  The game is beautiful. The music is amazing. The classes are nice and fleshed out. You can make various toons to play around with at no extra charge. You cannot cross class but once you reach Champion Level you can use those perks on all your characters. That's a very nice aspect of the game. They do give you good daily rewards and dungeon drop rates are okay. The pay to win elements are creeping in with experience scrolls and whatnot but you are able to play F2P and still thoroughly enjoy the game. I do think it's a good idea to have ESO Plus because you get crowns every month but you are also able to access all the dlcs and expansions. I give it a 8/10 overall just for minor quibbles not worth complaining about. I might even go so high as 8.5. It is a solid TES game. Being able to travel the breadth of Tamriel as see all the different areas is definitely a plus. The love the devs have for the lore is quite evident and that is so important. They're not just destroying it to destroy it. I know there were some changed but not as egregious as the ones that Bethesda has implemented in Fallout 76. If you are a longtime fan of the series and have not played, try it out on one of their free weekends. I think you will not be disappointed."
Positive,"Very enjoyable, especially with friends."
Positive,"Easy to get into, very intuitive.  Decent graphics, almost always available (very little downtime)."
Positive,"9/10 fun game, combat and travel mechanics could be better tho"
Positive,"My dearest Tamriel,Oh, how do I even begin to express my undying love for you? 4,960 hours (and counting!) we've spent together, exploring your every nook and cranny, from the snowy peaks of Skyrim to the lush forests of Valenwood.  We've battled Daedric Princes, uncovered ancient conspiracies, and rescued more cats from trees than I can count. (Seriously, those Khajiit have a climbing problem.)Remember that time we stormed the Imperial City, fighting side-by-side with hundreds of other players? Or that quiet evening in Morrowind, sipping Sujamma and watching the twin moons rise over Vivec City?  (Okay, maybe I got a little tipsy and accidentally set a Silt Strider on fire, but hey, who hasn't?)Elder Scrolls Online, my love, you're more than just a game. You're a sprawling world of adventure, a portal to a realm where magic is real, dragons soar through the skies, and I can finally live out my fantasy of being a stealthy Khajiit archer who also happens to be a master chef. (Don't judge my culinary skills, okay?)You've come a long way, baby.  Remember those dark days at launch?  The lag, the bugs, the constant crashing... it was rough.  But like a true hero overcoming adversity, you emerged stronger and more glorious than ever.  Zenimax and Bethesda, bless their hearts, listened to our pleas, patched up your wounds, and showered you with content updates that would make even Sheogorath jealous.Now, you're a shining beacon of MMO excellence, a testament to the power of perseverance and community feedback.  You're the game I always come back to, the digital home where I feel most at peace.  Whether I'm delving into a new dungeon, crafting the perfect set of armor, or simply wandering the countryside admiring the scenery, I always find something to love in your embrace.Here's why our love story is an epic saga for the ages:Pros:A World That Never Gets Old: Tamriel is massive and breathtaking, with a level of detail that makes me want to explore every inch.Stories That Grab You by the Soul: From political intrigue to Daedric invasions, the quests are always engaging and well-written.Combat That's More Than Button Mashing: Okay, there's a little button mashing, but the combat system is surprisingly deep and strategic.A Community That's Actually Friendly: (Mostly.) I've made some amazing friends in ESO, and we've shared countless adventures together.Content That Never Ends: Seriously, I've played for over 4,960 hours, and I still haven't seen everything.Cons:My Real-Life Responsibilities Have Gone to Oblivion: Who needs a job, a social life, or personal hygiene when you have Tamriel to explore?My Wallet Weeps for My Subscription: But hey, it's worth every penny to keep this love affair going.Elder Scrolls Online, my love, you're the best MMO I've ever played. You're the reason I haven't slept in days, the reason my house is a mess, and the reason I can now speak fluent Dunmeris (okay, maybe not that last one).If you're reading this and haven't experienced the magic of ESO, do yourself a favor and take the plunge. You won't regret it.Yours forever,A Hopelessly Addicted Player"
Positive,I think the game is sweet because the missions and all the stuff you can get
Positive,- Pros - Fun- Challenging- Makes you not bored- Cons- $130+ For DLCS (Recommended but definitely not needed)
Positive,I expected the game to be shit but it's actually really good.  Highly recommend it !
Positive,"Pretty solid game/mechanics. Lore breaking aside, it's a solid game. Maybe not 59.99 worth, but 40-50 range. Wait for Steam Sales and grab this for sure!"
Positive,LOVE THE GAME.....still the best mmorpg in steam
Positive,"*sigh* Why's it gotta be so  dang ol' pretty? So goddang big? Such an incredible representation of the most interesting world ever brought to gaming in general? But mostly, why's it gotta be a MMO? Yeah, I got a touch of the ol' social anxiety and it freaks me out to see all these other people around. Talking to me and whatnot. Fighting me, oh jeez, killing me. Makes me feel bad. Makes me feel like I gotta apologize. And the grinding. I'm not one for grinding. So yeah, incredible game I keep trying to get  into but I'm just too nervous."
Positive,"This game and Final Fantasy 14 are my all time favourite MMOs, and I highly recommend them both. This one especially for roleplaying, PvE both solo and all the way up to high end raid content, and some of the PvP (Cyrodiil and some Battleground content is fun as hell with the right builds).Player housing is good, crafting is good, quests are diverse and omnipresent, well written, all voice acted. Lots of content including a lot of zone firsts for ES games. Lots of character customization and class/build customization. Broad mod support. Meaningful racial passives. Diverse armor sets. Honestly, aside from the odd bug, the only things this game is missing is a better guild trader/auction system with a search bar by default and capes (which were removed in beta because Havoc Engine has a few issues).Buy the base game first and see how you like it; no mandatory sub fee, just the base game cost which goes on sale often and you're good to go forever. Lots of content to start with, more to get later also on sale or during crown store monthly deals."
Positive,"I'm maybe an hour into it and so far I'm liking it. Mind you, I was very skeptical at first and truth be told the only reason I decieded to take a chance was because of Steams new refund policy. I have to say that although ESO looks like Skyrim it plays a bit more like Oblivion, esspecially in the dialog and quest set up. Personally I loved Oblivion and so far am really enjoying the questing side of things. Graphics are great for a MMO. There are nice big set pieces that look cool and alot of vanillia Skryim graphics are definitally in there. There will be times when you get close to something like perhaps a small chair or stick that will have some really ugly textures, but nothing to terrible. The game feels big and you have that same feeling you get when you first walk out of whatever vessel The Elder Scrolls has you escaping from: ""Theres a lot of shit to explore"". It's nice running through towns and not seeing random NPC's with '!' over there heads. You can go up to random NPC's and they'll tell you random tidbits of information just like all the other Elder Scrolls games have in the past. There are some slight differaces in the menus and such, but the charator creation is about on par if not a little better then Skyrim. If you're on the fench like I was, take it from a fan, try it. if you don't like it in the first hour or so you can always return it. Happy Gaming!!!"
Positive,"Going into this:The way this game makes money is by reselling itself at full game price now and then. So every chapter, which is the game's form of an expansion pack, will be the larger chunk of 4 separate updates that comprise a season and costs what you'd spend on a new title. The other 3 parts will cost the same as premium indie title. This is on top of an omnipresent micro transaction system and a comparatively expensive premium service. That gives you access to older Dlc and unlocks features for equipment crafting that should be free due to the systems burden on inventory management.The main fault of this game is the greed of it's developer/publisher. That said, all this is opt in and i'm recommending the game since the value you get for buying the game the first time, which includes the former ""chapters"" (the big chunk of the 4 DLC parts that comprise a season) content is fantastic. The game has a huge amount of content and is quite enjoyable to just to login and play for short sessions or as long as you want as a lack of instances (dungeon and challenge content being the exception)  lets you log out at any time and come back later."
Positive,"I've played a few MMO's I'm the past, but this is by far my favourite! I've played Elder Scrolls Online for just over a year now and there are still places in Tamriel I have yet to explore. The questlines, dungeons and delves all have unique stories to follow, and some give you a chance to really develop your characters personality. The people I've come across in this game are really friendly and always willing to lend a hand.If you haven't played ESO yet I'd highly recommend checking it out!"
Positive,Best mmo Game  i have ever playedyou just need to learn it and then...its will be your favorit game (like myself)
Positive,meh.... but with friends it´s another thing
Positive,There is alot to do in the game and it's very fun to do dungeons with friends!
Positive,"Pretty fun game to play with friends or solo. My only gripe is when you join a group instance there are sometimes people that cancel it somehow that forces you out of the instance and then you can't requeue for 15 minutes through no fault of your own. Devs, please fix this."
Positive,"***Real amount of hours much higher as I logged in directly through exe file in game folder.***Gameplay:Mouse + Keyboard and gamepad mode both work well. As for the gameplay loop - you'll find yourself doing stuff and leveling without anxiety that you need 1 more level to start having fun in the game. Game is fun right from the start and enemies in zones scale to your level so you never feel like you're not challenged at all.Graphics: in recent patches graphics and performance were improved. Recent expansions look really nice. Core areas look pretty dated but expansion and DLC zones look noticeably nicer.Music and sounds:Music is on point, does give an immersive feeling and does not feel forced even after hours of repetition. Sound effects are spot on. Voice acting ranges from good to great.Value:The base game/gold edition is enough to keep you occupied for hundreds of hours. There are some controversies about whale-milking through crates/flash sales, however these are all just for cosmetic items, which you can enjoy the game without. I felt the need to buy a costume after like 200 hours of playing. The game is not pay2win. DLC stories are a bit better than core content, however - you just can't stop progressing through the quests, exploring locations and going through dungeons. Buy2play then play4fun.Updated for 2020."
Positive,"I played during the beta, and I didn't have too much fun, but it was still very interesting and looked like it was headed in the right place. Sadly it was a sub based game, in the beginning so I ignored it and thought it would end up being a pretty bad buy to play or free to play game. But then it came out as buy to play, I decided, that I'd buy it, give it a chance, and boy was I wrong. Every where I asked people talked about how bad the game is, but it's not, it's alot of fun. One of the main complaints I remember seeing was that it doesn't feel like an Elder Scrolls game, and I disagree completely, it definitely feels like I'm playing elder scrolls, the world and the characters around me help to solidify where I am. And it's a pretty cool sneak peak at places we haven't seen since Arena, and hopefully will see more of in the future."
Positive,"Although a lot of people say that ESO is not great, I think it is. The graphics are extreamly immersive and the game offers a massive world for you to play in. Furthermore each town and city is built with indervidualirty and you can even preform small tasks to top up your coin, such as creating amour (which can be done once a day). The game also runs with little lag and at great speed. There is a great varity of missions too and a great online pvp area where you fight for control over castles however there arew two limitiations. the 1st is that you cannot buy a horse without a lot of in game money or by purchasiung one via the store. This means that you spend a lot of time wanding from place to place (as you can only teliport from certain locations). This can become particaully irritating in pvp mode. My second point is that the game is not as interactive as those before it. For intance not every object can be piclked up.Overall I would say this game is an impressive MMO however if you want more interaction in game this is not for you."
Positive,"Elder scrolls Online Tamriel Unlimited is always updating cant review any end game conclusions, Mechanics are allot to be desired combat needs to feel allot more responsive but everything else is fine i recomend this game for people who enjoy engrossing themselves in an exapnsive just feels wierd to share the elderscrolls world with different people"
Positive,Awesome! they changed a lot of things about the game after the dissapointing launch they had for the the game the new changes are making the game one step better :D
Positive,It's an mmo thats fun.
Positive,"Review after free weekend:So having played at the original beta and now coming back to the game after several years, I have to say I've seen a marked difference in voice acting, game mechanics and story.If you are a solo player, you will adore this as a stand alone Elder Scrolls game. The random quest lines and stories, the lore books and tiny secrets, all of it feels just like they did in Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim.My wife and I play together, however, and that leads me to my only qualm so far: no real instanced areas. I had thought that in dungeons, caverns, mines, any area that transitioned you underground or into a building for a quest might have been its own separate instance to keep the immersion of the world for you and your group. Not so. Unfortunately as you and your team are sneaking through a dungeon toward that ogre in the hopes of stabbing it in the back, some rando is likely to go bunny hopping by to smack him in the face with his giant warhammer. This is the point at which immersion in the world is broken quite hard for me. I understand this is an MMO, I get that most people don't have a problem seeing 15 others at a quest hub, I've gotten over the ridiculous-costumed Uber-mounted godlings that go riding down the road to town past my scruffy-looking noob Nightblade. But when I see that same godling bunny hop past me on his merry way to slay the same 5 enemies I was going to sneak through....that's not exactly the Elder Scrolls experience I was looking for.All that said, the excellent game mechanics, beautiful voice acting, and fascinating story are still enough for me to buy this at $9.99 as of this writing. Still recommend it, especially as my problems are more of a dislike of MMO mechanics than ESO in general."
Positive,"I just really fooking love this game. It's a great escape from real life problems, especially with the pandemic going on, it helps kind of center me. It's wonderful, I love it."
Positive,i can be sneaky cool cat
Positive,"My favourite MMO ever.I played at the beginning and it wasn't great. I came back after the One Tamriel update and the game is so muc better.Unlike RIFT, in ESO they have stuck with the core mechanics of the game.Questing is actually great in this game, the voice acting is great, the stories are actually engaging. In other mmo's when I've made another character, I've usually been restricted to the same areas. In ESO there's plenty of leveling options, an abundance of engaging quests that you actually want to listen to and complete. Quests can have an actually difference on the world you inhabit too which is awesome.The community on EU and NA servers is great. I've played on both as I was in the UK but now I live in Canada so play NA. On both servers I've met such great people. I've actually sat in town just talking to people in zone chat about all kinds of random non game related things.End game PVP and PVE is very fun. Daily dungeons on normal are a bit easy, but veteran dungeons actually offer a real challenge.The crafting is well thought out and actually has purpose in the game.I willingly pay for a ESO plus membership beacuse there's so much content, very few bugs and they're actively adding more content all of the time. The list of expansions and dungeons is growing faster than any mmo I've ever played.I've nearly 300 hours on my steam account, but I've probably spent about 600 hours on the game because I had a non steam copy for years."
Positive,"It's okay, you really can't solo content in some cases. The game is fairly populated so your dependent on other people showing up normally a 5-10 minute wait.I'm still displeased with getting kicked out of dungeons at any level.It's a good game, but it isn't Skyrim.The random dungeon que favors the banished cells more than every other dungeon.You make all these dungeons, but can't setup a proper queing system.Kind of expensive to get all the content unless it's on sale. IF it's not on sale your spending more than 150$.IF it's on sale anywhere between 60-150$"
Positive,Very immersive. Amazing lore and game mechanics. Love it!
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is a remarkable achievement that brings the beloved Elder Scrolls universe into the realm of online gaming. With its stunning visuals, deep gameplay mechanics, rich storytelling, and an ever-expanding world, ESO offers a fulfilling experience for both new players and veterans of the franchise. The game successfully combines the essence of traditional RPGs with the excitement of an online multiplayer environment, making it a must-play for any fan of the Elder Scrolls series or MMORPGs in general. Whether you’re exploring dungeons solo, battling other players in epic PvP, or immersing yourself in the rich lore of Tamriel, The Elder Scrolls Online is an adventure that should not be missed.Score: 9/10"
Positive,"I'll start off by saying two thing. 1. Do not play this because you are looking for another Skyrim. This is not that. 2. I find this more fun as a Side mmo. You can burn your self out easily if you go in to deep. So enjoy it slowly With that out of the way. I really enjoy this game, the characters customization, the voice acting of all the quest, the housing... the list is endless. It is one of my favorites and very unique game on the MMO market. Does it have it's flaws? Yes. Can the company be greedy bastards who charge insane amounts for in game products like mounts ect? Yes, yes they can. But honestly that is almost every game on the market at this point. All the in store products are cosmetic only though so It's nothing to be put off by.  I like how they do their subscription it's better compared to most. I suggest if you really want a good way to decide playing this game. Look up on you tube ""Is eso worth playing now"" Watch those videos they will give you a good run down of what to expect from it. But I really do believe this game is worth the price. So give it a try!"
Positive,fun and addictive love the whole open world but dislike the DLC for pledges
Positive,Like the game play and the rewards you get in game for completing some of the harder content. The skins are cool and weapon skins are as well.
Positive,"(Prefacing this by saying I've only just recently bought this (again) on steam for ease of access - I've had the game itself since it was released, so have put a lot of hours into this.)I'd recommend this if you like MMORPGs with a bit of story that is easy to follow, however that said don't go into this expecting the things you'd get from a typical TES game, as it really isn't like a typical Elder Scrolls game; there will be characters you recognise from previous games in the story, alongside recognisable areas from previous games (a lot of which are unfortunately locked behind a 'paywall'- either buy the DLC or get ESO+ to access these, will go onto that next.)DLC-wise if you're buying them standalone they are steep when you look at how much they total to, however you do get a decent amount of extra playtime depending on how thorough you are. That said, I'd personally recommend ESO+ for the DLC as it works out to be cheaper to get the subscription and then buy the DLC outright with the crowns you get monthly. My only gripe with ESO+ is that you cannot play the latest DLC (which is Blackwood at the time of editing this review - 07/08/21) until the DLC after the most latest one is released- you might be waiting a year or so to play the latest DLC in this case."
Positive,"I've played almost 100 hours of this game now... and I haven't even scratched the surface.Lots of people play this game for the combat and PvP/PvE, but if you're a Quester like me and enjoy taking your time, you will absolutely adore this game too. Not only is every zone riddled with anywhere from 10-40 lore books EACH (baring in mind that across Tamriel and Coldharbour alone there are 22 zones - and that's just the base game content), the quests also all intertwine with what you read! You can be reading a scholar's lost notes in an abandoned ruin, only to have a mage mention it later as an ancient evil.This game is incredibly fleshed out and deeply engaging... not to mention it's just beautiful and exploring alone is rewarding!"
Positive,"The amount of content you get for 20$ (10$ on sale) is crazy. It's recommended for everyone who loves the lore and the world of The Elder Scrolls but don't come here expecting Skyrim. The combat is mainly based on abilities you can acquire and upgrade through leveling. These abilities can either consume Magicka or Stamina depending on your choice of build.>The world is massive and detailed with bits of lore everywhere.>The main quest and many of the side quests are actually interesting and pretty good for an online MMO.>Great community>You can be become a Vampire or a Werewolf!>Every type of weapon, armor, every class, faction, guild, race, crafting, cooking, Alchemy, Enchanting... Each one of these has its own unique skill tree that you acquire once you once you use/choose/join it, which adds a lot of gameplay value for discovering new things and offers limitless builds possibilities. >Combat is pretty good once you know what you are doing and how to rotate through your abilities."
Positive,"Awesome game. That is necessary for lovers of the elder scrolls. Now the whole Tamriel is online). The game optimization is super! Let's play, it will be fun."
Positive,"Great Game, Heaps of fun and good graphics. Don't expect skyrim as its still an MMO.Btw.... membership is $15aud from their site..."
Positive,"Immersive game with solo and group play. I really enjoy the small touches - on first play, I picked up a book with a song written in it. Two weeks later I encountered a random bard in a random inn singing that song.Tiny inventory is annoying at first but can be worked through, and increases with level. Overall misses many of the main pitfalls of MMORPG."
Positive,"Easily one of the best MMORPGs I've ever played. Well crafted quests, a vast map to explore, and extremely fun gameplay. PvP is one of my favorite things about it, whether it's the Battlegrounds gamemodes or the Alliance War. Highly recommend it. I have hundreds of hours and will probably clock hundreds more"
Positive,"a very good game , GOOD GAME unlike any others MMO that leeching at your wallet for money u dont need to buy a dlc,PVP balanced everyone can get rekt , massive siege at castles and someone pouring a hot soups at your headsadly , the ping gave me cancer because EU and NA ping killing me at pvp,for leveling its fine maybe a delay about 1 secthey should add asia server , or oceanic server since not everyone can play with 250 - 300 ping as mages please add asia server for this epic game"
Positive,"You should play this game,absolutely :D"
Positive,"Awesome game! It's like Skyrim, but with other players and with a lot of content. And it looks very nice!"
Positive,Definitely worth the buy if you are into Elder Scrolls or Skyrim.Have lots of playable game play and story lines.Both PVE and PVP is welcome and not tied to each other
Positive,Everything LostArk tried to be
Positive,best game ever frfr i got like over 400 hours the first month and a half i had it lol
Positive,"This game is NOT skyrim, nor World of Warcraft, and THIS  IS GOOD.Amazing graphics, Lots of flexibility in creating characters (healing rogue? sure! light armor mage tank? u got it! *viable builds!). Respeccable. Enthralling game universe. Questing experience that goes far beyond the usual ""kill 10 red monsters then kill 10 blue monsters then fetch an item"".  World exploration made fun due to gaining skill points. Crafting system that lets You get upgrades without insane ""farming"" resources - You still need some, but be surprised how little.I played guild wars 1&2, i was in Warcraft universe since Late vanilla, i tried lots and lots of crappy mmos in between.Now i found Elder Scrolls online and guess what - the (already bought) collectors edition of Warlords of Draenor wont be  installed for a long, looooong time (and that is - if ever)."
Positive,"This is not a game, this is Khajiit moon sugar. 10/10Update: Still sucks at PvP"
Positive,best game i have ever played
Positive,"1. Going to a dungeon2. Dungeon is at the bottom of a waterfall3. Try to find a way to safely go down the waterfall4. Fail5. Fall to my death6. Game gives me a recap of my death7. Game gives me a tip to avoid future death8. ""Watch your step""10/10, would be given obvious advice again."
Positive,"This is an amazing game that you can play on your own or with friends. The bosses aren't too difficult and the stories you get to explore are amazing. The only thing I'd say is that the server sometimes crashes, but if so many people are playing, that's understandable. Overall, great game!"
Positive,"Everything looks so nice, feels polished, and I could play this forever."
Positive,"Beautiful world and in depth crafting system.  I think I spent the last 100 hours just collecting resources, crafting furniture and making tea.  Chop chop, dig dig."
Positive,This is a lot more fun that I thought it was going to be. I played the beta and didn't enjoy it much but they have been updating the game and making it better and better. I never found myself without a quest to do and crafting skills are also well done. With update six adding stealing and being able to kill NPCs it feels even more like an Elder Scrolls game. Now with no subscription fee I would say this game is worth buying.
Positive,"Very few would find ESO graphically beautiful, but the game isn't impossible on the eyes. If you are a fan of this series, you will likely enjoy the storyline, gameplay, and decent character customization. ESO is fun to run solo or with friends."
Positive,"This game has some big downloads but it is enjoyable enoughI played it with my husband when our baby was young, and we tend to play in the evenings so lag isnt too bad and the EU server isn't too bulked out by then.It's fun making a character and doing quests."
Positive,"I am just getting started with ESO so I can't really go into progression or end-game yet, but questing solo so far has been good. You follow a main questline and then can go off and do sidequests or head to various types of dungeons as you see fit. The game has improved a lot from where it was in beta and at launch, and now sports a lot of content to consume and less grind. It feels like what it is, an Elder Scrolls game crossed with an MMO. The business model is one that I prefer in modern MMOs, which is that you pay once for the game, and then pay for additional DLC or Expansions as you see fit. Most of the content in the in-game store is cosmetic, although there are some upgrades that I think should really be included in the base game at this point, like the any race / any alliance one. Not requiring a subscription means that you can come and go as you please, so you never feel like your wasting money if you aren't playing enough because some other new game came out you want to play through."
Positive,"From my personal perspective, I love this game. I love the voice actors, and the way the talents are set up. I love the group finder, and pretty much everything. I can't think of anything I don't like honestly. I love the controller support, as I play with a steam controller, but also that the controls using the keyboard seem pretty good too. I came from World of Warcraft, and not many other MMORPG's can entrigue me. Some people may not like the extra stuff in the crown store, but honestly it really doesn't effect gameplay. You can get experience scrolls to level faster, etc. but that's about it. All the other stuff is aesthetics, which you can get equally awesome armor and stuff, in game. I love that there's something to work for with the dye stations as well. You have to complete a certain achievement to unlock specific dyes, so there's pretty good value in that.I'm not sure whether this review will be helpful, but I'm happy with it."
Positive,"There's something special and unifying in ESO that I haven't experienced in other games.  Players seem to just ad-hoc group naturally to complete missions and dungeons... then disband as naturally.  Even the trolls are reasonable, a rarity in-game.If you like MMOs, this is a great, unique option.  I've played the past month... over 100 hours on record.  I've barely scratched the surface."
Positive,"Hundreds of hours of content, if not thousands, and they keep adding more every year. If you're looking to get into it, I would say buy the base game for the $8 it usually goes for, and if you like it enough, preorder the next big expansion bundle so that it gives you a bunch of previous expansions. There's a few decent stories, and it's really easy to jump in with a friend or play solo, regardless of level. I can be level 3 playing with my super overpowered friend with no issues, I just might need to level to not die in some of the more recent content."
Positive,"Looted a chest, got some corn. 11/10 best corn ever."
Positive,"I as a player and huge fan of The Elder Scrolls, am disappointed with some things of the game, but this game still fucking awesome"
Positive,"Excellent game, has come a long way since launch. The one Tamriel update really rounded it out. Skyrym and a MMO in one = WIN"
Positive,"Steam allowed me to write a review of this game even though I don't have it, so I did."
Positive,AMAZING EXPERIECNE10/10 would download again
Positive,"Been balls deep playing this. Enjoy the combat system and player build. Many ingame things to keep players busy for hours an hours. Runs very well, have not had any crashes. Anything Elder Scrolls you should know is great. Add MMORPG to the list. oh, no month to month payment. DLC to boot. Happy with, Money well spent!"
Positive,"I have to say i was pleased with how they took the Elder Scrolls games and game it an MMO twist. Sure its not an MMO version of Skyrim which a lot of people were hoping for, but then again its not called Skyrim online. I have only played the game for a few hours (11.5 at this time) i can't see myself getting bored of the game any time soon. Although there are ""meta"" builds for each race/class it doesn't mean you have to use them to have fun. Take the Nord for example, based on race passives they should typically used for tanks, but if you wanna build one a dual weilding assassin or a mage, there is nothing stopping you."
Positive,"Great game, played roughly 50 hours:excellent communityawesome worlddynamic events are greatpvp is epicThe environment and graphics are superboffers unlimited hours of gameplayPOSSIBLY the best MMORPG  I've ever played and ever will !!!"
Positive,"(2016) :Personally my favourite mmorpg game so far, (I will update this review once I fully complete this game and that will be in the next 2 years ;)Edit (2017) :1 years later in still loving the game.Edit (2018) :still more to explore :DEdit (2019): Not yet 100% complete :oEdit (2020)Going ok so far"
Positive,A great mmorpg that maintains itself unlike some others who fizzled after years of investment. I really like the gameplay and fin myself in it just enjoying the views.
Positive,127 hours in the past two weeks. I am either autistic or the game is just good. Probably both.
Positive,An Excellent game with a lot of content/DLCs and updates. :)
Positive,"ESO has kept me coming back for a fix of adventure for over 500 hours. I originally chose to try this game as it doesn't have monthly subscription fees, an advantage it has over many other MMOs. When it comes to gameplay, I can't say that I love all aspects of this MMO, though. This review comes from a player who enjoys a good, immersive and interactive game world with plenty of things to do. While I've had my share of hours playing Skyrim, I'm not a Skyrim enthusiast and thus won't compare the differences between ESO and Skyrim.YOUR CHARACTER:You start with creating your character and you have many races and several classes to choose from. Each race has different traits and perks, and each class also has class-specified skills. Character development is quite enjoyable, though sometimes I feel the game could have more skills for each class to use. Level restrictions aside, you pretty much have total freedom in growing your character and in this area replay value is high, you can play other classes and races to enjoy a slightly different gaming experience when it comes to your character.THE GAME WORLD & GAMEPLAY:The game world in ESO is quite large even without DLC-areas, and the game rewards you with exp everytime you find a new area. This is a nice touch and gives you a feeling of being rewarded for exploration. The game also has lots of gameplay-related achievements which give you an additional sense of accomplishment as you play. Each general map area has plenty of waypoints which you can use for teleportation in order to fast travel within the current- or to a different map. All areas have plenty of enemies to kill, craft-materials like wood, runes, plants, etc. to harvest, and even treasure chests to find. You almost never run out of things to find and harvest. The game has plenty of delves, group-dungeons, PVP-areas, etc. which are sure to keep players busy, depending on how you like to play the game. For me, I like playing solo and with friends against the hordes of AI enemies in dungeons and arenas, *whack-boom- and huzzah!*Combating enemies with weapons and spells isn't rocket science in ESO and it's pretty straightforward, it does its job but I can't help but feel that it could be more diverse. Also everytime your character dies it doesn't really have a lasting consequence, just a loss of durability in your gear and a soul gem to restore your character to life.ITEMS & CRAFTING & GUILDS:ESO has a large and well-varied selection of gear with different traits and set items. You can also modify current gear, find new gear from loot, craft your own or buy from human players or NPC-merchants. Crafting, to me, is quite fun to do to help with your character and adventures. Of course, you have to level up your crafting skills in order to create better and more powerful items, but I personally enjoyed that as it gives you an additional goal to work towards.The game has human player-made guilds such as trade-guilds which you can join via an invite. You can sell your loot (often for more profit than what you'd get from a regular merchant) to other players and also buy whatever others are selling at the moment. It is a good and fun way to make gold in order to avoid spending real-life money in the game (yes, microtransactions are there). My experience in guilds has been a positive one and experienced players have been really helpful whenever I've had questions about gameplay or crafting.QUESTS:The game has more of these than I could ever have time to complete, the amount of quest content is so large that no one will run out of things to do. Not only do NPCs give quests, you can find new ones to tackle from notes lying around, bodies on the ground, you name it.When it comes to single-quests, the game has plenty of variations of the usual ""Fed-Ex""-quests, ""Kill enemy X and be rewarded""-quests, ""Craft items XYZ for a reward"", etc. Unless you just want to grind through quests without thought to eventually get to your reward, it all comes down to whether or not the quest quality and writing succeeds in keeping you hooked. To me, not only do many quests have very silly writing, I've often run through many quest dialogues without reading because the game doesn't give me a reason to care about many of its NPCs and what they have to say. More of this below in the NPCs-section.You also have longer quest-lines which continue even after several things you've performed for NPCs. The writing in some of these did succeed in making me intrigued about what happens next. Adding a level of diversity is that a longer quest line can involve numerous NPCs and events. The central story-figure NPCs are better written than the ""trivial"" ones, with Razum-dar being my favorite of the better written central characters.For better or worse, you have complete freedom of pace in your quests. For those who want to do quests without time limits, this is just what the doctor ordered. If you look for immersiveness, the quests have no sense of ""urgency"" as you can just stop doing your current quest halfway and let it hang in there waiting for you to complete it later. To me this makes no sense especially when ex. a village is being attacked by enemies and they're burning everything to the ground, you're supposed to go in and save the day but instead you can just opt out for a coffee break or a break from ESO altogether, just to find that nothing has changed while you were away with the village still intact and under enemy attack, and thus ignoring the village and its people doesn't have any consequences whatsoever. To me, this kind of game design is just ridiculous and robs the game of certain integrity. Regardless of the quest type, advancing through them is always very linear and limited in what you can say or do. You do get some moments where you have to select one consequence over the other, but it does leave me thinking ""all of this could be done so much better.""NPCs & IMMERSIVENESS:For players who look for RPG-level immersiveness, the question is, does the in-game world feel alive? While the times of day and weather keep changing, NPCs like merchants etc. always do the same things in their respective locations and always say the exact same things. You can't conversate with them about anything that is going on in the game world. Some bystander NPCs do comment on your actions (let's say you saved Queen Ayrenn from an assassination attempt) and this immediately injects some life into the game world while making you feel like what you did actually mattered. Some NPCs also mutter certain random lines as you pass by them doing your thing, but their comments don't ever change and the game's any proper attempts at immersiveness fall short.As someone who enjoys immersive NPCs, a sense that the game-world changes around me and that my actions have consequences, I find the game lacking severely in this area. You could always make the argument of ""use your imagination"" and I respect that, but to me this type of a game isn't a D&D-tabletop where you need to imagine everything in your own head, in my book NPCs should be well written. You never really have to (nor even can) prove yourself to NPCs in any way, they just throw quests at you trusting you blindly and never question your motives. You don't really even have a choice of being good or evil (outside of acting like an outlaw in society and being hunted by guards for a while). Most of the NPCs are almost void of personality and you can't form any kind of emotional connection with them.""IS THE GAME WORTH IT?"":It depends on what kind of experience you're after. Looking for an MMO with personality? Look elsewhere. An RPG-fix? Look elsewhere. Skyrim-like experience? Look elsewhere. I can recommend ESO as a casual MMO experience as it works best that way, as long as you're not looking for anything beyond casual.""Casual"" does keep me entertained, but always leaves me lamenting ""it could be SO much better..."""
Positive,Years of fun!
Positive,fun game will ruin my life 10/10
Positive,"Never was a fan of MMORPGs (""I don't need other people in MY game!""), but this one is somehow different. I love the setting, the gameplay (it is NOT dull like in most of online games), the well-written characters. And the crafting system. And the emotes. And how you can form a little misic band with random players while waiting for the Anchor to respawn.Another point that matters for me: this game can be played solo OR with friends. It is awesome both ways."
Positive,Amazing game for even a casual Elder Scrolls lover. Don't let the negative reviews discourage you if they are before the recent Tamriel Unlimited update which change a good portion of the game for the better. The game runs smoothly and I feel the customization will only get better as I get farther into the game.
Positive,"I am a huge Elder Scrolls fan, and I have to say I was really hyped when this game was set to release in 2014. I always thought that this game series would make a great MMO. However, this game was not at all what it was promised to be. I was one of the lucky few that was selected to play the online beta. I understood that the game was still in the beta stages, and what I played was not a complete representation of the game’s final product. With that being said, everything that you enjoyed about Elder Scrolls was pretty much stripped away and replaced with the same old MMO play style. The game was promised to be completely free roam like Skyrim was, or Morrowind. This was not the case. Everything was rigid and narrow. If you saw a mountain that you wanted to climb, or an island you wanted to swim to, you were met with invisible barriers or deadly piranha whenever you explored past the intended path. The “do whatever you want; whenever you want” play style was also removed. It was replaced with the standard cookie cutter MMO play style. Go do this thing. Then come back and get some gold. Go do that thing and then kill this thing... blah blah blah! You do not have all the freedoms you took for granted in the previous Elder scrolls games. The beta was not a total loss though. There was a bit of uniqueness when it came to the fighting. I did like how your attacks play off of your teammates attacks and even your enemy's attacks as well. You had to strategize and plan ahead. You had to know what your team’s abilities were if you wanted to play effectively; However, this was not enough for me. I stopped playing the game for quite a while. I only picked it back up because my wife started playing with one of her friends. She asked if I would play with her too. By that point the beta was closed and the official game was released and the Summerset expansion was the latest DLC. At that point I had only around 17 hours of the gameplay. Since then I have poured over 1100 hours in the game, at the time of this review. I can say that the game has improved by leaps and bounds from the last time I played. The game does not feel as linear and the free roam aspect is better fleshed out. In my opinion the true feeling of playing an Elder Scrolls game is still lacking. The game is just like any other MMO out there, but with an Elder Scrolls overlay. I still have fun playing this game with my wife, and I have no real problems with the game anymore. I have come to an understanding that the Elder Scrolls Online will never be as good as it was promised to be. If you are an Elder Scrolls fan and like the MMO style game than you would like this game."
Positive,Iplayed like 5 years ago and it was horrible. now  im playing a excelent game mmorpg in 2020 whit good content and graphics and the beautiful lore from the elder scrolls <3
Positive,"For those fans of Skyrim, this game is fun. From good graphics, audio to the lore and storylines, it doesn't fail to please!"
Positive,This game is addicting as hell.
Positive,It's a great game.
Positive,"Hitting lvl 50 has helped me get a lot of sex, thank you zenimax"
Positive,its great game guys
Positive,Its fun.. Never really gets boring
Positive,+Graphics+Music+Quests+PvP+Addons+Can join up to 4 Guilds at the same time-Not a server wide Auction system-fps drops at cities ( AMD user here)
Positive,"It is really a good game , especially for MMORPG and the elder scroll fans, it can fit ur any image of an open world and give u a total different experience of the world compare with WOW. But if it can support more language such as Chinese or Japanese, it would be better. Overall, this is a good game."
Positive,It is a very fun game. but be warned it not like it older brothers (Skyrim/Oblivion or Morrowind).  Still very good if you like the store line of Elder Scrolls or are looking for a mmo (Massive Multi player online) to play this is the game for you!its got a great story line fun side quest.  humor (2/10)Blood   (6/10)
Positive,"I enjoyed playing this game on Xbox, I'm very new to playing on the PC. Its a really good game. There is a lot to do in game with quest and missions several hundred hours of game play to be had. But there is one small thing, the community that lives and breaths this game and only this game are more toxic then a original CoD lobby in 2007."
Positive,"Firstly, let me lead this review with the fact that Zenimax has very nice/polite tech support. However, after waiting an exasperated length of time for the initial download of the game to finish (42.5gb). I finally got the launcher up and was extremely excited for my chance to waste hundreds or even thousands of hours in the world of Tamriel. Then, the patches started, all 4.6gbs of them. Alright, no problem, I’ve lasted this long, I can wait another hour or so to be able to play this game. Well, then I hit the wall of complete hatred like many other users, when I received the “WebGet retrieval failure” error. After several quick fix attempts and Google searches to no avail, I moved to the next step, submitting a ticket to Zenimax. They apparently are very busy, so it took about an hour for a very nice lady to call me back and play 20 questions with me, double checking that I had tried everything they list on their trouble shooting page before we progressed. Well, after deciding that I had done everything in my power to resolve the issues myself she submitted my ticket to higher authorities and emailed me directions on how to use the launchers self tester. Did that, and emailed the results to her. Three hours later, a random guy at Zenimax called to tell me he had received my email and report, and someone in actual tech support would call me back with a resolution to my issue. In the mean time, I managed to fix my launchers download issue, I assume the massive amount of reboots, restarts and profanity cured the issue, but I honestly don’t know.First thoughts on the game, it has the visual level of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, which is not entirely a bad thing. I rather enjoyed Oblivion, aside from the insanely repetitive main quest line, go here, shut Oblivion gate, go back, and repeat. That got old real quick, but otherwise it was great fun. However, the more in depth I get on TESO, the more I realize that it’s trying to be a repackaged Skyrim. For those who don’t know, I hated The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, or should I say Fallout 4! It was beyond bland, in both design and color scheme. I also despised the level of ease it had even on higher difficulties. But, I digress, when I first started in TESO, I found it extremely exciting. Then, I did some serious playing for tens of hours on end day after day, and I realized quickly that it is in fact another MMO. I mean that is just a generic quest engine, go here, fetch this, come back, and repeat. Seemingly, never endingly though. So, I soldiered on, after my first character was massacred 40 or so times, I consulted the all knowing Google for solutions. Here is where the true meat and potatoes of this game is, sad as that is. The real community, interesting things, and general fun/immersion of the game exists in the bowels of the endless Google searches. I’ve learned more and become more immersed in the game on Google than I ever do while actually playing. Everything I come across, reads like a classic novel, word smiths convey their views and make me long to play like they do, for literal days on end. So, in my excitement, I launch the game and get in, constantly saying to myself, this play through will be different. I’m going to get full blown immersed! No one will see me for months on end, and I’m okay with that. Then I get in game, die 4 or 5 times, and I’m back where I was before I read the articles. This is my major problem with this game, in all honesty. It is just another MMO, the story is bland and shallow, the mechanics are quite puzzling at points, and the faction thing is just outright stupid. “Well we needed a system to base the PVP battles off.” Well, you could have done it a better way than to split up the races into some non-existent feud war. Which, the Imperials, apparently are impervious too as they exist in all factions. So, now I have to have two characters in all factions, since some of my friends play on the other two factions. So, of course those characters are underpowered since I only play as them, if and when my friends are online and want to grind/level. This is not as often as one might suspect in an MMO. Especially, since like me they are searching for an immersive experience, not just a grind fest. So, in all honesty, I give The Elder Scrolls Online: Skyrim, 7/10. It’s a good MMO, it works rather well, it did fill the need of a general MMO in my life, and it tries to still be an Elder Scrolls title (like a real one, not some shitty spin off). However, it is still very lacking, and is effectively Skyrim, retarded technically to work on broader spectrums of machines. As I write this part, Update 6 is freshly released, and I’ve been receiving reports of the fixes and new features that it bears. But, to those familiar with the Elder Scrolls franchise, low hanging fruit is never as sweet after initial launch. So, the next section of this review will have to wait until my appallingly slow internet connection finishes downloading it.Update 6 is the best part of this game thus far. Although, they did add a whole pile of useless crap (for me at least) they fixed several issues along with making proper alterations to some other complaints many people had to where they aren’t quite as bad. With the looming B2P deadline, I’m curious as to how the swarm of new users will affect the system. Only time will tell I suppose.B2P is here and it’s actually not as bad as I was expecting. There are swarms of new 13-15 year olds who are abrasive and effectively useless, seemingly at all hours of the day or night. But, along with them returned many older/original players whom you will mostly meet in higher level areas, I’ve also heard a lot of players complaining about the zone chat since the B2P started. I’ve mainly been hearing of excess uses of profanity, lewd behavior and general stupidity to the point of them wanting to leave the game. Well, unfortunately for these people, if you do leave we probably won’t miss you, because as harsh as it may seem, that means you’re still in the beginning area of your choice alliance. However, pretty much once you leave that zone all of that insanity stops, immediately. Since, the childish players can’t dedicate enough time or aren’t good enough to advance their characters to the level you need to be to move to the next zone and survive. So, my advice to you is hang in there, or GTFO.Well, I feel as if my ranting and raving about this game has gone on long enough. If you decide to pick up this game, I recommend doing so highly; just remember to get it on a Monday so by Tuesday evening (if your internet is worth a damn that is v_v) you can get right in the action. Enjoy the gaming and I hope to see you out there in the future.Thanks,TheApothecary"
Positive,"very nice game, too many place to explore, lots of quest and more."
Positive,best game ever
Positive,"If you like Elders scrolls lore, You'll like this game. This is a great way to spend your time when you're trying to forget reality exists. A bit different feel than other MMOs but in a good way. 99% of this game is voice acted, which is amazing. The graphics are beautiful. You can play now without a Sub fee so if you didn't want to pick up this game due to that, think again. I picked up the base game on sale for 6$ and got about 1000 hours worth of playtime out of that and theres still more I haven't done. Thats about .006 cents per hour. I would reccommend this game so hard. So much effort was put into it. It has seamless play and endless things to do. 10/10 pick up this game. I know it had a lot of bad PR but they fixed a bunch of stuff and lives up to the hype I'm setting up for it. The voice acting is a beautiful touch. The storyline takes you for a RIDE. Its great, amazing writing."
Positive,"Having now played ESO for 220 hours over three weeks, i can only say that i definitely enjoyed it!I would consider it a hybrid Skyrim, with more MMORPG features implemented, and a more wide and explorable world! All of it stuff i like. It can seem daunting at first but once you get the hang of it you definitely know what to do!There are a few things i would provide constructive critisism on, like the ESO team giving the Character Creation and race models a much needed update with slightly more options, along with some older visual stuff getting an update. Not to mention that the balance between classes in PVP definitely needs a look at, since there are definitely favorable race/class combos that are predominant in PVP for the time being. But the game definitely has lots of potential and is a lot of fun, especially the fast paced combat that has given me a consistent stream of ""Are you done clicking yet?"" from my family.Keep going at it ESO team! And please listen to feedback from your community! We all want whats best for the game <3"
Positive,Pretty good game although i have just started playing.
Positive,PvE is greatPvP is not
Positive,Long review short: This game is really fun for those who enjoy a mix of great looking graphics and attentive gameplay.  The story line is extremely thick and has various outcomes depending on your way of answer or completing quests.  Every class can be very diverse and have multiple roles they can play.  Overall this game is one of the best MMORPG games out there.
Positive,"This is one of my favorite games of all time.  Many of the issues with other MMOs do not exist in this game.  That's not to say it is without its share of issues (server performance has only recently improved; the devs like to change things), but overall this is one of the greatest games ever."
Positive,"I bought this game back in 2015 for my Xbox one. It was an absolute dumpster fire of a game. Actually one of the worst purchases I have ever made. Since then they have released many patches including a 60gb revamp. I gave the game a second chance and bought it for my PC and have not been disappointed. It is everything I wanted the game to be on release day. If you enjoy the Elder Scrolls franchise, then you will love this game."
Positive,underrated mmo. great pvp
Positive,One of the best game i ever played ! but with shity servers !
Positive,Elder Scrolls Online is a bad game don't play it
Positive,Probably one of the most welcoming MMOs I have ever played.
Positive,"seems it keeps getting more fun, each time i play"
Positive,its a great game and i never run out of things to do
Positive,So much of my life was wasted a way on this game ;-;
Positive,"I don't want to like this game, but I don't want to put it down.OK, first, a lot of the problems HAVE been fixed up. This game is working so much better now.If you're a TES fan, you probably won't like this game. It's even MORE dumbed down than Skyrim, quests feel hastily thought out and everything is just a fetch quest or slay quest.  EVERYTHING.  It. Gets. Old.But...  It's still got just enough TES inside it to make me want more."
Positive,"I'm already fan of Elder Scrolls Series, I was looking for a mmorpg games like the Elder Scrolls series, and this game offers unique setting and quest. This game is unlikely other mmorpg. It has unique quests, dungeons. PVP in this game offers us conquering castles, joining epic battles, defending castle."
Positive,Been gaming WoW active for 11 years now.. Was just gonna give this one a shot for fun. Now i disbanded my hardcore raiding guild on WoW and got my guild to game this. So much fun! If u`re looking for a massive multiplayer RPG game this is for you! U will never game alone if u dont want to. Been declining over 100 group invites and i am just level 20.
Positive,Amazing game i have been playing for year's now
Positive,Highly Addictive ! XD love it
Positive,"The game itself is great, it's a hybrid of a standard mmo experience such as wow, and a single player TES game. The quests are quite a bit more fleshed out then the standard MMO fair, and there are more recurring characters, and they sometimes even recognise things you have done before. Another boon is the emphasis on exploration. where just roaming around is a treat. And it's gorgeous to boot!skills are a lot more interchangeable outside your chosen class, and a character can be built around skills from weapons, armor, guilds, diseases, and what not and, to make off the wall builds. In the past I had given this game a negative review due to problems with an update rendering the game unplayable, and the support team first pretended nothing was wrong. Once the complaints on reddit started to mount they blamed ISP's, and refused refunds. So while this tainted my view of the game for years it's not a direct fault of the game. I have since given the game another try and the problems have since been resolved and I can play without problem."
Positive,"THIS IS NOT SKYRIM ONLINE! ITS AN MMO SET IN THE ELDER SCROLLS UNIVERSE! DO NOT BUY THIS THINKING ITS SKYRIM ONLINE! So i decided to give it a try since this is free for the weekend, i actually really like it and enjoyed the nearly 10 hours i played. (I ended up buying it so those 10 hours are soon gonna be over 100) I dont really get why people started hating it or giving the game negative reviews only cause they were dumb enough to mess up the account logging thing. I see people having trouble with that - the log ins. Well you download the game, launch it then create an account by clicking ""ACCOUNT"" at the launcher (assuming youre new and dont have an account), close the game and then re-launch it and log in with your newly made account. A message will pop up to link your account to Steam, then thats it, no more logging errors! Thats how i did it and i dont even have any logging issues any more! Seriously its not even that hard! Anyways its really an awesome game with tons of content. I really enjoy it and the community so far has been nice to me so thats another pro. Will update this once i have enough playtime and experience with the game so i have a much better knowledge wether its worth buying or not. As of now, its on sale and i definitely reccomend it.EDIT 1 : This game has seriously tons of quests worth doing. The story is rich and amazing. It really feels like an Elder Scrolls game though if you played Skyrim on ""easy"" this is not easy at all. Remember, this is an MMO. There are some bosses that you must either be well prepared or have some friends for backup. Also alot of people can be running the same quest you are doing and the quests bosses/items and stuff respawn like instantly which is a major pro since that means you dont have to wait to complete a quest. Also something i didnt like about the game is all this overpriced DLC (1500 crowns for 2 dungeons only?) that you can buy with crowns (which theres no way to earn them ingame) or by getting ESO+ or whatever its called, the subscription. Bear in mind this is NOT a subscription based MMO, you just dont have access to 2 or 3 dungeons and some gear if you dont have the DLC. As i am not max level yet i cannot say wether or not this gear is better than what you can get without them.Also this crown system is shit. Id really want a real MMO where skill and actually playing the game and farming stuff can make your character stronger etc but nope, there are so many idiots who like to throw their wallets at the screen. Thanks to all of you we will never get an MMO with no microtransactions at all. Im fine with cosmetics but pay to change race/name/faction and all this bullshit is annoying as hell. I mean cmon devs just add a pay to get a max level op geared character already.TLDRRecommend if you like MMOs and questing and quests that actually have a story. Not sure how crowns and DLCs affect gameplay at endgame when i hit level cap ill update this."
Positive,i can play as garfield10/10
Positive,Great game 10/10
Positive,This game is really fun.  I might fail college because of this game 10/10 Would fail to run one more dungeon... :D
Positive,i want lyris to crush my skull with her thighs
Positive,This game is amazing! No subscription after March! Great gameplay and amazing combat system. Definitely worth the money!
Positive,From what I have played this game so far has been a lot of fun with friends. If you have some friends or if you find a good guild then this game can be a bit of fun.
Positive,"the log problem is ok now,the game is very good"
Positive,"There's a surprising amount of single-player content here! I've owned this game for a hot minute but have never actually played it because I'm not into MMOs or anything like that. And I'm still not. Now, maybe I just haven't really played this game enough yet, but I'm seeing a whole lot of single-player content with this game! Maybe not single-player ""focused"" gameplay, but still single-player. I'm actually impressed."
Positive,"An amazing MMORPG with a ton of content and amazing lore and stories.I've completed about half of the zones in terms of quests and done 100% completionist in a few of those zones and on the side I have focused a lot on gold farming in terms of joining trading guilds and focusing on earning money on the auction houses.So yes, I have 447 hours played currently and am about 50% done with zone quests, and again there's additional things to do in every zone which I find very fun and rewarding, '100%ing' zones in terms of collectibles, exploration, fishing, etc.I do want to point out how amazing the different stories in this game is, and it is all fully voiced which is awesome. I would've never discovered how good all the lore is if it wasn't voiced, and more developers need to realize this.There are some quests in the game that really stand out, and for me at least it's the ones you'd least expect. Just some seemingly small random job on the side and it suddenly turns into one of the best quests in the game out of nowhere.Thieves Guild and The Dark Brotherhood quest-lines are A+++.I pretty much play it exclusive single-player+farming the auction house because I find it a fun game mechanic, as in I do not Raid or PvP, and raiding really isn't the best in this game and the raiding community isn't happy with the treatment they are getting by the devs.PvP is fairly fun but I only play PvP for daily rewards. Same with multiplayer PvE content, I only do dungeons for quests and daily rewards.It's also a great MMO in terms of stopping and starting playing it whenever. It doesn't matter if you stop playing the game for a year. You will not have fallen back in progress or power, which is great.If you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page."
Positive,"If you are looking for a skyrim-clone, you have come to the wrong place.If you are looking for a World of Warcraft clone, you have come to the wrong place.However, if you are looking for a WOW-esque, Elder Scrolls based MMORPG, then you've come to the right place.I decided to play this game, albeit a bit late I will admit, but so far this game is one of the best MMO's I've played.-Combat is fluid-Good mix of races-fully voice-acted quests-Brotherhood and Thieves Guild-player made guilds-Completely immersive crafting.I admit, I was a bit skeptical, but now I am amazed and glad that I got this game."
Positive,"Coming from a long lineage of playing MMO games, 2 of my most fav being WOW and DIABLO... it took me longer than usual to start this game.GREAT graphics, nice mechanics, fluid gameplay, smooth performance, updated constantly and full of pvp campaigns. Many people complain it's hard to lv up yet they haven't played the game for more than a couple of days. You'll reach 50 even before you know it, and you'll feel like there's still so much left to do. The story, the small details, the combat system, everything is really well done!This isn't another grind-centered MMO, it's a first real massive multiplayer RPG, where you have your story, you're making decisions, etc. Plus everything else is great: frequent updates, dungeons, community. If you are an elder scrolls fan you will love this game for the lore and story, if you are an MMO fan you will love this game for being refreshing and taking a different approach to combat and questing as other MMO's. If you like RPG's you will love the fact that you are not forced to play in groups and can also perfectly play the game alone. Pros : TO DAMN ADDICTIVECons: TO DAMN ADDICTIVE"
Positive,"I have been playing this game some what casually for about 3 months now. The questing in this game is top notch, the stories are well written. So far the community has been, for the most part welcoming, I found a guild with laid back players like me. It is a very solo friendly game so much so that dungeons are a joke. If you like group content this might not be the game for you. Instance runs consist of players queuing as roles they are not and running like mad ahead of the group burning down everything. Making it a very boring experience. I run trials weekly,ESO version of raids, and I find them very lacking, compared to other MMOs. Some people rave about the combat but it is just okay. The 2 bar system takes time to get used too but I find you rarely get a chance to use most of the abilities cause everything dies so fast.   I am an ESO plus Member but I do not think I will keep playing just for the questing. If you want a game with great quests this is it otherwise save your money."
Positive,"After over 700+ hours on this game I would say its worth the $30 price tag. PvE is alright from my experience of the game. I'm not a huge pve player, so my experience of this aspect of the game isn't close to what is available. PvP is a new open-world experience compared to other games i have experienced. It's a good change, although I do wish sometimes they had a battleground aspect of pvp to the game, because there are a few issues with an open world pvp system. Such as fps drops,lag, getting smoked by a group of 24(a zerg). But overall if you are looking for a new mmorpg pvp experience give it a go. Also although not required the subscription of $15 a month is almost a nessessity due to the lack of bag space for crafting mats without it. So you either sub or play bag space manager 2016. At some points this game will leave you in a state of orgasmic bliss, and at others a state of rage, hate and frustration. Which is alright if you're into crying while self pleasuring. Overall for $30, give it a go."
Positive,"One of my all time favorite games that I can just get lost in. I love how rich the lore is in this game, and the character creation. I have sunk many hours into the console version and only a few here. I am eso plus as well. People say this game is a cash grab when it is not. Do they have things that you can purchase like every single game out there? Yes it does. Are these items necessary to progress in the game: no they are not. If you want to buy a cool pet you can get one, and if you wanted to buy a house you can buy one, but these things aren't necessary to play the game. In-fact the game gives you free houses, and mounts! The  people who think it is a cash grab are those who sunk a lot of money in the game and they have buyers remorse because they have zero self control. That is a personal problem not the games. I have sunk hundreds of hours into the console version without spending a dime besides eso plus and the expansion packs."
Positive,"I was dissapointed after beta last year and I didn't wanted to hear about this game anymore, when I found out that I will have to buy it and then play monthly to be able to play it. When I heared that TESO is dropping monthly subscription in march, I decided to try it right away and I can't stop playing it. I can't say that this is the best MMO that ever came out, because i haven't played all of them, but I love The Elders Scrolls games and FOR ME this is the most interesting MMO I have ever played. Since Morrowind fans of TES was trying to create whole map of Tamriel. We were able to travel over whole Tamriel only in Arena. This game has the best chance to give you that experience again.I don't know why are other people so disapointed. I know there are little bit better systems in questing like in GW2, sometimes dungeons gets crowded, and it annoys me to hell when I pass some creature on horse, it attacks me, I fell down, try to attack it and that creature runs away with full health, to it's position...But if you ever felt alone in Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim and wanted to play it with friends, this is your chance."
Positive,"Watch and learn, Blizzard"
Positive,"Good game, price should have include the dlc's as well but still affordable and worth it"
Positive,"Like Elder Scrolls but online, what more can I say? After the One Tamriel update it plays and feels like good ol' Elder Scrolls. Highy recommended for fans of the franchise."
Positive,"The trials and dungeons and just overall pve gameplay is unlike any game ive played in my entire life. The combat is amazing. I highly recommedn picking this up, it will last you a very long time. HUGE player population too."
Positive,"MMORPGs never interested me in the least. This game is amazing. There is so much to do I can't decide on where to begin. It looks great on my potato of a pc and its more fun than I've had in a long time. Just get it, you wont be disappointed."
Positive,"[UPDATE]: IT'S FREE TO PLAY NOW SO FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF! (NO SUBSCRIPTION)  So I have noticed a lot of negative reviews, even before I proceeded to purchase the game for myself and I just want to clear the waters here. THE PRICE: This seems to be the main concern for people here. ""I really don't want to spend this much on a game."" You need to understand this game is new, as all new games, the initial price is nothing surprising at all.. On top of the initial $59.99 you will require a credit card for monthly subscription as this is an MMORPG and it is to be expected. Although $15 is quite steep for a subscription, I'm almost certain you will get your play time out of it, which I will adress next. THE GAMEPLAY: This part reallty impresses me, the customization offered when you start your character is incredible! I feel like I am playing my own unique mer, which is a submerging aspect for a gamer to find in an MMORPG. Once you've created your very own character, you then go through a tutorial which teaches you the basic run down of combat and such, and then you are shipped off to start your life in Tamriel! (which is ABSOLUTELY HUGE) I promise you there is no shortage of quests and things to do! you can spend hours upon hours in a city finding people who need an able bodied adventurer such as yourself!  THE COMMUNITY: The community has been very helpful in guiding me through everything I need to know this far, all you need to do is reach out and ask, there are many guilds based around helping new players. I find that one of the aspects of this game I have the most fun with is that you meet people(other players) throughout your quests and sometimes even get to team up with them! The game was definitely geared toward having a great community rooted in team work. (although you have the option to solo) OVER ALL CONSENSUS: Bare in mind that every review you read holds bias to the critic. I really enjoy this game and although some people may not be able to dish out a hefty $14.99 monthly to play, I do recommend they give it a taste before throwing it away. The people you will meet are fairly new as well, so you have the opportunity to get in on the game while it's still fresh. My only suggestion is that you don't take the negative reviews so seriously and give the game a try for yourself.I'll see you in Tamriel!"
Positive,"As a long time fan of RPG games and fantasy worlds, this game is one my favorites now"
Positive,"Outstanding base game with great content and continuous improvements and upgrades (i.e. new DLCs, server memory management, bug fixes, etc.)"
Positive,Very fun with the right people and you can still choose how you want to play.
Positive,for mmo lovers the best out there
Positive,Feels very much like a single player RPG with the option of co-op. Quests and Side-Quests are fun and interesting. The best part is not having to worry about my level so I can just explore and stumble upon content without worrying if it's going to be too tough or too easy.
Positive,"Easily the best MMORPG out there. Also one of the best looking. Great for solo and grouping and just exploring the world around you while you progress. There's cooking, alchemy, tailoring, blacksmithing, fishing, ect. you can also buy a house and decorate it to your liking if your into that. Also NO SUBSCRIPTION REQUIRED! you can upgrade to ESO plus for extra bonus gold and exp and unlimited crafting bag supplies if you like and all DLC except the recent one. 15 bucks a month is worth what you get."
Positive,"I just got Morrowind for free with Summerset pre-order....reinstalling now and going to Start a level 1, cannot wait."
Positive,"Been playing for more than a year, and even when I take a break from it I always find it easy to jump right back in."
Positive,"nice game<, morrowind really makes me cry once more :D"
Positive,i dislike a few things about this game like how you can't use weapons on the horse or how the horse can't swim and that vampires suck soooooo much and sword and shield skill line focus mainly on sheild abilitys
Positive,"Great MMO in matter of fact one off the best ones i have ever playd, If you like to have plenty to do and take your time like me then this is a game you might want to try out.What i love the most about it is that it is Voiced, i hate games that are all about Reading alot, There is ofc plenty of books and stuff to read if you want to, but all quests and npc you talk to are all voiced.The look is awsome Specaly whit the Resade mod.There is nothing at the moment about the game i dislike, i hope this helps some of you makeing up your mind, Alot still i havent seen so this is just a small Review."
Positive,While I had fun I don't think the game explains things as well as it could do. I don't mean they should spoon feed the player but I did end up having to look up some stuff. Will probally play more and was worth what I paid but im not blown away by it.27/01/19 - I have recently got back into playing ESO and while I'm still not blown away I am enjoying it alot more. I'd give it a 7/10.
Positive,"FIrst off, it is a lie. ive been playing this for at least 200 hours but i got the steam edition so i wouldnt  have to find those cds to reinstall it. This game does a few things right and alot of things wrong.PROS:1)It has good fighting mechanics. Altho it does suck tremendusly on PVP, the actual game outside of cyridle is very playable. for those that dont know cyridle is where PVP is. The combat can be unstable as the servers often lag at peak hours.2)Large open world. even with just the base game, There is enough open terrain to keep you entertained for several days or even weeks. on top of all that, it is suppose to be a revisit of all the locations in the elderscroll universe.3)plenty of quests. so many quests it will test your patience.cons:1)PVP is aweful. befor some updates, mages could kill you in two hits. IVE SEEN IT. the elves are super OP. this was fixed but its still broken with siege weapons that can do high damage at insane ranges. Just stay away.2)The paywall. Never have i ever seen such a game begging for money like this. some of the core features are missing and placed behing a dollar sign. this makes things difficult for casuals that just want to have a relaxing game session and cant do what they want without having their wallets out.3)quests are far too repetitve. almost every big quest has you do three tasks. -Talk to these three- -Each one needs you to do something for them- -Then you have activate three stone- -then fight three boses- rinse and repeat. although some of it is fun and some has good story, its way to repetitive.4)server lag. this game suffers from lag so much that ive traveled half down a mountain just to be zipped back up it because a large lag spike hapened and didnt register my movement. this happens quite often and has even had me kicked from the server many times. mostly happens in highly populated areas.so whats the verdict. id say get it if its on sale but dont expect too much out of it. ts still a good game and shouldnt be looked down upon as ""just an attempt at an mmo rpg"". if they could fix and rework a few things id be happy but i still recomend it."
Positive,"This game is phenominal. I cannot recommend this game higher to any fans of the Elder Scrolls series. It has changed massively since Beta/early release and has easily earned a second chance from anyone who played before!  The graphics are fantastic, as is the voice acting and general storyline of the game and quests. Combat is extremely fluid, combining the magic and melee combat almost seamlessly. Like the previous Elder Scrolls games you can use any combination of armor types and weapons regardless of your class. You can steal, pickpocket, and murder pretty much any NPC in the game, aside from guards who are unkillable.   Levelling is extremely engaging, with a variety of in-world events, group bosses, solo-dungeons, and general exploration to amuse any player. Exploration is encouraged and rewarded very naturally, with a variety of rewards waiting players who explore (lorebooks, certain exceptional views, solo dungeons, and Skyshards). Skyshards are collectables that exist in all the solo-dungeons and scattered around the map (which can be located by solving riddles in your Achievement menu) that reward an extra skillpoint for every 3 you collect. The quests all vary and are not simply 'kill 10 boars' or 'collect bat eyes'.  For example, one quest involved solving riddles and finding clues hidden in NPC journals to complete the quest.DLC is very fair as well, costing around $20 for the new Imperial City DLC. The Crown Store only offers non-essential items for sale (and the DLC of course), such as costumes or mounts and pets. You have the option to purchase 'ESO Plus' which is an unrequired monthly subscribtion that nets you 1500 Crowns per month along with access to all currently released DLC.PvP is an intense, open-world, experience. The Oblivion map of Cyrodill acts as the PvP zone, with each of the three factions fighting for control of various keeps, resources, elder scrolls, etc. It comes with its own set of skill points and ranks that can be acheived.Crafting is also extremely engaging and interesting, with each profession having its own set of skills you can learn, just like in Skyrim.All in all this game is extremely worth it. At the time of writing I have had it for about two weeks and have almost netted 60 hours of playtime."
Positive,"For the MMO noob and huge elder scrolls fan like myself, this game is pretty amazing. The quests give a good insight into ES lore and are pretty well written and varied, which is even more impressive when you see just how many of them there are (the main story pales in comparison to the great DLC story). The pvp i found to be one of the highlights of my playtime so far, the huge faction battles and sieges of keeps and the like are pretty breathtaking (at least for me anyway). I cannot say what the true end game content is like just yet, however there seems to be a very large amount of dungeons of varying difficulty and reward available for high level players which I look forward to. I have had some technical issues, more precisely, the same issue many times over. I sometimes get stuck in an infinite loading screen which i have to alt f4 and restart because of, but this doesn't happen often enough for it to severely hinder the experience. Personally, I am  having a blast playing this game, and I'm very excited to see where it goes in the future (including morrowing in june)."
Positive,"I bought this game on sale after the recent free weekend. While I usually don't play MMORPGs I enjoy ESO quite a lot.Don't buy this game and expect something like Skyrim, you will be disappointed. Its an MMORPG set in the Elder scrolls universe. While we can't travel to places that've been already explored in the Elderscrolls games the continent Tamriel still offers a lot. Content wise you will probably need 300+ hours just to finish all quest and explore every land, not even thinking about lategame PvE like dungeons and PvP."
Positive,"TLDR; Much, MUCH better then at release. Give it a chance if you like MMORPG/RPG or the Elder scrolls!-----------------I played the beta and found it to be decent at best, it was definately not worth a subscription fee. Now however, with the subscription fee gone, it is worth it. If you're into elder scrolls or RPG/MMORPG's, then you should give this a shot! Especially now with the subscription gone. The PvE questlines are really good, everything is voice acted. The main quest is good and immersive and the sidequests have a nice amount of lore and immersion put into them.With the recently added crime system, playing as a sneaky thief is really fun. Stealing stuff, breaking into houses to steal their riches and even leveling within the thieves is much fun to be had. I really hope its just the top of the iceberg of whats to come!The PvP is the most fun I've had in a while. I'm a huge PvP player, and while there is room for improvements and polish, the large scale PvP is still one of the best experiences so far. Setting up siege weapons on the walls, breaking down the gate or the enemy walls and capture their precious keeps! One of the best part is that you can level up by doing PvP, get gear and gold!The character customization is awesome. You can basically become whatever character you want. Start as a mage and wear heavy armor, fight with a two handed axe to become a Battlemage for example. Any class can use and specialize in any armor/weapon, no matter which class you chose. The Crown store which was added due to the removal of subscription fee, has *so far* not showed signs of becoming Pay 2 Win. Its mostly costumes and mount skins and stuff like that. I personally really hope for more cosmetic effects, especially for skills/spells!There is probably more I'm forgetting right now, and while there is still room for improvements, as always, it is a much better game than it was at release. If you're in the ""should I try it?"" stage, then I would definately recommend it. Its in a much better stage than it was at release."
Positive,"If you think this is ""skyrim 2"" or some silly shit like that, don't buy this game. If you love Elder Scrolls as a whole then you should already own this game. 15/10 for nostalgia and lore"
Positive,"very good MMORPG , buy if it sale"
Positive,Game issues with login and server load have improved
Positive,"EDIT All connectivity issues had been fixed.Great game. Huge world to explore, hundreds of hours off interesting, story-driven, well-voiced quest lines. I play it as singleplaeyer game, I rarely interact with other adventurers, I haven't done a lot of group dungeons or pvp battlegrounds. It is not perfect but even without multiplayer part it is worth its price.  + few hundreds of hours of fun more aviable in expansion and DLCs if someone don't have enough, but it is not required."
Positive,"Main toon on PS4 has been around since launch. Got the PC version for the performance and add-on's, and I wasn't disappointed. If you like MMORPG's this is one of the best currently. Yeah there are some persistent performance issues during peak hours but that doesn't take away anything from the game. As it usually is only a problem in the PvP zone."
Positive,"This game is very complex and very detailled. The lore (story behind everything) is EXTREMELY well-done. It feels very familiar if you have played other Elder Scrolls because the lore is the same and you get to visit all the big cities you once played in. For example, we can visit Morrowind, a part of Skyrim, Summerset Isles, Cyrodiil (doomed by war and chaos). You get to choose what YOU want to play as, no matter your race or your class. ESO:TU is a huge change from before, and many more updates are to come. Recommend to a friend? Hell yes!I rate this 8.5 / 10 There is a lot of features I'd like to see added in the game, possibly in the near future. But as of now, this game is complete et very well done."
Positive,Great gameGood quests
Positive,Good Game i like it more than WOW 9/10
Positive,"I just turned level 24 so I have some experience.  The game is good!  The battles are fair (see below), the graphics are good, and the story line is well written.  I do have one major complaint though.  When you tackle a quest in a cave, dungeon, or whatever, you have to go some distance to finish the quest. In doing so, you will fight numerous enemies which is fine.  What isn't fine is the way the enemies REGENERATE IN RECORD TIME.  I killed ten enemies by myself and they all regenerated within two or so minutes.  I had no time to look around or even check my inventory.  I was also killed twice because they regenerate on the path you just cleared.  The game is not for single players.  You better have fiends with you to help clear a path to the quest. Because of this, I give the game a 7 out of 10 rating."
Positive,"A great MMORPG that is worth giving a go.The game sports a great amount of content that will suite any player, be it a solo player or a player that enjoys group content.PRO's - An expansive world overflowing with lore.Voice acted NPC's.An insane amount of content.Multiple forms of PvP & group PvE content.Huge amount of exploration based gameplay.Many forms of crafting.Fun yet simple combat system.A good amount of variations in the types of builds you can have.Plenty of content for solo players as well as plenty of group content.So much content that you will never be left feeling that you have nothing to do.Multiple story arcs, ranging from the various main story arcs or the multitude of the smaller story arcs.The ability to be in 5 different clans simultaneously.New content & events being added constantly.+ much much more.CONS- Graphics are really starting to show their age now.Maybe too much content. If your a completionist then you will have a lot gameplay ahead of you, for better or worse. SUBSCRIPTION vs F2P - The game has 2 options available to access extra content. The Subscription option opens up all the DLC, along with some 'Sub only' perks such as a dedicated crafting bag, a bonus to EXP, increased storage space, a monthly amount of 'premuim currency', etc..The F2P model is actually very generous, You have access to all the features of the game & a lot of the content, minus some of the DLC content. You are able to purchase the DLC individually or in packs though the ingame store using premium currency.  This way you are able to spend a small mount of money on the DLC you want & still be able to play it though the F2P model. Here would be my suggestion, start with the F2P model & if you enjoy the game then try a month's worth of sub. If you enjoy the extra content then carry on the sub for a while and save your premium currency. After a while you will be able to purchase the DLC though the ingame store with the premium currency you have received though your monthly subscription. Other than that there isnt much wrong with this game. In terms of a MMORPG it has everything going for it. Its a great game in my opinion."
Positive,One of the best games I ever played
Positive,"Very fun, even as an MMO game. 67 GB game."
Positive,"Cannot close the ESO, tried everthing people say online, and none of work, and I do not want to reboot my computer to fix a stupid game,  The game is not fun if you have to play it alone, as all the end battles are impossible to win by yourself, and the should not be.   If you do not have alot of  friends playing then this game is not for you.Issue fixed with Reboot"
Positive,"This is probably the best MMO i have ever played. There are elements in other games of this genera that are done better in different games but, Elder Scrolls Online is a well packaged MMO experience, set at a reasonable price with hundreds of hours worth of playable content, and a great in game community to make the beautifully crafted high fantasy world feel real. If you like dungeon running, Role Play, crafting, PvE, PVP, this games got something for you."
Positive,So as i write this i have 67 hours in game and have only owned it for what is going on to the 4th day. I am champion level 86 and have 130k. I jave not seen anybody irl in days. I have an addiction problem and i need help. Please save me. In the 4 days i have spent almost 200$ on crowns to buys houses with plans to buy more. This game has me hooked and i need to be saved before i get devoured.

Positive,eh its alright
Positive,"Great game, tons to do."
Positive,"The first MMO i played was SWtOR, right after Knights of the Fallen Empire released.  I didn't really play it as an MMO, just like a rather grindy rpg. I began as an Imperial Agent, so I first hand got the experience of just how toxic MMOs can be: Dromund Kaas zone chat is some of the worst I've ever encountered.  As such after the summer I played it first, I faded out of it quickly.  When Morrowind Chapter released for this game I still assumed it was was as bad as people like Angry Joe made it out to be at launch.  However I learned the game had improved and I  adored TES lore.so I mad the plunge.  I made a Dark Elf dragon knight and messed around a bit in Morrowind and the Dark Brotherhood's zone: Gold Coast.  I played on and off then, as that was my junior and senior years in High School and I spent much of it medically quarantined.  However i did no socializing and played solo.  Then, when I arrived at University I decided to give it a try again and played an Orc, again solo.  This was because it was one of my few games that runs fine on my MacBook.  I stopped around the release of Murkmire as I got sick again and had to focus on finals.  Finally, this Winter i started a third character as a Khajiit nightblade and after messing around some in zone chat for the first time since SWtOR I made  a decision to join a social guild that was advertising in the starter zone.  This guild, ""Pyandonean Bottle Company"" was wonderful and welcoming and the game has really come alive.But what about the gameplay and story itself.  Great stories, very exciting and really goes into the lore of the whole TEs lore, not just a specific province as they do in the main series.  Voice acting is superb for an MMO, and some characters: Sir Cadwell, Razzam-dar, King Kurog gro-Orsinium, Sotha Sil, King Camoran, Aranias the Rock-Witch, Lyris Titanborn, Vivec, Abnar Tharn, Queen Areynn, and the Prophet.  I remember all these names because the story is good.  These are just characters I've met and I'm only half way through the Aldmeri Dominion's campaign.  The other two alliances have just as long stories.  Some of them are from DLC, which is also wonderful.  Orsinium and Dark Brotherhood are the two 've played through and they both stand out.  On the subject of DLC, the ESO Plus subscription is not required. but it is worth it.  For 50 cents a day you can have your experience enhanced greatly, with unlimited crafting inventory,  and access to all DLc except the current chapter, which much be purchased on steam.The game is very healthy, and was Platinum on Steam this new years.  The player base is growing and the upcoming Elsweyr chapter is very exciting, as they are introducing Dragons.  The four DLC releasing this year, including Elsweyr, are part of a unified story called the ""Season of the Dragon.""  The combat is great also.  I have not gotten into PVP, but my friends tell me that the Battlegrounds are great fun.  Also, there is a whole PVP zone in Cyrodiil and the the Imperial City.  Each of these zones also have quests and stories, and intrepid PVErs can brave the campaign for this content so long as they stay behind their Alliances lines.In short, best MMO out there right now.  Worth every penny, even with the optional subscription.  (Join the Dominion, its the best alliance.)"
Positive,"ESO was my first MMO and I really didn't know what I was getting into when I started. I do come and go, but it always feels good to comeback. This game is great and beautiful. I hope it continues to make good stories and fun events for the years to come!"
Positive,just buy it dont ask anything this is best mmo  out there that s not require sub to play and its so lovely
Positive,"i dont do gay stuff but i like playing this game kindaEDIT: for some reason it crashes when logging in. lol temporarely 4 star but okEDIT: that was a while ago, actually, now it's fine. 11 out of 5"
Positive,"So as most people know, its not Skyrim. It has similarities to the actual numbered Elder Scrolls games but the combat is intended to be used by large numbers of people. I for one have enjoyed this title both on pc and consoles. It has the leveling system based around using different weapons or armors (similar to the regular series). It encourages me to constantly try out new things. Let me be frank though, the crafting system has been the most frustrating part of the experience. With limited inventory and each item taking up space, its hard to do more than one or two styles at a time. Its not ruining the game for me, I choose to focus on one or two at a time and upgrading to the premium does solve this issue. Overall it is a good game and now that it is not subscription based, I'd definitely give it a try!"
Positive,"Probably the most fun i had in a MMO since Guild Wars 2.Pros-1) Copious amount of content for a low one time price.2) TES lore. 3) Heavy emphasis on exploration and questing.4) Intricate lore and quest structure.5) Boss battles are amazing.6) Easy crafting and Levelling7) Content flow8) Solo friendly 9) Great melee combat system.Cons:1) If you're from anywhere that is not EU or NA, you're pretty much screwed out of PvP2) Random crashes and Bugs.3) Hotbar has only 5 skills per set with one item and ultimate slot. So you have to juggle two 5 action sets in combat.4) too many ""oh no, its the cultists again"" type of quests.So far so good. I'll change/add more points as i play more."
Positive,"Installed the game on steam that took me 16 hours, then opened it and had to reinstall the entire thing again on the launcher. 10/10 would uninstall again"
Positive,"Overall this is a good game, awesome graphic! But for my taste it is little to much of quest and talking. But if you like a story rich game with quests and talking this is a good one!I did love the lvling and stats system, you get to choose and mix your skills pretty good.And the character creation is just epic in this game!"
Positive,Ok so I tried this awhile back and HATED it! But I played through the tutorial again and chose Khanarthi's Roost to start and I LOVED it! I really think where you start impacts your game. If you love lore and the Elder Scrolls games for sure give this a try. I have over 600 hours in the game now and I cannot stop playing I love it. the community is super nice as well. Well everyone I've run into anyway. Give it a try at least! :D
Positive,"Countless hours have passed and I still enjoy spending hours without end in this universe. If you are even a little bit interested in this franchise, prepare to do the same, for better or for worse. There is enough to do for PvE and PvP play styles. Have fun! :D"
Positive,"Server constantly down, ongoing login issues, can play maybe once/twice a week (if I'm lucky) though I'm attempting to login most days. Minimal communication from ESO officials. Not close to good enough given the cost.EDIT - Okay, that was a particularly bad time. Yes, server downtime still happens but communication has gotten slightly better and can log in consistently now.  As a Skyrim obsessive I've come to bloody love ESO (technical nonsense notwithstanding)."
Positive,J'zargo needs friends in this game.
Positive,Restored my faith in MMOs.
Positive,its ok i guess
Positive,"Meh, it's okay."
Positive,you can have a pet cat
Positive,"ESO is a great MMO, the best I've played, better than Rift, Runes of Magic, and the rest of the so called Free to Play, of which are VERY dishonest. In this game, dying is not as costly as other games. The questing is the BEST in any MMOs, Period! You wont be disappointed in this game!"
Positive,"Good game, if you're willing to sacrifice time to grind on this game, this is the game for you. Follows a Elder Scrolls style game while sticking to the MMO genre. Great community that are willing to help you if you need help. Overall great MMO and gameplay really fun."
Positive,"Havent spent much time in this game,but so far i have a love hate relationship with it. Mainly just wanted a game to last until fallout 4 comes out and i think ive found it in this game! There are a literal shat ton of quests to do and its fully voice acted whether or not you will actually listen to to voice acting is ur choice i personally dont and just skip around for the most part. I think its a good game and worth a sale pick up."
Positive,"Greatly entertaining with very little intro needed.Fewer classes than most MMOs, and much simpler design, but infinitely more fun than any other MMO I've ever played.(Biased opinion, as a fan of the franchise)"
Positive,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EVERYTHING ONE WOULD WANT IN AN MMO WITH THE AWESOMENESS OF ELDER SCROLLS MIXED IN WITH IT. IT'S AN ORGY AMONGST GODS.
Positive,I like it but without lots of money you look pretty bland!
Positive,Takes 3 years in order to install
Positive,love this gameIMO  better than WOW :)

Positive,Addicted love it! Woman loves it more than me...great overall game extremely good lore and no reading if you are dyslexic as all quest givers speak in full audio...very very deep storyline. Amazing end game...the level cap is just the start. Cannot rate on PVP because i am so busy exploring so much stuff that i havent had a chance yet.
Positive,"After playing this on the normal launcher I decided to buy it on steam to give away a free code, hence the low hours.But on clocking around 400hours in the game, I find that most negative reviews are based on people lack of willing to pay for a game. It has all the right components for a nice MMORPG, and still has a nice Elderscrolls feel to it unlike skyrim.Aside from early game bugs I have to say the games been mostly flawless."
Positive,"As someone who likes to play solo in MMOs and immerse in the storytelling, this is an amazing game. No pressure to rush & grind just to enjoy the latest story. Skill advancement & level scaling make every encounter fulfilling and not feel like a waste of time. IMO, unlike WOW, this game feels more like a game than a job. If you value immersion more than competitiveness in an MMO, you will find this game both fun and relaxing to play."
Positive,"I really enjoy this Elder Scrolls experience, more than I enjoyed TES4/5. The world feels alive and players can be seen absolutely everywhere, the quests are all well written and quite engaging, voice acting is top notch and the soundtrack is beautiful (My personal favourite is the Reach). Every zone feels unique and the people that reside there all feel natural to the area. In my opinion, Zenimax should handle all ES titles from now on, as you can very easily see the love they have for the world and lore."
Positive,Played this game for 48 minutes before beating the login screen. Best Login Simiulator ever.
Positive,to be continued....
Positive,Outstanding game.Everything is perfect.It's just a bit too expensive to enjoy it fully.
Positive,"As an elder scrolls fan this game is an absolute gold mine of content, highly recommend"
Positive,Most Balanced MMO In The Market.
Positive,got out :)
Positive,Nice game while staying at home
Positive,"Pray, permit me to elucidate the superiority of Nords o'er other races in Tamriel, forsooth. These hardy souls, spawned amidst Skyrim's frosty embrace, boast an unmatched mettle and fortitude, akin to the steadfast cliffs that adorn their realm. Their hearts, sturdy as oaks, and sinews, resilient as tempered steel, mark them as paragons of endurance and valor in times of trial. Amidst winter's icy grip and the tumult of warfare, they stand resolute, their resolve unwavering. Their prowess in combat, legendary, with axes wielded as tempests, cleaving through ranks of adversaries with unmatched fury. Yet 'tis not in battle alone that their prowess lies, for their minds, sharp as blades, are tempered by the harsh winds of their homeland. When lesser souls falter, the Nords stand unwavering, custodians of tradition and embodiments of resilience. Thus, in the grand tapestry of Tamrielic races, the Nords shine brightest, casting their indomitable spirit as a beacon across the storied lands they call their own."
Positive,"This game, simply, is what I love. Quests, battlegrounds, dungeons , they're all so fun especially with friends  I don't have friends  . The feeling you get when you upgrade your equipment, and when you level up is great. I'd overall give this game a rating of 9/10."
Positive,"This game is a lot different since the mess that was beta. I've gotten several people who played the beta back into the game after claiming their experience was so bad they'd never try it again. Though the class building is insanely flexible - it's not as flexible as it could be. The game is likely to suck you in - especially if you're a roleplayer. The customization options for your character's appearance, outfit and armor are nuts and they keep adding more. ...If you've got the cash or the coin.I don't anywhere nearly as highly recommend the free-to-play version. You get enough crowns for your buck with the membership (that you can even use to buy DLCs), on top of a few other perks like more exp, free dying of costumes and Crown-Store-bought hats, and infinite crafting material storage (the material storage is the best thing ever about the membership, even though I think it should be included in the free-to-play version). I'm a sucker for character customization though, so a little bias.Some items in the Crown Store are a little outrageous in price if you convert it to real-life monies, but if you're like me... you just want it too bad so you get it anyway, and feed into their micro-transaction schemes (though if you have a membership, they give you crowns with it worth basically as much as you buy the membership for - again - so if you're already gonna buy a 20+ dollar horse, you might as well just buy a 3mo membership - especially when memberships go on sale - cause you get like 3k crowns with it.) /endramblingANYWAY! I don't think a lot of ""hardcore"" gamers are gonna like this game. If you want a much better TERA, with way better quests, storylines, more polished gameplay and better customization, then yes, you will likely love ESO. But if you're an Elder Scrolls fan that also loves to roleplay, prepare for years of roleplay investment. ;)"
Positive,"I really like this game. I've left for months at a time, but I always come back to it. There is always this satisfaction of getting back into the stories and enjoying the exploration in all the different areas.This one begins with a tutorial where you have to escape the Cold Harbor realm where you are imprisoned. Seems you were a sacrifice to a dark Daedric Prince by his priest... nice way to start things. You've no soul since this butthead stole it!Definitely puts him on my schite list, right at the top!The crafting is really nice, but sadly I couldn't make a sack for a few pounds of potatoes since I've not been really doing much. It's on my to do list. Mostly, I've been gathering, exploring and helping out those that ask for it. There are a lot of folks that need help, so many things to do, places to go and stuff to find.With the new DLC it just expands what I can do and where I can go. Plus the new Chapters offer even more!So this is definitely my go to game... it used to be WoW and if the subscription was optional... I may give it a try again. But they've really changed so much of the game, it's not the one I stuck with for so long. I sorta stopped at the Mists of Pandaria. ESO has given me the feeling I used to get in WoW... and they've not stopped. There's more and more so far that keeps me coming back to discover more and more of the land, the people and the stories. This is like coming home... to the spirit of adventure!"
Positive,good game recent patches have made it much like a traditional elderscrolls game.
Positive,GET IT SKYRIM WILL ADD MULIPLAYER SOON ALSO SO GET ELDER SCROLL ONLINE U WILL BE PRO AT IT
Positive,"Keep in mind that this is an MMO, not single player with installable naked mods cause you want ""realism"" (sure), but it does not suck (it really doesn't)."
Positive,"Still Enjoying The Game, Keep Up The Good Work !"
Positive,"A wonderful game, however bug and latency infested. Missing any meaningful client communication about the performance issues it has."
Positive,best game ever made i have 4k hours on xbox and still play this game like there no other game
Positive,"Synchronized my Bethesda Elder Scrolls Online account with the steam version with no issues whatsoever. This is likely the best single player elder scrolls game since Morrowind,  even if you cannot completely break the game with alchemy and crafting like it was possible in that one.Multiplayer dungeons are also quite fun.Chill, relaxing and fun game, honestly.Edit: Holy shit it runs well on my laptop at minimum specs. That is amazing.Very addictive."
Positive,"Guys..every mmo goes down for maint. You also forget its free right now and im sure there is an influx of new players including myself. I am really enjoying the combat system right now and I cant wait to see whats in store. I like the game and will probably pick up the game after the free weekend stops. Yes it isnt skyrim, but it sure is a damn good scrolls game. The multiplayer aspect just makes it so much better. Its not skyrim with multiplayer..never has been so get over it. For those of you that got it for 60 dollars..game sales happen all the time. Ive had games go on sale the day after I got them. Stop trolling or throwing a hissy fit. Shit happens"
Positive,"I don't care what anyone says. If you don't like MMOs Do NOT buy this game. Everyone that hates on MMOs buys this game and expects it to be like Skyrim and then downvotes the game. This game is actually great, and I suggest everyone to get this game. The guilds, the crafting, everything is fantastic. Maybe some features are not like Skyrim, and sometimes I wish they were, the game is equally great in the multiplayer aspect."
Positive,Only downfall is all the microtransactions even if you pay for the monthly. Being able to store your items at a home is a major game changer that you can only get with crowns.
Positive,"Great game, best MMO I've ever played."
Positive,extremely amazin !
Positive,"Beautiful locations, incredible detail, engrossing story lines, skilled voice actors, good music, lots of moral dilemmas.  It's a work of art."
Positive,"if you wanna run away from the live you have right now, you can go buy this game and have a your own fantasy~"
Positive,"Игра офигенная!!! Я много часов провела в этой игре, могу о ней отозваться так...+Графика хорошая)+Интерфейс тоже нечего так+Сюжетная линия хорошо сделана у всех фракций+Доната в игре почти нет+Атмосфера хорошая+Сама игра сделана для одиночной игры больше, чем кооператив)-1 БОЛЬШОЙ МИНУС ЭТО... ЦЕНА"
Positive,For all the people that are having issues with logging into the servers vis steam...I have no issues I am playing right now and have been able to log in every day for the last few weeks even before summerset came out. I reccomend Verifying the cache in the install via steam options. That should fix the issue.
Positive,"I've killed werewolves, goblins, stole a helmet, attacked a guard, got killed by that very same guard and sold things to a bunch of thieves living under Daggerfall..... I only started playing yesterday10/10 would get murdered by guards again"
Positive,"Ah finally, the installation has changed.Pretty boring to be honest, it seems at level 20 dungeons are a grind fest and everybody just speeds on through.Graphics are pretty bland for a more current generation MMO, even Black Desert looks quite a bit a bit better. Oh well."
Positive,"It's quite good, I play it sometimes."
Positive,"This game is an amazing time waster.  You really get immersed with the graphics and questing. Next thing ya know hours have past beyond what you wanted to play.  Plus, there are so many things to do, it never gets boring.  Yes, there are microtransactions but the 15 dollar subscription is optional.  Compared to other MMOs, this is not a bad deal considering the sub fee is optional.  With the subscription, you get almost the equivalence in crowns (the mtx currency) so you will have an allowance to spend in the shop if you subscribe.  Not to mention all the DLC and a crafting bag.  I highly recommend this game especially if you are looking to play a MMO."
Positive,"When ESO (Elder Scrolls Online) came out in 2014, I did not buy it. I was not going to support a game that made it mandatory for the purchaser of said game to make recurring payments through a subscription. Without a subscription, you COULD NOT play the game you already paid $60 for. As of May 9, 2019 I highly recommend this game. When I play this game there's never a dull moment. Not only is it not mandatory to have a subscription, but the perks that you get when you do subscribe won't be missed. The developers did a very good job of balancing this game, in no way is it pay to win. However I would strongly believe that it is a play to win. So if you're into that, buy the game ;)*A little side note, if you do end up liking ESO, keep an eye on your wallet, it's very easy to spend ""unnecessary funds""  :p"
Positive,"When I first started playing ESO a few years back, the online store was entangled in pretty much everything that went on with the game. It had been a few years since I played ESO and I recently decided to give it another try.Most things on the Crown Store now are purely aesthetic, although there are scrolls and such you can purchase that will help with XP. It doesn't interfere with game-play so much anymore that the game is off balance. Playing ESO this time around, the overall experience in the game is a lot better that when I made my first review. I recommend the game for anyone who likes The Elder Scrolls franchise and anyone who loves the lore and such. As always, I am very impressed with the story-lines and voice work.  Solid 8/10"
Positive,Best online MMORPG <3
Positive,"As a WoW refugee, I'm enjoying this game alot. I mean like ALOT!"
Positive,One of the best MMORPG i have played and long time been waiting for online The elder scrolls
Positive,"I've only played for a little while.I was so skeptical over if I'd like it or not. I actually battled myself with a banana for two hours trying to figure out if I should get it or not.I decided to get it. Not only because the banana won, but because I love the Elder Scrolls series. From Arena to Skyrim. Even though this game may look un-eldery scrollsy on the outside, when you actually play it, it feels like you're back into it. Right where you started. Buy it now while it's on sale!"
Positive,"great game, one of the best MMOs out there. the fully voiced questing makes leveling so much nicer. Having champion levels carry over to all alts make the grind sooo much less. And the world is so massive and beautiful, in terms of graphics, probably the best in MMOs. 10/10"
Positive,"Add Asian servers,add chinese,you will surpass Blizzard!!"
Positive,Great game if you play with friends! immersive with even more.
Positive,"A game I thought would be trash, but in reality a lot of fun. Looking forward to getting an ESO membership"
Positive,"This game is a lot of fun.  DO NOT go into this expecting Skyrim.  Actually, you should just forget that it's called elder scrolls as well.  Just treat it like a new MMO and you'll have a great time.  I've put way too much time into this game and it's really engrossing.  The drop rates are awesome.  Dungeons are fun.  Money is relatively easy to earn.  New content comes out on a regular basis.  I'm really looking forward to trying the necromancer class.  This is currently my favorite game.  Definitely worth the purchase."
Positive,"Absolutely hated this game at first, because i expected something closer to a multiplayer skyrim, not necisarily a mmo. quit for over a year, then it went on sale, and my friends began to play it, which if you are playing with friends it really brings new light to the game, and makes it enjoyable. since they've started, i've come to like the game, and even play without them. once you get to a level where you can play pvp, the game hits its top notch, and become addicting. shoot, 24 of my 36 current hours have litteraly been me non-stop playing. give it a go, but go in expecting mmo, set in an elderscrolls game."
Positive,"Having never played an MMO before and never being interested in an MMO, I decided to pick this up. The first few hours have me optimistic, and the $60 should be worth it. It's like WoW, which is unfamiliar to me, and Skyrim, which is very familiar to me, had a fantastic love child that I am willing to look after on the weekends."
Positive,"I admit I was a bit disappointed when I realized this was not Skyrim Online but rather the next evolution of World of Warcraft (which has similar mechanics to other MMOs out there) but once you get over that and give ESO a chance to stand on it's own two feet it's great experience with friends. But if you are a solo player, Skyrim is probably the better game for you. Don't let the negative reviews influence you, we love it and you should judge for yourself but just realize it's not Skyrim Online.This is my third copy of the game, so wish they would do some sort of family plan but we're still getting our moneys worth and would also be nice if they allowed free use of the client for my other two non-steam versions of the game. You can use existing accounts on the Steam version but since we only have 1 steam version, only one player can use the Steam client."
Positive,"It's the best MMO I've played so far, having played others like WOW, Guild Wars, Planetside, Archage, etc... As an Elder Scrolls fan I think the game is fascinating. What Bethesda and Zenimax have done with the game since launch has made it into a really good and fun to play game. Yeah, sure, some stuff is locked behind pay walls, like dlcs and cosmetic (utterly useless, just fun to have a look at while you play) stuff, but mostly everything is obtainable through gameplay. And it's not like microtransactions are something new, they're sadly everywhere nowadays, but it makes sense to have things to pay for. And if you like the game, then why not spend a few more bucks for that thing you really, really want and can't get otherwise? But I digress. The game is fun to play, PVE and PVP. I've always wanted a chance to play an Elder Scrolls game with my friends and, even though there's a mod for Skyrim that does that, now I can, in a new, vivid, and beautiful game. I highly recommend, if you're still skeptical, you give it a try."
Positive,"Can you believe it? Dragons! In your own homeland! What are you going to do? This one does not know, but he hopes his family is safe in Riverhold.If you're wanting to get into ESO, you might want to reconsider. After devoting thousands of hours to the game myself (non-Steam), I'm here to warn you. You might have thought the virus was bad for temporarily ruining your social life and turning you into a shut-in. This game will do that to you for good. There is no vaccine.Played WoW for years as well as BDO. Never read a single quest in those games. For the first time ever I truly enjoy following the questline here. On other MMOS the quests are just kill this, kill that, bring me this bring me that. Here the quests are more like a story in which you take part by helping. On top of it every quest has dialog which is really cool since you don't have to read anything and can just chill and enjoy the story, which is very, very well written."
Positive,"So, let's get the basics out of the way. This is not Skyrim. This is not Oblivion. This is not Morrowind. So if you're jumping into this game to Fus Ro Dah some shlub over a cliff and scamper off into the woods for some Daedra worshipping shenanigans, then this is not the game for you...sort of.So let me tell you what this game is. It's basically do what you want. Sure there's a main quest. But do you really need to do the main quest? No, not really. Let's say you want to play a furry cat who is a ninja that can cast horrifying fire magic. Sure thing, Five Claw. This one thinks you can be whatever you want so long as you don't take the Skooma. Then all you are is a moon sugar licking daedra loving kitten.Seriously, you can be whatever you want. Be a heavy armor wearing daedra summoner. Be a light armor wearing archer that can cast powerful magics. There are a few things that are kind of broken, but I think that's not worth not playing the game.The lore is massive, with not only the Lusty Argonian Maid available to read, but also a bard song to go with it. The community is toxic light compared to other mmo's. I haven't wanted to throw myself out a window too much since playing the game.There's a pretty good crafting system that I mostly enjoy (oh you dwarven oil, why you got to be so hard to get). Plenty of places to explore. Just so much to do.And with all mmo's, there's fishing. You know you need that in your life. I see you, fishing person who fishes!Plenty of things to earn, plenty of things to do, plenty of things to kill. Be a vampire, be a werewolf, be a weird guy who is trying to sneak around town for the sake that he wants to steal someone's pants. You cannot steal anyone's pants....yet.There are fun community events that you will actually encounter some cool people, but if you're a creepy hermit cat lady collecting different cats for your cat army then fear not. This game is totally playable solo and enjoyable.So should you play this game? Well just DO IT! DO IT! DON'T LET YOUR DREAMS STAY A DREAMS! DO IT!"
Positive,great fun. I especially enjoy it now that the heavy subscription cost has been lifted.
Positive,dont buy crown crates it's a slippery slope
Positive,For those coming from Final Fantasy XIV:You play FFXIV to immerse yourself in a STORY.You play ESO to immerse yourself in a WORLD.
Positive,I have had this game installed for 48 hours and I have already put 24 hours into this game. I'm going insane.
Positive,"There's a little too much money grabbing for my tastes, but other than that, it's an amazing game."
Positive,DO NOT BUY ON STEAM. STEAM USERS CANNOT LOGIN ON REGULAR INTERVALS FOR 12 HOURS AT A TIME. BUY FROM G2A OR SOMETHING.
Positive,"good graphics, good storyline and the battles are fun"
Positive,"Overall great game to play, but it is a type of pay to win game. A lot of the game's content has been made so you can only play it as an ESO plus member, or you have to pay for it with crowns, which also cost money. I still enjoy playing the game despite the overpricing."
Positive,"Well I have played this game for about 70 hours. My main character has only reached lvl 28. Not sure about the PVP, but if you want to enjoy decent stories with a group of friends, this is the game. ESO has a very good story and background lores, which is consistent with the entire Elder Scroll series. I am no hardcore TES fan but I have played skyrim for 1k+ hours without modding the game mainly because I wanted to explore the story and lore contents to the fullest extent. Some hardcore TES fans are disappointed with ESO for whatever reasons. I think the story is not disappointing. Characters (races, cultures, accents etc not actual individual character) I loved from Skyrim are still here with very interesting plotlines that are subtly connected to the previous games. Of course, I am not sure whether I will enjoy the end game contents and large scale PVP though. I didn't enjoy those aspects in GW2 or WoW so I guess this game sort of suits my interests and its mmo-ness is only serving my desire to play co-opting with other people in progressing the story.Word of advice: If you don't like the white horse, do not buy the imperial edition. And Buy the ESO Plus at least for the first month for extra xp and some currency to buy a mount. It is pain in the ass to save up for mount in early game. Gold should be all spent on bag upgrades lol."
Positive,"So I played this game long ago in beta, and a little bit after release (Like an hour). I didn't get very far past the tutorial without getting bored, and there seemed to be a lot of bad or just ""meh"" stigma around the game at the time. I didn't touch it for quite a few years.Playing it now, it's way better than I expected. On the path to be a favorite MMO of mine. This is one of the only MMOs where the quests are actually SOMETHING. Even if you don't care about the lore, at least the quests aren't ""Go here, kill 10, come back."" There's something going on and it's at least something to see and enjoy. I also personally enjoy the crafting system a lot compared to other crafting systems. You can generally avoid the cash shop too which is nice.There's also generally a decent amount of people around, and the mobs scaling keeps things fun for all. And it's very comfortable on an Xbone controller. Better than keyboard to me. Probably worth picking up if you're bored of all the other MMOs or looking for something to do. Especially so if you like playing games with a controller."
Positive,I think I'm finally getting the hang of this game.
Positive,"Best game to play dress-up and decorate houses since the Sims. Also you can kill monsters, too."
Positive,this game is like comfort food
Positive,I like that you can go almost any where.  What I wish- to be able to go underwater.
Positive,"This game. I would do unspeakable things to. Great community, Well worth it. Still needs to be expanded on. Remember that this is not all of Tamriel and the other parts are being worked on. And the best part is that you can play this without having to be connected to Steam. So the 8.8 hours i have is a lie. Get this game. Now. You know that you want it. 100/10"
Positive,"I have not touched this game in quite some time and issues i had previously seem to have been resolved [although there might be an odd long load time rarely]I think the intro is not the greatest but i do enjoy what little i played. I visited variety of places, got quite a few skills, and played around with both spells and weapons. I enjoy that almost all dialogue is voiced, and quest i did play were nice. They are not as, thematic or something like Skyrim, they feel more like something out of Oblivion but i was compelled enough to do them.Really the game feels like Oblivion but with look and scale of Skyrim, and honestly i quite enjoy that, the exploring i did was probably actually the best part of the hours i played, and the combat is servicable enough that i am inclined to do it.Its this weird Elder Scrolls game, its clearly like the usual one you play except you are looking at it trough a weird mirror, it feels right but also very different at the same time.Ill prob have a big review rewrite at some point but the game is pretty decent, i had a very poor experience when i first bought it but most of that seems gone."
Positive,"3 years passed since i started playing but i still cant get off from my computer... everyday nearly 7 hours playing this game. There is diferent world here. From coop pve to coop pvp or just adventuring alone, it's addictive. It has unique character designs including image, style, and build. Each character brings something special to the table. Plus you can have your own house and design it how you want adding collectibles, furnishings, or crafting your own stuff to fill your home. This game requires a lot of experience to be good at it, but people are always willing to teach you how to ""get good"". This game is ""not"" pay-to-win"", however if you like your character to be spectacularly unique, then you can purchase many extra customizations for your appearances. You can earn/find unique weapons/armor and buy/sell/trade them. All in all, eso is life. ...SIYAH SANCAK"
Positive,"I originally was super excited for ESO, and joined the Beta as soon as it was open. Upon getting access however, fresh off some modded Skyrim, I was so completely and utterly underwhelmed that it wasn't ES5+ even my desire to delve into my much loved ES lore could not keep me interested. The clunkier combat, the annoying hunt for randomly spawning global resources, the shadow of the $15 subscription looming over the 'free' beta; nothing compelled me to look back from my return to Skryim.4 years go by and many, many games are played, and I hop into my recently modded up Skyrim Special Edition after a solid break, looking to rekindle my Dragonborn adventues. But, as it so happens, it was still too soon, and I just couldn't help but feel bored after crawling the same quests and dungeons I had so many time before. I still had the ES itch though, and with ES6 lost to the indeterminate future, I returned with low expectations to ESO.The intro Coldharbour region did not do much to engross me, but somewhere in the first couple of quests in Stros M'kai, I started to appreciate the (I believe) streamlined combat, the better player instance balancing, so collecting resources felt rewarding, and the reasonably solid voice acting. Now that I'm 20 hours into the world, and I bought the Summerset Isle DLC (with Morrowind in for free) without any hesitation. I haven't seen the end game, nor delved into guilds or pvp or any of the more MMORPG stuff, yet I feel ESO has enough of the ES spark to keep me playing.Yes, I'll likely jump to ES6 the moment it exists, and I don't know if I would plan to make this a 'daily' game, but I am enjoying exploring the various snippets of Tamriel, connecting my ES lore knowledge dots, born from reading almost every book in Skyrim (and many in Oblivion), and smashing enemies in the face as a Dragonknight.Oh, btw Zenimax (and yes I know it was YOU who made this choice) 'Dragonknight'...? REALLY? Sorcerer, fine, Nightblade, eh it was in Oblivion I'll give you that, but Dragonknight as your Warrior flavor text? It's petty, but you could have just called them Warrior or Knight."
Positive,"Rich in story and lore, so much to explore. The quests are actually fun to do. The crafting system is nice, not too complex. The zones are beautiful. And there are so many things to do - pvp actually has quests, the dungeons have quests, scrying, pledges, guild questlines (mage, thieves, fighter etc, not your actual guild), and there are many different ways you can build and customize your class. Definitely fun and I highly recommend to anyone that loves to quest and explore."
Positive,Lots of parts to this game - but it's certainly fun learning.  I think once I get a better idea of the game play I'll purchase the plus subscription.After days of playing - I can confirm I purchased a subscription and can also confirm that this game is Bonkers Good.
Positive,Fav one so far.
Positive,"Lots of quests and stories for the single player type person like myself.  Eventually as I'm more comfortable and confident, will probably join a guild to attack some of the MP content.  Worth it!"
Positive,"I love this game just switched from Xbox. Sucks I had to restart but other than that, PC is a bit better with this game imo."
Positive,i recently soiled my pants
Positive,good gluk game
Positive,"By far better than destiny, is a bit grindy but they don't remove content like bungie."
Positive,"It's one of my most played MMO's and I have to say I don't regret it. Now its not everyone's cup of tea but the communities I'm apart of and play with really feel like a second family. The game has had rocky patches in its lifetime, but they try to smooth it out as best they can. I'm nowhere near finished with this game and I hope to see it continue being supported in the future!"
Positive,ESO has the best story driven content in the MMO space it feels more single player with other people running around in it. Crafting is hard to get into and the combat is a little weird. I have been taking long breaks from the game so not to burn out. I have not gotten to max level yet so I cant say what the gear grind is but im a casual player who just want to enjoy the story.
Positive,"Fun game, lots of content for the price, membership not required unless you like convienance tbh, really only impacts if you're planning to stick around for the long haul with the game tbh, def give a try if you like mmo, and especially if you also like elder scrolls lore."
Positive,"Friendly community (esp for an MMO), great world, so many different games within to play, it's not just questing and raiding. fun achievements, crafting is interesting, special in-game events every few weeks, the graphics are cool enough that you could even just go to the various ""scenic lookouts"" in the game and appreciate the beauty. Lastly, it's Elder Scrolls - I've been in love with Tamriel since Morrowind captivated me in the early '00's and this is another continuation that keeps that world alive for me"
Positive,"Game, where you can return every year. Nothing will change much, just the world will be bigger and more dungeons to fight in! Unfortunately, PvP is not rewarding and there is no much motivation to do it."
Positive,20 bucks for skyrim 2.0. Worth
Positive,abosoluty awsome no buts
Positive,"Solid 8.5/10 even if you really hate grinding, but beware zone chat, that'll give even Akatosh nightmares some days."
Positive,"Easy to jump into and play. Detailed guidance along the way, but some things you have to dig for, or discover on your own."
Positive,Dungeons and exploration are great in this game!
Positive,"Good game, may be hard in begining but slowly one can get use to it :D"
Positive,"I have never played an Elder Scrolls Game before , but i have played MMO's. If you dont treat this game as a Elder Scrolls game but as a MMO you will find one of the most polished MMOS on the market. TONS of Content for Singleplayer and lots for Groups . Every NPC has Voice lines , The Storys are not bad at all. Huge Map to explore and some pretty gourgeos places . Class freedom , housing , Raids , Dungeons , PVP , crafting its all there and its great! Recommend !"
Positive,"While I'm not a huge fan of how much this game is filled with microtransactions...I'd be lying if I said I do not have fun playing this game.Yes, some of the quests get repetitive; yes the graphics are bad; yes the story is mediocre at best; yes the combat system is terrible.  But what matters to me the most is that I have fun playing the game regardless.  Meeting people in-game and adventuring through each region, slaying monsters and clearing dungeons, defeating bosses...it's surprisingly fun.  And this is coming from someone who has never played another MMORPG before in his life.I think what truly draws me to this game is the ability to create your own story for your character.  Like Skyrim, you can be who you choose to be.  A knight in shining armor?  A devious thief?  A malicious necromancer?  A compassionate healer?  You have quite a few options, and an infinite number of ways to play each character you make.  That's what really made Skyrim my favorite game of all time, and ESO managed to capture that aspect of it.If you're looking just to be social online and team up with a bunch of people to screw around, cause chaos, be heroic, or just dance around and be merry...this is the game for you.  If you absolutely hate games that are built entirely around microtransactions...then this game isn't for you.Either way, I recommend this game despite my distaste of all the microtransactions."
Positive,Do you like stories? Lore? Exploring? A huge world with seemingly infinite nooks and crannies to find.  Playing with like minded friends?  Great game.  Are you a hard core Git Guder who wants adrenal pumped action with instant leveling to end game and full sandbox gankfest PvP.  Not the game for you.  I can't speak to the Raid endgame since I never raid.  I am realy enjoying it a laid back sort of experience rich in fun stories and lore and beautiful scenery.
Positive,Love the Elder Scrools World and this really works as an MMO.
Positive,A Never ending Masterpiece.
Positive,So if you like grinding for hoursThen this game is 10/10 for youI personally love this game but it can suddenly go like 6 hours if you don't pay attention
Positive,10/10You can RP as a zombie.
Positive,"(350 h/  LV50,CP 300) Gream Game,Sound 8/10Gameplay 7/10 Sound 9,5/10 Grafik 8/10Performance 7/10Quests 7/10"
Positive,"Looks fantastic, plays good.  Tons of solo content."
Positive,"like World of Warcraft but BETTERlike skyrim but WAAAY BETTERThink dnd but cut back on thinking so hard about it because all of the creation is done for you and you just get to enjoy millions of adventures all at once.also cheaper then skyrim, and its better so wtf you doin?also its fun to explore the older ES games like daggerfell and ext,"
Positive,"While the game has a lot of room for improvement. Being forced to Solo story line stuff in a MMO along with other kinks in the Party system, is not my favorite. It is a rich environment that has a lot of fantastic things other games don't that a role-player like me appreciates. The emote list is amazing."
Positive,"First of all, I will start this review saying that ESO is a good MMORPG. It is not a perfect game, just like any other MMORPG, but it does most of its stuff really well compared to many others. What I like the most is that the world seems to be really well-made and all the NPC characters are voice-acted in decent manner, which brings always additional immersion to the experience. The combat system is a bit of combination of mouse and number buttons. It feels a bit wonky at first but once you get used to it, it is pretty decent. Personally I found it a bit more refreshing compared to the most MMORPGs on the market and I ended up liking it.Performance-wise ESO runs pretty well on my seven years old rig. The only detail I've had to set to high or medium (depending on the area in the game) has been shadows, everything else I've been able to keep on ultra or at least high level. The optimisation in this game has been done really well and I was surprised that even my old worm box was able to run the game well.Character development is also refreshingly different compared to other MMORPGs. Most of nowadays' MMORPGs tend to have a very simplified talent tree style of character development where most of the class skills come automatically, but in ESO you can actually combine different skill sets with each other and also morph skills once you reach the maximum level in them. The game also includes an advisor system in the character development, meaning you can pick up a pre-made character template and the game then tells you, which skills this certain template would benefit you the most. You can also turn all these guides off and entirely choose the skills and abilities you want by yourself, so using the guides is not mandatory.Quest-wise ESO is good, although some of the writing with NPCs leaves a bit more to be desired. While I find most of the writing satisfying, the occasional humour here and there sometimes feels a bit forced and makes some of the writing seem a bit immature, at least in my opinion. However, what I like the most is that most of the towns you visit in game zones have their own quest lines, which make the game again a bit more interesting than your usual MMORPG. Also, every game zone has their main plot you can follow and eventually finish once you get closer moving to the next area. The game also has one main plot which is quite mediocre compared to the major expansions (Morrowind and Summerset), although it is worth going through at least once.ESO also has quite a sizeable and active roleplaying community on both North American and European servers, so if you're wanting to play in character and with other people, that's also very well possible to do. Quite a few different communities exist, some of them area-specific, some of them more casual RP and some of them heavy RP. I'd say the RP aspect is pretty well covered and it is rather easy to find a community to join into.Overall, The Elder Scrolls Online is a good game and I can recommend it to anyone who likes to play MMORPG style of games. There's also free to play mode which gives you access to the most of the world, so the ESO Plus membership is not necessary to play the game."
Positive,Great game to go along at your own pace while exploring the world and making new friends!
Positive,"Improved a lot since it's launch, quite good actually"
Positive,It's not what I had expected but it can be fun for a while. The combat is quite fun and unique but it feels a bit weird.You have to try it by yourself to really know if you'll like it but I do recommend this game.
Positive,Hella addictive. just watch out for scummy guilds.
Positive,Great Game! Solid 5/7
Positive,"I really love this game! The world is beautiful and full of lore. The number of quests seems endless, many of them really interesting. Character evolvement is quite sophisticated but not too difficult. Gameplay can be relaxing or exciting - just what you want it to be. It even has housing, which was the main reason I started playing. Imho the best MMORPG since Ultima Online.HOWEVER, I cannot recommend playing the game on Steam. Create an account directly with Zenimax, because Steam account users keep suffering from ongoing log-in problems :(."
Positive,"First thing you should know is that they have rebuilt nearly every aspect of this game from the ground up based on community feedback. All the problems complained about in it's first year have been totally fixed. The game is not pay to win outside of the monthly + membership which most notably gives endless inventory space for crafting supplies and access to all DLC and expansions, totally worth it. The only problem is that they focus WAY to much on overpriced cosmetics, they still release lots of great content for everyone though. Best MMO I've played out of dozens, great and thriving community compared to most. If you are a fan of the world then you will get loads of great lore and fan service, but it's made with the new comer in mind."
Positive,"There is no negative point to this game expect that you lose your real life.I played the game in beta and loved it, played it in the early days for the first 6 months after release. I loved it back then, but it only got better over time. all 2-3 month I come back to his time for a period for 1-2 month. The only reason I don't play this game active is that I play a lot of other games and have other stuff to do.This game has so many things to offer:-good and active Developer Team, they do really work for their player base.-add on support-a decent story for a mmorpg-insanely good voice acting-the whole world feels so complete, especially for Elder Scrolls fans, even tho there are some Lore party not everybody agrees to-visually stunning and highly immersiveI could keep going but there is one thing that I really want to point out.This game has the best online community I have ever experienced in any game.There is always someone ready to help you out, the players are so friendly and beginner friendly, you don't even need to be in a guild.I can only recommend this game, even if you just want to play the story.The base game is dirt cheap for what it delivers and the dlc's also have a very fair price."
Positive,"It's very fun and often totally nuts in PvP. It's not skyrim though, and there are some stupid things that come of it being an MMO, such as saving a town from vampires but the vampires not going away! Also all the cosmetic improvements from the crown store are obscenely overpriced. Overall though I would recommend it. I've played ~50 hours on the not-steam launcher as well as my time on steam. WHY THE FUCK CAN'T ZOS GET PROPER SERVERS. WHY THE FUCK DOES IT TAKE TEN MINUTES TO LOAD INTO CYRODIIL> FUCKSFUCKINGSAKEFUCK. BI still play it obsessively though. hah"
Positive,well its way harder then skyrim
Positive,IS GOOD GAM
Positive,best game in a long time
Positive,It's aight I guess.
Positive,Nice way to spend time. Comunity is very nice and helpful.The pvp is very different from other mmorpgs unique and  fun but   there are still some bugs that are there from the launch that the dev team seems  not to  be able to fix.The housing is also very enjoyable making you lose hours  araging the house.Overall recomand it if u fell like wandering around and exploring (all tho being multiplayer you can easily do 90% of content solo)
Positive,"I have play ESO for a long time and I love playing this game. Even without the plus membership, there is a lot to do. I highly recommend this game to my friends and everyone else who is interested the the Elder Scrolls franchise.---Edited Review---With a little over 3k hrs in the game total, while I stand by my earlier review, there is a lot to do with the plus membership but a lot of gold is needed if you want to keep up with bank space to keep all the crafting mats because normal players do not get the crafting bag, only plus members. But I will say this, plus member is worth it to me because of the amount of stuff you get for being a plus member. I still recommend this game to friends anyone who is a fan of the Elder Scrolls franchise."
Positive,"This game is super fun.. I never enjoyed any of the elder scrolls games as much, but this one works for me. This game is surprisingly immersive, considering it's an mmo. If you pay attention during questing, the storytelling is very well done. The action combat is similar to that of the other elder scrolls games, but a few mmo elements are added in, like a 5 button hotbar.People used to say this game sucked, but the game really received some major changes, and now people love it. If you enjoy mmos and elder scrolls games, then I definitely recommend it"
Positive,"I get this game as a gift, and so far this game offers solid exploration and quests, good community and fair servers. also it's a buy to play game, not pay to win. which is nice.Do not expect a skyrim online and you wont be disappointed :D"
Positive,"It's not easy to write and objective review, on a elder scrolls game, especially when you love the franchise alot.But here are some pro's and con's about this mmo.( ive been addictet to WoW since vanilla and wanted a other type of mmo to spend my time in )Pro'sBeautiful game ( Graphics, scenery, and atmosphere ) Easy to pick up and play for a few houres.Quest are fun, and dosent feel repetative. ( so far )You can join up to 5 guilds at the same time, some of them being Traders guild ( no auction house in the game)Pvp - big scale pvp, with alot of people at once, and alot of things need to be done, before you can try to seige another fort.People in pvp organize them self in groupes and are attacking forts and defending, people really do understand the team play and are co-operative. Community seems to me, to be of a mature type. alot of nice people in game from around europe, ( playing on EU server)Big zones and alot of new patches coming in the future,this game is on the way to be something really big.Cons:Questing ( alot of dialog and forces you to go back and forth to be compleated )The level progression is a bit slow for my taste, it could have been a bit faster lvl 1 to 20 for me took 23 houres. almost non stop questing, you can grind levels faster buy killing mobs, but what is the point of killing the same mob houre after houre ?Premium: You can go premium for a price and earn some rewards, like + 10% increased xp from all sources and so on.When you bought the game full price, you should atleast get the first 3 months for free.Mounts are  expensive in the game, if you dont want to be lvl 22 before you are getting one or spending real money on one.All in all, if you buy the game go premium if u are thinking of having this as a main game, in my opinion it is worth it.Atleast u get all the dlc for free.7/10"
Positive,"This is the best MMORPG in terms of story and quests. Especially this game will appeal to players who know the lore of scrolls. In this game, very large PVP battles, team PVP, a lot of interesting PVE content. In this game you won’t get bored for a very long time, especially if you join in good guilds. The developers support game very well, conduct various events, produce high-quality add-ons, organize various events on the streams. Here everyone will find his place. You can decorate your home, go with friends to clean the dungeons or join to clan raids on trials where you need a very close-knit team. If it annoys you can diversify this with very interesting quests (there are no such quests as in ordinary grinding games, where you need to kill tons of mobs on one spot (although for fans of such spending time there are very big opportunities in game too)), here they are very interesting, which will increasingly immerse you in the lore of the game and in its unforgettable atmosphere.      Это самая лучшая MMORPG в плане сюжета и квестов. Особенно эта игра понравится знающим лор вселенной свитков. В этой игре очень масштабные PVP баталии, есть командные PVP, очень много интересного PVE контента. В этой игре не получится заскучать очень долгое время, особенно если вступишь в хорошие гильдии. Разработчики очень хорошо поддерживают игру, проводят различные ивенты, выпускают качественные дополнения, устраивают разные мероприятия на стримах. Здесь каждый найдет свое место. Можно заниматься обстановкой своего дома, пойти с друзьями зачищать подземелья или присоединиться к клановым рейдам на триалы где нужна очень сплоченная команда. Если это поднадоедает это все можно разнообразить очень интересными квестами (здесь нету таких квестов как в обычных гриндилках, где нужно на одном споте убивать тонны мобов (хотя и для любителей такого времяпровождения здесь есть очень большие возможности)), здесь они очень интересные, которые все больше погрузят тебя в лор игры и в ее незабываемую атмосферу."
Positive,"A lot of content,Amazing visuals and great for any MMO lover."
Positive,11/10Nice GraphicsCool GameplayFunny BugsGet it already
Positive,Great game.Had fun exploring and doing what most mmorpg's do and that's be yourself in your own world.
Positive,"""Hello traveler, are you interested in helping me on a quest"" 6000+ hours later still trying to find his dog."
Positive,"Previously I wrote a bad review _Keeps loosing connection. No fixes available.The Devs sorted the issue and I am at last playing the game and I enjoy it.Reminds me of Skyrim, a game a enjoy immensely. Having a blast on PvP and glad I am choosing a path of a sorcerer."
Positive,"As a fan of previous works of The Elder Scrolls Series, I can say Bethesda just keeps on giving when it comes to this game. The ES world we love, in total immersion and depth, with cocuntless possibilities. Don't think twice, might be one of the best deals you can make."
Positive,"Probably the best mmorpg on the market right now, game is full of player soo many variations of quests with actually interesting story lines as you would expect from an elder scrolls game. Great pve content scaling from easy for new players and nightmare for people who want challenges. On the other hand pvp is just as amazing having quests, big scale epic fights among alliance s with adventure of destroying keeps and walls with large group raid. Its just the best mmo you could play right now highly recommend it."
Positive,"my second account playing ESO, probably over 4,000 hours on the first oneESO is the most complete western mmorpg in the market for action combat lovers.Game is still very beautiful and loses only to Black Desert Online in terms of prettiest looking mmorpgCombat is super skill expressive and actually brings something different to the table unlike pretty much everything else which is just a copy pasta of each other with minor tweaks. ESO has no skill cooldowns but adds resource management mechanic.Almost all of your actions can be animation canceled which shows the mastery of your class, crowd control isn't 17 years like in KR mmos like BDO or Lost ARK, you can always CC break if you manage your resources correctly.PVE is one of the best in the market, extremely complete solo/small party/larger raid content, lots of it. Challenging stuff, easy stuff, you name it.PVP is great, combat feels fantastic in PVP with okay content having open world pvp area and queuable battlegrounds.For those who are quest/lore/story enjoyers i mean, shiiiet, this is probably the GOAT (not my case but i acknowledge it). its an elder scrolls game after all, ALL QUESTs are fully voice acted and engaging, you probably have like more than a triple A title single player worth of quest time tbhGame is not pay2win either, there is solid gear progression unlike a guild wars 2 type of game that the best gear remains the same since 12 years ago, but it's not fukery like BDO or archeage or lost ark that you are dealing with 2% chance to enhance an item and its completely dominated by p2w and rng"
Positive,"This game has several flaws. Its monetization is horribly aggressive by locking most quality of life behind ESO Plus and its best cosmetics behind loot boxes.  It's also initially a bit confusing with how the DLC system works, being you either buy the DLC and own it permanently or pay for ESO Plus monthly and have it as long as you have that subscription going.  I personally don't pay subscriptions so I just bought it outright and regularly suffer from inventory management because of it.Regardless, the game is fun. I ran through Skyrim for hundreds of hours and I ran through this version for hundreds of hours. I've beaten the story multiple times with 3 different characters at this point.  It's hard to run out of areas to do something in.  It can get a bit repetitive after going through so many zones if you're just discovering and not playing missions, but even just sightseeing the different areas have distinctive enough looks to not get boring. If you have people to play with, this is an easy game to get lost in together.One of my main things I don't like is how classes have best in slot ability layouts that don't really offer diversity without handicapping yourself.  I like being able to use abnormal abilities and make them work to equal or greater success but this game just doesn't offer that experience.  You only have the best abilities because not all abilities are created equal and the diversity comes from your armor sets.  There is clear 'best' armors for each class as well that are usually locked behind raids, but you can get by through by crafting less powerful but still passable sets. I'm not one for min/maxing in games, but it does bug me when there's a clear 'best' for any aspect of a game."
Positive,"This is THE best MMORPG on steam! Everything is good, fun and enjoyable, so rewardable an experience I can easily recommend this to everyone! 10/10!"
Positive,"I bought this game for $10 during a steam sale 2 weeks ago and have already logged 100 hours on it, but I feel like I've only scratched the surface of it."
Positive,"Great game! you just gotta be careful cause you could spend alot of $ on your mods, the store, add-ons, and crowns."
Positive,10/10 Doesn't require a monthly subscription fee.
Positive,To start off this is a great game. Skyrim was my favorite game and even that had cons I played it for hundreds of hours on the Xbox bought it for the PC and played it for another hundred. Being 17 hours into ESO I can truely say this is better. Being an mmo the cities and wilderness are no longer empty. The combat is more fluid and interesting. The map exponentially larger. And every where you go you are always swamped with quests so you are never bored. Overall I love this game and anyone who loved Skyrim or medieval games this is for you.
Positive,"10/105 StarsWould Play Again.Here's my tip:Throw Skyrim out the window and approach this as a semi-skyrim/morrowind/all-together-elder-scrolls vibe.-Gameplay is different than Skyrim.  Try it though, it's not far off for the population you share with.-Put Headphones on, go to settings, Audio:    =Set Master Volume to 100    = Set Music to On    = Music Volume to 60    =Ambience Volume 100    =Effects Volume to 100    =Footsteps Volume to 85    Dialogue Volume to 100    Interface Volume to 80NEXTHit ESCAPE, go to CONTROLS, set quick key for ""UI On/Off"" set to Numlock 4.Get altered, hide your UI with a headset on and just wonder around.  It's magical AF.You're welcome.P.S. You can thieve.P.S.S. You can assisinate civilians at your will.P.S.S.S. Open World PvP over the entire map of Oblivion.P.S.S.S.S. Housing system and you can fashion your character to look however you want if you put the work in to learn the motifs for crafting the items.  Look. How. You. Want."
Positive,"its pretty good honestlyextremely hard to run out of stuff to do, i'm over 1000 hours in and there are still so many places i haven't been. Only real downside i find to that much content is the size of the install and how overwhelming it can be for a new person to be bombarded with quests from characters they don't know yet"
Positive,Epic. Played on PS4 and now PC. They really have made a lot of good improvements to the game although pvp is still a bit goosed due to proc sets.With Morrowind on the horizon it just keeps going from strength to strength.
Positive,had potential but 50 year old women wont stay out the dms
Positive,"Updated 25/11/2020: I thought I should revisit this. There has been improvement in server stability and Steam issues seem to have been resolved. As such this is switching back to a recommend as the game is a lot of fun. Updated 26/10/2019: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Incompetence has turned into contempt for their EU customers. Repeated login issues that are never fixed. Updated 30/01/2019: Access to this game and stability once in the game has been incredibly poor lately on the EU servers, with extended periods of downtime preventin paying customers from accessing the game. This issue is exacerbated by the complete absence of any communication from ZoS, which is a symptom of a general disdain for their EU playerbase. Updated: Steam issues now fixed. This is a fantastic game when you can access it. Unfortunately lately you are regularly unable to login as a Steam user. There is minimal communication from the developer and any compensation offered is paultry (one crate for several days of lost subscription time). This issue has been ongoing for far too long and the customer service is appaling."
Positive,"I really enjoy this game!  Can't stop playing it!!! Running at 5760x1080 and I get 30+ frames in the world and 50+ in dungeons and caves and things with Vsynch on using GTX 760, Intel i7-4790 @3.60GHz and 16 GB Ram.  Awesome! I was an early beta tester and did not continue with the game past that due to all the negative press and reviews upon launch last year.  Since the overhaul game is amazing as Tamriel Unlimited.  If you enjoy story/lore and crafting this game is for you. If you like the WOW grind with weak/minimal story and leveling as fast as possible this game is probably not for you.  Now that there is no monthly subscription makes this a great buy!  ESO Rocks!"
Positive,Great game i wish you can kill the guards though lol. Otherwise it has a looot f content weather your into side quests or not and for 10$ i cant complain! Def will upgrade soon
Positive,they did us dirty with that cut off in the dlc but sure am game
Positive,Great game and worth the $ but they should improve the LFG system and have a megaserver thing where you can play in dungeons with other races to enhance community experience - PvP is a separate thing.Why did Steam stop selling Crown Packs?
Positive,"I bought this game a year ago, played it for about 10 hours and then never touched it again... Until I recently started playing again 2 weeks ago :p and was pleasantly surprised to see that both the servers were populated and many of the bugs in the game had been removed or fixed.There also seems to be a new flow to the combat which feels much much smoother and less choppy like it use too. The servers are stable, the game is fun, and theres quite a few players. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone that loves massive-multiplayer rp and genuinely fun (MOBA-ish) combat."
Positive,"if you're a fan of mmorpg's then i highly recommend this game. it easily grabs you by the balls and sucks you into its world i have not played much of this game but from what i have played so far i can truly say it is money well spent, for me.first off none of the quests that i have done have been pointless fetch quests and even the ones that are they had meaning behind it. also i feel as if i am a part of the world when i am doing quests in the game watching a village transform due to my actions really gives a sense of self pride when playing.secondly, the mmorpg i played before this was guild wars and don't get me wrong guild wars 2 is also a damn fine game however i found it too restricting when it came to classes i was told too many times that i carn't wear this or carn't use that. where as in eso i have never encounterd anything similar so far.lastly the combat system in this game is astonishing. i am able to do light and heavy attacks like skyrim and have 5 skills with an ultimate to use. after level 15 i am also able to switch weapons which creates a second skill line i can go from a staff holding mage to warhammer warrior with just the click of a button.i was also skeptical when buying this game and i watched the reviews of angryjoe and boogie2988 but it must of changed a lot since then becuase i thought that this game was brilliant. sadly i cannot compare this to WOW as i have only ever played the demo on battle. net which just asked me to kill a couple of pigs and fetch some crab legs."
Positive,I haven't actually played this yet. It's just been 190hrs of downloading updates.
Positive,"9/10Guards don't have ""arrow to knee"" dialogue.... I'm dissapointed.... This is an amazing game. I highly recommend it for any who have played past Elder Scroll games."
Positive,Super fun game to play with the freinds and there is years of content
Positive,"decent mmo, subscription isn't really worth it imo but alright, as usual, better with friends."
Positive,"It's alright, but you do need to pay a monthly fee if you want to thoroughly enjoy the game."
Positive,Next best thing to Skyrim-sometimes just as good. Great for those of us who like MMO's but hate people. I'm told it's also great for those who like people. Great world
Positive,Best MMO I've played
Positive,the dragons are hot
Positive,"Simply the best MMORPG currently active. Lots of potential still, an ever-growing, friendly and very helpful community, amazing universe and lore, fun combat and a beautiful soundtrack <3"
Positive,3 Hours in so far if your used to mmo's you will really like this game.If your not used to this type of game just try it :D i shall update 30 hours in
Positive,"If you love elder scrolls universe, you dont have to think twice to buy and play this game."
Positive,V v good probs one of my favourite games of all time.
Positive,Love the game but i have free weekend deal
Positive,Better than wow
Positive,"This is easily by far the best MMO that has been created thus far. I really can't be bothered to write more, I will just go play more instead."
Positive,wery nice game :)))
Positive,"Spent more hours in launcher,downloading and repairing the game than in the actual game. 6/10"
Positive,"I keep coming back to this MMO out of all the ones i've played. It's not the same as Skyrim, which is the one Elder scrolls game i fell in love with, but i love it just the same. So much depth of lore and attention to detail. I highly recommend it."
Positive,Has to be one of the best games I have played in about 7 years. ESO Tamriel has a unique blend of single player and MMORPG aspects rolled into one graphically satisfying game. The worlds are vast and the developers made sure to make them feel just that. Combat is impressively smooth. There are two aspects of the game I have not yet experienced which is end game raiding and PVP. I will update when I do. Best money spent on a game.
Positive,"Very good rpg, everything you can ask for and more"
Positive,"A friend bought the game for me, and I've been playing non-stop ever since."
Positive,"Great game, isn't Skyrim so don't expect it to be. Has many similarities with the other Elder Scroll games (clearly) but is still an MMO. 10/10 Just don't plan on being turned into a vampire with out paying a ridiculous fee or getting lucky finding a person willing to use an ability that has a 7 day (actual time) cool down for free on you. Have fun, hope to see you in game!"
Positive,"Eso has to be one of the more complete MMOs today.  Its quests and voice acting have to be the best.  The PvE and PvP conflicts less than most any other game and the crafting, player housing and general collecting will satisfy most MMO gamers.  These elements are not perfect but better than good enough,"
Positive,"Im new to Elder Scrolls Online but not new to MMO's, so after 10 hours in one sitting, I've decided to review.PROS:~ Massive map, as im sure you've guessed its almost all of Tamriel, and DLC being released expands the map even more. Well worth the buy.~ Stunning graphics & visuals~ Extremely atmospheric & immersive gameplay, the visuals as well as NPCs, storytelling, etc. make you feel like you're in the Elder Scrolls universe.~ The daily grind! - Who doesnt love grinding on an MMO to reach those new levels and better equipment? This game has done the leveling system / daily grind very well. I hate the MMO's where it only takes 2 hours to reach level 30. This game isnt like that. You feel like you've earned every level / item you reach & get.~ User friendly & noob helpful! - People are nice and helpful on here. When they offer help they mean it. The chat box isnt constantly filled with people talking about guilds or items for sale like most MMO's. (Mind you some still do it)~ Skills, crafting, shops, lore, and more! This game has an insane amount of features for me to even begin to explain. But it rocks.~ Countless hours of MMO gameplay awesomeness.CONS:~I had to stop playing in order to write this review.Guys seriously: If you're on the fence about buying this, dont be. Its an awesome game, well worth the money. And it doesnt make you feel like its pay to win. If you like the Elder Scrolls universe (Skyrim, Oblivion, etc.) and MMO's, you will love it. I promise.I rate this 9.9/10 only because I will no longer have a social life."
Positive,"What say of this game after 1,500 hours, it's a great MMORPG the best you will ever play with his Lore and his funny characters the game takes place ages before the events of elder scrools Arena and the next chapters. Your purpose is become stronger enough to defeat Molag Bal, that is making the entire Tamriel his personal hell filling it with demons and monsters.The game is cool there is a lot of Lore and you can create your character by choosing the dominion where he belongs. The game was out in 2014 that means textures in low resolution, the armors are just skins with shaders on them to look like armors, the combat system is cool and the battles are fun. The npc's are not various after hours you will see the same faces everywhere with same voices.The game is full of Lore like in Skyrim, you will find tons of books to read. The game has a lot of skills settings and they are all binded perfectly. Cons for the game: When you speak with a character the dialogues are boring and too long, with little quest choices sometimes, the characters talk very slow too but that doesnt help cause you are supposed to read a lot of lines before to answer.There are vampires and werewolves and you can become one of them i love supernatural stuffs!The npc's animations suck the player can do the same animations but it adds just more immersion, The chat HUD is full of spam, other players wont respect you if you have to do roleplay you cant use your microphone to speak and add more immersion.When a new DLC comes out the cinematic is great but the game graphic sucks and it hurts to see. When you call an horse it just spawns instead of run in front of you like in Assassin's Creed:Origins, Some quests are boring its just go to speak with someone for a riddle, or for a fight etcc....The game wont be perfect but you can't expect a better experience from an Elder Scrools game, we are in 2018 i woul like see some graphic imporvements ive been forced to install shaders like SMAA to make it better.Update: now in 2022 the game has the DLSS too, best MMORPG you'll ever find, plus it has a lot of DLC's worth purchasing. Most of Tamriel has been unlocked9.5/10"
Positive,"Fantastic game, very story-driven with great graphics, and music. Every piece of dialogue is voice acted, which brings a sense of immersion. The combat is fluid and fun. May be a little frustrating grouping for quests at times, as the phasing and instanced elements can make things complicated, but it's all fun and easy enough to do by yourself until you get to the meat of the group content (dungeons, PvP, etc.)"
Positive,"I wish they put back the option to upgrade morrowind expansion if they had the base game from before. As of now the morrowind expansion costs 3500 crowns which currently costs $40.00 to get the 5500 crowns. twice the price of the base game currently with the morrowind expansion. I kinda want to return to try the warden, but i dont want to spend that much money for it. Oh and whats worst is during the 2018 summer steam sale the game went $10, i was not able to buy it because i already have a copy."
Positive,"There's a wealth of content in ESO and it represents insane value to pick it up during a sale.Surprisingly, I think the zone stories and the bits of writing and storytelling you get from the quests themselves absolute do justice to the Elder Scrolls name. Could the combat be better? Sure, but honestly as someone who's checked in every couple of years from time to time I can say that I also think it's steadily improved over time. I think if you like Elder Scrolls games already this is an easy recommend, I'd only caution someone looking for a group oriented MMO experience first, as the group content is fun, but simple in this game until you get into the veteran dungeons. I don't know much about it at that point, but I have found questing with friends frustrating and detrimental to the overall experience of the story."
Positive,"Alright so lets get this out of the way first. If you want a true Elder Scrolls experience go buy Skyrim, Oblivion, or Morrowind. If you are looking for the Elder Scrolls feel that the other games had this is not the game for you. This is not a Skyrim Co-Op its an mmo and you will likely be dissapointed if you expect a traditional Elder Scrolls feel. However, this game does offer many things that you will like if you are into mmo's. They have PvP and PvE seperated nicely so you can play how you wish. It plays smoothly and is extremely fun to have with friends. The game is not pay to win either, the items in the crown store are simply consumables and cosmetics. The consumables do not provide overpowered buffs either, they are all fairly balanced and you can always craft your own potions and food that can match the power of the consumables in the store, making them basically unnessecary unless you desperately need some for some reason. And ESO Plus does not provide anything other than passive buffs, such as slightly increased XP and Gold gain, as well as access to an infinite craft bag that helps free up inventory space. All in all, this game is very worth it if you want a fun and fairly easy to play MMO."
Positive,"Ah, this one has thoughts about The Elder Scrolls Online, yes? This one will share them, but as a Khajiit, hmm? Here is what this one says:Other than the big updates and patches, yes, this one believes the game is very good, very good indeed.The Elder Scrolls Online is a perfect mix, yes? Single-player, multiplayer—both can be enjoyed! The people you meet, they are friendly, willing to join paws against strong enemies. Hmm, though, the chat box—could be better, yes? Khajiit thinks it should have more options. Maybe bigger text or let this one choose where it appears, hmm?The gameplay, smooth like the fur of this one’s kin. The graphics, shiny and beautiful, yes. The controls, not so bad, easy for even a clumsy tail to use. Many characters, many lives you may live—makes exploring Tamriel so much fun! And you can switch from first person to third person? Ah, this is good, very good indeed.This one could list all that is liked and disliked, but that would take far too long, yes? Instead, this one says: buy it when the moons align and the game is on sale, give it a try. If it is not to your taste, let another take the reins.Khajiit gives this one a 9/10, yes. The many characters, this one loves them."
Positive,Good game but you need irl friends or it gets boring quick
Positive,its amazing play it
Positive,its funs and has improved tons
Positive,"best purchase ive made so far. open world rpg with so many different options to chose from, best part of all that its not buy to win.]"
Positive,"I play this game every now and then when I'm very bored. It's a really good timekiller. However when you don't have much people you can play it with, it's pretty boring. Soloing, is rather poor. However the overall game is really good. Props to Bethesda"
Positive,"I love quests! ♥ So alive, full of character and VOICED !!! And very immersive. And I can decorate my own house. And its free to play - no stupid sub, all expansions & dlcs can be bought on demand of what you want to explore next. Which is neat in my book. Visually game is horrible, Reshade saved my eyes. In fact if not for reshade I'd never even play it. And I'm enjoying ""active"" none locking battle system. And it's fun without friends, although it depends what you are looking for of course - I'm enjoying casual relaxed rp exploration, lore and just good to be back to morrowind :)Subscribe to a Plus Membership price is unreasonable, should be 70% less. It doesn't add anything of real value to justify such price. Crown price again is beyond reasonable, should be at list 70% less. New content cost as if new AAA game comes out - again unreasonable, should be 50% less. And the other thing that gets to me ~ too small amount of items you allowed to decorate in your house without Plus membership or even with it. The old content even if outdated beyond 1 year still priced as if new content - not good. If not for such fees I'd be more economically active with the game. Im not surprised people go to offshore sites to buy services because official prices are unreasonable.And final thing I dont like is that colors for outfits are locked behind achievements. That is a very stupid decisions."
Positive,I first started playing this game from my brothers account though I liked it so much I had to get it for myself.I love the complex character creation which allows for characters of every race and build you can think of as well as the open world roaming.The main downside to this is that it takes SO long to download and update...
Positive,"I remember when I heard this game coming out, I was hyped. When I actually played it, though, I was disappointed. It may just be because I'm not fond of MMOs, but the game doesn't click for me. 5.8 / 10. Edit: I didn't expect a developer / representative to respond. I appreciate the response! I should probably clarify that it's not really a fault of the game itself as much as it is MMOs not being my thing. I think the lore of ESO is really cool, but I just have a hard time ""getting into the game"", if that makes sense. Even when I was playing single-player, it just felt too ""rinse-and-repeat"" for me. If you like MMOs, though, you might just like it. I don't know.Upped my score and changed my rating because I think I was being initially too harsh."
Positive,"After putting a couple of hours in it I have to say this is a pretty good gameThis coming from someone who really enjoyed TES, but never an MMONo, this is not skyrim online, But it is a MMO based in the TES universe and it feels right at home 10 billion quest, (rough estimate, may be more)Crafting thats pretty cool and makes sense Pretty good array of builds, fantatsic array of equipment. No, this is not Skyrim online, stop askingEasy to connect with friendsCrown crates exist (purchased with real money) however have no products that will make a difference in game, all stuff like costumes, mounts, pets, some QOL stuff, but nothing that will upend the playing field in PvPSuggest the Sub, crafting bag alone is worth thisCons:No World trade, have to join guilds to sell items to other players, not great by any means but it sort of works(please just install a World Merchant/Auction House Bethesda)No its not Skyrim onlineBest be praying to RNGesus because he is heavy handed in this gameother things i cant think of because they arent that important"
Positive,"EDIT: I will recommend this game due to the vast amount of content, but the only downside to it is a personal opinion towards endgame progression. All in all, however, I find this game to be a lot of fun. Oh where can I start? Initially playing this game in December, I was instantly hooked with the smooth game play and awesome quests. As a lowly warden, I was beginning to learn my class and I truly felt progression every level, with new gear as well as new skills for my class! As the main story-line started to wrap up in Vvardenfell, I decided to complete the main story quest. I found the main story to be truly intriguing, with one of the main characters, the Prophet, being voice by Dumbledore?! Awesome! Soon enough, I got a free loot pack from hitting level 40, or somewhere along there, which gave me a flaming camel mount! My luck couldn't get any better with this game! I progressed further, and then decided to purchase Summerset. When first arriving among the shores of the vibrant island, I fell in love with the aesthetic, as well as the kingdoms that lie across the land. Furthermore, helping out the Cyjic Order in Arteum was also very interesting. While I quested, I also ran PvP battlegrounds which were a ton of fun! The one thing I found that lacked, however, was the social construction of the game. See, the entire ""MMO"" side of this game is extremely one dimensional, because it is pushed towards instances and trials. There was no point in this game while leveling where I needed the help of another, or was even given the opportunity to communicate with anyone, which was extremely disappointing, and rather boring. I craved a new social MMO like Everquest, or hell, even WoW, but I just could not find that element in this game, no matter how hard I tried, because in all, this is a single player game with other people running around in it. I found it extremely hard to connect to this world where I didn't have to talk to others, and people didn't talk to me. The endgame of ESO disappointed me to begin with. There are 810 champion points you obtain after level 50, which are basically mini-levels that give you small points to put into a ""talent tree"" type of game design. I found them extremely cool at first, but then I began to see through the development of this pure lazy feature. After CP 160, there is absolutely no more progression towards equipment through stats, other than different set bonuses and perks. I found this absolutely astonishing, and it has truly pushed me away from this game, because I love a sense of true progression that can represent your power among the land for how much work and time you put into a character, because in this game, it doesn't matter at all. I regret to say that I will not be continuing my journey in Elsweyre, due to the fact that I just don't feel the motivation to do story quests for no good reward, because that is what drives me to the play an MMO, a good sense of progression. I'm not at all saying this game is bad, but I am saying that it didn't deliver what I wanted out of it, and that maybe is what others may have wanted out of a different MMO as well. I will be returning to the new TLP servers on Everquest (an oldie but a goodie) in order to rely on other players and truly interact with them! Cheers!"
Positive,I love this game more than real life.
Positive,"my gf broke up with me tonight, she said that im not spending enough time with her. i didnt answer, i was in vet trials all night."
Positive,"This is the only MMORPG I've ever enjoyed playing solo. Got the base game during the last time they had a free weekend at half off, and am loving the heck out of it. It's got lots of MMO trappings of course, but still feels mostly like playing Skyrim, which was a nice surprise."
Positive,"Those who love MMORPG titles know that you cannot pursue 2 different game paths at the same time. They are so time-consuming, that to succeed you should quit from real-life activities.Even if I'm already involved in playing another MMORPG, Guild Wars 2, I couldn't miss the chance to try ESO. Well, compared with GW2 is different, but not so much. Graphically, the 6 years younger ESO is absolutely amazing. And even if the game looks detailed enough to modern standards, the whole game experience is uncomparably smoother compared with the old and not optimized GW2 graphic engine.The character's voice acting (English only) is professionally made, and the soundtrack will accompany your journey through the countless areas the game will make you available. There are so many, and they are so wide, that during this free-to-play small period, I was barely able to look through the first one.Even if both (GW2 and ESO) share the same third-person floating camera view, playing ESO will give a closer look at what the character is doing, and spells are more first-person cast. On the other side, GW2 gave the player more of an area-based spell cast, where the character is primarily the point of the spells and so, you choose the area of effect.And why, a friend of mine asked me, you will not buy this game, even knowing you like it so much? Yes, compared with GW2? Is smoother, has better graphics, a comparable voice acting and is newer with a new DLC coming in the next few days. Just cause I do not have time to play this game too, I will not, but if you are searching for an engaging new MMORPG, ESO is a game to buy."
Positive,Decent game 7/10 Solo aspect 5/10 Multiplayer aspect 7.5/10. Would recomend to anyone new to the MMORPG scene
Positive,World of elderscrolss is the best
Positive,"I will recommend this game, but only because certain people I feel would love this game, and others would just hate it; I don't think there's an ""in-between"" feeling people are going to have about this game.First off, if you're coming here expecting World of Warcraft formatted for Elder Scrolls? Save your money. This game isn't anything like WoW.There aren't many mounts in the game, and they don't increase your speed significantly in my opinion.In WoW, there are no ""unfinished"" areas - you can just go where you want when you reach the proper level. Not so with Elder Scrolls Online.We know that there's a Western region of Skyrim, for example, but you can't go there; it's not finished yet. Kind of lore-breaking for me, and I'm sure it would be for some people. But it's hardly game-breaking, so don't take that the wrong way. There's plenty of areas to explore otherwise.Combat feels blocky, even for an online RPG. There are only a few attack animations put in the game when you swing a sword, axe, etc. and it just feels to me as if Zenimax could've done more.If you're looking for an Elder Scrolls game? Definitely not; Bethesda wasn't involved in the making of this game, so the whole ""Elder Scrolls"" aspect of the game is mostly gone, except for the races and places.However, I still did enjoy this game, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh take on the online RPG world."
Positive,yeah sure there is a lot of paid content but the game is still very enjoyable without it
Positive,THIS GAME IS AWESOME
Positive,"8/10 Reviews are inherently subjective, so I will give you a little background on my experience before listing liked and disliked features. I've played a lot of single player games and am a fan of Bethesda games having logged around 400h in each game (Fallout 3, Fallout NV, Oblivion, Skyrim).  I however haven't played many MMORPGs.• First difference between this and single player Bethesda games; it's quest based, meaning you get close to nothing XP for simply killing creaps and the main way to level up is by completing quests, don't worry though there are literally hundreds of quests lying around, in fact most of the time there's at least one quest associated with each location on the map. Once you understand this difference and begin to adjust your play style from random exploration to completing objectives you begin to progress in the story, levels, maps... and the game starts becoming enjoyable.• Same excellent UI and controls as in Skyrim; compared to WoW or GW2 the UI is much cleaner, easier to use and the controls (specially when it comes to camera) just feels better to work with.• Compared to other popular MMOs this game is laking in secondary features, but they are updating things somewhat regularly. As a mostly single player gamer I was pretty happy about how things were and only felt the differences when I compared games by putting them side by side.• Beautiful art style; characters and colours are more realistic (less contrast), and the scenery is very vibrant. This is simply my opinion, since I prefer ESO's style to GW2 or FF.• Helpful and mature community; in the 100h that I've spent in this game I've never seen anyone being rude or swearing, people were always super helpful. I would attribute this to the game having a slightly older player base because of the price and art style. This isn't just in the game chat, people always help each other out in dungeons or raids without even speaking, most people are very co-operative.• Fun player interactions; the PvP content is designed to force players to work together, it's takes a bit to learn and adjust to the change in play style but once things start rolling it's extremely fun and enjoyable. The same can be said for group dungeons, I've grouped up with random players to complete a difficult dungeon and those have been some of the best moments.• Don't expect epic loot; one of the biggest disappointments I've had is with the loot system. For example you complete a chain of quests and finally confront the main 'bad guy' for the first part of the game and once you beat her you get... wait for it... 2 gold coins, yay.• Contrary to popular belief, not that many bugs; Bethesda games are famous for having many bugs and I had heard bad things about the bugs in this game, however upon playing I didn't encounter a bug until I reached level 35 (out of 50) and it was nothing game breaking. I would same that throughout my 100h of gameplay I've only seen around 6 or 7 bugs which were mostly visual and none were game halting.To wrap up, I would say that this game isn't as good as 'the next Elder Scrolls game', but until that arrives it's a great way to spend your free time."

Positive,"My personal thoughts and opinions thus far-Bought game-Made character-Joined a faction-Started gameplay-Immersed myself totally in game -Decided I'd recommend said game because of the great story so far and the amazing amounts of variations of weapons and armour pieces not to mention the fact I already seem to enjoy it more than swtor, as well as the fact that its just a good game overall and there's not much I'd really be able to pick out as bad so far, the enemies seem to be just as well off as any other mmo I've played and they aren't terribly hard nor terribly easy imo just the right amount of both to get a good fight out of, except when you get to certain areas by rushing through without doing a lot of fighting and just sneak past or swim along the shores if there is one till you reach an area where the enemies are higher in levels, although again that could be a plus if you've just grinded and want tougher ones and thats not even a problem if they are too high of a level since you can just turn around back into the water before engaging and back track, overall its just a good game watch gameplay on youtube if you need more surety before buying though not everyone may agree10/10 would recommend"
Positive,"Constant crashing, black screen. When ESO does work it ends in crazy artifacts for no reason, and it's only THIS GAME. This feels like the verge of Runes of Magic or something, the hoops to get this POS to start let alone run.. TRASH CANAfter hours of crashing and scouring the internet for some sort of fix and seeing others with similar issues, I tired a fix that worked for someone else;  down-clocking my GTX 1080ti by 5%,  why this is a fix is beyond me."
Positive,"I honestly can say I have enjoyed playing this game. I'm not a huge MMO person, but I like playing with my friends and all that. It's also helped me get used to playing in 3rd person, which I'm not very good at. This game is definitely not Skyrim, but it does have little bits brought over from Skyrim that I appreciate."
Positive,After last update (it's been yesterday morning) can't get launcher to update and can't play game at all  - disappointed to the point that I will not spend money for this game any moreBut the game was very good for me
Positive,"this game disrespects its players with the worst daily rewards buthands down the best mmorpg of all timeall quests are voicedtho u usually dont die doing quests like other elder scrolls which could make it too easyand the thing that this game needs most are capesEVERY RPG GAME NEEDS CAPES OR AT LEAST THE ABILITY TO HAVE CAPES DAMN U ZENIMAX GIVE US CAPESand I wish it had 40 man raids like wow.and the new class necromancer is epichmm lets think, what else ...ah u can only buy horses with mounts, other mounts are only bought with real life money which is a money grubbing move."
Positive,"Not as good as the real elder scrolls games, but still good. It can be a solo game if your not in to pvp, i mostly do pve solo myself."
Positive,Awesome Game! Very good for free to play after you buy! Just wish items in the crown store weren't so expensive!
Positive,"Support is trash, game is good 7/10"
Positive,This game is literally amazing!Most in-depth and intresting MMORPG I've ever played and I've played quite a few. Feels like the perfect mix of what Skyrim did well mixed with a handful of amazing features and styles that make other MMORPGs so well done. Hands down would play if you loved Skyrim and have at least an intrest in experiencing an MMORPG.
Positive,"Fantastic MMO experience with no-subscriptions?Sale for base game that costs 10 dollars?Over 250 mastery levels, dungeons, quests, and thousands of items in the base game?Amazing DLC that comes for a fair price, but isn't neccessary?Better beg Mommy for those 10 dollars like you've never done before, Little Jimmy."
Positive,"A lot of you are probably like me and heard about how bad this game was when it first came out.  A couple of months ago, however, I heard from some friends that the developers have been working hard on fixing a lot of the launch issues.  Then finally, ""One Tamriel"" update came out, and I thought I would finally give this game a shot.This game, in my opinion, is one of the best MMORPGs you can play in this day and age.  It effortlessly merges some of the best designs and elements of other popular MMORPGs together yet stands in a unique untouched area that sets it apart from anything else on the market.  Let me break it down.1) Exploration: 10/10This is, by far, the strongest point of this game to me, and it is my reason for why this game is unique.  With the One Tamriel update, this game now uses a fancy, balanced, yet intuitive level scaling system that is similar to Guild Wars 2.  The game now feels like a proper Elder Scrolls game (but a lot better in the level scaling than stuff like Oblivion).  You can go anywhere, do anything, and attempt any danger.  This both encourages exploration but also allows high level players to revisit old zones, help with their friends, or explore other starting zones.  All in all, this added tons of gameplay and strengthed the community.2) Combat/Classes/BuildsThe action combat in this game is a blend of Guild Wars 2, Tera, WoW, and Elder Scroll games.  It's flash at times, yet realistic in others.  It is both simple to learn yet complex to master.  While there are ""metabuilds"" each classes can adhere to, for 99.999% of the game, you do not need to follow cookie-cutter builds.  As long as you do your research and have a good understanding of the game, the flexibility and incredible arsenal of skills you can use to customize is truly incredible.  Any classes can be any builds, and there are diversity on top of that.  Even the way they incorprated the classic Tank-Healer-DPS is interesting, and all of that is further boosted by the interestingly designed dungeons, worldbosses, and events.3) Payment model, community, and othersYou pay the game once, and you do not have to pay for anything else.  The ESO-Plus subscription is nice to have, but it is not at all necessary.  All the stuff you can buy with real money are cosmetics, as they should be, and most of them can be aquired through in game currency.  Unlike games like Black Desert, you are still able to fully customize and create some very cool ""fashion"" outfits without paying a single cent after purchasing the game.  With the One Tamriel update, the game has steered hard into friendly co-op mode, and you can see this in the community.  People are generally very kind to each other, and since there are no competition in exp or quests, players are often happy to see another running by.tl;dr-If you want a world worth exploring, diverse and flexible classes, incredible pvp (which I didn't get to touch on), and well designed group content, this game is for you.  Especially considering how cheap the buy to play price is, this is a steal for anyone who like Elder Scroll games, MMORPGs, or even just exploration/immersive worlds."
Positive,"Awsome MMO, Awsome game in general. The only problem is that Bethesda is taking it way too far with the DLC and microtransactions. I mean, the only one that feels nessecary is the horse, which is pretty cheep anyways, and if you're patient enough, you can save up around 10,000 gold for one anyways."
Positive,I really like this game very much. I'm glad that its buy to play so it is awesome!!! I do recommend this game to you!
Positive,"To keep it short, simple, and sweet: This is a fantastic game."
Positive,"Three or so days in. I can say that for the money, especially if its on discount, there wont be to many games with the amount of content this provides."
Positive,I love the customization of your character as you level. So much more personal than any other MMORPG
Positive,"GOD i love this game. hands down best mmo to evr come out. it got dragon, sword, and bow"
Positive,"There's a bit of a steep learning curve, particularly with the crafting. But there are enough quest chains to keep you busy for months."
Positive,If only there were SEA server it would be super amazingFor us SEA players.... but all in all amazing game!
Positive,"With the switch to B2P, there is no reason to not buy this game if you are an MMO fan.I've played countless MMOs, literally, I have lost count. Tons of them out there.This may be the best MMO I've ever played, and I don't say that lightly.And for the last time, this is not Skyrim Online you faking nooblets.9/10(Needs dueling and an auction house)"
Positive,"This is possibly one of my favourite games of all time. I haven't played a lot of MMO in the past, but I love the story telling, the friendly enviroment and endless hours of quests and exploring. Currently playing a dragon knight tank, but I like the fact I can play more than one character with a different class, and even though the quests are the same, the gameplay experience is totally different.Having played now for over 750 hours I decided to get ESO+ so I could use the craft bag and the DLC. Looking forward to Morrowind. It is totally optional whether you choose to subscribe.The only downside is the graphics will only work in pvp on lower settings which can reduce the experience a little, the animations can be a bit crude and the combat a little repetitive if you have a lower DPS setup. Also heartwood.Overall I would recommend this game. At first I was reluctant to pay £50 but now it is worth it (and a lot cheaper these days)."
Positive,"Let me start this review by saying that this is not Skyrim 2.0 Online. No, there aren't any dragons that can be shouted at. My review after 100 hours of gameplay:Beautiful looking worldLots of questsLots of craftingLots of possible builds (no holy 3 class trinity)No P2W (except maybe for the Imperial racial all microtransactions are cosmetic)Scaling Dungeons Seperate PVP zoneUpdates on a regular basisPoor standard UI (can be solved with addons though)No traditional Auctionhouse (there are guildmarkets however)Beefy download (80gb+)Some bugs (freeze/crash during loading) 8/10"
Positive,"The Best Open World MMORPG game you will ever find! You can buy weapons,armor,pets,horses, you can even be a werewolf or a vampire!!! Lots of quests, lands, creatures,.. You can choose what you want to be, you can be either good or evil, you can help or destroy others, you can give or steal things. This is really the best game I ever played, It has everything you wish for! It has a few ""mistakes"" which I hope will be repaired in the future. I hope they also add Guild Houses and Player Housing and also some sort of ""npc friends"" which would follow you around and help you with your battle. I really recommend it to anyone that loves MMOs and RPGs."
Positive,"Currently the game offers a lot of player freedom due to the fact that it allows us to do any quest and explore anywhere without restriction, the best part that couples with this being the scaling of the quest/dungeons/monsters - are scaled to an extent so that you or your group are able to tackle it, excluding endgame stuff. I think that this is its biggest pros as it extremely elevate's the player's choices - not stuck on grinding one zone or area, which would be most MMOs out there. Boring. This then all boils down to the player being able to play this like skyrim or any other elder scrolls but with your friends, guild or solo for that fact.I believe that if you are an elder scrolls fan and mmorpg junkie, you should definitely give this a try since it incorporates most of the mechanics and builds on it. Note that this game was absolute trash, subscription based and the player level didnt scale before an update called One Tamriel. That time period absolutely tarnished its reputation and i believe the game's current state is definitely a worth it buy!"
Positive,LET ME OUT
Positive,"you can visit Vivecs bedroom and dance on his corpse. Although you cannot sit on his stupid face but at least if you just leave the quest alone at that point, he stays dead and its great"
Positive,if u like any of the elder scrolls series you will like this game. As an mmo it has loads of content.
Positive,"Started ESO recently and its the Elder Scrolls experience I wanted. No in depth review, yet, just that I am having a lot of fun."
Positive,if you like MMORPG games and youre a kind off a hardcore gamer you should try it
Positive,"So, here's the experience from someone who bought the game and played through the weekend where folks were having trouble. I got the onsale Morrowind pack. For context, old-school gamer with multiple MMO experience, starting with MUDs back in the day. I've played the Elder Scrolls from Morrowind onwards as well.No login issues. Smooth sailing. The most beautiful MMO I've ever played (got some screenshots public if you want to look). Combat is fun, fluid and inuitive, but also complex enough to keep you on your toes (better than Skyrim hands down). The crafting system, which is usually a chore in other games, is immersive and engaging. There's a large, helpful population, and the towns always feel full. And the questing... my god they've got excellent writers. Everything is voice acted as well, creating a sense of immersion that I've only ever encountered in single player games. The dynamic leveling / challenge system is excellent - I didn't like the way it was implemented back in the day with Oblivion, but it's perfect here - allowing you to really explore the enormity of Tamriel right off the bat. The combat is still challenging, and will kill you if you don't keep on your toes, so it never feels like things are nerfed down to your level.Exploring is a big part of this game, moreso than any other MMO I've played. There's an entire skill line (Mages Guild) that basically encourages you to go and search out every nook and cranny learning the lore of the land. Gripes? I wish they'd start you in your basic starting area instead of the DLC area (or give you a choice). I wanted to experience the core game from the beginning and it can take a bit of travel to get hooked into the main storyline. Final verdict? This feel and breathes like a living world, and 20+ years of development into the lore and history really shows. From a technical standpoint, the MMO is extremely well built, the skill system is fluid and non-conformist, and the graphics are freaking out of the this world. 10/10 - best money I've spent on a game in a long time. Well worth full price - I feel lucky that I got it at $10."
Positive,"get it on sale, a large amount of playtime of mine are loading screens and leaving the launcher on. loading screen times can be depressingly long if it's crowded, sometimes, you'll have to load multiple times in a crowded area as the initial load was sloppy. download it during a free weekend just to be safe if you're keen on getting it on steam, it's large.there are times where you'll have unusual high ping, it's a common issue that just happens in specific regions, an example would be AUS players suffering from lag while everyone else is fine, then shifts to another region and all NA players will be affected and AUS players are not. the issue differs from NA and EU, though, you'll need to rededicate on playing separate servers which isn't encouraging as the loading screens may be horrible during the time and doubles your playtime requirements.base game is decently large, contains morrowind and may include summerset once the elsweyr chapter is out, you'll obviously need to get it separately if you plan on getting it now. recommend getting it on a sale as well and wait for reviews as the servers are quite bad imo as it degrades on each update and maintainence, enjoyable as a single player with an added bonus of dungeons. it'll honestly be great if there was a ES that's constantly supported, but it's online and held back by the engine required to be a mmo and technical limitations as a sacrifice. role playing is optional, but tiresome and cringy in my opinion.eso+ is skooma, get it if you have no real life or are in retirement, if not, I'd recommend not and be social by asking for help in crafting needs with a side of inventory management, no need to collect and hoard all materials, just tedious for new players. skooma is a viable option once you hit 50 and cp of 160.recommend getting  minion [minion.mmoui.com] because the defaults are near useless in game by either lacking information or not perfect as in typical bethesda fashion. it'll take awhile to startup everytime and usually comes with a firewall warning at first, but the consecutive run will do it fine for some people."
Positive,its very nice
Positive,"-Elder Scroll-MMO-NO Sub fee-NO P2W -It can only get better-Kate BeckinsaleJust get it, its Elders Scrolls Oline!"
Positive,hehe Deadra go brrbrr
Positive,"Shittons of content. If you want a mmorpg with infinite things to do, this is the thing."
Positive,This one thinks the game is fun and worth playing.
Positive,"it's just like elder scrolls, but online"
Positive,"No subscription fees, straight forward and easy to understand system. Voice acting for npc's is a must for realism in games. Wonderful community."
Positive,"Without a doubt, this game gets a recommendation. This being my second MMO and with what it is now with all the quests, exploration, adventures and other stuff you really can not go wrong with buying this game. No sub, just initial purchase for hundreds of hours of fun. This is a definite-go from me!"
Positive,"I played this game for about 2 hours when it first released, and then got a refund.  It was that bad.  I decided to give it another shot after this passage of time and have not been disappointed.  I highly suggest giving this game another try if you are in the position of having played at release and seeing how terrible it was at that time.  It has improved very much, and being buy to play is a nice bonus, the subsciption option is totally unnecessary."
Positive,"One of the friendliest communities in gaming. A ton of content! Also a lot of DLC content, which varies in quality, but mostly it is worth the price, excluding the Dungeon DLC.Progression is relatively easy and if you know what you are doing, you won't need to spend a single dollar on microtransactions.Steam Achievements would be a great addition tho."
Positive,"This game is amazing with tons of things you can do. Adventuring across different lands, Party dungeons, raids with random people. One of the amazing features you can do in this game is to PvP. Guilds are a very cool feature too, you can go to your guild bank and take stuff that other guild members put in there, go into pvp with them and the amazing thing is that you can transform into a Werewolf or a Vampire. This game is definetely worth 60 USD."
Positive,Casual exploring in a beautiful world is a lot of fun!
Positive,"One of my all time favorite games, the endless content and endless future of the game is priceless. Thank you for many great friends and memories <3"
Positive,Scalie heaven. Truly beyond anything else. It is beyond your comprehension
Positive,Really been enjoying this game because of the online. I was really not into skyrim but came around to this game.
Positive,Why does it always freeze at the Launcher???? i really wanna play it but it keeps freezing.
Positive,"Pretty decent once you get the hang of the ability trees having their own separate progression line. Respecting is a bit of a nightmare, but if you follow a build you shouldnt have to move too much stuff around. End game gear is pretty easy to get if you farm dungeons for the stuff you need, and a good bit of stuff can be found doing public delves or world bosses. All in all probably 8/10. 9/10 with a friend"
Positive,Overall it  a fine game. shame it doesnt really  par to  Skyrim. But  i  guess it would be hard to do such as an MMO. Other issue is that   i got it  via Eso Online Site.  and  i would have to buy it again  here. but it seems you cant   link it.Besides such i rather  enjoy  the game  and just wish. the last item will be  ... fixed in the future.
Positive,"Like this game so much I own it on both consoles and on my PC.Pros- The combat, PVP content and PVE content.Cons- No voice chat on PC version and the devs do not enable you to transfer accounts from console to PC and don’t intend on recoding to enable that."
Positive,"I decided to change my review to something longer that doesn't need a tl;dr version but my original review was just a single word.The games is pretty cool, theres a pretty steep grind after level 10 or 15 imo but its fun and story rich enough to leep you interested. Pvp is fun, Pve is fun, Pvp co op is fun, Pve Co op is really fun(sorry for the redundantcy). The community is great and has a grreat sense of humor(reddit/4chan sense of humor). overall the game is pretty good and I'm enjoying it. Thats all I really wanted to say."
Positive,"For those who love the land of Tamriel and the stories of Nirn and the planes of Oblivion, this is seriously the ultimate when it comes to lore-building. It sadly doesn't have the same feel as the other beloved Elder Scrolls games but provides some much needed details to things only heard about in the mainstream games. Gameplay is kind of mixed, sometimes meh, sometimes action-filled, but fun. Animations can feel a bit stiff and repetitive. Usual monetization strategies show their faces without being paywalls or pay-to-win. Mostly cosmetics and DLC locations that usually have so much attention to them as an entire game. Many expansions are fun, best to wait until they're on sale, which many times they are! Unfortunately, some DLC locations can only be purchased in-game through the Crown Store, which is a premium currency store. If you subscribe, you'll have access to everywhere as long as your subscription is active. The game has changed dramatically since it's initial release. It has evolved into its own fantastic space to explore. I've been playing off and on since the Tamriel Unlimited release. I keep coming back."
Positive,Overall the game is really good and very entertaining I've never been hooked as much by a game as I have by this one
Positive,its not Skyrim but it will do until bethesda does better.
Positive,Great game dont litsen to the reviews.
Positive,so i bought this game twice one time on http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/ and then here on steam do i need to tell you more its fuckin awesome DÜDE... just buy it and have funZZon a scale from one to 10 i give it a solid 9 1/8 points thats pretty good for a mmo! right?good job BoyZ and Gurls

Positive,"Started playing shortly after release on XB1. It wasn't great from what I remember, and I became bored quickly. I just started over on PC, I have barely made it to level 10, and I'm already having a blast. Now... to convince my buddies to see what I see."
Positive,"We'll start out with the pros!Pros: Good Graphics, Well optimized for high FPS, Not P2W (Pay to win), Provides a well created traditional RPG feel while not just copying other RPGs, Made by excellent devs such as Bethesda and Havok!Cons: Repetitive gameplay, overpriced dlc thats adds very little, immense time required to progress!Overall Rating: 4.7 [] [] [] [] [_ (Squares) Excellently developed and addictive gameplay that offers a wonderful world full of fun and grinding! I highly reccommend this game if you are a fan o RPGs and the Skyrim world!"
Positive,"The game was expensive before and you'd feel the number of players were really few!!But now the players number has increased to tamriel unlimited and finally stopped the monthly subscription!! The game doesnt deserve 15$ a month . just have a problem of the server getting slower from the high number of players.but play this game now,it'll be fun."
Positive,"Started playing this game over two weeks ago after they dropped the sub fee, but I am paying the premium membership anyway to get the perks.  This game is amazing.  My character is now a VR2 and I am sinking my teeth into end game content.  There is just more and more to do, just overwhelming amount of content.  No need to grind if you enjoy the lore and story, but grinding is still viable and productive up to the veteran ranks.  The vet ranks are broken right now, but they will get rid of them eventually now that the champion system is in place.  It just sucks though because to be competetive in pvp, you need to get to your VR14 rank which is almost impossible with the nerfed xp for vet ranks right now.  Other than that, wonderful game mechanics, graphics are outstanding, and story is pretty good.  To be honest though, once May 19th gets here, I will be playing nothing but the Witcher 3, but this game has fullfilled my rpg itch in the meantime."
Positive,If your a DIe Hard ES fan like me i highly recommmend getting this game! the combat might not be like skyrim. it is mostly like every other MMO game. but with their new patch they added a criminal systerm which adds bountys when you steal and kill! And the combat was changed a little bit. otherwise I think it has a great storyline and plenty of quest to do. You'll never go bored with this game or have nothing to do! theres always something to do! like i said the combat isnt like skyrim but most everything else is! If you do decide to buy this game I wish you safe adventures and have loads of fun!
Positive,Fun. Scale Impressive. Easy to get swamped in side quests. Only accept one at a time.
Positive,great community and filled with lore
Positive,This game makes me forget to masturbate...
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls® OnlineIt truely is a fun experience, with lots of Quests, storyline and also action and typical MMO pvp/eIf you have friends to play with, give it a go.. but it does get lonely time after time.Game is still a charm and would advise you to get it :)"

Positive,"As another review was written by another person.. I must agree with him on this:""I would highly recommend this game and see myself putting in many more hours"".*** This game has pretty much all that a MMO RPG needs. Graphics are great, story/questing is so well built, community is friendly/helpful and .. the items.. there are just soooo many variations of everything! Customizing options for character builds are realy flexible.***The prices on ingame purchases are modest.One doesn't need to buy the DLC's to have fun, there is so much to do!I also played BETA, I didn't like the game that much atall back then, but I must admit, alot has changed and they've done  good work on it.-Totally improved ALOT since BETA.9/10 - Would love to have a ""arena"" type of PvP added to the game."
Positive,"Initially, my first experience of the game was in beta. I despised it, all the hype died for me in the beta. I don't know why that is, perhaps I just really dislike the Covenant ""Starter Island"". It felt bland and empty, especially compared with my experience of the other two factions start locations. There was also issues with combat and how weightless it feels and plenty of other minor problems.A lot of people also disliked it on its first release, and I can see why. When I played it on release, the game felt incredibly grindy, there were major balance issues and the weight of hitting shit hadn't been fixed. Not to mention a lack of options, we didn't have the ability to steal things, and no ""Justice"" system.A fair amount of time later, and the game is substantially improved. We have a justice system, the ability to steal shit, a nice crafting system and combat is far more enjoyable now. The removal of shitty  subscription and replacing it with the crown store was a great decision (They need that server money after all) and yeah, I'll edit this at somepoint and actually finish this review, but for now, lazyness wins out, so fuck ya'll"
Positive,"I spoke to a elf then i was tasked with eatting a frog so i found it and ate it, then spoke to a tree, then went out and killed a pack of wolfs >found a sword in one< then i lit a fire then i spoke to a ghost tree, then i went and killed a bunch of ghost wasps, then i saw chat then basicly, >random1: Hi >random2: your gay, then i stole a armoy of weapons and child toys then i sold them, then a got a horse, then i was killed by a big eye that spawned on me, The end"
Positive,"EDIT Dec. 20th: I decided to give ESO another chance, and after a couple dozen hours I'm revising my review. I think my main problem at the time of my last review was that I was treating it like any other MMO, and it is not that. ESO is... well, an Elder Scrolls game, just multiplayer. You can go where you want, do what you want, and the only limitations to either is the selection of abilities your chosen class gets, and whether or not you're equipped to handle what you're fighting. I haven't had so much freedom handed to me in an MMO since Star Wars Galaxies, and for me even a passing comparison to SWG is high praise. If you've got the money and you're looking for a really unique MMO experience, I'd strongly recommend it.ESO has come a long way since launch, unfortunately it went a long way in the wrong direction. Even by MMO standards the game is boring, the combat is clunky at best, and it feels like the whole affair was crapped out by a focus group rather than being the ultimate experience in a legendary RPG series. I've given the game every chance to capture me the way even Skyrim, as dumbed down as it was, did and it just doesn't. If you want a solid fantasy MMO, go play WoW or even dig up a private server for Everquest, either one would be a much more entertaining use of your time.EDIT Jul 31: I want to say that I'm very touched a Bethesda representative felt the need to reach out to address my review and ask for direct feedback, unfortunately that wouldn't be very productive. The reasons I don't recommend ESO have to do with the way the game functions and it would require some fairly drastic changes for my opinion to change. I don't enjoy the game, I don't personally recommend it, and there's nothing wrong with that because at the end of the day, no game is ever going to appeal to everyone, and that's just the way things are."
Positive,This game has come a long way since its been released. This game is well worth putting the time into.
Positive,i quit wow recently and decided to check this game out and im so glad i did. this game is better than world of warcraft
Positive,The Elder Scrolls game dont need anything to prove good....they are always awsome
Positive,I feel like the number of hours at time of review is all you really need to know...
Positive,"I've been a fan of The Elder Scrolls series since Morrowind back on the old Xbox.  ESO When it first came out, I admit that I didn't like it but it is far better now and only gets better every update!"
Positive,"I have heard so much shit about this game so i decided that i  tried it myself. And i was disapointed, its NOT a shitty game, actually this game is fuginggg good. But i recomend to buy Gold edition, it bring SO much more good things in this game. (Update, I have no life 1k hour now... is gud tho)"

I played it a multiple of times throughout the last 3 to 3.5 years. The stories were enjoyable and it was pretty cool to see the different zones. Once I got into the combat, I had fun with it. However, after some time, I began getting bored with the combat as it started to feel dull, even when I created new characters to try out new classes. It did a while for me to get bored with it though. Other aspects of the game, such as the mount training system and the vast majority of mounts being locked to the crown store, began to annoy me. With all of this, I eventually stopped playing the game. Even so, I had many hours of entertainment with this game and there is a lot of content that I did not even play yet. I recommend picking up this game if you’re looking for a new MMO to play or are an Elder Scrolls fan. However, I advise trying out the game during a free trial whenever it’s available again to see if you like the combat. I will probably return to the game in the future and I hope to see the developers continue improving the game. Update 1: It's been about 4-5 years since I played this game and a lot has changed. There's a lot of new content and several systems were changed for the better. While mount training still takes 6 months, it now resets at the daily reset time instead of 20 hours, meaning you can do the training anytime during the day. Several of my other complaints seem to have been taken care of, including there being more earnable mounts. I will continue playing this game and will update it again in the future. At the moment, I definitely recommend taking a look at this game."
Positive,"There is no more robust fantasy RPG out there than this one. The quality of the quests, the beauty of the landscape, the amazing music, the intricate customization, makes ESO a joy not just to play but to experience.  10/10"
Positive,"It is not Skyrim. It feels like it, and plays like it, but it's not it. I still enjoy it very much and its worth a shot if caught on sale."
Positive,skyrim online that works :D
Positive,I love this game but you will never complete it 100%
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online gives a rich history and story lines within the quests helping you to enjoy playing it. I am a builder type individual and the crafting system allows me to develop my skills to whatever level I wish to play at. The character classes are also very customizable by type or even within the type to suit your play style. While I do recommend ESO premium account for the benefits it provides, you can  do the free to play."
Positive,"I have played this game loads, i know it says i haven't- it's because i use the launcher from the site, my steam one is dodgey! I playeed the beta for teso ages ago and i enjyed it, but it was too pricey and something just felt missing. But now with Tamriel Unlimited, the game feels incredible! the combat is weighty now and it's just polsihed overall! eally enjoy the quests, side quests will often lead on to be massive, wehereas some are small- i enjoy this mix! it's great to know i don't have a pressure to keep playing to get my moneys worth, not that i've stopped anyway! highly reccomend :)"
Positive,"I'm playing the free weekend, but definitely getting this one, the story is rich, a world one can live completelly, and enjoy for months. The parts of The Elder Scrolls story I was missing."
Positive,"In ESO you get part of the Skyrim feel combined with the fun of World of Warcraft. I'm not heavily into mmorpgs, becauseI find that most have very repetitive quests and grinding gets boring. In ESO all the quests are pretty unique and different. The Tamerial Unlimited update made the game worth the price and added some much needed features that make getting loot and leveling up easier."
Positive,"Good clean MMO. for the record i do enjoy the Elder Scrolls Emersion Games but i do enjoy playing a good MMO. I have played my fair share of mmo's this one is completely got me, the AvA combat system. pure enjoyment of the great story telling that you would see in previous Elder Scrolls, and a great crafting system which is better then 3/4's of the mmo's in past. yes their is a few bugs but i am really shock at the company's first crack of a game of this quality. i expected alot more issues and bugs but there are few i ran across so far. Gaming Mechanics are very smooth and set up quite nice skills and traits are very user friendly, an their is no real need to search for a cookie cutter build is this. You will adapt your toon to your play style with easy. In a whole if you love a good mmo, this is the one to look at."

Positive,"Great game, amazing community. They had a very rough start, but they pretty much fixed every issue I initially had with the game.I would recommend buying through their site over Steam, as the Steam login issue still exists. But even then, it's rare."
Positive,Honestly on PS4 I played this game at first release and thought it was dreadful. I looked up some videos on it and pc was looking good so i decided to get into this game on my computer and was very happy with my purchase only about 25hours into this game and i'm only in glenumbra at level 32. This game keeps getting bigger and better and is honestly worth the buy if you're into mmorpg's this one is a very high recommend.
Positive,"After getting over a thousand hours into this game and playing many other mmorpgs I decided I will update my review. I have been playing this game for years now and I still always find myself coming back to it; I love the world. The Siege PvP is a lot of fun with armies of players fighting for control of the land. The CP system is still flawed but that will be updated soon and should fix it; just PvP with no CP until then.  This game personally has my favorite dungeons; they are very western mmo like WoW. The vet dungeons can also be extremely challenging which I love.The customization is awesome; all the ways you can create your own build  that lets you feel very unique compared to every player. In general the customization is far better than any other game; from how you look to how you play you will not be anything like anyone you see. If you do come across a player that looks like you, you should screen shot it XD.If you RP I highly recommend ESO; This is in the universe of  single player role playing games and Zenimax/Bethesda knows their fan base. They are constantly adding emotes, clothing, a really good housing system; and in general many things in that regard. You can find many guilds for RP or anything really; you are also not stuck with just one guild you can be in many.The game does have one con for me that I hope they fix, that is the open world though has many challenges such as world bosses and anchors; the open world is way to easy. The open world is a main focus with so many great and voiced quests but when you know you're going to almost one shot the bad guy it can kill it a bit.They need to add a system that is like SWTOR where you can adjust the difficult level; maybe add a higher drop chance for purple gear or a few more gold for motivation.Anyway I highly recommend"
Positive,"ESO is something special, it is hecka tight and super tasty as hell. I would recommend to my friends moms family and dead relatives, but I wouldn't recommend to my family cause they would outcast me. See it starts all starts at the age of 13 in the summer of 2003, I met this girl named Lucy at a doom competition and we hit off, I thought Lucy was the one until one fateful day when she installed ESO on to her Windows 2000 desktop. At the time this was one of the latest and greatest games to have come out and she had me hella hyped. Lucy and I ended up playing this game for the entirety of summer break and I couldn't stop the addiction and this is where it all hit, I realized that I was bare naked in computer chair and my power had just been cut off, Lucy screamed and begged that I should stop playing this game but I bought a laptop and ended up on the streets drifting from McDonald's to Starbucks Cafe's. Dear friend when you have something special do not let it go, unless its the world of ESO, I can confidently recommend this game to anyone but my family, and Lucy if you are reading, baby I love you please find me at the Starbucks."
Positive,"""connection to the server timed out"" - One of the worst experience I have had the pleasure of. EDIT ----If you are getting server timeout while linking steam in-game then go to ESO website and link steam from there. Game managed to connect to servers now.Let's talk about the game now. As soon as I completed basic tutorial, I came across a guy roaming around who I added in game.He taught me some things about the game and we went on quest hunting together. As we completed our 1st quest together, we found 1 more guy who we also added to party and we went dragon areans.Defeated so many monsters for 2 hours straight, it was so much fun...GooD Game, might buy it after free week..."
Positive,"I came to ESO after playing Skyrim, Oblivion, and Morrowind. I loved the games for their amazing story telling and the ability to create your own fun out of the the massive fantasy worlds that you were placed in. I wasn't sure what to expect, but ESO did not dissapoint me at all. The game is built so well that if you were to play it completely solo you wouldn't have any complaints! It almost feels like the game was designed to be played solo, but then they added multiplayer and co-op dungeons/trials/world bosses/etc just to put the icing on the cake. I went into this game a hard critic and came out enjoying absolutely every piece of its content. Heck, even the crafting is fun... and I didn't enjoy crafting in any of the other Elder Scrolls titles."
Positive,"The best RPG I´ve ever played. I got 500+ hours on the game and still numbers are going up. This game is so good that you can´t even imagine. Choose a race and class you want to play, fight like a warrior wielding staff or as a mage tanking and tauting everyone to fight you !  Everybody should try it out. You wont regret it.8/10Pros- Rich story, 200+ hours of main story of three aliances, 25+ hours of heroe´s own story and 400+ more hours with DLC´S and you can get them free if you play the GAME, - lot of NPC´s with unique stories of their own- Coop- massive multiplayer featuring PVP and PVE events- beautiful graphics- Cons- If you want everything and full-experience you must pay little more ( because DLC´s are marvelous and their stories too but the price is ehm... double times than basic game but still you can find good deal on sales"
Positive,"I quit WoW for this.  I am entirely satisfied with my decision.  If you are dissatisfied with WoW, come here.  The grass IS greener.For more detailed review, recommend  by famous WoW personality Az from HeelVsBabyface who himself declares ESO as a superior game (in his subjective opinion).  While one may seek objectivity when making a switch, it's a game, dude.  A good game, but a game."
Positive,"If you played this game at launch, be warned: This is apparently a completely different game from that one. Everything I have heard about ESO at launch sounds like a lot of rage-quitting.It's a much more approachable, but complex, game now, with quality DLC and expansions being made. There have been some hiccups with servers from Steam talking to Zenimax nicely, and one could wish that the Crown Store items were either a little cheaper or featured less rather simplistic reskins.  Apart from those complaints, though, the game is fun, and there can be nice lovely pockets of people.There are plenty of asses, of course, but by and large the community is a decent one.  There's a reason this game is now often cited as the second most popular MMO behind WoW."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online or ESO is an open world MMO game set in the universe of Tamriel, which is the same universe as the rest of the Elder Scrolls games. ESO, however, is very very different to those games. If you plan on buying this game because you want to play Skyrim online, I would recommend looking elsewhere (maybe mods?) However, if you want to play a game with a highly developed community focused MMO with basically endless content and head spinning amounts of complexity then this is the game for you. I would highly recommend this game as I've played over 1000 hours and still greatly enjoy this game but with that being said here's basically everything you could ever know, good and bad, about ESO.TL;DR at the endThe graphics in this game can be absolutely beautiful and I've taken a number of screenshots and used them as wallpapers. Sometimes you come across these vistas of landscape that are so detailed and beautiful that it blows you away. There are many dungeons in this game and each one has it's own unique style. Alongside that, there are a number of zones or regions in the game and, just like with the dungeons, they follow a theme and style that is unique and there is rarely a piece of furniture or coloration that looks out of place. The bad things about the graphics are the character models and the bugs. Sometimes you will be talking to an NPC and their face will not match what they're saying or they will be making gestures that are laughablly bad. Graphical bugs also occur pretty regularly, but these are usually caused by players, such as  a player running while on a mount. Thankfully the only world based graphical bugs are usually revolving around item clipping, where an item that is supposed to sit on top of something will just phase through it.  The sound design in this game is pretty superb. The tracklist is so varied that I still occasionally hear bard songs that I haven't heard before. Like with the graphics, the music changes in each dungeon and region. There are occasionally some songs that you will hear over and over again but after a thousand hours I can confidently say that the music is great. There are even some songs that I sing along to myself all the time. Red Diamond, Red Diamond, the heart and soul of Man!  The gameplay is where this game really shines. The amount of content is quite literally endless. There are 16 dungeons in the base game, some of which have two parts which are wholly unique. Then there are the veteran versions which add a higher level of challenge. Then there are Trials, which are late game mega-dungeons. Then you have delves which are mini-dungeons that can be done solo. There are four to six delves per zone and there are about 22 zones in the base game. Each zone is also massive so if you're an explorer then you have a ton of area to work with. Then there's the hundreds of quests. If you are starting to add up the numbers you can see, there is a near endless amount of content. I have about four characters and over 1000 hours in the game and I would say I have played about 40% of what the game has to offer. There is also housing, which you can purchase with in game gold, or actual money if you feel like it and you can craft or purchase furniture to decorate your house with. There is only 4 classes but each class has skills that you can ""morph"" which change how they work dramatically, so in reality it's more like 16 classes because you can play each one as a magic damage dealer, stamina damage dealer, tank or healer. The beautiful thing about the way your character works is that you can play him or her however you want and you will probably still be effective, outside of late game trials and veteran dungeons. I would say the only gripes I have with this game are the same gripes I have with all MMO's, the controls and inventory management. Your skills are mapped to 1-5, which can be annoying to use unless you change the keybindings or have an MMO mouse. The inventory management is another thing that can be really annoying. Space is usually very limited and if you plan on being a crafter your inventory will almost always be full. Plan on picking and choosing what to pick upPvP in this game is great in some ways and not so great in others. Cyrodiil, a massive warzone where you can have huge battles of upwards of a hundred people on each side, is nothing less than awesome. In Cyrodiil, the goal is to capture and keep points of interest, such as forts and castles, and it does not end until the end of a season. Riding in a ""zerg"" or a massive group of players and taking a fort by seiging it down is some of the most fun I've ever had in this game. Battlegrounds, a smaller quicker game mode, is also great fun and fast paced. Having good gear helps to win but knowing your abilities is much better. The only thing that sucks is that you will probably have to get most of your gear from PvE. The major issues with PvP come from the developers. There have been many bugs with PvP that were just ignored for months. Sometimes item sets become ridiculously strong and the devs don't address it for several patches. Alongside these issues, people have been complaining that they don't get any real rewards from playing PvP and they could make way more money or get better item sets by playing PvE instead. If you plan on playing PvP, the only real reward you will get is the fun of it. The good thing is that the developers have been slowly trying to fix these issues. Recently they added some nice rewards that are exclusive to battlegrounds and Cyrodiil but it is still definitely more rewarding, in an MMO sense, to just play PvE. Zenimax Online Studios, or ZOS, is generally hated by the community and with understandable reasoning. I would argue that they are doing a solid job but I'll discuss everything they have done and let you decide. Almost completely ignoring major issues in PvP is really just the start. There have also been major bugs that affect PvE as well and they have gone unchanged in patch notes that would rather discuss the next round of cosmetic items that you can purchase with real money instead. On top of this they came under fire recently for installing spyware in a patch and not telling anyone about it. They later clarified that it was just being used to determine origin points of new players to better plan advertising but not telling the community about it was obviously not a good choice. Then there's the issues with Steam login. Every month or so there will be a time period where people who purchased the game on Steam will just not be able to log in. They have been trying hard to fix many of the issues the community brings up but they simultaneously push monetization hard. The good thing is that they are putting out some pretty awesome content. The two expansions have been great and the dungeon DLC they have been putting out has been innovative and challenging.Game Score: 9/10Pros: Endless content Great character balance Graphics and sound are fantastic Story is really good in most cases Community is very strong  Developers are actively trying to listen to the community and fix issues and are putting out good contentCons: Developers push monetization hard and have made some shady decisions Graphical bugs can take you out of the game at times PvP takes a major backseat to PvE The sheer amount of stuff in this game can be daunting at times"
Positive,someone make an addon that fixes cyrodil crashing
Positive,great mmo game only downside in pve stuff is extremely easy except vet dung etc. so if you are casual player you will love it on the other hand pvp is big challenge and unique.
Positive,"I'll admit I hadn't expected this game to pull itself out of the dumpster fire it threw itself into upon release in 2014. It has come a long way since then. I've only put in about a dozen hours so far, but I have loved every single minute of it. The quests are not your typical MMO, ""Go here, kill some number of these things, come back, collect reward"" each quest feels interesting and natural. I find myself walking through the world excited to see the markers for new quests because they are so much fun. The voice acting for each and every character is pure joy upon the ears. It isn't your typical MMO, while there are skills to be used, the skill tree is definitely nothing in comparison to something like WoW. It's an inviting first time MMO, not too complicated and with simple controls and mechanics. I think at this point it has finally delivered on its initial promise of being Skyrim, but with friends. I actually think that some elements are better than Skyrim and I hope that they will be incorperated into the next Elder Scrolls game, whenever it is released."
Positive,"The fact that I spent probably about 4 hours on a city sidequest and enjoyed most of it says a lot. The attention to the world and the characters are there, and the traditional eyeroll of a cast isn't which is pretty refreshing.Usually I just play mmorpgs for the hit sword against things and get gear, but I find myself slowing down and reading the text in the quests, granted not all of it because its an absolute wall, but enough to understand whats happening and to care about the characters involved.Every part of the game is interesting, the only eyeroll is how big the map is sometimes without a mount. But the map is by no means empty, there are unique boss creatures, bandit hideouts, people needing help, all spread throughout the map which makes it feel alive. It rewards exploration and doesn't punish the player for just walking around and looking at the pretty scenery or thinking ""oh i wanna go kill THAT"".The game knows what I want to do as a player, and I truly truly respect that and it's very validating."
Positive,"I have now tried all of the class' and they are all fun. The graphics are very good and for such an old game there are A LOT of players online at any given time, very impressive.The stories are fun and its nice that most of the quests are quite short, very convenient if you can't be online for long.It is by far on the role playing side of mmorpgs with all of the intricate crafting and how you place your skills, but easy enough to catch on.What is discouraging for me is seeing other players at over level 1000, I think one time I even saw a level 2000+ so it seems like I am forever far from whatever end game this might offer. Another negative is even with so many players, there is not much social talking going on. I am looking forward to choosing what class I want to stick with and try out some groups."
Positive,"Love the Elderscrolls lore so if your the same as me, you will probably enjoy this game and all the references to past gods and so on. Game still needs a lot of polishing, bought it on sale at £33, probably not worth the full ammount in its current state but with future improvements it should only get better"
Positive,"First a little background: I LOVE Skyrim. I practically live there. I used to pretty much live in WoW's Azeroth but I got jaded with the whole subscription MMO thing - nothing you did made much difference to the world, & you'd likely get killed by a pack of mobs you'd just killed respawning before you'd had time to heal from the previous battle. I lot faith in MMOs - the subscription thing just made it apparent to me that the art & entertainment aspect of gaming was becoming very much a secondary or even tertiary thing, falling behind making big money out of a lot of gullible people.So when the ESO beta happened, I was interested but jaded, and wow, did it ever have a lot of bugs. Fair enough, it was a beta test, but they went live so quickly after that they didn't have any time to address bugs, and at what £15/month? It was way too much to ask. I honestly couldn't recommend a game that cost you nearly £250 to play in its first year - and the quests were dull, and the lag such that you could be dead & not know it, killed by a dozen mobs you couldn't see because they hadn't spawned in your client yet. It was execrable - I'd not seen worse, and I'm an old guy, I've been gaming since Pong and to quote Blade Runner ""I've... seen things... you people wouldn't believe"" - but yeah, this game, at release, was one of the worst attempts I'd seen in ages, and worse yet they were ruining my beloved ESO franchise. Remember, I f'ing LOVED Skyrim.So, what's changed? Firstly, it's a one-off buy to play model now. Your first year now costs 1/5 what it previously did. The drops from mobs have increased. This is a big deal folks. Back in the beta, horses cost $HUGEAMOUNTS & boss mobs dropped 1 gold if you were very lucky. At that rate, grinding for gold to get your horse could take you till you're in your retirement home complaining about the crappy brain interface the latest version's got. No - NOW we have ordinary mobs dropping up to 6 gold, and often enough a piece of armour or a weapon. You can craft useful stuff, and farm mining or woodwork or cloth-making to generate yet more cash. That horse is just a few weeks away now. Also, quests are part of an ongoing story - you evacuate an island that's being invaded, and defeat a siege back on the mainland, and it affects what mobs and NPCs are available in any given area at any time. Some mobs actually turn neutral when you've defeated the boss that was riling them up against you - so, e.g. there's a bunch of skeletons defending a dragon priest's shrine, once you defeat the necromancer who's controlling them they sort of mill about ignoring you unless you start a fight with them. This makes sense, far better than WoW in that regard. What you do affects things around you.Also: crime! You can make crime pay, & frankly most of my characters do engage in it a bit at the start. You begin with some very basic gear but you can sneak about & nick bits & pieces off the market. These will get confiscated if you're arrested. If discovered in the act of committing a crime, civilians & guards will attack you unless you surrender. If you run away, it'll be ages till they forget your misdeeds & you can safely interact with them again. One of my early nightblades got caught pickpocketing: I had to kill the victim, & the guards came after me so I ended up in the wilderness for days till my bounty faded to nothing.If you're wise, you'll find the outlaws' sanctuary. This is a lot like the thieves' guild in Skyrim's Riften. They'll fence stolen gear for you, you can pay off your bounty if you have one, and they'll even ""launder"" stolen items so that you won't lose that sweet helm or sword when you next get caught. Good way to get a 250 gold piece helmet for 15 gold!Now, I hope that gives you the impression I'm trying to give here - from an awful, awful beta that was released too early & too overpriced, it's become an involving and immersive game with quests that make sense & make you feel part of the action. Many of the bugs have been ironed out, and lag is rarely an issue any more. From being frankly disgusted at Zenimax's fairly pathetic offering, I'm now genuinely impressed & glad that they dropped the subscription & glad I bought this game. Well worth £50 & 80Gb of HD space."
Positive,"The game is nothing like back in 2014, unlike most MMOs which get worse every year (WoW) ESO actually continues to surprise players with amazing content. There's always something to do and the DLC areas and expansions are well made and worth the money."
Positive,"Now that the monthly subscription is gone I bought the full priced game. WOW! I am not disappointed so far. Even though this is an MMO but I can surely play side and story quest on my own, also no server drops, graphical conflicts and great game play. I am still waiting for controller support, but that won’t take long to add so I'll wait for it. Worth $60."
Positive,I actually completed the main story :0
Positive,"Fast Based combat, Massive Lands, Tons of quests, good community, what's not to like?"
Positive,"the game is fun and its enjoyable to play here and there, just kinda wish the combat would be upgraded. it reminds me of oblivion and i loved that game literally have quite a few hours into the game and favorite dlc will always be about sheogorath but Skyrim kinda made the combat better and now its just sort of stale to me. other than that i give it a 8 out of 10"
Positive,"Amazing quests and area designs are overshadowed by the awful combat.If they would redo the combat to try to make it better this would be my mmo of choice but alas its still the same after all these years.Seriously awful combat i cant emphasise that enough its like new world but worse ""shudders"""
Positive,"I pre-ordered this back in 2014. Went to my local Best Buy the morning of release and picked it up (Yeah it came in a box lol). Speaking of that box. Because the Collector's Edition came with a large statue and other things, the box is huge. Enormous for the box for a game. The game itself was great. I played it for quite a while, but for whatever reason it didn't grab me hold me there.Fast-Forward to earlier this year, when I decided to give it a shot again, I was blown away. Where to start. First, starting a character. It is so streamlined, easy to understand and lacks the chaos that I remember. It's a nice way to ease someone into the game. In fact, they've seemed to have streamlined the entire game. We're talking about an enormous amount of talent to allow players in this game to start questing in one place then shoot off to an entirely different continent and begin questing there, with your other quests patiently waiting where you started. On top of that, it doesn't matter where you go, it's your level! Your quests are always your level. There's no worrying about out-leveling your quests or missing out on hundreds of low level quests. This extends the game so much it's insane.Next huge thing, the sheer enormity of content they have added over the years! The world is absolutely huge, it's almost mind-blowing. I can have fun just wandering the world off of the roads or pathways. Collecting resources for crafting, since you can level all crafts if you wish to. I can spend hours just doing that alone.To end this, since it's getting very long, the *entire game* is voice acted. It's incredible. Should you play? Yes. Now. Go play it. Shoo."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls series is a tried-and-true formula for fantastic fun and TES:O is a great element in the collection. Arguably, it's the only title that has received regular updates in recent years and Bethesda actually has been releasing new TES games in a regular basis in the form of updates to TESO.I can't really argue its qualities in comparison to the other major online MMORPGs. I tried WOW and I would say that TESO is a significantly better world, IMO. At least I felt much more at home and like it was more diverse and dynamic. Allegely the FFO recent title is very good but I don't feel like investing into yet another set of mechanics right now, what I know is that TESO is very good, it has a boatload of content and it's here and mature.Thus I recommend it."

Positive,you already know
Positive,5* for me
Positive,"I love this game and cannot speak highly enough about it. ESO offers the player the wonderful ability to be whatever they want to be, and do whatever they want to do within the game. I did a lot of research before I committed to buying it, and it is one purchase I have yet to regret! What surprised me the most out of everything this game holds value for, are the social connections I have made virtually. Working in teams, joining guilds and zone chats have all proven to be a surprisingly positive experience for me. As someone who loves working in a team, and learning from those more experienced than I, ESO allows me to virtually indulge in those activities, proving itself to be worth more than its weight in gold or crowns!"
Positive,"Not like all other moba's out there, this one is exceptionally done, purchases are fair and absolutely legitimate, not pay2play, the membership is also absolutely worth it. Nothing else to say."
Positive,"A variety of play styles, large open world, many different quests or objectives that are available to allow for easy leveling or play with friends, or solo."
Positive,Do you like Elder Scrolls? Do like endless grinding? Do you like playing an MMO solo like me? If you answered yes to any of these things just give them your money. 😊
Positive,"One of my favorite fantasy worlds in MMORPG form , whats not to like .Easy to pick up and play and rewarding combat ."
Positive,A huge and wonderful world to explore!
Positive,"Must say, with letency problem that this game have around SEA and Australia. It's rather frustrating when doing group stuffBut I'm focus on leveling and actually learning the game at my own pace. It's not GREAT, great per se but it is engaging"
Positive,you can chop wood
Positive,WOTLK HYPE WOTLK HYPE
Positive,"Eh, it's not bad. Comparing ESO to MMOs, it's a 4/10, but that's a result of being spoiled by WoW/FFXIV and having played STO, BDO, EVE, LOTRO, Runescape, EQ, DAOC, etc. I wish Steam had a ""meh"" option, because ESO has some positives and you can enjoy things. But it's also incongruous and jarring sometimes.If you've already hit the endgame, the expansion/chapters are much more enriched and generally better than the old/original content. But that New Player Experience is going to be rough. If you haven't played ESO before, check you're buying the Collection/Full version, as Expansions are ""chapters"", so you have to check if you need the 'collection' (all content expansions) or 'upgrade' (just the DLC/expansion on top of your base game), as it's not very clear that it's DLC/Chapter expansions. I've done this with ESO and FFXIV, so it's not impossible to be stuck. I don't really recommend the game itself. You need to be a real fan of Bethesda/TES and have zero expectations. Some of the game is fantastic and intriguing. But, it's also surrounded by a tepid standard of gameplay and a fair amount of work/grind. I recommend this if you can drag friends in to suffer the levelling process with you. But, if you're going to do that, pick a better MMO. Comparing it to modern games is a mistake though, since this was likely intended to match or resemble Morrowind's 20 year old graphics for Console compatibility. As a result, it's got that credible ""Bethesda"" quirky/janky feel, where you get low-res textures and 'dead'/empty zones, and oddly spaced/arranged zone mobs. That's okay when it's a single player game with time and mods to spruce things up, but you can't unsee the jankiness when going into cities or finding quest items and clickables. It has improved... but like all Bethesda games, all that effort can be ruined by dull questing/PvE in the new player experience."
Positive,"Great game to lose your self in a adventure world where you are the main protagonist and making friends, hard decisions, and developing your character"
Positive,Great MMO i just wish PVP performance was better at prime time its one of my favourite things to do in ESO and unfortunately its unplayable anytime after 5pm GMT.. a real shame! PC EU
Positive,"If you enjoy Skyrim, you will 100% enjoy this game. It has basically taken the game of Skyrim and made it so that you can play with your friends, and see where the stories and folklore come from"
Positive,"The Taste test from steam is really neat, and when I played it for a few hours, I was hook, not just because it was free for a few days but I was hook with the side quest that is not just side quests, it's more like a novel that you can pick up and read for a few hours until it's finish :3"
Positive,"I've heard this game described as many things; ""Skyrim online,"" ""Elder Scrolls in one game,"" ""fashion simulator,"" etc. They're all correct. The Elder Scrolls Online is a game about what you want to get out of it. I love how it has simple overworld PvE contrasted with challenging trials. Arena based PvP contrasted with open-zone objective PvP in Cyrodiil. The entire combat system can be navigated without much thought or it can be min/maxxed to obtain the highest DPS. Not only does the combat give you what you want out of it, but the rich game-world and storytelling as well. If you're a sucker for lore, there is plenty - nay, an abundance of lore to delve into. Dungeons tell a story and within those dungeons you find lorebooks of tales long forgotten or even some familiar from previous Elder Scrolls games. The world changes around you as you progress through stories and persists until you make a change again. But what if you're not interested in story or combat? This is where it gets great. This game is so multifaceted bringing a rich player-owned housing system, a cardgame mini-game, treasure hunting, thieving, scrying, fishing, and much more to list. There is something for anyone to enjoy here. Just don't get lost in how huge the world is and how much there is to do."
Positive,"Good game, played years ago, started playing again. Still good, even better. Good game indeed"
Positive,Ngl them lizzard ppl be chill afffthey be giving me shrooms to help enlighten my path
Positive,Started E Dating a dark elf last week. We have a dungeon date tonight
Positive,I like the Elder Scrolls Universe and Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) has evolved quite a bit over the years and has added a ton of great content. I feel like the updates and tweaks to the game over the years has all been positive.
Positive,The pure MMO experience with a heavy splash of lore and story. I love that all the NPC's have full voice acting attached to them and your environment reacts to what quests you do. I love farming for rare colors and items to flex in front of my guild mates. Also you never forget your first dragon fight <3
Positive,"This games graphics are great. I would rate 7/10. The lack of present story line is frustrating as a new player. Finding the main story line was nearly impossible unless you look it up and or know people who play. Even then, the story takes maybe 3 hours to complete. I like the housing options but wish it did not cost 100$ in real life to get a cool house. (I own a few) Combat and skill tree are great and in depth. Dungeons are immersive and fun. More fun to play with friends."
Positive,"Really love the game. Now playing it over 1 year and still having fun with all the content. Zenimax is bringing every year new content and there are a lot events within the game you can join. Its great to play alone or with friends or also with strangers you can meet in the game. :)1 or 2 times per year its possible to play the game free and if you like it I recomment to buy the base game with the DLC together. Take a good look at the description at the different versions on Steam, but it says clearly what in which version is included and what not.I think ESO Plus very useful, but not necessary. When you are someone who wants to collct all stuff and so on, it is better to use it. :D You get a endless bag fpr craftig materials, bigger bank space, 10  more exp and 1600 crown. For me its like I buy crows and get for free some extras, or buy for some extras and get free crowns. But it doesnt effecte the gameplay in a negative way if you havent ESO Plus. Just take care to read well, the abo will renew always if you dont cancel it at steam (fast google search hepls to find where you can cancel it). The best is to cancel it immediately after purchase if you dont want it longer than 1 month.  Sometimes Zenimax offers for a week ESO Plus for free."
Positive,"For me, it is the best fantasy MMO game, beautiful environment, great resources for the player, spectacular races [although I wish they had more facial expressions that were not so rigid] a game with a very well maintenance and continuous growth ... AND so far no SEX OR RASISM SCANDALS, NOR DISCRIMINATION AGAINST OTHER HUMAN BEINGS ... thanks to you [Elder Scroll Online] for being what is not [WOW] a great company and for listening to your players."
Positive,"A really great game. At the moment one of the most complete games i,ve ever played. Minimum bugs. Enormous pve content."
Positive,This game gave me a neckbeard
Positive,"I fucking love this game!I had a 15+ year addiction to another game. *Had*I have not played that game once since I was introduced to this, or any other game in fact."
Positive,Racism Simulator Online.
Positive,This game has made not want to slam my balls with my pc case so 10/10 will play for over 100 hours.
Positive,A very good MMO for those who are new to MMO's in general and definitely for those who are ES fans. All the quests are voice acted too so immersion is top notch. Good sh*t.
Positive,"If you like MMOs then this is a great game. Lots of groups to join for casual gameplay, roleplaying, farming, adventuring, trading and much more! Plus there is a million hours worth of content."
Positive,"Grinj, pay2kys g4me, janky hitboxes, yuge rubberbanding, mald evertyim :((11!(.Pvp is poorly maintained, very unrewarding thus vast majority just avoids some mods (of pvp players). devs tie pvp to pve balancing, making some item pieces unbalanced af.

Positive,"(h1) ABSOLUTELY (/h1)As someone who grew up playing RPG style games, this is 1000000% worth purchasing.Even when not playing after months, it is always an absolutely amazing and immersive game to get into.I have made some fantastic friends while playing this as well.I would recommend you subscribe to the ESO PLUS feature as it works out being cheaper than paying for individual DLCS."
Positive,"Great PVE, Good PVP. Cyrodill without lag would be awesome"
Positive,i love this game :D
Positive,Absolutely amazing in every aspect!
Positive,story and content are fun
Positive,"Mechanics and game play are awesome, definitely not a pay to win game,cosmetics are good, and it takes skills and time to master each character."
Positive,Do you like endless content...do you like to ride wild animals....do you like big boobs tucked into some ill fitting armour for those boobs.This game is great and has so much content.
Positive,"yes very good, must pay money"
Positive,"As a newbie to the gaming world on pc , i found the introduction to this game very good and detailed. For beginners it is very informative and easy to follow. When i first started i struggled with using the keyboard to move around as it is different to other PC games in have played. I now use my play station controller for ease and i have used these for years and my fingers know what they are doing. Using my controller lets me play ESO sitting back in my computer chair comfortably for hours. If you want to get lost in a different world , i 100% recommend this to anyone. I play this game with my partner and play the story lines together making it so much more fun and enjoyable."
Positive,iam a old World of warcraft player and can only recommend this game
Positive,"Nice Immersive, crazily over built and details (yes, that's a good thing) If you like MMPRG go .. play it.  now."
Positive,"""It's better than fortnite"" - My dad."
Positive,"This game is something different, real open world game. Man I love it."
Positive,i mean its an elder scrolls mmo. if ya like elder scrolls lore and mmo's get it
Positive,เพลินๆดี ถ้าเพื่อนเล่นด้วยจะดีกว่า ช่วยกันทำเควส ช่วยกันลงดัน
Positive,"I'm generally not a huge MMO fan, but ESO is a great trip around Tamriel that explores Elder Scrolls lore and is fun to play!"
Positive,"The most immersive and story-rich mmorpg that I've ever played. Needless to say, i'm a big fan of the Elder Scrolls franchise, but this game keeps surprising me in all of it's aspects. In addition to what I've said, the PvP/Battleground is fun, the plus membership is fair, offering all of it's previous DLC contents and you don't need to own the DLCs to get to the max level, you just buy it if you want to play it's history."
Positive,Really wish the store prices were alot cheaper. The items in the store are way overpriced. Anything that you can purchase on the game are severely overpriced. That really takes the fun out of the game. The graphics and Story line are awesome.
Positive,This is a fun game!
Positive,"My favorite game of all time. I could play this game for thousands of hours, and in fact, I have!"
Positive,"Hands down the best story that you could hope for in an MMO while still giving you everything that you need. The lore and quests make sense across thee different factions and serve to really immerse you in the world. Plenty of skills and traits to work on and every piece of gear that you wear can be made or modified through crafting. It is a bit of a grind for players who are not monthly subscribers but still the VAST majority of the game is accessible to all players. The combat is a bit more weighted on ability than just the skills you use and it is one of the only full MMOs that you can play with a controller. Also, if you dont want to interact with anyone you dont have to. There is so much to do and other than the end game dungeons and trials, the entire game can be played solo or in small groups."
Positive,"Its pretty good. If you like the elder scrolls UNIVERSE, not the gameplay aspect, but the world and universe i recommend it. If you are expecting something like Skyrim online dont even bother cuz you are not gonna get it. But otherwise a fantastic single player MMO, that has all quest voice acted and pretty decent writting in most of them. With a pvp  that is either hit or miss for you (i personally love it) and no subscription required( though yo do get some good advantages for subscribing, not necessary if you are here for the single player content), this game is atleast worth a try for any fan of mmos of elder scrolls."
Positive,As a new player there is a ton of content.  Combat system is fun.  Active events.  Overall great story content.Only complaint is cost of items in the Crown Store.
Positive,Gigantic open world perfect for a single player or multiplayer experience.
Positive,"Hop in with some homies, find an experienced player who's willing to teach you whats up and dominate the world"
Positive,"This is a satisfying MMO. A plus is the rich history of the Elder Scrolls literature. I played this a couple of years ago on the XBOX ONE but I now own it on PC. I may have more to comment on in the future as I play but as of now, I don't have the expansions. All in all, I still would suggest this to anyone who has not played it as of yet."
Positive,"Its fun, and super adorable! i love it so far!"
Positive,"Vast world, great graphics, rich contents, of course I gonna like it, it is The Elder Scrolls Game, one of my favorites"
Positive,Highly addictive game. I love how much there is to do.
Positive,Best thing since Runescape.
Positive,Its pretty addicting and fun
Positive,"Short version: this is basicly baby's first mmo, with limited active skill to fit a controller and a more laid back playstyle if you want while questing.Long version: This mmo was basicly nothing really when it was released but after coming back to it a few years later (because i found out i was still paying for monthly eso+) i found out that everything was decently balanced, everything scales and if you want most of it is quite doable solo.Everything scaling means all quest are worth doing XP wise and as a maxed player you can play with someone that just started, the big limitation there would only be your patience while you wait for them to understand the basic mechanics.This fully voiced MMORPG is recconmended as a 7/10 for me as i enjoy a story. which is actually surprisingly decent and even side quest could have quite some interesting story behind it. if you like a story you can do the questing and never be bored in any of the DLC area's though ill be honest, the old content is... well... you know... OLD. so the older areas while still interesting are still quite boring with reused dungeons all over the place.Lastly, How should you play ESO?Get a main character and almost directly after get a side character (pref an orc) as a crafter,Just play the game on your main and do all the questing and explore the game as you want, while on quests you will receive equipment and resources, if you are not a ESO+ member, just chuck it all into the bank for your crafter to do stuff with,You can easily level your crafter to max by just doing dolman gates, since xp drops get bigger as your level gets higher, with some efficiency you can have a maxed character in roughly 6 hours while doing this.And ALWAYS remember, you can respec your skills and attributes at a ingame price that scales with the total skills you have, if you have the gold for it you could even make your main your crafter (just make the side character really)GLHF if story is your driving force or if this is your first mmo."
Positive,It's good to be back in Skyrim
Positive,"I enjoy the fast-paced momentum of this game. There's always somewhere to go and quest and room to improve your character. It's a well-written, combat focused MMO with a story line."
Positive,"Chill, endless content, amazing Scenery. Worth every euro spent in it."
Positive,"As someone who came from playing Neverwinter on console. (Xbox one, Logged 5998 hours in game playing), When I started playing this game, as someone who loved skyrim, oblivion ect, I was hooked. It helped I had awesome people to play with too. Its beautiful, some quests are tedious but if you love adventuring around, learning about the world around you in a mmo, probably a good game for ya. Well, in my eyes anyway. :D"
Positive,"Love playing this solo or with my friends! Great graphics, perfect performance. Recommend 100%. Don't miss out on a decent game!"
Positive,"I've played many MMOs over the course of the previous two+ decades and I have to say that I feel ESO is the best I've played.  The graphics are solid. The quests are often involved, usually well thought out and make sense within the game world. I enjoy the combat system with weapon swapping and not locking you down to a single weapon. You can learn many different weapon styles on a single character. I enjoy the crafting where I can make different styles of armor and weapons, with different traits, that are actually useful to equip in the game.  Level progression, the use of skill points and the primary level with extended Champion leveling really helps add longevity to characters. If I had to pick one MMO to play, ESO would be it.  (I play mostly PVE and not PVP so I can't comment on that aspect)."
Positive,"It's almost as fabulous as @Potteries ❤❤❤I love this game.  It's gentle early-on (so new players aren't excluded from content) but becomes increasingly challenging.  They've even added built-in advisers with various character-builds.  Classes are not locked to roles - a ""Necromancer"" or ""Sorceror"" can tank; a ""Nightblade"" or ""Dragonknight"" can heal - anyone can fit any niche if they try.Customization is major (not just in decorations - but you can learn various abilities based off weapons, guilds, etc to give you options outside your class).  Player housing, costumes, pets, mounts - assistants!  I now have a Thieve's Guild smuggler who will come when called to help me fence goods.It's almost as fabulous as @Potteries ❤❤❤"
Positive,i dont actually have 484 hours i just forget to close the launcher. but this game is fun
Positive,"Have you cried twice yet well get ready because sometimes this game makes you cry because oh god, this character I liked is DEAD or LOST THEIR MEMORIES or something similar ahahahaha"
Positive,"what Fallout 76 should've been9/10, it's basically Skyrim with co-op"
Positive,FODA PRA CARALHO <3
Positive,"I'd say 99% of the game is fully voiced, which is always a nice touch to really immerse you in the game. However, in addition to that it is extremely flexible for an MMO when choosing classes and skills. While there is a ""best"" combination like all things, that isn't to say that almost any way you set yourself up isn't a viable option, not to mention every class can fill every role, giving you the truly open opportunity to play the class whose lore or ""feel"" you like best."
Positive,Very cool and satisfying with the correct build the environment looks amazing
Positive,GOOD mmo lots to do and if freinds to play with even better still a lot to do for single player havnt even joined a guild yet at 671 hours
Positive,"You can play it on your own, with friends (level difference doesn't matter) or with strangers; it's fun no matter what! And the world, story and first person view is much more engaging than your usual MMO fare."
Positive,"Elder Scrolls has always been fun, and ESO continues to get better as time goes on. Plenty of fun and quests to do especially since you can play with your friends !"
Positive,Very enjoyable to dip my toes in every now and again. Definitely have gotten the most play out of the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild DLC.
Positive,"Simply a pleasure, especially for elder scrolls fans"
Positive,"Absolutely love this game. I'm new to ES; I started with the mobile app for iOS and fell in love with it. So, I began searching online and discovered there was an ESO. I downloaded a day ago and have absolutely fallen in love with it. The graphics, gameplay, quests, etc. are amazing. I played D&D and WoW for years, and ESO is, IMHO, far better than both. I highly recommend this."
Positive,"I played this game on PS4 before switching over to PC. The community of people this MMORPG has brought together is the best in any game I've played before. With the performance improvements, lifestyle upgrades, and expansions, the game is exceptional. I always have something to do, and with nine character slots free at start, the possibilities are endless. There is plenty of content for everyone, and a home for players who enjoy outfit decoration, home decorating, RP, end-game hard group content, and challenges for those who wish to test themselves. It is very user friendly, and the community is always willing to help new players. If you haven't given TESO a try, there is no better time to jump in."
Positive,great game. Diablo meets Wow. big open world. lots to do
Positive,"It's ok, I guess."
Positive,"I really enjoy this game, and still do!"
Positive,One of the best game played by me
Positive,"Great game. I quit playing wow because after every patch everyone had to grind new gear all over again. It really felt like a job which killed my desire to play. In this game your gear is as useful as it was 2 or 3 years ago. If toy are a wow player, I know ESO could feel weird at the beginning, but trust me, it's a good game."
Positive,"Several hours of story-enriched content, so far I've only completed one story arc (Ebonheart Pact) and none of the DLC expansions over the course of a weekly evening played with friends.Edit: After playing for upwards of 3000 hours spent in dungeons, PvP and trials, I can say that I'm only just catching up to the latest content (Markarth and Blackwood chapter). It has been entertaining along the way.The story for each chapter has been enriching and enjoyable, with the only exception being a small DLC zone (Hew's Bane) for the Thieves' Guild. I have not really been that interested in sinking my teeth into this particular zone, nor have I been overly interested in The Gold Coast for the Kvatch/Dark Brotherhood storyline. However, your mileage may vary.Prior to an earlier patch adding the 'Collections' tab to include account-wide sets that can be reconstructed with Transmute Crystals, the grind for specific gear was a little rough, but now as long as I find ""an item"" of the required set & gear slot, I can just use the transmute crystals on my main - who has plenty of skill points to have maxxed out crafting and then several left over.The game itself, outside Veteran content, is very casual-gamer friendly and doesn't really penalize you for coming in late. Eventually you settle at Level 50, CP 160 gear without too much trouble and overland / crafted gear can get you through Normal content without any real stress (even Veteran if you can understand the mechanics). I've introduced several friends to the game since playing, each finding it very easy to get lost in the story and the game itself and not feeling left behind as they progress in content at their own pace.One such friend solo'd Spindleclutch I as a level 22 Sorcerer without realising it was a dungeon meant for a group - and he enjoyed every minute of it and felt incredibly satisfied with succeeding. Then I took him through it as a group and he was even more impressed with his ability to do it solo. To this day I still recommend it and as a previous World of Warcraft player, I've found I enjoy Elder Scrolls Online far more and I've yet to hit the same burnout phase that I did with World of Warcraft."
Positive,"Despite some stability problems and agressive marketing. The Tamriel lands are expanding each year and getting their life in this game. Love it.UPD Nov 2023:Well, 8000 hours and 9 years are behind. What can I say? It is still amazing.I recommend it, especially if you like any of the Elder Scrolls games.What you will find:- Many... MANY quests. Nice stories. Memorable characters. Compliments to the previous TES parts.- Open world without zone leveling. That means you can make quests in any zone with any level character.- Group content tuned in three difficulties: newcomers, veterans, veteran hard mode (for bosses). Supposed for 4 and 12 player groups, but it is optional.- Mechanic based encounters. That means in hard content you should react on environment: interrupt mobs, block hits, roll dodge boss attacks, move (sometimes with whole group) or stand still. It is not that kind of MMO where you just stand and cast things.- Best mass PVP with sieges I've ever seen - an enormous zone of Cyrodiil for 3-banners-war. Battlegrounds and duels are also available if you don't like mass fights.- Many things aside quests and battles like fishing, crafting, house holding, archaeology, even a card game.Can you play it solo? Can you play it in group? Can you PvP with questers?- All the stories except specially marked group content (dungeons and trials) are available for solo play, but you'll have a chance to meet other players of the same kind there. You also can play this quests in group with friends. Rare exceptions are main story and some guild stories that are pure solo.- Specially marked content is supposed to run with group. You can premade a group with your friends or find one with ingame tools. Almost all the group content is available for solo or minor group runs if you are strong and experienced enough. Rare exceptions are some dungeons and trials that require more players due to mechanics (use levers or buttons etc).- Special PvP zones (Cyrodiil, Imperial City, Battlegrounds) are separated from PvE zones. You can do quests in Cyro and IC and fight other players there, but you can't ambush simple quester or resource harvester in other zones. You can fight a duel in any zone, but it requires both participants agreed. You can set duels autodeclined if you're not interested.Things that you will find strange, hard or irritating.It is not cons, if you ask me. Just things that every new player meets here one day. Each element looks strange for outer look, but have it's strong inner logic and history, why it was made this way.- LA weaving - a trick in battle, that allows you raise your damage is you master it. It is not necessary for game as is, but endgame groups in fact require it. If you need it, guides will help.- Low level scaling anomaly - on start your character may become weaker after levelup. Your lvl10 char in lvl10 gear is really stronger, than on lvl20 with the same lvl10 gear. It is a side effect of scaling that allows you run any zone hand in hand with high levels.- Making your crafter character whole takes months if you don't use crown items. Gear trait system specifics takes the most of this time. You don't have to spend all this for comfortable game. But if you wanna be a crafter who's ready for everything, you need to know it takes time.- Gear drop (named ""curated drop"") is optimized for collection, not for character building. That means you can make many dungeon runs with a very slight chance to get the second ring for your build, if you got one already. It is a side effect of set gear collection. It is comfortable for old players but may be a bad surprise for new ones.- Amount of things in ESO is overwelming for a new player. It is usual for the game that has been evoluting for many years. Even the quests you can get running around are often too many for your quest book. I recommend visiting the official forum, guides area. You can find the recommended story order there, if you get lost.What about paywall and microtransactions? DLCs are not neccessary, but paywall exists. Microtransactions can be totally ignored. Details:- You have a lot of content in the base game to enjoy. Rich stories, dungeons etc. But at the moment more than a half of the PVE content is in DLCs. Just by numbers: basegame (22 zones, 26 group dungeons, 4 trials, 18 public dungeons, 1 arena), DLCs (21 zones, 26 group dungeons, 8 trials, 15 public dungeons, 3 arenas). The best PvE gear is currently obtained in DLC dungeons and trials. You can make a good build without DLC, but it will miss 5-10% in perfomance.- PVP content is fully available in the basegame. Some gear sets can't be obtained without DLCs. But it is controversial if that gear is necessary for good PVP or not.- There are 4 character classes, 6 crafting professions and 22 skill lines available in the base game. While 3 character classes, one crafting profession (Jevellery) and 5 skill lines (Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Scry, Excavate, Psyjic Order) are available through DLCs or crown store.- Crafting sets and transmutation/reconstruction functions are put in DLC, but any basegame crafter can use it in guild mates' or friends' houses. Community makes it available for all.- Microtransactions offer only cosmetic items (skins, mounts, gear outfit), timesavers (skillpoints for alt character, fast trait learning, exp buff) or something easily obtainable in game with the same quality(foods, potions etc). It can be a problem for cosmetic-addicted, but can be ignored by everyone else. No any functional pay-to-win element was detected in crown store for 9 years I played.- Summary: you can enjoy the game without DLC, but many DLCs worth trying.A word about community.It is various, but usually good and friendly.Due to mechanic based encounters lots of random people you meet in group dungeons are ready to help you with learning the mechanics or builds. Well, you also may meet someone who keeps you as a furniture, not a soul. Anyway a half of good advise about the mechanics I got from people in random groups.Guilds are awesome here. ESO guild events organized and driven by players were the best memories in my 20+ years MMO experience. Duel tournaments, house furnishing contests, horse rides, naked sieges in Cyrodiil, roleplay almost everywhere. If you want to open all the aspects of the game for you, join a guild (may be more than one, according to your interests). You'll never regret it."
Positive,"God, I dont typically love mmos but I absolutely love ESO. It's very lone-wolf friendly, but if i do have to group up for dungeons etc, I never fail to find rad people to play with. I love the game and i love the community that makes it a worthwhile experience"
Positive,"I personally am not really into PvP, so I cannot comment on that portion, nevertheless I am thoroughly enjoying the PvE side of things. Typical Elder Scrolls stories and quests :)"
Positive,Good Game. Just don't raid on patch day.
Positive,"Played this for about a week while it was free and found myself having a blast. A little bit of a different approach to the classic MMORPG, and still remaining fun for both you and your friends. Game has come a long way so excited to see what the end product will be once all DLC & Expansions are released. :>"
Positive,"Good gameplay and stunning art/graphix, but half the content is cost-gated which is kinda disappointing. The cost gate can be overcame with just makin bank in the game and buyin crowns from ppl. but thats dif for casual players. Seems like the only way to play the game is to buy the individual dlc's or just sub to eso+. That said, for $20 it's fun as hell."
Positive,yes yes very yes good yes very yes yes very yes good yes very yes yes very yes good yes very yes yes very yes good yes very yes yes very yes good yes very yes yes very yes good yes very yes yes very yes good yes very yes yes very yes good yes very yes yes very yes good yes very yes yes very yes good yes very yes yes very yes good yes very yes yes very yes good yes very yes yes very yes good yes very yes yes very yes good yes very
Positive,"This hits the sweet spot between WoW retail and WoW classic. Not a faceroll like retail, but if you need a break from the challenges of classic this is a good compromise. Also try LotRO, which has tons of F2P content, if you have the end-of-expansion blues with WoW retail and aren't interested in classic."
Positive,"This game is an absolute blast.It feels like an Elder Scrolls game as it is very easy to ignore the other players and play solo but also enjoyable if you are playing with friends. You can play for countless hours and not run out of things to do (even if you don't put any more money into the game). It's not limited if you're playing solo as you can still do PvP, complete the large amount of quests and explore most dungeons as well as exploring the world itself. The combat is a lot of fun and feels smooth with the abilities combining well with the actual weapon/magic fighting. A downside is that it can get a bit repetitive when you're given a time consuming or overly difficult task in a quest however this is uncommon. Overall I would recommend getting this game because of its abundance of enjoyable content, even if you don't buy any other chapters/DLCs."
Positive,"When I first played this game a couple years ago I gave it about 6 hours and never touched it again. A couple months ago and I could not find anything to play. I figured what the hell, I pass the day with ESO then figure out what I want to play tomorrow. Well fast forward to today and im still playing it. Not only am I still playing it but I put a couple hundred hours in already. The game just seems to scratch every itch. It has as much story content that you could play the whole thing solo. Has a progression system, different skill trees that are exclusive to each class, and crafting or farming better equipment and loot. If you arnt into solo play than it is really easy to group up with people to take on dungeons, dolems, world bosses, or PvP arenas. There is just so much content. Technically all you have to do is purchase the game once and never have to pay again, but the game almost forces to get ESO Plus due to the crafting bag that gives you unlimited storage space for crafting items, and you get double the bank space. But you also get 10% permanent xp bonus and around 1550 crowns every month. So the $15 a month is worth it. Are there some bugs and issues to the game. Yeah sure. What game doesnt. But I have yet to ever come across anything that broke the game or made it not enjoyable for me."
Positive,Good Game and amazing lore behind the stories of daedric princes
Positive,It brings you to a new world you can't have
Positive,"Even though their are a lot of DLC's so buy, and a few expansions. The game still offers a lot to play as a base game, and is a lot of fun to play. Any character, any play style imaginable is possible."
Positive,"Lots of fun, but the cost is a bit much. I mean $9.99 and 600 hours of your life much. Great game"
Positive,"The only problem I have with this game is that more people don't play it. That problem mostly lies in the fact that a lot of people still think that you have to buy the game AND pay a monthly membership fee. Every new person that learns I play the game almost always asks ""How do you afford it?"" or comments ""I'd love to play that, but I don't wanna pay a membership."" If there were a bit more clarification in this regard I think it would be played by more people. Any additional content after the base game itself are optional and at the player's discretion to buy, not essentials left out just to leverage more money. All that aside, I have to say I love how immersive this game is. There's always something to do and each area you can explore is beautifully rendered and distinct. The NPCs you interact with are engaging and have well-written dialogue. I also love the option of being able to buy and decorate a multitude of homes in varied styles and sizes. Lastly, the character creation and classes give you a vast amount of possibilities for playing any way that suits you. At the time of this review I have just under 2000 hours logged on this game and heavily recommend it."
Positive,Very fun and good community.
Positive,"Its a cross between a single player RPG and an MMORPG and it doesn't really know exactly where it fits. Also has a huge learning curve if you are just coming in from the Elder Scrolls games. Despite this, when you grab a group of friends and stick inside the PvE gameplay its immensely fun. I've definitely put some hours into this game and I don't regret any of them. (maybe the hours when it still required a subscription.)"
Positive,"This is one of the best MMORPGs currently out there.Amazing content, quests with voice acting and nice story, great gameplay.There's not much to be said that wasn't said before other than: Yes, I recommend that game a lot."
Positive,"After playing many different types of MMOs (OSRS, WoW, etc.), I would say this is for the Elder Scrolls fan. I have enjoyed past Elder Scrolls games such as Morrowind and Oblivion to a large extent, and being able to visit Cyrodiil and Vvardenfell with other people was an awesome experience. The quests seem like intricate little stories that have meaning to the choices you make. Combat is immersive and interesting; whenever I battle a fearsome skeleton in a dungeon or creepy Kwamas in a mine, I feel like I am actually fighting it. The world is beautiful and there are many things that can immerse a player, such as becoming an assassin as part of the Dark Brotherhood, or a thief of the Thieves Guild, or perhaps both. I played as a stealthy Nightblade that's goal was to steal as many things as possible to become rich, and the extent to this MMO being a sandbox is fantastic in my opinion. The only problem I have with the game, to be honest, is that you still have to buy individual expansions (ex: Summerset) when new ones come out (Elsweyr). I think ESO Plus is an addition for the hardcore player of the game and should be considered if you truly enjoy it to get the full experience. Overall, buy this game if you are a fan of Elder Scrolls and be able to experience the world of Tamriel with new adventurers or old friends."
Positive,"I have only been playing for a short time but feel really immersed in the game play, the game is huge and will last a casual gamer a good long time just running story quests alone.Overall I would recommend"
Positive,"Great first impressions, definetelly one of the best games ive played in a while,(es player)"
Positive,Fantastic game. Used to be bad but they've since then made the game great. 9/10
Positive,Ive never spent so much time riding a horse through 10+ territories just to find out I couldve went to the docks and traveled by boat... 100/10 game i love it
Positive,"Really amazing quality for an online RPG.The variety of playstyles, races, quests, and areas to explore is fantastic."
Positive,It has its flaws. Combat is more like DPS race than having spikes of burst daamge. You can often feel that authors are doing it for money and focusing on making it work with the least amount of cost possible. But it´s still highly enjoyable game with massive world to explore and almost unending progress.
Positive,"Great game, I'm over 500+ hours in endless content. Haven't even fully mastered half the roles or classes.Anyone that complains about the expense of the game is just wrong, ESO+ is optional and you can live without although the craft bag is handy.Graphics excellent, variety brilliant, community by i large is helpful!"
Positive,"i meannnnn, it's alright I guess. I will say this as my only negative. The Megaserver blows chunks. at any time no matter your location you will have a bad ping and there will be delays in your abilities. But man when the Megaserver is working smooth... OOOOOO WEEE. this game is sharper than a number 2 pencil."
Positive,Love the game.
Positive,oi mate check it out mate fuck yeah
Positive,"If you go in expecting Skyrim or Oblivion you will be disappointed. If you go in knowing you're playing an MMO, then you will find there is some fun things to do and be quite pleased with the game"
Positive,Over 1760 hours in and still can't stop playing ;>
Positive,"I've never expected it to be this good and fun. Quite surprised.First thing I liked is graphics. Nice but not overwhelming. Balanced colors and smooth textures.Soundtracks ingame are making me so nostalgic and I love that throwback feeling.If you've played earlier games in franchize you will enjoy, if you didn't same goes for you.Amount of lore and history you can find about Tamriel and broader is amazing. Story line is fascinating.Thank you"
Positive,"I've played MMORPG's all my life and nowadays they should be way better then they are.This game is the best attempt to do a decent MMORPG I've seen so far.It's also quite different then what you're used to, if you like the elder scrolls series...Deserves at least a try if you're curious. (wont be a waste of time)"
Positive,"Great game! I am a huge MMO fan and this has everything that I could ask for! Don't be fooled, This is NOT a pay to win game. A lot of the paid items can be unlocked through gameplay excluding alot of cosmetics, special mounts, etc. I STRONGLY encourage any MMO fan to pick this game up!"
Positive,"Really a fun little MMORPG.  Well not little it's pretty huge.  And doesn't give a good tutorial at all.  Like what mods you definitely need and want.  A few google searches and some patience later though and it's a really fun game.  Dungeons and mobs scale to your level for the most part, upside of this is that most things feel pretty accessible."
Positive,this game is a job now
Positive,its real huge data files
Positive,this game's crafting system is great! And the combat system is pretty dope. the new chapters are amazing. cant recommend this enough!
Positive,Dark Elves >
Positive,A great immersive RPG with great lore and fun quests to follow. Most difficult part is trying to optimize your inventory as a 'basic/non-plus' account and trying to figure what mats to drop and which to keep.Game still going strong years later
Positive,"The best thing about ESO is that it's gorgeous!  I love the environments the most.  Weither I'm galloping across the grassy plains of Cyrodill, crossing the harsh desert of Alkir, or fighting for my life in the heart of a valcano in Morrowind I can always count on ESO to get the atmosphere right.  The gameplay is fun and the cosmetics cool if a bit exprensive.  Honestly the only real complaint I have is their crown items tend to be overpriced.  You better make sure you really want something before forking over the dough or you will regret it.The quests are very well done with good voice acting.  The best advice I can give to new players is don't rush your first time.  Just enjoy the ride while it lasts.  Once you get to level 50 Champain 160 you can then start worrying about grinding as fast as you can to get the gear you want."
Positive,"Overall a very solid MMO. The only major things that I dont particularily enjoy are:-no open world PvP (always been my favorite in MMO's, and no, Cyrodil doesnt count)-very low penalty for death in game. (only repair costs essentially~which makes overall combat less exciting than it could be) inv management is a nightmare too (speaking from a perspective without ESO+ craftbag, etc...)BUT the game is great in:-combat fluidity-crafting system-character customization (costumes, outfits, etc...)-questing (the lore is probably the best out of any MMO ive played)I would recommend it to a friend if he/she were looking for an MMO"
Positive,"Of all the MMORPG's I have played, including WoW, this one has to be the best one so far.  I wouldn't say its the best by far, but I have to say it is the most entertaining.  I think it has been refined to be better then most mmo's in ways that quests, dungeons or raids, and leveling is better in this then most (if not all) MMO's.  You level up quicker, you don't fall asleep during raids (WoW), questing doesn't require you to pick up 14 sticks that have a 15% chance of dropping, and you feel like you're actually playing an extension to the Elder Scrolls game.  The quality of this game is truly up there.  As for a negatives, it is quite easy to say the negatives are the ""payment portion.""  You dont get a crafting backpack unless you pay, so you find yourself having to deal with destroying items often.  There are high level items that require you to pay for (in crown points) which is actually very expensive in the long run, etc... You don't get as much experience as those who are paying monthly (on top of extra Crown points purchaseables).  Yet at the end, I can't help but compare this to what is considered the best MMO, WoW.  The beauty behind this game, is it is NOT REQUIRED that you pay 13-15 dollars a month to play the game.  This is a bigtime for me.  I know WoW tried to do something about this and made an in game monthly purchaseable that no one can afford except for people already paying monthly (biggest contradiction ever), but I would never go back to WoW knowing that there is a better free game out.  I just don't like investing time in a game, because I have invested money in it, and not because its the most fun game in my library.All that being said, I wouldn't bother wasting time comparing other big named MMO's to this, because the many many other MMO's I have played were not comparible at all and got boring real quickly."
Positive,"Great game.Please notice it is not next Skyrim or Morrowind. It's totally different game based on TES universe. And it's brilliant.HUGE world, A LOT of quests, great crafting system, interesting plot and great lore.Love it <3"
Positive,"Eines der besten MMOs überhaupt. Sehr einsteigerfreundlich, keine Grinds oder langweilige ""besorg mir 10 davon""-Quests, ausschließlich unterhaltsame Story Quests, wie man sie aus den Elder Scrolls Teilen (Morrowsind, Oblivion, Skyrim, etc.) kennt. Unglaublich viel Content, allein im Basisspiel. Ein großer Teil des Spiels kann im Einzelspieler erledigt werden. Alle Gebiete und Quests leveln mit, so dass man selbst auf max Level noch unerledigte Questreiehen abschließen kann. Ich finds großartig."
Positive,Definitly  in love with the Elder Scrolls game! I have been playing the games for a while now and I love how they put all kinds of things from their previous Elder Scrolls games into this  online one!
Positive,"i love the game, really really fun. would recommend it to anyone."
Positive,"Keep in mind this is an MMORPG with The Elders Scrolls theme, not Skyrim or its sequel.You are the chosen along with other chosen ones. If immersion is something very important to you, get out. Like I said this is an MMORPG, understand this and you will enjoy yourself a lot.Still the quests and sidequests is quite bland because my immersion getting start afected in long runs and doing events, dungeons and repetitives actions makes you feel like a robot and the fun leaves the room.The Patch v3.3.5 (Update 17)  alow the game more newbie friendly, with rewards every time you level up and a build Level Up Advisor, giving tips etc.The game is poorly optimized. FPS drops a lot in very populated areas. I try a lot of things, lower every thing  and the difference not worth it . I played most modern games that demands more of the system without frame drops.Playing the game without pay the plus menbership make a huge impact in your play style and yes afect some aspect of game mechanics. The plus menbership in my country is very expensive and not worth it.The combat system uses rotation, its like a lot of hadoukens you need to memorize to be accept in endgame content, because with high dps you get invite, if not you get kicked and mocked. The community gona make every thing hard to you for endgame content if you have low cp/dps and crap rotation and enter in a casual guild don't help, you still getting asked for parse and high cp.update: The publisher of the game voluntarily make the game painful to use because inventory management without paying for the auto-renewed monthly subscription is quite horrible. Having smaller bank for non-subscriber is not great, but what kills the fun is the hundreds of crafting ingredients that are useful to keep around... But if you don't pay monthly for the craft bag, you are in hell. Every time you run out for a quest, you spend a boring amount of time of thinking what you need to throw out of your inventory instead of playing the game."
Positive,Im not a big fan of MMO games. After playing this i can say that its not only a good online game but an even better RPG game.
Positive,"this game is a lot of fun, and so much to do.  I do not think I will run out of things to do in this game"
Positive,"I’ve been playing this game for going on almost a year now. I never experienced it when it was initially launched but from the sounds of it all that is a good thing..Before I kick things off, a little disclaimer that for the hours logged to date I’ve only spent less than a handful of them PVP’ing. I don’t tend to enjoy PVP in MMO’s as much so I cannot critique from that POV. But that’s one of the beauties of this game… You play it however you want to play it!The game:For those who have yet to experience this wonderful game all I can say is if you have enjoyed past Elder Scrolls games buy it, you won’t regret it! Whether you play FPP or TPP the game is extremely immersive and the amount of interaction with the world and it’s flora/fauna/NPC’s is everything you’d expect from an ES title.The graphics are unreal! Even on lower settings with high drawback, all parts of Tamriel and it’s countless delves/dungeons will impress.I will say it’s not another Skyrim (lore and time setting dictates no dova or dovahkin) but that’s not a bad thing. I must be one of the odd minority that wasn’t overly obsessed with replaying Skyrim more than twice... However back to the point.The Community:I’ve played various MMORPG’s over the years and without doubt ESO is by far the BEST I’ve ever experienced to date. Sure there are a minority that are heartless jerks that unlock chests and only take what they deem valuable and leave junk for the next innocent passerby. But that’s pretty much the worst of it.Minimal immature 10 year olds. For the most part almost every kid/teenager I’ve met in ESO is just as mature as the 40 year old playing this game. (Rare in any online community)Like any MMORPG the game has accounts that bot and it’s obvious when you see 30+ players run the same lines over and over to kill the same 6 harpys. And yes like all other developers Zenimax puts banning these accounts pretty low on their to-do-list. But the way that this game is offered to us, other players lvls don’t impact our own gameplay anyway (exception of Cyrodill-PVP) Dungeons and monsters for the most part are scaled to your level. A HUUUGE PLUS! And imo makes the game so much more enjoyable.DLC:Without the relevant DLC packs you will not be able to access certain delves, dungeons, trials or do anything within the related provinces (i.e. Vvardenfell – Morrowind DLC). If you’re hitting up Tamriel on your own then it’s won’t be a problem as there’s already TOO MUCH to explore before even needing to consider taking on additional areas. However, if you like bossing and running delves, trials or pledges with a group etc you’ll find yourself back on Steam. FYI, I purchased the GOLD edition of ESO.. Worth it since you get 3x DLC packs in that.ESO+:One of the BEST things about ESO is that if you don’t (or can’t) subscribe, it doesn’t affect your gameplay or enjoyment to the point of crippling a player.If you love playing MMO’s for the cosmetics, mounts and different character skins etc. then really consider ESO+ for the monthly crates and (store) coins, however that’s not who I am personally and I’d rather spend the $ on buying a DLC pack or something.The single BIGGEST perk of subscribing is the crafting bag. I’ve discussed this at length with guild mates and most do swear that the craft bag alone is worth the cost of sub. However $15USD p/m is quite a lot for me after I convert it to my own currency so since I’m stingy, I’ve learnt to be savvy with my bank space and deal on a daily basis with my hoarding issues across numerous accounts  :DOverall: 9.5/10.0"
Positive,Good story line and its like world of warcaraft but you dont pay a subcription and its kinda addiccting to play
Positive,shit was mid tbh
Positive,"This is such a beautiful game, from character creation to the various lands you visit while questing.  Mounts and pets are plentiful which makes traveling more fun.  You have a number of races you can play, each with it's own unique starting area so if you get bored by one, you can try another.  Overall, this game is a very fun and pleasant way to spend the day (or week or month, lol). I definitely recommend it.  My only complaint is limited storage for free players.  Yes, you can spend in game money to buy more storage, but I gather resources faster than I earn gold. :("
Positive,"This game is pretty nice looking, and pretty well optimized. I've already spent 100+ hours on it and didn't get bored."
Positive,After 11 years of WoW this is an excellent game to pick up!
Positive,"Typical elder scrolls player who was afraid to get into this mmorpg game. It is my first time and it is very different. But I am enjoying the combat and most importantly leveling the differnt skills and talents you get. You can have like 7 things leveling at once which is fun. example is like light armor, staff, soul magic, storm magic, high elf skill, crafting skill. They are all seperate so you can be working on them all at once. For me, so far this is more enjoyable than Skyrim. But you probably wont agree with me. I personally just love the world of tamriel, and this game feels like your in the world. I was so suprised that you can actually travel to so many regions. like skryim was located in skyrim area where the nords live. So far i've gone to summerset isles, and daggerfall. You can go to cyrodill and playing as an Altmer I cant wait to see these talos worshipers and flex on them :). I am having a lot of fun roleplaying because i always altmer first each elder scrolls game, and early in this game you get to meet the queen of the aldmeri dominion and do missions for her, and just unite the kajit and bosmer. so if you like doing this kind of role playing actually in the FANTASY WORLD you will enjoy it. I didnt really like skyrim because it was so ordinary and human... nords are boring compared to daedra.....I am having a blast I recommend if you are an elder scrolls fan who likes the lore to at least play for 1 month. buy the base game or the gold edition or try to get a trial or something and try it out, it is worth it I am lvl 16? and I look forward to getting to lvl 50+   ONE HUGE COMLAINT- the game can be very easy so you have to push ahead and dungeun by your self if you want a challenge. thats what i do, I usually play all games on hardest difficulty and this game is like playing on easy mode. But at least we have the power to go and explore and just fight dungeons that are more difficult and fun. I havent dont online pvp fighting yet, i will try later but I am used to single player games so im gonna get my grasp on all the crafting and lvl and etc and then try the more dynamic types of experiences. anyways As an elderscrolls fan I really recommend. It eased my mind waiting elder scrolls 6 now that i can mess around here."
Positive,"I originally played ESO in 2014 when it was first released, and at the time did not find it all that appealing. To be fair, I was expecting a ""Skyrim Online"" experience (urealistic, I know) and still very into a couple of other games so I quit playing after only a short while.Fast forward to earlier this year when I decided to pick it back up again. Boy howdy, was I pleasantly surprised!!! In the past 3 years, ESO has really found its stride and grown into itself. One Tamriel gave it the quality-of-life change it needed (and that every MMO needs, honestly) which is level scaling. No longer are you confined to play in certain zones at certain levels; the entire world is now wide open to you, beginning at level 1! This means that every zone is frequented by players of all levels, and anybody is available to quickly get together to defeat world bosses, daedric anchors, and public dungeons. It also means you can zone into a dungeon with players of any level between 10 and 690, and you no longer have to wait until you're caught up with your friends/guild mates, or swap around alts, in order to group up and enjoy content together. You can quest with your friends in any zone and don't have to worry about anybody leveling too quickly or too slowly. Just group up and enjoy the game together!I happily played through that open world for a good while, until I decided I liked the game well enough to purchase the Imperial Edition. Because I wanted a mount, and I definitely wanted to re-create my Imperial from Skyrim who had been one of my favorite characters in that game.This led to me jumping into the subscription shortly afterwards, because I wanted to experience Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild without actually purchasing the DLC. Instead I figured ""for $15 you can try everything and see if you even like it, before you buy it."" The difference was immediate, and remarkable. My bags magically emptied themselves of crafting materials (unlimited crafting bag, hooray!), and my bank space doubled. I quickly deleted a couple of ""mule alts"" I had created for storage, and instead started creating a couple of more ""live"" characters to actualy play and enjoy the game with and experiment with different race/class combinations.In July I was already deeply invested into the game and into my characters, and had joined some active trading guilds. So a few weeks after Morrowind was released, I bought it without hesitation and immediately created a Warden (who is one of my favorite characters, still), and began my journey through Vvardenfell. I never did really play TES Morrowind, so there was no nostalgia factor involved, but I did enjoy the zone and the quests and the storylines immensely.I have 7 characters that I play all the time, and am in 5 guilds that I enjoy a whole lot. The ESO community is extremely friendly and supportive, especially people in active guilds (please don't judge the maturity of the ESO players based on zone chat; that's not where most of us can be found).I think that the game gets better and better with every bit of new content released. ZOS customer service has been amazingly accommodating when I've needed them. With the deals available right now, there's honestly no better time to give ESO a try. Its worth every penny, even at full price. ESO is a riveting and engaging game with a huge world and amazing lore, and if you're an Elder Scrolls fan, you'll not be disappointed. If you're not an Elder Scrolls fan, you'll soon become one, because the game is honestly THAT good. I hope to play it for a long time yet to come. It's really scratched my MMO itch after finally getting bored with WoW, and my Elder Scrolls itch while we're all waiting for TES6 to be released.I hope you found this review helpful, and I look forward to seeing you in Tamriel!"
Positive,very good multi player.  challanging .  good for long term play.  if pvp is your thing it has that covered too
Positive,"In spite of all the shit this game got over the years (and is still getting, sadly), I have to say that it is an Elder Scrolls game to it's core. It has the atmosphere, the visuals, the LORE!!, and I lose my sense of time whenever I play. I mute the music, because it's just muffling the otherwise amazing sound design, and I enjoy the gorgeous scenery while riding around on a guar. Most chill MMO I've ever played."
Positive,"This game rules.  Basically endless things to do, explore Tamriel like no other TES game.  Play solo or group content, it's all there.  Up for a challenge, try Veteran dungeons and Trials.  The community is usually pretty good.  Would play again.  Also, not like Skyrim, except it is in the same universe.  ESO plus is a must if just for the crafting bag."
Positive,"Blimey mate. First time I found out about 'tis game I wanted it, immediately, 'cus I was a big Skyrim fan. Truth 'b told, 'tis game ain't Skyrim, it may have a part of Skyrim in it, but it ain't the same thing. The first 100 hours were interesting, but after that, I couldn't force meself to play it anymore, it became so repetitive and boring I just didn't enjoy it. The quests consist of goin there bringin that you SON OF A PUTRID RAISIN THAT HAS BEEN  LEFT OUTSIDE IN THE BLOODY SUN TO SOAK UP IT'S GLORIOUS RADIATION. If yer into that kind of stuff, go ahead, get the game. 100h well spent, everything beyond that, no good. Oh and another boner destroyer in this game is the DLC's. See ye cannae jus normally buy DLC's you have to buy in-game currency and with it buy the DLC's which is stupid and the cunt responsible for it should be fed with honey till he turns into a bloody bear, no joke. His lack of incompetence should been noted."
Positive,"Very experienced MMO player here- wanted to say that I love ESO!From the graphics to expansions, classes, dungeons, and lore, all aspects are really well done. Very talented artist/game designers behind this gameIf you're the type of person looking for a new MMO to get into, I strongly suggest this game! Also- you get duel spec at level 15 and it's a total game changer!Now, I do have a negative comment about PvP.I've NEVER been in a PvP match where it had similarly balanced experienced players.Designers need to build out how they track the players experience levels and difficulty so that they can group people in more competitive tiers. But PvP is like 10% of the game, so this isn't a big issue."
Positive,"I love Skyrim and I love this. Way before I got this game, I heard it's not that great and it's not fun.. I think it is. I think it's amazing. Also, when I started playing, I thought it would be more like Skyrim, so I went and effed up my first character that I've now been trying to fix. I suppose if you do want to do stuff in squads, you can't be an assassin nord on a dragonknight character? Soo yeah. I totally went with the same idea of ""I can be whatever I want"", as I usually do on Skyrim. So I joined all the guilds and just did my thing. I miss having proper companions, instead of ..well. I just enjoy having npc companions that I can boss around or whatever. Also I want to be able to marry that stylish argonian from the Thieves guild. But I can't. Why must you tease me so? He's too fabulous not to be married. If only Skyrim had him. Mounts can't swim. Why? Why in the name of Sithis can't they swim? And you can't fight from ontop of your mount. Pretty sure that was the greatest disappointment. I'd say having no home was another, but they've brought the homes to the game so I'm glad. I'm sick and can't think so I'm gonna end this with my words of wisdom: Try it, experience it, stop reading people's comments and just try it. I thought it'd be bad, but it wasn't. But that's just my opinion. What will yours be?"
Positive,"This game got my by surprise, the most fun I've got with an MMO in a while. Very chill and relaxing IMO"
Positive,"A really nice mmorpg, I suggest you play it with some buddies and enjoy the immense content."
Positive,Hi guys I made so many friends playing this game! XDDDDDDD I didn't have many to begin with oh well LOL now I do.
Positive,I would buy it if there was a localizationUpd:ну наконец то )
Positive,"Hey, that's pretty good!"
Positive,"This game has gone from absolute shit, to genuinely fun. Every zone is memorable, and while I skip all the text in the story, I still get a bit wrapped up in the story unfold in the game. I'm glad I've been able to finally get into it, and the future looks much better than WoW. There could be some QoL changes to make things more streamlined, but I'm sure addons can help with that."
Positive,"Normally i get burned out with MMO's within a month it has been like 4 months and i still have lots of in game content i have not experienced. the quest lines are genuinely intriguing , and sometimes gets you to make some deep thought provoking decisions (if you are into that). the crafting system has a lot of variations so you don't have everyone wearing the exact same thing. and you don't have to continuously pay to play or even pay to win."
Positive,"I really disliked this in closed beta for some reason.  I saw the Morrowind announcement a while back, and had heard over the years news of the game getting better and better, so decided to give it a look.  I come from a background that started with Everquest and has been all over the place ever since.  I was pretty much done with MMOs, all the time commitments, the raiding, all that stuff is a huge turn off to me at 39 years old.  I don't know exactly what it is about ESO, but this is the first game in a long while to have the feeling of a living environment like I did the first time I played Everquest.I could go on and on, this game is great, it's worth it.  What I will say though is this:  Even if you have no desire to play an MMO, but love RPGs or Elder Scrolls, play this, and heck, turn off chat if you want.  The sheer amount of quest content and recorded dialogue is mind boggling.  I can't believe a game I hated in closed beta is now one of the biggest hits I've been a part of in a very long time."
Positive,"Even if you never played a MMO before and don't plan to, this game has enough single player quests and other content in it to keep you busy for many many hours. If it's on sale for 50% off or more, buy it."
Positive,Play it as an mmo not as es6. p good tons of content
Positive,"You Know you want it, so just get it."
Positive,"the steel birds descend upon us, weep for those who are still living"
Positive,"Awesome game!  Great combat, questing is fun, beautiful landscape, a lot of ways to level in the game especially after the One Tamriel update (Basically gave every player the freedom to do to whatever the fuck they want).  10/10 would definitly recommend!!!!!"
Positive,"A beautiful game and fun fantasy romp, if you enjoy the Elder Scrolls series there is plenty of material to remind you of the preceding games and to unveil more of the world they are set in.  Coming to the setting fresh, it's a varied and colourful world where you can explore and adventure either alone or in groups.  Compared with other MMOs I've found the crafting to be particularly engaging."
Positive,"Last MMO I played was a long time ago with Dark Age of Camelot.  This one is leaps and bounds ahead of that old game but still reminds me somewhat of the vibe of that game.  I am also a Skyrim Modder and this game is simply amazing if you really like the lore side of Skyrim.  One of the biggest attraction of Skyrim is moddability and this being an online game, you can't really mod it and it is here that ESO diverges the biggest from Skyrim (IMHO), no longer can I change the game rules to my liking, its their rules or the highway.  Fortunately, the rules aren't bad and you can't mod Skyrim to include the whole of Tamerial even if you tried, so this is an amazing experience any Elder Scroll Fan should try.  Oddly, even though I am playing this with a buddy of mine, I can see this as an excellent Solo experience in terms of Roleplay Let's Plays, the quests are crazy numerous, sure some of them are predictable and linear with simple binary options at most, but I can still see a large roleplaying opportunity in there with all the interesting stuff to find.  I also found the combat to be a lot more engaging than Skyrim, the world levels with you, which was annoying in Skyrim without mods, but seems to work much better here, as I would be totally lost to where I can gold without it.All in all, a really good game.  Its still early days yet, its an MMO so its back to the grind."
Positive,"Im really new to this game, 10hours in and I just learned how to use traits.. I dont dare go indept with this review but what I can say is this: If you wish to take the game ""seriously"" you better read a fuckton of guids because im on my 6th char and just barely got him right for the role I wish to play. The game itself is fun and mesmerizing (steam doesnt have spellcheck so I apologize for the shit ton of grammatical errors) but it requires commitment if you dont want to play it like an ordinery elder scrolls game (which you can).The best part about the game is that it is very toaster friendly, I bought my oven 7 years ago and it has 4gb ram some i3 processor probs from the first series and an old GTS card. You can pretty much modify everything and currently im running textures on high with everything else either disabled or on low. Definetly worth the buy and I suggest purchasing a membership as well simply because of the exp boost and the access to the crafting bag which is a life saver..not to forget about the crowns you get!10/10 would wait another 6 months for a steam sale!"
Positive,"I will recommend it. I played WoW for years and decided to leave MMO's all together. I listened to the negative stuff about ESO for a while so avoided it.Then I felt like just giving it a go. It was pretty good. Here I am about three years later... the game is getting a little stale for me but I continue to play it here and there. I think deep down that MMO's are just not my thing anymore. They all seem to have the same inherant flaws and ESO is no different.I currently feel the DLC are lack luster. The quests for them and the characters involved are very shallow. It's better than WoW's 'go fetch 10 of this' quest that hasn't changed for a decade though. Still, I feel there is a huge missed opportunity with storytelling and questing in this game. It just feels so bland compared to the other Elder Scrolls single player games.So, is it worth it? Well, get it on sale for 20 bucks... or less if possible and don't subscribe - just use character slots as mules and play one class you like and forget about doing everything here... it just isn't worth it.The Morrowind Expansion was sort of ho-hum. It looks nice and everything but the story was short. Some questlines were good, some not so much so. The Warden class, unless you really crave a bear or to be a frost mage, doesn't justify it for me. The land of Vvardenfell is detailed by a lot of land is just left unused which is a crying shame.Thieves Guild / Dark Brotherhood DLCs - worth getting for the passives - storylines are OKishWrothgar (Orsinium) - worth one playthroughImperial City - pvp only, I could care less.Those Dungeon DLCS - never tried them. if you subscribe, run them once for achievements and don't bother to waste the crowns to own them (crowns are the ingame currency)Crown Store - mostly just visual things to buy. I get stuff every once in a while to support the game when not subscribed but the some of the items, usually mounts, seem very overpriced.Crown Crates - A SCAM. Out to take your money. Avoid like the plagueIn the end, the whole thing will feel like a job with daily quests with meager rewards that make you feel like a field slave and ask yourself why you're even playing it (then again, World of Warcraft felt the same for me towards the end). My recommendation is to never play an MMO again and save youreself the time and money for other games in different genres (normal rpg, strategy, survival... anything really)."
Positive,"I actually really like this MMO plenty of content (Quests, Zones and Dungeons) with first persaon combat and nice music. Ignore what you've heard and give it a try! who knows, you might actually enjoy it."
Positive,"one day on random city, A male Khajiit say something stupid.. he's say ""if you don't have something to say , say nothing!"" turn arround hide on shadow, and this one send this poor stupid to sithis!"
Positive,Probably my favourite MMO i have ever played.  I have played countless hours and have enjoyed every minute of it.  The game has so much content it is impossible to finish no matter how long you play for and is a really good buy.9/10
Positive,"This is not Skyrim. You will not skill up like you would on Skyrim. You have to join the Mages Guild to get your Persuasion skill and the Fighters Guild to get your Intimidation skill. People yell about this a lot in the public chat. For everything else, there's Google and Add-Ons. 11/10 would roam the internets again for Injectors and ENB presets because for crying out loud, Bethesda, this thing is a wee bit fugly. I'd recommend this because I need people to bomb around in dungeons with. Everything is so much more scarier than necessary when you have a pokey hand-me-down armor and a bargain-bin, dodgy staff."
Positive,"I didnt like this  game much when i started playing but just went along with the gameplay, After completing the whole story thought i was pretty much done with it but then i felt that i dont have a badass gear still so started working on it. 2.5k hrs ingame later I STILL DONT HAVE EVERYTHING.11/10  worth it"
Positive,"I feel inclined to leave my personal review of the game, seeing as its rating has dropped dramatically thanks to trolls and idiots during this free weekend. If you are looking for Skyrim Online, this probably isn't the game for you. This is a (very good) MMO with Elder Scrolls (NOT JUST SKYRIM!!!) lore and skins. I won't deny that the release of the game was, as far as I know, fairly rough, but I'm now playing it and having a blast playing with a couple of friends."
Positive,Ok so i have been playing this game for a good while now only started 2 weeks ago but man can i say that i am massively impressed with how well written the story/lore of the missions. The combat feels rewarding and there is just soooo much to do. I totally suggest buying this game for anyone who enjoys MMORPG's :D
Positive,"I was a beta tester for ESO but then i didnt get the game at the start cause it didnt agree with me( still lots of performance bugs, random crashes and fps drops, massively op builds, cyrodil was basicaly a joke etc.)When they ended the subscription needed to play plan and tamriel unlimited came along i got the game and honestly it feels like whole another game on the same maps, i think i dced twice in the whole time playing.I can honestly say this game is great and it offers a real challenge in some areas(and i mean the good kind of challenge) and its realy fun to playP.S. btw when i got it the Steam version had some problems with loging in, so i play from ESO client from the siteP.S.S last i heard the 1st download in steam is very old, so you will download 13GB and then patch around 20GB, so if you let it patch overnight its ok otherwise getting the game from ESO site  save you arounf 10-15GB of download"
Positive,"pretty good MMO. I play skyrim and guild wars 2, i wanted this game to be a mix of both and thats what it is, not quite to what i wanted but its still really good! its fun challenging and similar to skyrim and guild wars. however the game has some stuff that you can only do with a membership, like most MMO's, but its still a great game. and there is no monthly membership unless you want the premium which isn't worth it in my opinion."
Positive,"I like this game, it is fun, and exploritive. Elder Scroll fans will feel pretty familiar with the game mechanics. However, I really just can't shake the feeling that the owner of Bethesda and the owner of Blizzard Entertainment sat down, rolled a blunt and got super blazed. This game was birthed with the phrase: ""aaaayyyy bruh. what if. what iffff. follow me now. what if... Skyrim and WoW.... like had a baby. And that baby was like a hybird Skyrim/WoW baby."" to which Blizzard replied: ""dude. *passes blunt* lets get some Jimmy Johns and crank this bitch out.""Worth the $31 I paid for it. I would not have enjoyed it had I paid the full price at launch, but it certainly delivers when you feel like just grindin' for loot and money, and don't want to dig out Skyrim. I am not to the point where I am social yet, and I feel like there are raid systems for dungeons and pvp in place, but I am under level 10. Ill give it 4.99/5. (-.01 because I have yet to be told my purpose, or it lacks a goal setting system type-deal.)Noteable Pros:-Graphics are pretty great, maybe just a smidge under what skyrim was, which is great for an mmo.-Combat can be simple, or invasive, your choice.-Nice community from what I can tell.-Guilds-F2P (with inital purchase first, of course) with option to purchase DLC's and cosmetics and mounts-Has a nice tutorial that isnt annoying as shit, and is sweet and to the point. Everytime you open a menu for the first time, it has a pop-up with maybe 2 paragraphs explaining all you need to know, and then it will go away and leave you alone. you dont even have to accknowledge it.-The voice acting and sounds are spectacular. Best I have seen hands down.Peev Cons:-Weapons and armor are kind of bland until you get WAAAY up in them levels. Reminds me of Rift's style stuff.-I was a hardcore mode Skyrim/Obliv/Morrow player, and this is way too easy for me, and it has no difficulty setting, but I     am forgiving since its an mmo. -Feels very empty, like it's lacking in content, or just creativity, perhaps too spread out???All in all, it was worth the $31 i paid. Its addictive, and pretty fun. Make friends in it asap though, or it will get dull. This game would make a Skyrim/WoW fan pretty happy."
Positive,Amazing.  getting close to a thousand hours of gameplay. It seems i cant stop playing. The best Elder scrolls so far
Positive,"Probably the best game i've every played, it brings TES to a new level, a more epic level. The only bad things is that you cant get into cloud ruler temple :P"
Positive,Loving this game now that it has gone B2P. The pressure has gone from leveling and i find the game very relaxing now and I really am enjoying playing 3.5/5
Positive,"I started playing when they took away the subscription fee, and gosh dang we need to change these reviews to positive!"
Positive,"Great game, has gone thru a lot of improvements and with the coming of patch 1.6 it's going to get even better. And the B2P model just like GW2 I see this game might around for a while."
Positive,"This game is insane !!! I HIGHLY recommned this ! Especially if u got a family member or a close friend that will play with you too.. My cousin and I enjoy this and haven't really stopped playing since we got it.. (Yesterday) I used to play skyrim on playstation (Story mode version) and it is simular, however its different in many aspects. The fighting is the main one but I like it here.. More skill based I would say. I really love this game ! <3"
Positive,"I had bought this game and I was so juiced to start playing it. Plugged in my 360 controller to my PC and... nothing happened.  Great game for the little bit that I'ved played, but I'm somewhat distraught that I had assumed that the game would be 360 controller to PC compatible."
Positive,"I've been playing a lot of CSGO lately and decided it was a time for a change, that change being The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited. The only other MMORPG I have ever played was WoW and that is what I expected. ESO def did not meet those expectations but for the greater good. The PvP is amazing, I cannot get enough of it. I def recommend this. 10/10"
Positive,One of the best games I have aver played. For sure when your with allot of friends.
Positive,ALTHOUGH THE PVP IS HACKED TO DEATH SADLY.
Positive,I have tried a lot of MMORPGS and this is by far my favorite
Positive,"PVE dungeons, trials world bosses and basically always something to do I give this an A+ PVP battlegrounds and open world Cyrodiil imma just go with nope.Game still has random small glitches like invisible walls but I've only seen this once in one dungeon and there have been other weird things like teleporting through doors due to timing that shouldn't be possible but no major flaws other than that. I'm quite sure much of the player base in PVP are still running macros and other small cheats. You will also frequently see bots running around in some of your favorite grind locations, report them for a solid month and maybe ZOS will ban em. Overall it's not a bad game, quite the challenge in some aspects, single player trials and PVP being the hardest. I love the flexability of the different classes in the game. I'm writing this after about 1500hrs played."
Positive,Over 800hrs on PS4. This game is amazing on all platforms. Long live ESO
Positive,Its a fun game
Positive,"Having sunk almost 400 hours into Skyrim and doing every fucking quest possible let me say this is the goddamn game I've been waiting for. Absolutely love it. Not gonna say it's perfect, but it's definitely a damn good time. And far far better than it's Beta days. 9/10"
Positive,"Do not expect Skyrim: Online from this. (ironically, it does have skyrim as a region,however.)For the best experience get the latest Chapter, this usually includes all previous chapters and thus gives you acces to a LOT of regions, which in turn means a lot of content. This game will easily give you thousands of hours of content, i'm almost 200 hours in and have barely scraped the surface. I HATE MMORPG's, but this game perfectly strikes the sweet spot between Elder Scrolls game and MMO, delivering a rewarding, satisfying experience for elder scrolls fans. The game does not have the typical ES leveling system that allows you to fully create your own class,rather, it has a couple classes that are widely customizable. Every single one of the classes can be played in at least 3 different ways; tank, healer, and dps. Most of these also have a ton of hybrids and creative freedom in mixing and matching. With that also comes the fact that every weapon and armor type have their own skill-lines, every Skill can be ""morphed"" into a special variation (e.g exploding skeleton from necromancer can be morphed into a faster, more damaging version or into a version that deals disease damage and uses stamina rather than magicka). If you buy the latest chapter, you don't get ALL of the DLC, as some minor questlines and dungeons have to be bought sepperately (thieves guild, dark brotherhood,...) while others ARE included, such as the fighter's guild and mage's guild.ESO+ will grant you acces to all DLC including the afforementioned ones, excluding the latest big chapter. (Previous big chapters such as BLACKWOOD are included, however).Subscribing to the service also grants a bunch of advantages such as slightly more exp,gold and progression, a bigger inventory and you get a lot of extra ""free"" premium currency which you can use to purchase some of the chapters you like, or save up for something like cosmetics.TL;DR:Don't expect a 1:1 Elder scrolls experience, but if you give it a bit of time and experimentation, the setting and world will offer tons of variable content that most ES fans will love."
Positive,"I tried this game in the beta and didn´t like it that much, moastly because the character in 3d person was too small for my taste. Trying it now it feels like a totally different game, 1st person is awsome and 3d person character is much bigger, It reminds me alot of Skyrim.The best with this game is that it has no monthly fees and still gets updatedI really recommend this game"
Positive,"When the game first came out, I was not enthused. I came back to try it and it is really amazing.Takes a bit of effort to learn the system. Feels good and I'm happy they have enough settings to allowyou to position the 3rd person camera. Having it offset at first over the shoulder to where it was at defaultwas terrible. However, with some minor updates it is great.Game feels good, touches that nostalgia factor and overall has a lot of great features.Fully voiced everything is amazing."
Positive,"I was wandering around the town with my lads, having a blast.Suddenly a naked Argonian approached us with an offer we couldn't refuse....I paid him to dance naked in public for 50 gold10/10"
Positive,Still one of the most casual-friendly MMOs on the market and with years of stories available to enjoy and multiple game modes to choose to participate in.
Positive,Best MMO. No need to play anything else. Just delete your library and get ESO+. That is all!
Positive,"The game feels great and has a good leanring curve, especially for returning fans of the elder scrolls. A good mix of RPG and MMO elements are used to make en experience that is satisfying."
Positive,Works fine for me on steam.
Positive,"To quote The O' Jays: ""Money Money Money Money"". If you like spending money on a game, oooh boy do I have a game for you. Other than that, the gameplay is pretty good. Other than the balance patches."
Positive,Ok so this is a tricky one.... yes I like the game. It's awesome and a lot of fun. However playing alone can become tedious and take the fun out of the game. Sure you probaly can play it alone if you really wanted to and there is a lot to do... I'm still working on getting to level 50. But I would recommend you find others to play with. Join a guild. That way you can enjoy everything the game as to offer and take on dungeons with fellow players.
Positive,"So much yes, not only if you love Skyrim (which I dont even that much *GASP* I know lol) but if you like an mmorpg for everyone. Yes, you solo players especially ^^ This game is not only full of story and lore, but full of group and solo content, exploration, player driven economy (it works great), over 20+ houses to buy and decorate, 5 guilds you can join at the same time, not to mention npc guilds as well with their own story and lore, gathering and crafting (my fav of every other mmo out there), own pvp map and instanced pvp, great endgame and much more. If you buy the base game its free to play after that except for the multitude of dlcs and expansions, but if you get the ESO Plus sub, not only does it give you great perks but unlocks everything up and till the latest expansion. Also gives you crowns which is the store currency. No P2W aspects. Classes is unique, as in every class has its own 3 skill lines and every weapon you pick up has as well, even the npc guilds have one and pvp. You can wear any armor and use any weapon and swap as you like. Same with skill points, etc...pay a small gold fee (in game currency) and you are a blank page ready to try a new build. I love this game, so many many stuff to do and see, so many treasure chests to lock pick lol. So many quests to keep you busy. Either alone or in a group. Really caters for everyone, the solo, the group junkie, the pvp'er,  the gatherer/crafter/gold maker or the achievement hunter."
Positive,"It honestly took several attempts for me to get into this game over the years. I'm not sure if thes recent changes that hve made it more enjoyable, or the fact that learning curve is a bit of a stumbling block to entry. I'm still by no means an expert or even a compitent player, but I'm having a lot of fun playing the game. It has all of the things I Did like about Elder Scrolls: Oblivion & Skyrim, and very few of the parts that I didn't like. You don't have to be a massive fan of the previous Elder Scroll games to get this one, but it probably would help if you had a little background. The games tutorial lasts too long, but once you get through it and start exploring it for the sprawling MMO it is, it really opens up to your own personalisation of the experience. You don't have to be a Mage to join the mage guild, you don't have to do anything except the parts you want to do. I do recomend that new comers join a guild early on. Each player can join 5 guilds that are shared over all characters.  Different guilds have different purposes, So start by getting yourself a casual social guild, which will allow you to make friends and really enjoy the game. Save the other four guild slots for purpose guilds. There is no Global Auction House in ESO. You can buy things from Guild Traders, in place all over Tamriel. Trading Guilds hire these NPC's to allow non-guild members to buy from their Guild Stores. So joining a trading guild will give you access to not only a Guild Store (Basically a Mini Auction House, but with set prices) but also a Guild Trader that offers the goods you list to other, non-guild member, players. There also Dedicate guilds to PVP and other content types. My Main Gripes with the game are User Interface based. It's not fantastic. I've seen, and enjoyed games with worse, but it takes a while to get used too. I recomend Keybinding to your own comfort, and checking out websites like ESOUI for Addons and Interface Mods to make the game more Managable. Every Player should get HarvestMap and Download the live Map of Nodes for Crafting Materials, as many of them are heard to see in game. There are also plenty of apps for crafting, navigation and ui re-design. Overall, play how you enjoy playing, and you'll have a great time. you may just have to grit your teeth and bare it to get through the tutorial, especially if this is not the first time you've used a mouse."
Positive,"I just love this game! I have spent many hours leveling up a main character and several alts. There are several reasons it has captivated me-the graphics are very clean, realistic- there is a mix of questing, killing, crafting, solving puzzles, and exploring that makes the game well rounded. Since I am mainly a solo player, I like the fact that I can play solo most of the time and sometimes when things get a little hairy, someone jumps in to help and we both get credit for killing the boss or group and we don't have to be in a party to benefit. That is cool! At first, I didn't like the mail system and thought there should be physical mailboxes, but now I like the idea I can get my mail from anywhere and don't have to be in a town to receive or send. One thing I would like to see is a mini map. It is kind of annoying that I have to bring up a big map to see where I am going. I am getting used to the pointer system on the bar at the top of the screen. I have learned to bring up the map on the fly...but be careful you don't run into a bad guy while doing so. I haven't devoted too much time yet to crafting and would like to pursue that more. I do like that the world is an open space and I can do and go pretty much where I want. I feel that the developers have spent much time listening to their players on what they like and I look forward to continuing my ever-expanding, never-ending adventure."
Positive,I honestly didn't think I was gonna enjoy playing this as much as I do. I went out of my comfort zone a little when making my character because I'm used to being a main tank but I picked to play as a sub-tank and a dps
Positive,"Yes, dont be fooled if my hours are low! This game has alot more than you think."
Positive,One of the best MMO as far as i played in 2017
Positive,SO MUCH CONTENT IM DROWNING IN IT OMG THIS GAME IS SO GOOD
Positive,I know it's not much of a review but I love this game.
Positive,ESO housing go crazy :)
Positive,my grandma is dead
Positive,"I've been playing this game for a few years now and even now there's ALWAYS more to do, which I love. I can spend hours working on a house, or I could go do dungeons with friends. It really always stays exciting especially with things constantly changing. This can unfortunately be difficult for beginners but anything can be learned by simply asking people, joining guilds or googling questions. On top of this, I really love the community. I've met so many awesome people in the game to the point of even meeting them in person, and I've had the opportunity to build my own community and it's my pride and joy. It really just adds to the endless feeling of the game where I can escape and live the way I want to!I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants more out of Elder Scrolls, or anyone in general who wants to have endless hours of exploring along with a great community to make friends. I'll be playing for a good long while yet!"
Positive,I like that they make having alts fun and not a grind.
Positive,A wonderful MMO game with a shortage of Tanks and Healers. Mostly Tanks. Good luck queuing up a dungeon as a DPS
Positive,Digital D&D on steroids
Positive,"Enjoyable. Just do not  buy loot boxes,"
Positive,only mmo that I almost got late game too.
Positive,"Just beat the tutorial, seems like a good game so far."
Positive,"A beautiful port of Skyrim and its predecessors to the online medium. The quests are interesting, diverse, and tell great stories. Huge maps to explore and conquer and some really nasty dungeons for you to delve with your friends. Highly recommended."
Positive,"Watch out, don't say any kind of insult or anything offensive in zone chat because that violates TOS. I am now a bethesda convinct, a zenimax criminal. I was perma banned and you will be too if you don't follow The very pc community. the slightest slip up, the smallest ounce of trash talk to people will get you banned faster than you can comprehend. It started off with my characters names, Fat bich, killen people, Tyrone Bigcrotch, I was forced to change, conform to new names. I am like iron I don't bend, so when i changed my names they were equally offensive. Not taking it serious at first I continued my criminal activities, till the life finally caught up to me (after 1 day). It started with a slap on the wrist, then a 3 day suspension(all administered withen 2 days). Now I'm perma banned. Don't be like me because it's not worth the life. They will headhunt you, bringing up past offenses and going through days of chat logs to make sure you get banned. I have been playing this game for 2 weeks, and owned it for much longer and its all gone now Good thing this game is on sale right now"
Positive,"I found this game super fun. After 7 years of other MMO this game was nice change. Battle is fun and quests are not boring too! Great dialogs and voice actors. Also world design and music are also very good.What I found negative is UI design, since game advertise itself as a MMO. That type of game atracts many people from other games that are MMOs, like many from WoW and LOTRO went for ESO too.  In other words probably many raiders went to test it which means they need infos on UI. By default UI is almost empty which is ok, you can turn on some stuff to follow info. But for group play game really missing some stuff which dont exist at all in game, like mini map (so you can quickly see where are your party members, it is small thing but can help a lot).I dont like using plugins but saw on youtube that many people use them which seems like players really do need some more info about fight and group.All in all, game is still fun and I found it as positive experince."
Positive,"honestly i love this game. ive played quite a few MMOs and there is alot here to do. that being said, this game is like most MMOs with a toxic community."
Positive,"Hard to get into at first, though I'd only recommend playing it with friends as it can be dull playing it solo"
Positive,"No one really reads the reviews, so i'll say that i'm gay. B)"
Positive,"First and Formost is that I love this game... I own all the DLCs.... it has great graphics, a very rich story line and best of all you dont have to pay  monthly for the subscription, if you dont want too... unlike WOW where you have to pay $14.99 a month the just to play the game and that doesnt include the over priced expantion packs.... ot the fact that the good mounts are $25+ .... this game gives you all that WOW does but for some much less......"
Positive,"My review is actually quite mixed here. I love the game, the grpahics are great, the community is friendly and large, the quests are compelling and fun, the music is gorgeous, the environments are immersive and the monsters are awesome. I love the game, more even than Skyrim itself, and I've poured years into that game. ESO has quickly climbed to become a favourite of mine.What I hate about ESO is the staff and customer service, as well as the Steam-to-ESO communications. Recently, I have had issues after the two most recent patches that render me unnable to log in. I recieve an error saying that ESO or Steam cannot initialize a connection or something similar, and I can't do anything other than sit on the main menu.My game runs like a dream, when it can actually run. I can play the game on high graphics with no stuttering or issues, so when I went to customer service to see why I couldn't log in, I was extremely upset when my ""helper"" took one look at my graphics card and shoved me aside, pinning the issue on my card and hoping to call it good. I felt like this was incorrect, and when I told my partners, they thought that my ""helper"" gave me a bullshit answer so that they wouldn't have to help me. So I asked for further help, recieved the same assitant that told me my card was the problem, and recieved even more information that I couldn't use. Frustrated, I simply reinstalled the game (up to a total of 4 days to download now because its such a big game and it takes almost 2 days each time) and that fixed it, I was able to play all day long. After telling ESO that reinstalling fixed it, I received complimentary gifts from the staff as compensation for bad service. Sadly, the same issue has occrued today after the patch. I cannot log in because of a communication issue between Steam and ESO. I don't believe I will get help if I ask the ESO team again, and Steam straiaght up tells me int he ticket menu that they cannot (read: will not) help me. I may have to download it a thrid time (6 days of downloading just to play for a few hours when I can) and that isn't an exciting prospect. I hope Steam and ESO figure out what is wrong, because it's making me not want to play a game that I love and that I've only had for 10 days (4 days if you dont count the 6 days of downloading I've had to do.)If you want to buy the game, I say go for it! It is great and fun and wonderful! Just do not buy it here on Steam. Save yourself the trouble I'm going through and just buy the game on the ESO website."
Positive,"Bethesda has taken the best elements from all the most popular MMO's and integrated them into the universe of The Elder Scrolls. Roam all your favourite parts of Tamriel from the series, join all your favourite societies and guilds, and make your mark in this Era as Molag Bal aims to take over the world.I have a champion 160+ High Elf Mage part of the Dominion. My main archetype is a healer, I output up to 24k damage block for people around me and 5k+ per second healing.Pro's:- Easy to understand Interface- Voice acting on 90% of the NPC's- Full of Lore- RolePlay is present in the world from the Players- Seamless Realms (Minimal Load screens and travel time)- PvP is easy to get into and Not just part of the end game(Starts at Lvl10)- No Subscription- Crafting is as easy as it was in Skyrim- Trading & Market system is straight forward and easy to use- Good graphics engine- Lots of in game taunts- Use based experience system as found in Skyrim.Con's:- Micro-Transactions - (However it is Pay to GLOAT not Pay to WIN)- No warning of level 50 skill tree change unless other players provide insight or you read 100 guides.- Lots of Pricey DLC that limits your ability to play with friends if they dont have the same DLC- Limit of 5 spells per cast bar with only 2 cast bars accessible(1 per main weapon - Only 2 main weapons available) unless you activate a ""Destruction"" spell based ultimate that opens a 3rd cast bar(Spell must be active to equip spells into this slot)- End game quest progression becomes ambiguous(Have to research quest triggers from unrelated quests that need to be completed so you can finish your current quest - Does not naturally flow)Edit: Still going strong and still getting great updates. Much love to the Zenimax team"
Positive,"Played the Beta a lot, was upset to hear that they planned for a subscription but made up to see it free, just a shame i lost my characters at some point, got randomly deleted with no reasoning to why! But overall this game is addictive and fun as hell, i mean, ITS ELDER SCROLLS BUT MMO! What is not to like about that.The Crafting does seem almost pointless though... also too easy."
Positive,"(Steam wasn't tracking my playtime for the first couple of days for some reason. I have well more than 3 hours in the game.)I was terrified of playing this game. First it was the simple fact that I never wanted an Elder scrolls MMO, and the fact that I typically hate MMO's in general. I've tried several and I simply cannot get into them. Then it was the price, 60 dollars retail plus a monthly subscription. Then it was the early reviews which were horrible. But now that it was on sale for 20 bucks and there is no mandatory subscription, I figured what the heck, at least I can explore for a bit and if I don't like it, I can refund it. I can say with confidence that this game is super fun to play. It doesn't have the typical steep MMO learning curve, it looks great, it plays great and I have had a great experience playing almost exclusively in singleplayer. People that play the elder scrolls will get the majority of the systems right away, The skills system isn't hard to learn and the way they incorporate traditional Elder Scrolls elements into it creates a game that feels like an Elder Scrolls game and it's own thing at the exact same time. I have no regrets over this purchase, and as a purist that loves singleplayer Elder Scrolls and never wanted to see ""Skyrim online"", after playing it I can only recommend it."
Positive,"Is it a GOOD MMO? Yes. (And I got 10000 of hours in WoW, 1000s in Black Desert (Private Servers) and a few 1000s in Destiny 1+2.) Does it got flaws? Yes.Do I keep finding enjoyable ways to enjoy the game and new avenues for fun after 1000 hours? Yes.If you want lore, its here.If you want big PvP battles, its here.If you want hard PvE combat, its here.You wanna FISH? FOR MONEY? it's here.You wanna collect all the things? Oh gaud, its here.You just wanna chill in a basement with a **** catman? Its here.If you do want cool mounts for playing the game, it's not here tho. Most of the things that makes you say ""wow, I want that!"" are in the cashshop, and MOST OF THOSE ITEMS are locked behind lootboxes. Had a guildie buy lootboxes (for gold) that equaled about $4800 before he got the mount he wanted.I wish a bit more features where account wide and much much better reward structure but other than that I've had a good ol ride, and I think I'll keep having a good run even with a bad patch looming in the next few weeks.Cya In Crag or in Kryddodill."
Positive,After playing in beta i felt this game was ok to fair but would struggle to justify a subscription. The conversion to buy to play has made this game well worth picking up on special although I would struggle to pay the standard price for it. Hopefully an influx of players will give the game more opportunity to fix and add to what is still fairly bare bones. (even the big games like World of Warcraft started out at this point.) The feel of the game is somewhere between Morrowind and Skyrim with each improvment pushing it closer to skyrim. It could really do with a more open class system like skyrim instead of the class+ weapon combo it has atm but I suspect that is a major overhall that they wont have the $ to do. In lieu of that adding more classes(the warden leaps to mind) and expanding the weapon skills out some more.Over all - good game - pick up on steam sale
Positive,"""There is an urgent task for you!""""The guild has need of you, comrade!""""Comrade, a word!""""The Guild requests your help!"""
Positive,"It's overall a cool game to play. However, the in game currency is poop."
Positive,"One of the best MMOs I've ever played. Has incredibly deep lore, questing, and combat. Really respects your time and encourages you to take it slow. I will be playing this one for a long time."
Positive,only true nords play eso
Positive,Highly recommend! Tons of content to the point where it seams a little overwhelming but in a good way! i will say the interface is a little wonky and takes a little getting used to. I would definitely advise getting some Ad-ons if your are playing on PC.
Positive,"My friends gifted me this game to try it out. This review comes from the perspective of someone who NEVER touched an MMORPG besides 12 hours in total at World of Warcraft.The game is incredibly fun with and without friends. The community is dedicated to almost everything that the game offers. You can easily find a PvP match with people that can help you learn the game, hop at some dungeons to earn rewards and xp, trade items to get incredibly more gold than you would get from selling from npc merchants or even find even smaller niche communities that are still fun to participate with!I fell in love with the housing system the game offers. It is obviously something you will do in the late game once you made a good build for your character, because it needs lots of grinding for money, achievements and some other small quests to get most furniture, but the building is so enjoyable and accessible to do i couldn't keep myself away from it. It has simple controls but you can still make everything with the furniture you can get for your house. I made my own stone fencing for my garden by using the stone blocks i got from buying a house!Besides that, it was kinda hard to get into at first because its my first actual mmorpg experience, which meant i had to learn a whole new game genre + what ESO has to offer by itself. To be honest, it wasn't that bad! I got into the hang of it quite easilly by getting guided by some kind strangers. Even at the first 10 minutes of my game i got a guy from turkey to help me defeat my first boss! The community mostly is pretty kind and it motivates you keep playing the game knowing you will have nice encounters like these.The only bad thing i wanted to mention is how a good chunk of the good content is behind a dlc, but if you look on it from an another perspective the developers are really generous. Their dlcs are cheap and offer hours of content, while also give free dlcs at least once or twice per year from what i've seen! The campaign story for the dlc expansions is 100% better than the base game story, which from where you look at it from, you can see it as a good deal knowing you are getting something better to look on. Imagine you already liking the base game and then you realize your progression will lead to even more fun!One last thing to mention is that you can get most items/furniture from dlcs by other players by just buying it/trading it from trader guilts. Saved me lots of time and money for the time being.In conclusion i wanted to say it is an amazing game to start your journey on the mmorpg genre and just in general a well-worthwhile game for the long term. Hope the review is somewhat useful for whoever is considering getting the game!"
Positive,"As a dedicated fan of The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) since 2016, my journey through Tamriel has been nothing short of extraordinary. This game perfectly marries the rich lore and immersive world-building of the Elder Scrolls series with the dynamic, social gameplay of an MMO, creating a captivating experience that continues to evolve and expand. World and Exploration  ESO transports you to the breathtaking, expansive world of Tamriel, where every region is meticulously crafted to reflect the unique cultures and landscapes of the Elder Scrolls universe. From the rolling hills of Cyrodiil to the volcanic plains of Morrowind, exploration is both rewarding and awe-inspiring. The game encourages players to delve into hidden caves, ancient ruins, and bustling cities, each filled with quests, treasures, and lore that deepen your connection to the world. Story and Quests The narrative in ESO is a major highlight. The main quest lines are engaging and immersive, featuring compelling characters and epic story arcs that draw you into the struggles and triumphs of Tamriel. Each expansion and DLC introduces new stories that are as rich and detailed as the base game. The Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, and Daedric Princes all make appearances, providing familiar faces and foes for Elder Scrolls fans. Combat and Gameplay Combat in ESO is fluid and dynamic, blending traditional MMO mechanics with action-oriented gameplay. You can choose from a variety of classes, each with unique abilities and playstyles. The skill system is flexible, allowing for deep customization and specialization. Whether you prefer to wield magic or brute force, ESO offers a combat experience that is both challenging and satisfying. Social and Multiplayer Experience As an MMO, ESO excels in fostering a vibrant and active community. Guilds play a central role, offering players opportunities for collaboration, trading, and social interaction. Group dungeons, trials, and world events like Dark Anchors provide numerous ways to team up with other players for cooperative play. The player-versus-player (PvP) combat in Cyrodiil and Battlegrounds adds another layer of excitement, where large-scale battles can shift the balance of power in the ongoing war between the game's factions. Graphics and Sound ESO's visual and audio design are top-notch. The game's graphics have aged well, with continual updates keeping the world looking fresh and beautiful. The sound design, including the atmospheric music and voice acting, enhances the immersion and brings the world to life. Continuous Updates and Expansions One of the most impressive aspects of ESO is its commitment to regular updates and expansions. Each year brings new content that expands the world, introduces new mechanics, and refines the gameplay. This continual growth ensures that there is always something new to explore and experience, keeping long-time players like myself engaged and excited for what’s to come. I have played it for almost 1000 hours and still have a lot to explore! Conclusion In conclusion, The Elder Scrolls Online is a must-play for fans of MMOs and the Elder Scrolls series alike. Its rich world, engaging storylines, dynamic combat, and vibrant community make it a standout title in the genre. Having played since 2016, I can confidently say that ESO has only gotten better with time, consistently delivering new and exciting content that keeps me coming back. Whether you're a seasoned adventurer or new to Tamriel, ESO offers an epic journey that you won't want to miss."
Positive,"Great Game. Great story. Every DLC have its own story and its magicial in its own way. After 1,5k hours on steam and 1,5k hours on official Bethasda luncher i can highly recommend that game. Going to play it again so anyone looking for help,advise or just friend to play just add me :) Im pvp content lover and pvp here is AMAZING!"
Positive,"It's is not a perfect game, but as a huge Elder Scrolls fan, there's no better way to get immersed in my favorite fantasy world, not as a protagonist or a destined hero, but just another random dude going on his own adventures along with the best online community i've ever experienced in a game."
Positive,"Best Story - Star Wars: The Old RepublicBest Community - Final Fantasy XIVBest Fashion - The Elder Scrolls OnlinePlayed a decent amount of all three and other MMORPGs. Having thought about it, I'd have to recommend this game for the Fashion. Has a Transmog/Glamour/Outfit system so you can customise your character's armour, tons of dyes to choose from and the game also goes in depth with stuff like adornments, face markings, body markings, different skins that make your body glow or make you look like a zombie. All of this can overlap one another so it's a pretty good system. Plus, the equipment actually looks decent in comparison to other MMORPGs with Transmog/glamour/outfit systems.Outfit styles and appearances like skins and body markings are locked behind achievements, which is a good thing IMO because it makes the outfit you put together feel more unique to you and impressive.The Outfit styles and appearances are also bound to your account, not character. So you just need to get the achievement once and you've got it forever on all your current and future characters, which is another big W."
Positive,Just starting to get addicted to it o.O
Positive,"I really dont understand why people say this game is bad. Its so fun, just because it wasnt another Skyrim, doesnt mean you have to be a gey boi and hate on it."
Positive,Great combat and detail. I can see a lot of work went into this! i reccomend high settings for a 640 graphics card. 10/10
Positive,Changing my review since I fell in love with this game since! ++++++
Positive,"I witnessed two people casually talking in Zone chat about how they really liked one specific brand of crisps/chips. Eventually they grow feelings towards one another and  those two decided two get married. I myself and many others from server were gathered around shrine of Mara, all dressed up in fancy clothing and were waiting there with the groom but alas the bride never showed up. Groom was heartbroken but as far as I know, he still continues to love those very crisps/chips that started that whole romance..."
Positive,"Played the Beta way back and left because I was disappointed. Now I was convinced by a colleague to try it out again. And wow, was it worth it!Right now, when writing this, I've played 24 hours (bought the game one week ago) and I've had a blast!Strengths:- Questsystem: no boring fetch quests. Even the side quests grip your attention. This also means no stupid grind but very enjoable leveling!- Voice acting: everything is voice acted, and the VA is great- Map: so much to discover. Prepare to get lost in the world!- Many crafting possibilities- Dungeons: other players will always be there to help you if you don't manage it. There is literally ALWAYS someone.- Many different class/race combinations, and therefore also skill combinations available- Levelsystem: due to the way they made it, every area of the game is available to you from the very start. Enemies level with you and you can fight together with players with a different levelDownsides (for me):- prices in the crownshop: I'd definitely consider buying things, but 20€ for DLCs when I'm also already buying addons for 20-30€ that actually bring new areas and quests to the game? I know that MMOs always have crazy pricing, but I will still complain about them (and boycott the premium shop).- Levelsystem: yeah, I said that it's great, but on the other hand I will never feel truly powerful because all enemies will always be on my level. I'd like to feel a bit stronger while I proceed. (Correct me if I'm wrong)And finally, my personal conclusion/recommendation:Buying the game for 30€ is absolutely worth it. Even if you won't continue playing for months/years, the quests/story is enough fun to make the game worth the money. If you have ESO Plus, you get all DLCs for free (for the month!). So, if you want to play them but don't want to spend an incredible amount of money, buy one or two months of subscription and play the DLCs."
Positive,"So ive put in a decent amount of time now and Figure id give this the old thumbs up. The game is huge, like insane and there are a ton of quests. I have 450 hours in as of this review and ive only scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. I told my wife the other day ""ive finally found the mmo for me."" any class can fill any roll if build correctly Thumbs upyou can build your character to solo most small scale content minus a few dlc dungeons which have mechanics that prevent this.There a a ton of cosmectics , amazing houses costumes, etc which can all be grabbed with in game work. Of course there are some houses that are 100$+ but if you are a cosmectic  junky like myself youll have no problem justifying the purchase.  All of the dlc can be bought piece by piece. I am subbed so its all included.subscription has a few benefitsincreased bank space and housing decoration capall but the newest dlc available for uselittle things like that  which go a long way when you are going to sink 1000's of hours into a game.support is responsive within 24 hours youll get a response.lets talk about whats really dreaded in mmo's toxcity. I have yet to find any of it. In fact i had to take a step back and say ""am i the toxic asshole in my life""?  huge rp community if thats your thinglots of raiding , trading , pvp guilds out there.If you are on the fence about buying this id say pull the trigger."
Positive,"I've played ESO, WoW, and FFXIV extensively, and hands down, this is my favorite MMORPG of the three. The world is beautiful, lore is fascinating, quests are immersive, combat is challenging, housing system is vast and creative, and the community is overwhelmingly friendly. It's a gem, honestly. I also think that the optional $15 monthly subscription is totally worth it. The only ""downside"" I can think of is the loot box system (gambling basically) and the amount of in-game purchases more generally. I say ""downside"" with scare quotes because the great majority of purchases are cosmetic and don't impact the game play at all. But they do advertise them frequently, and it is a bit annoying that players can't earn everything in-game."
Positive,Cel mai tare joc jucat de mine
Positive,ya this is amazing game
Positive,"It's definitly a good time to get into the game. If you start playing now you'll learn how2play and advance your account well enough for the release of Elyswer. The Elyswer update will release a new class to play that will basically revolutionize the combat experience, particularily in PvP.Highly reccomend if you're going to start a new MMO, you try this one, especially for the price they have listed on steam!"
Positive,"Just get the game! Trust me :)The combat is probabily the best on any mmorpg, fast (but not too fast), 9balanced(ish) and extremely fun!Graphics + visuals are great.Questing is actually engaging, with voice acting and not some long ass text telling you some story you can't really care about.Crafting system is solidEndgame PVE and PVP content is varied and satisfyingThe community is actually GREAT. Guilds are really helpful and I have rarely come across any disrespectful memebers.Iz ze good eh!"
Positive,"Jacko Rating 9/10 - Buy to Play Version ReviewWell to no one's surprise ESO's subscription model was a massive flop but they managed to turn off the greed gene and turn on the ole brain and release the BTP (buy to play) version before the game turned out to be a memory in most peoples minds.I was one of the masses that refused to buy this game and then pay per month even though I knew it woudl be an epic adventure.  Thanks to all those like me who were the direct reason ESO went BTP.The game itself is brilliant and has delivered a true adventure for those who enjoy RPGs and MMOs which this is marketed as.  Graphics are good but not great, though the environment is truely beautfiful and at some points you will stop and just gaze at the sunset or the beautiful view from the top of a mountian etc, its the layout and design more than the graphics that gives you such great moments.Audio is very well done and I love the vioce overs instead of reading text all the time.  Music is also very well done and it helps to immerse you in the game.The weaknesses are almost all to do with MMO bugs and protocols which experienced MMO game producers already know and have tweaked to perfection in their own MMO games.  As this is a first crack at the genre for an ESO game the final result is a bit below par when trying to quest as a group with your friends, especially if they are not 100% synced up to your mission progress and other little problems that become apparant when you try and play it as a traditional MMO.The best thing I can say after 100+ hours in game is that ESO will immerse you completely if you let it - Don't run through in a mad rush to get cheevos or other novelties, take your time and live each and every story to truely receive the benefits this game can give you.  If you are a bit of a solo MMO player and don't run with guilds all the time then this will really favor you.Massive maps, very nice combat that skilled players can take advantage of even when out leveled, mounts, pets and varied quests give the gameplay a very high rating and a lot of re playability in my view.Sooooo glad it went BTP so that all of us can enjoy the adventure in waiting.Fantastic - A True Adventure to be had here."
Positive,"This is my first time playing the game in about 7 years and I could not be having more of a blast. I've put a scary amount of time into this game since I bought it... I've barely scratched the surface of a single zone. Very happy to see rewards tuned up across the board, Twitch drop campaigns, this 10th anniversary event, solid bonuses for DLC purchases, etc. ESO is in a very good spot at the moment. It still scratches that MMO itch and provides fantastic additions to the lore of the Elder Scrolls universe. Most of the voice acting is solid. The newest class, Arcanist, is a hell of a lot of fun to play and you won't get carpal tunnel from spamming your rotation(s). The game hasn't introduced any new predatory mechanics,  outside of the craft bag from ESO Plus and the speed at which you upgrade mounts without paying. You can buy the full game for under $30 on sale. If you like Elder Scrolls, you should consider picking ESO up."
Positive,"I've had this game for many years now and thoroughly enjoyed the new releases and patches, as well as the fan support and love for the game. A very solid and interactive community with many adoring fans of the franchise. Worth every penny I put into it. And it was alot of pennies..."
Positive,"great with friends. Two of my friends and I have split up the grinding. I focused on alchemy, someone focused on smithing, and another person focused on enchanting."
Positive,One of the few MMOs that I repeatedly find myself coming back to.
Positive,It's one of the better MMO's.
Positive,this game literally grabbed my wiener and slurped me up like a walrus without teeth. would recommend.
Positive,"Love the game, Tho I do reccomend playing with a friend/s and using a 3rd Party VOIP application"
Positive,"ESO is exactly what you expect from a GRINDY MMORPG. It's got great graphics, a huge open world with lots to explore, tons of expansions and a lot of people play it, so you'll likely find a group if soloing isn't your thing. There's not really a whole lot of things this game gets wrong, so if your an MMO fan, you'll probably love this."
Positive,"Me two weeks ago ""Im so going to play and enjoy this game""Me today: ""Oh look another 10h maintenance""Also im certain Zenimax hate EU players.Its almost 2021, 5 years after the original comment. Zenimax still hates EU players."
Positive,"Hands down the best mmo I've ever played. Very expansive map, great community, enchanting gameplay.  The game is also quite visually stunning for the genre. I am also a controller gamer this greatly accommodates my need."
Positive,This is literally WoW with better graphics and far more fair rules regarding crafting and gathering. And I wouldn't have it any other way. Montly subscription is absolutely worth it and I don't regret any money spent on it.
Positive,"This is the closest you can get to the ""feel"" of tabletop role playing from a MMO. None of the silly Kill X of Y creature quests, they are all story based. Three cheers for the return of intelligent gaming!Well worth a try. Simple review9/10"
Positive,"For an UNFINISHED GAME, it's pretty good and has a lot of content150002233/100 :)"
Positive,Good fun! with or without friends! mostly friendly community.
Positive,Best questline immersion in any mmorpg
Positive,It's not bad anymore
Positive,90% Skyrim10% World of Warcraft
Positive,ATTENTION!! AFTER YOU BUY THIS GAME DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT USING STEAM!!!! JUST CANCEL IT!!!!This game is huge and game client of steam version is outdated!!!! This can cause many problem with patching (Which is fucking huge) and  launcher.Buy it and go to ESO website to download the game and use that installer instead.DO AS I SAID OR YOU WILL HAVE TO RE-DOWLOAD THIS GAME!
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is a game developed by ZeniMax Online Studios and Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda and is an MMO spin-off to The Elder Scrolls seriesThe game offers some nice graphics and a good aesthetic that really brightens and makes the game stand out and uniqueThe game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but an okay game nonetheless and ends just at the right timeThe Elder Scrolls Online overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is an good online RPG game to play in short bursts! REVIEW SOURCES:  None"
Positive,"I have to admit that after participating in beta in 2014 I knew, that ESO would not be a game that I will be playing. Back then with over 200 hours of play time in Skyrim and a short affair with Morrowind, and having such titles as Guild Wars 2, Star Wars: TOR as a mesuring stick... ESO fell short. Although maybe unfairly seeing as it was only a beta.However it served me well, as I bought and logged in now in late 2015. Without any expectations or preconcieved notions but knowing that it is not ""Skyrim Online"" I found the current game really enjoyable. I do need to mark here that I'm mostly a PvE'er (low lvl for now) and despite having a mount I travel across Tamriel on foot... as I came to conclusion that while more convenient, horses take out a lot of the wandering and discovering done in ESO:TU. The lore books lie around every corner, almost every container seen in game can be looted, NPC's mugged... And I have crafted equipement that is the best I could get for my lvl as I progressed I could and can easily solo most of the content... It slowly begins to feel like Skyrim.The two things that are a bit of a hassel for me personally so far are Guild Merchants and a bit slow Group Finder tool, but I can live with them. So all in all, I think it's a solid and trully enjoyable game as it is now."
Positive,"Fantastic world of fantasy to escape to. Highly recommend for any fantasy lover that is in search of deep lore, exciting adventures, amazingly designed landscapes and dungeons. This is truly the ultimate second life for a fantasy lover."
Positive,"Pretty much a stealing simulator. Me and my homies would spend countless hours going around towns and shops staining people. Some other fun aspects would be running from the guards and learning their attack pattern so after u steal shit u could off it almost flawlessly. Other fun aspect of the game were exploring new zones, doing world bosses with friends, and killing other player in duels and then hitting them with the t bag. overall the games really fun I would give it an 8.5/10"
Positive,"Game runs smoothly, plays great and has the best questing system i've ever seen. Tired of slogging through boring questing in WoW style mmo's, with their walls of text and boring fetch this and kill 10 of these? Look no further, as ESO's questing system mimics Elder Scrolls to a T, with fully voiced quests with real tangible storylines you actually want to pay attention too.  I actually am theroughly enjoying the leveling and questing part of this MMO which I haven't been able to say of anything for years. Usually the ""questing"" is just clicking through drab text boxes and trying to get to the ""end game"" where all the actual fun is. ESO is not like that, ESO is fun from the very first level, great for the kind of player who doesn't rush through all the content WoW style and actually wants to explore and quest and put some time into the game part.  Not the game for those who expect WoW/Wildstar style gameplay. ESO is a totally different beast from those types of games and if you enjoy those dungeon grinding style MMO's where it's all about grinding out for loot drops you will find none of that here in ESO. ESO also is a little weak in the group content, a lot of the quests seem very geared toward solo play, though you can do them grouped if you really wish. There are group dungeons and such though, and events which you must have groups for. This is either a bonus or a downside depending on your playstyle. I myself do not always have the free time to do all those big group raids and things, so this solo style play actually works well for me, but it may not be for everyone. This is a great game if you are a fan of Elder Scrolls or open world RPG's in general and want to be able to play that kind of game along side others; if you enjoy solo play and meaningful questing as well as exploration this is also the game for you. This will not be the game for you if you are looking for raiding and loot grinding ect type gameplay. It's just very targetted at a specific type of gamer, which isn't always a bad thing. I don't see why this title gets so much hate, i'm having a good time.**As of Steam Deck release, this game CAN be run on the steam deck but requires SIGNIFICANT tweaking to do so. I did not personally find it worth doing as this game takes up so much space on the deck it just doesn't feel at home there. Your milage may vary**"
Positive,One of my new fave Online MMOs
Positive,Very fun. 10/10
Positive,"UpdateBár már jó ideje nem játszom a TESO-val, de úgy gondolom adott annyit, hogy most 2023-ban is jelöljem ""LABOR OF LOVE AWARD Game of 2023""-ra.My LABOR OF LOVE AWARD Game of 2021"
Positive,the elder scrolls online is the greatest game of All Time
Positive,"after a long day working for the man all i wanna do is grab the finest grog, a sweetroll or two, and sit on my tushie for a couple of hours. this is escapism at its finest and sometimes you just need to feel like a hero."
Positive,"I'm definitely late to the party, having started to play ESO this year. At first I used to be somewhat sceptical, as I don't necessarily enjoy MMOs, but the more I played, the more enjoyable the experience kept becoming. Questlines are interesting, and a lot of the new lore is pretty good, too. Beautiful locations and soundtrack. As a side note, I think it's the only TES game with a crafting system that I actually like. :P"
Positive,"I only played this game on the Bethesda launcher, not on Steam. I have like 50 hours on ESO at this time.First of all I like to say that this game is not Skyrim Online, this is Elder Scrolls Online. This game has the appearence of an Elder Scrolls game, but has so much depth to it that no other Elder Scrolls game comes close to it.     Nice community (my experience)    Good combat (no stand still, cast and repeat combat)    Very good story    Every character has spoken dialogue, because of this dialogue the story gets much more depth    In depth crafting    In depth guild system/ economy system    Not a traditional MMO    Lots of dlc behind a paywall    Some events are locked to dlc area's    Lots of travelling and backtracking    Some addons should have been in the game    Login problems if you have ESO on Steam    Not a traditional MMOESO started with a bad launch and a lot of people got put off by that, but the game has grown over the years.If you have time to invest in a new game and like to learn more about the Elder Scrolls Lore this is game is for you. Also if you like to explore, combat and a nice story. But ESO plays different than any MMO I have played before, if you see through, you will see the gem hidden in this game."
Positive,"Gameplay is about what you'd expect from a regular Elder Scrolls game, so not that great, but a little bit better with AOE attacks and attacks that are best blocked. Being an MMO, though, it's all incredibly easy.PVP was pretty great at the start, but since the game became non-subscription, the PVP has become incredibly laggy. No matter how good my PC is and what my graphics settings are, I can't get more than 30 FPS in large scale battles. Also, th ey removed champion points for PVP, which made playing a ton and getting a ton of EXP worth something more.Anyway, if you enjoy Elder Scrolls for the lore, quests and that good ol' Elder Scrolls feel, this game is definitely worth a one time fee."
Positive,Awesome time to play alone and with friends  wholesome moments
Positive,it's not Skyrim but it still a good game I like it
Positive,"After having played many different MMORPG's, while I wouldn't say that this is the *best* one out there, I will definitely say that it's in my top three list, personally.  There's a lot of content that this game offers for anyone out there looking for a new MMORPG to play, such as:1.)  PvE, such as Raids, Dungeons, and World Bosses, all with varying levels of difficulty,2.)  By far the *best* Life-Skilling/Crafting system out of any other MMORPG that I've played to date.  Everything you make feels like it's made an impact, even if it's something that you would never equip.3.)  Grand PvP Content, ranging from GW2 like Faction versus Faction battles over keeps, to fast paced and hectic Battlegrounds.  4.)  An absolutely immense world to explore, with varying degrees of variety in terms of Biomes, Weather Types, Scenery, and much more.  The world feels very much alive as well, which is grand. And finally, 5.)  It still holds that some Elder Scrolls and Bethesda nature of games where you can just walk into a direction and find quests, ruins, or just in general tidbits to explore.  Regardless of what type of content you're looking for, I'd highly recommend ESO as a new MMORPG to pick up; it's casual enough to pick up and put down without feeling like you're leagues behind players who never quit, and it has just enough incredibly difficult content to cater to those who want a challenge."
Positive,"Easily one of the best MMOs out there. Here is my review of things people seem to care about, doing my best to remain objective.1) Combat is not tab targeting, and while it is not TRUE action combat, the dodge roll system combined with the active targeting system make it feel pretty close. Class builds are super varied and while there are always ""Meta"" builds, the game gives you a lot of option for leaving a personal mark by limiting your build to 2 bars of 6 skills, rather than ""Here are all the skills everyone else has, go online and find out the best rotation""2) The buff system was streamlined years ago, limiting it in good and bad ways. It also makes it very clear-cut and easy to understand regarding what you should be looking for in your build (A Source of Major Sorcery and Major prophecy, a way to get major expedition, etc).3) The amount of PvE content for solo players is absolutely insane. Tons and Tons of Quests, Delves, Public Dungeons, etc. 4) Cyrodiil is an amazing System for PvP, but it suffers from poor server performance and always has. Make no mistake, I still enjoy it most days. But there are issues there which ZoS seems unwilling to address. 5) Battlegrounds were added a while back and bring a completely different PvP Experience, so you now have an option for small scale PvP and Large Scale PvP6) There are a TON of dungeons, all with 2.5 levels of difficulty. Normal dungeons can be run of anyone of any level, more or less. Veteran Dungeons Require you to be Max Level. Veteran Hard Mode is a way to run the final boss in a Vet Dungeon for a chance at added rewards. This is not even counting things like Trials and Arenas for even more challenging PvE Content         6.5) The original dungeons from the base game are significantly easier than what they are releasing with their new content, they are really stepping their game up. 7) The gearing system gives a lot of ways for customization (obviously less and less as you get more and more ""Meta"", but there ARE a variety of GOOD options). It also is more forgiving than other games, allowing you to upgrade quality and change the sub-stats of gear with a slight grind. 8) The game is very forgiving for alts. Once you hit 50, the ""Champion Point"" system is account-wide, so you can start gearing up your character right away. You can also farm or craft the gear on your main character to just put in your bank for the alt to take, meaning the end-game grind for gear is a lot easier to manage.9) The Roleplaying community is also very strong if that is something you are in to, with tons of big guilds with lots of structure and events. Something for everyone. 10) ESO+. The optional subscription. It is worth it for most players because you get access to all DLCs (Not the newest ""chapter"" but that gets a bit weird to explain) you get the infinite storage crafting bag, and you get a small bonus to gold and experience from enemies. The craft bag alone honestly makes it worth it for most. The other thing you get is Crowns, the premium currency in the game, at the same rate you'd get for just paying the same amount for JUST crowns (a month is $15 and you get 1500 crowns. 1500 crowns alone cost $15). Speaking of this....11) The cash shop. I know people always loathe it, but it's there so I am going to talk about it. On the one hand, 95% of the stuff in there is completely cosmetic. The things that aren't are often so laughably ineffective that there is no point in paying real money for them. There are exactly 2 items on their that are things you can't get from just playing the game a lot, and now that they added the crown gifting system you can if you just save up the gold and find someone to make a trade. It isn't perfect, and if you're the kind of person who violently convulses at the mere mention of a premium currency shop, you should leave now because ZoS puts as much work into the crown shop as they do the actual game, for better or worse. That isn't to say it's a shit game with nothing but stuff for whales to buy. It is a great game, that just also has a really great cash shop that you can choose to go your entire ESO career not touching if you want, or you can even earn the gold to get whatever item it is you had your eye on in the cash shop.        11.5) The Crown crate system sucks ass, but that is ENTIRELY cosmetics. All their coolest stuff is locked                  behind loot crates now, and I hate gambling. They DO have a small amount of ""bad luck                  protection"" but you still end up spending a ton of money to get what you want. My only complaint. At the end of the day, I can't recommend the game highly enough. Every day that I log on it feels like there are so many things to do I couldn't possibly do them all.  I have been playing this game since before it was released on steam. I have made great friends on this game, and it is by far my favorite MMORPG to date."
Positive,I am now an expert in troubleshooting problems thanks to this games' update launcher
Positive,"Great gameplay , great quests , overall just a great game."
Positive,"Sometimes when I'm feeling... sad, I'll go into a highly populated area within the game and turn down all the sounds in the game except for the voice volume and have it on as background noise. Doing this makes me feel as if I'm in a social interaction for once in my life."
Positive,"I`ve been playing this game for a couple of months only, but i`m totally hooked.Beautiful open world with tons of different and really interesting quests. Also the combat system is really great10/10"
Positive,get this game while it on sale boys!
Positive,Elder Scrolls Online isn't the usual MMO. That's what makes it worth playing. It is a wonderful game to play and it's rich in every department of MMOs.
Positive,"I am hooked, though I will admit it took me a while to get into this one.There's a lot of things in this game that I didn't expect, and there's quite a learning curve when you start out - however it still has the comfortable familiarity of every other elder scrolls game and it fully encourages you to explore every nook and cranny of the world.It's a lot of fun, it is infinite, and the community for the most part is very warm and welcoming. Definitely recommend picking it up if you've been thinking about it"

Positive,"Clear Nominee for MMORPG of 2017.The devs care a tremendous amount about the community and do listen a LOT on the official forums. The game is supported by strong updates and it offers a unique choice where the users can either pay for a subscription or b2p (where the client would buy the DLCs individually).This is also the only MMORPG I've ever played that made me happy to pick up sidequests. You can tell the devs put a lot of time into the quests and poured their souls into making it as enjoyable as possible.Pros:- Jaw dropping amount of content (overwhelming almost)- Really good graphics for an MMORPG- Strongest sidequests I've ever seen from an MMORPG- Plenty of dungeons- Really fun PVP system with multiple game mods- Holy shit all the quests have voice acting (which is REALLY well done)- Very strong main quest linesCons:- Way overpriced DLCs- Overpriced Expansion (Morrowind)- Game attempts to shove microtransactions down your throat with regular notifications about the new ""Store deals""- Step down in combat gameplay from Skyrim (+ Clunky stealth system)- We're back to the telepath guards that know you attacked someone 300 miles away- A race and a class hidden behind a paywall"
Positive,"I will get this out of the way: I dont play this game like an mmo. So far, the writing, story and voice acting keep me hooked. The combat is incredibly mediocre but it is an elder scrolls game, i didnt expect much better. The world is absolutely gorgeous to look at. Exploration, stories, and the occasional dark anchor or world boss keep me hooked in"
Positive,"The good parts of an MMO with the epic world of Tamriel. the unlimited model is great for those of us who may not always have a lot of time to play in a given month, but the crowns and DLC seem a bit pricey. Even so, for an Elder Scrolls fan, it is worth it. The world is gorgeous and the combat is solid (not amazing, but solid)."
Positive,"This is literally my favorite game ever. I genuinely dont understand why some dont like it.Dungeons: AmazingPVP : some cheaters but still really funPVE: enjoyableLeveling: super cool, especially vet leveling with the Champion points systemI've had this game for over a year now and they are continually making this game better with every new update and DLC."
Positive,"I’ve been playing this game for years, and realistically, I’ve never actually had a problem that’s physically stopped me from playing it or stopped me from enjoying it as much as I have. Lacking friends is a downfall, but I don’t mind solo playing. It’s still fun either way! I’m up to date with all DLC’s and I can see myself playing this for years to come. I’ve recommended this to people who have played previous Elder Scrolls games. It’s a brilliant game, for the zone stories and the exploration."
Positive,"cured my depression because i like open worlders and this one is pretty expansive imo. Impressive music and character-dialogue. Its a more HARDER version of skyrim because every move you make is set in stone.HOWEVER; I have major gripes with the bad connection. Sometimes my connection will go bad at the ABSOLUTELY worst times. Killed someone with a rare weapon? Gone because disconnection. Broke into someones house to rob goods? Woops, I get a bounty even though I successfully snuck through it before the disconnection dropped. This was SO close to getting a 5/5 rating for me, but because of these issues, its a 3/5 at best, because this issue genuinely destroys the experience even though I was ultimately having fun. I just wish there was a no-server option"
Positive,need a lot hair for the character creation loooool~
Positive,Yes I would recommend this game to friends but I would say instead of getting it from steam get the game from Elderscollsonline there its only 20 $ vs the 60$ you spend on steam...
Positive,Ive played all this time without DLCs and its EPIC!!!
Positive,Good game would recommend
Positive,Thank you for fixing this game again.
Positive,"I've been basically a casual player since launch, before it was on Steam. Every so often I pick it up and put it back down again. The combat is painfully slow and has been since they they implemented the auto-scaling of enemies. I have to basically fire 5 powers to kill a mudcrab. I don't feel powerful. I tried to do some research to see if I could improve my builds. When I looked at veteran player builds for most classes, the majority of both ability bars were populated by powers that are available to every class via the guild powers or weapon powers. When my ability bars are basically all powers that any class or any character can have it makes me feel like I'm not even playing the class I created my character for. If I'm a nightblade, I should be able to use all nightblade powers and have a sick build that feels like a powerful nightblade. When I fire a power, I'm actually not really sure it's even fired because it doesn't seem to really impact the enemy except a barely-perceivable tick against their health.  I'm aware that I'm supposed to weave light and heavy attacks in with the abilities, but it literally doesn't seem to make much of a difference. Also, the light attack animation for staves looks like a bug. It looks like a cancelled animation of someone using a staff. It doesn't look like a powerful magical staff. The enemy attacks also really don't mean much when I can basically just walk away from the animation in many cases.For enemies like mudcrabs and basic trash-level enemies, I shouldn't even have to fire a power to roast them. We used to be able to light attack them once or twice and that would be it.I  watched some high level players doing a raid on youtube and it doesn't look fun to me. They don't look powerful. Even players with top-tier gear seem to take what feels like forever to even kill non-bosses. I want to like this game so much but the combat is seriously so boring I have fallen asleep playing and that is not hyperbole.   I basically play this game as a olde thyme crafting simulator and I do whatever I can to never fight any enemy, but even that's annoying at times because I have to go places to get materials and it feels like a let down that I actually have to avoid combat for the game to be fun at all."
Positive,this game make me fun :D
Positive,great game. a must buy for mmorpg fans. screw the bad reviews. its well worth it
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited is a fantastic game with a lot of content, a good community (from what I've experience), and good customization. It is definately a lot more improved that when initally reviewed, and thus I believe it does not deserve the hate it receives.Firstly, I have played the game since beta. While I did not play a huge chunk of the game, I played enough to be able to say it was somewhat lacking, and while fun, it did bore me out fairly quickly. When the game launched, I didn't not get the game, and had only heard bad things about the game. It was only after a few months later did I eventually decide to dive back into the world of Tamriel, after hundreds of hours of playing Skyrim. The game had improved drastically since beta, and I truely recommend anyone who has not played the game to give it a try, especially now that the game has gotten rid of the Monthly Subscriptions.On that topic, no the game is not ""pay-to-win"" due to the reduction of the monthly subscritpions. As of now, the only things you can buy are Mounts, Pets and cosmetics with no plans to add a pay-to-win element into the Crown Store. The biggest thing you must remember when looking at this game is that it is NOT Skyrim Online. The faster you get that notion out of your head, the better the game becomes. And while it is not Skyrim Online, it is still a really fun game, and probably the closest you'd get to such a game. The game is heavily quest based in the leveling process, but they're relatively fun quests and everyone is fully voiced. The customization in this game is really enjoyable with the way you are able to pick any weapon, take various skills, pick morphs, wear any armour, it's extremely fun to experiement with different armour sets and weapons, trying to find that perfect build for your playstyle (though looking online for builds isn't a bad thing, either). I have had a ton of fun over multiple characters with different classes just waiting to get new skill points in order to try new things.While this may not apply to everyone, I have found the community to generally be really good. There are probably going to be trolls, or generally dislikable people along the way, but for the most part I have found the chats to be nice, and the guilds to be pleasant. Speaking about the chats, they are not filled with spam on buying gold online that I find in a lot of other MMO's, and they're actually filled with people actively talking (for however long that may last). All in all, I believe this game is well worth the price and is definately a fun experience. It is different to other MMO's and I enjoy both playing in first person and third person, though I had to change the FOV to 130 in first person (and even then I would have prefered a bit more). I'd recommend this to anyone looking for some entertainment, and definately to someone who was put off from getting it due to the negativity that it once had."
Positive,It's dank 10/10
Positive,"I like this game, it's fun. Character maker is great!Gameplay is great!Graphics are great!Story is great!Game = Great! .... have I mentioned it's great :P"
Positive,I enjoyed it on release. Was immersive and looked great. Hard to get back into though. Really don't like free to play cash shops.
Positive,There may be alot to do and it is fairly fun. however later game you realize just how much repeats.and then how little you can actually customize your char.theres 6 classes whitch is good but basically the same powers just slightly different but most have the same effects.
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online: 6/10After investing around 78 hours in this game, I can confidently assert that ESO holds a middling position in the gaming landscape. It offers moments worth cherishing within its beautifully crafted world, although a significant portion of this world is accessible only through paid content. Nevertheless, the combat mechanics leave much to be desired. By the time the tenth hour rolls around, they begin to feel monotonous, with adversaries resembling more like resilient sponges rather than distinct characters. The game's dialogue is intricately designed (arguably the finest within the franchise), yet I often catch myself hastening through it due to the fast-paced nature of the gameplay, though this might be a personal idiosyncrasy. In stark contrast to previous Elder Scrolls installments, the central storyline is alarmingly forgettable. So much so that, despite previously playing ESO on a console, I struggled to recall any elements related to the main questline.ESO stands as an MMORPG, allowing you to confront these tenacious bosses with random players or alongside companions. Although the social facet exists, its impact on the in-game realm is marginal at best. The revival of defeated bosses and enemies diminishes the gravity of death and narrative progression, rendering these events almost weightless. Toppling an opponent? Simply exercise patience, and they shall reappear, as if your in-world actions carry minimal consequence. While a chat feature facilitates player communication, it proves largely superfluous for completing the game, causing it to largely escape my attention. Exploring dungeons in the company of fellow players further contributes to a sense of lifelessness within these environments.In sum,My experience with this title was enjoyable, yet games like Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind, or Daggerfall outshine it, particularly when enhanced with mods. ESO serves as an effective means of passing the time, offering a splendid ambiance, somewhat intriguing characters, and an abundance of quests.Pros: - Good dialogue- Beautiful worlds to discover- Good time waster (plenty of quests)- Decent lootCons:- Boring, stale combat- Unmemorable storyline- Most of the world is locked behind paywalls- Tons of glitches (that I have come across)- Artificially boosted boss difficulty- Less locations (caves, camps, etc.) compared to previous TES titles- WHY ARE HORSES SO EXPENSIVE?"
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls OnlineFinal Verdict: 8/10. Would advise buying on sale but no shame if you buy it for full price.-----The good:Tamriel Unlimited: The faction war is now on the back burner, allowing you to see the world in its fullest. Content is scaled to you and widely accessible.Content: Now that the faction barriers have been dropped, the content across the entire map is bountiful. By the base game alone, if you don't do the main storyline, you'll have months of missions to do and advance your character. The questlines are with their own side stories, with visual impact based on the decisions you make or the actions you fulfill. All characters are voiced and  options to decide on whom you side with or what you do branch off into their own actions that you perform to fulfill the quest. I'll have more to say later.Graphics: It's rare that an art department fails to deliver and the Elder Scrolls Online is no different. It's a little uncanny, going from Skyrim or Oblivion to ESO, but by itself, it's fine. It's also more theme fitting for the Argonians and Khajiit, who's art style tends to frequently shift between games like Morrowind to Oblivion. The art design of the starting areas are well decorated and each place feels different from the last.DLC: The DLC chapters range from minor to major, like the Shivering Isles, Tribunal, what have you. The quality is far greater than the base game, though the base game alone is not horrible by any means. The length ranges from the Shivering Isle, to some of the more minor questlines, like the length of a guild's questline. You get access to all of them if you get ESO plus. Or if you'd rather not, you can purchase them all permenantly.Difficulty: ESO's difficulty is sufficient, if you play it like a singleplayer experience. One foe shouldnt be much of a problem, though they'll certainly sink your health bar. As you progress in your levels, the difficulty will rise to the point where you make use of potions and poisons, or soul gems if you die.Community: The community is especially helpful, as I've discovered. Although it's a human being on the other side of the screen, complete with all the opportunities in which they may screw you over or harass you, a community is always more embracing than a random individual.Alternate starts: If you have the DLCs, you can start off in different areas than Coldharbor. You don't have to prominently be apart of the Coldharbor storyline until you so choose to.Housing: If you purchase housing, it does not vanish if you stop playing the game for periods at a time. It is there for you, for now and ever. The decoration system is perhaps the best I've ever seen in a game. It works almost like how you can set up props in Garry's Mod. Whether it's interior or exterior setup, the experience is akin to building something in the toolkit.MMO-lite: The game has more of a single player theatre experience than an MMO. You can play the game as though it were a standalone Elder Scrolls game. If the game's mechanics of special abilites on a 1 through five button bar, with an R 'ultimate ability' (shapeshifting into a wolf, a special ability based on your weapon's tree line, or a special ability based on your class' three specializations, there's a ton to choose from), you'd probably forget it being an MMO, reminded only when you see another player run by.Accessible mounts: Mounts are now accessible and more easily acquired in the game. You visit a stablemaster in any large city every 24 hours to train your horse to be faster, have more stamina, or be able to endure more before they thrrow you off. You first get a horse, but can get other mounts through great effort, or by microtransactions.-----The meh.Combat: Combat is fine if you're a ranged user, though melee can feel floaty and without impact when you heavy attack or block a heavy attack. They make up for this by giving you stuns and kick-backs that you can unlock in your weapon's skill progression. I made this meh, because combat in the Elder Scrolls has never been of great nuance. Even in Morrowind. Your only valid option was to take up magic and become literal god. I will say that, mechanically, the game does offer more than Oblivion and Skyrim in terms of mechanical builds, though you may not find them as enticing if you don't care for how traditional MMOs are played.The voice acting: The voice acting is hit and miss in some places. Most of it is serviceable and some of it pleasant to the ear, though there are a few examples that made me cringe. One such example is Venus (Vanus? Vinus? The Altmer Arch-Mage), has a tendency to just yell, even in situations where he shouldn't be yelling. The production value is good enough, though. The production value in the DLCs are even better. I make this 'meh' because it's not all bad.Microtransactions: They nickle and dime a lot in this game, which, that's okay, they're a buy to play game and they need to make their money. I do take qualms with being able to buy into the vampirism or werewolf curse, though. I make this 'meh' because they have to make their money somehow and it's not that you /have/ to buy the curses, you can seek out a member of the respective cults to to give you the curse. Or you can get bit randomly and seek out an NPC to be cured of your curse, or embrace it and follow it where it leads.The story: The general premise of the story isn't too inspired, but it's not horrible. It's an Elder Scrolls story, complete with the troubles of the Daedric Princes and a side of all the provinces clambering for the throne, despite their individual hatreds for one another, the most notable one being the Redguards and Bretons siding with the Orisimer, whom they hate, but manipulate into being the Daggerfall Covenant's rank and file. I make this 'meh' because the main story isn't the only story ESO tells. There are other prominent stories that it goes on to tell after the events of Coldharbor, such as the troubles in Summerset and so on.The soundtrack: The natural ambient music is serviceable, no complaints there. The combat soundtrack is an uninspired drum and jingle-jangle beat. It only gains any actual tension during a fight with an enemy that requires more than one opponent to beat. I make it 'meh' because only one portion of the soundtrack is bad.----The bad.Weird nickle and diming: They locked the Imperials, the base, generic race of man, behind the collector's edition? What? I get that their original purpose was that they could join any of the three factions, but they offer packs where you can do the same with the other races now and for much cheaper. Also, lootboxes? I deadass hate these. I don't want to gamble for a chance at something cool for 400 crowns, I want the chance to just pick and choose what I want and don't want. I wouldn't mind if they were free, but paid loot crates? These need to stop.Fashion is hard: Dyes are locked behind achievement progress, you can't acquire them by other means. You can purchase dyes with crowns (or from crystals that you get from disassembling your daily login rewards) but they only work on outfits, not base outfits that you make at the outfit station. You do not gain the ability to make outfits from different racial armors simply by picking the item up, you need to get their crafting motifs to add the item's appearance to the armor collection, whether by finding them or buying them for insane amounts on the microtransaction store. Though there is a small mercy, in that you can craft gear to make it look like that.Graphics, an addendum: There is this weird feeling that the armor pieces feel 'flat'. Like they're bodysuits, not  unique pieces strapped to your body. Some pieces aren't like that but it's more than a little bothersome. I know this isn't the only MMO that does that (I'm looking at you, WoW), though the counterparts like that are beginning to step up in that department."
Positive,"After trying out other MMO's and not enjoying the combat or not enjoying the lore, there is a happy medium with ESO. The combat is engaging and not just rows and rows of hotkeys to button smash, or a recipe of keys that you have to hit in order to execute a specific spell. The lore is obviously amazing if you want a world to get lost in. The only negative that isn't even a big negative is that sometimes your attacks don't really feel like they have much weight behind them...but that's a minor nitpick."
Positive,"EDIT: No more waiting times atm. Love the game, especially without guides and just anjoying the adventure, exploration and occasional mischief.I like the game but couldn't recommend it. When i wanted to play i had to wait 15-30 min to log in. This is not accetable in 2023. If they only want me to pay them 20$ for the game and and a month sub they have achieved their goals."
Positive,"This game is now better than in the release!!and a bonus to that, the subscription fee is gone!! :D"
Positive,My favorite thing about this game is the PvP. I haven't played much PvE but from what i have played it is amazing. If anyone wants a 130 member pvp guild pm me :)
Positive,Love love love this game
Positive,i really enjoy playing this game. only downside is that it is a bit laggy since i run it on a laptop.
Positive,"Pretty Graphics, fun classes, and always something to do."
Positive,only issue is that you need eso plus to have separate inventory for crafting materials ew
Positive,Quality story with great combat. Need more of a skill set than World of Warcraft (if coming from there) since you have to learn to block and managing spells to use for best setup (forced to pick between a few out of many).
Positive,"It's fun.  Not as fun as Skyrim but still fun.  It feels a bit too much like WoW with the respawning enemies and such.  Also there isn't as much fun exploring like in Skyrim as everything takes you from one quest to the next.  I don't know if I'd pay for it yet though as Im still on the free weekend.Edit:  Having revisited it some time later, I can say it has changed and improved dramatically.  I very much enjoy this now."
Positive,"There are some odd design decisions, group dungeons are pure cancer, as YOU get punished (a penalty of 20 minutes or so, that you will have to wait in order to search for a new group) if someone else leave the raid group, if you actually manage to get a group (at least I am familiar of waiting for at least 1 hour sometimes for a group).Though the game is really beautiful, and have a lot of aesthetics worth experiencing.Moreover, I would like rare, high level (etc) weapons to deal way more damage than... lets say start weapons ( this is probably compensated by abilities which you can learn)I did like to see some of these things either fixed or worked upon since I think it hurts the game (at least for new commers)"
Positive,"A perfect mmo to start with, great lore, fun story quests, beautiful dlc zones, challenging dungeons, and amazing roleplay. However, it's very easy to become burnt out and overwhelmed with crafting, skyshard hunting, long drawn out side quests, and trying to create a new character."
Positive,1300+ hours and another account on xbox with well over 2k. id say i like the game lol(edit 3k+ hours now)
Positive,Its pretty much my first MMORPG and really enjoying the game If you want true mmorpg experience this game is for you!
Positive,"I recommend this game for all the reasons others mention BUT DON'T BUY IT HERE, BUY IT FROM ZENIMAX. because you will only be able to login for 5% of the time."
Positive,"Make sure you get into a group or have some friends to play it with you. Otherwise, it wouldn't be as fun as it would be without them. Great game."
Positive,"Very enjoyable, this game is my top favorite mmo so far."
Positive,"Cool game, but i only play it casually"
Positive,"B-best G-game for sh-shanking.. sh-shanking.. lots of sh-shanking! Pickpocketing and g-getting caught.. l-lets see you do it at 80% Pffft! Wanna steal and murder aimlessly for hours, this is your game. Traveling is pretty cool, connect the star dots and BEAM ME UP DARK MOTHER!"
Positive,"6 Hours in --- LOVE IT.Thank you. Damn FP mmo, crypt voice acting, I get that same feeling i got from Fallout and Oblivion with the random triggered events and quests. Yea it took forever to download but its legit. 5 stars - In my humble opinion. A well crafted game worth my hard earned money and respect.22 hours in - ESO .... is SO GOOD!!!!! Yes!33 hours- Damn this is Great!50 hours - My main is Level 20 Khajiit Templar/TANK healer--Made some other character's of different races/classes alliances for fun: well they start in a different place(opposite side of the world as my last char) so it looks like I might get a whole different story line/experience too!!! Also day and night cycles as well as weather.  :D100+ hours-- Better than Skyrim!!!!!!  This is the best Elder scrolls GAME YET. STILL LOVING IT!@"
Positive,"Okay, this is (in my opinion) the best MMO I have ever played. This may be because I am such a TES fan, I don't know, but anyone who says this game is terrible, is speaking from their own opinion and not for everyone. So, please try this game out for yourself (Whether you purchase or use a friends computer) because it truly is a masterpiece. Yes, it has its bugs, what MMO doesn't? I've spent the last four years playing PWI, and ESO was so good I haven't played PWI in a week. Trust me, that is a record for me."
Positive,"I don't even like MMOs but this was easy to get into and really addicting. Combat is fun and the quest are all diverse and fun. PVP is great once you get the hang of the game. Base game is enough fun as it is I can't even imagine it with all DLC or ESO+. Highly recommend to anyone who likes ES universe or MMOs in general and even to those who don't play MMOs as much. Even though I'm broke I'm thinking of buying the DLC, definitely worth your money."
Positive,"I hate MMO's. This though, I really enjoy it. There's always something to go do or explore, its not stupidly complicated like WoW and easy to get into. Dungeon runs are fun, world boss hunting is fun, exploring the massive world is fun. There is no monthly subscription to pay in order to play, just 1 time purchase. There is the crown store where you can spend real money on stuff but nothing in it is necessary to progress nor does it give you advantages over other players. Sure the stuff in the crown store is a bit pricey, but as I said before you don't need any of it as it's mostely cosmetics and mounts. Mounts can also be purchased with in game gold and made to be every bit as fast as crown store mounts. The down sides? Huge download, but that's to be expected with this much content in a game."
Positive,"OK first off this game was not even on my radar as a viable MMORPG.  I played the initial beta and was not impressed.  I was so dissappointed I thought nothing could save this game.  During beta they announced some wierd rules regarding alliances and races and that players would be limited to where they could go. This of course turned me off even more.  So I just never gave this game a thought again.  Then one of my brothers told me to I should give it another shot that this is not the same game it was back in beta.  So I bought the Gold Edition and started playing.  Holy Skyrim Batman - this game plays more like Skyrim than it ever did in beta.  It is an open world - go anywhere - explore anything.  Classes are more open.  Game has taken much of what made Skyrim such a great game and ported it to online game play.Graphics are beautiful.  Just awesome.  Cannot wait to see more of Tamriel and of course the up coming expansion Morrowwind.  :)Seriously, if you think this is the same game it was at release - you'd be wrong like I was.  This is not the same ESO from 3 years ago.  This is 100 times better than that game and worth the price now.  One of the best MMO's I've played in ages.   I totally recommend it."
Positive,"I would first like to say that I have played WoW off and on for years (usually for new expansions until the late expac lull.)   I enjoyed playing TES:Oblivion and Skyrim on consoles.  Recently I began playing ESO (about 70 hrs in).  For me, this has been a very natural transition blending elements I love from both WoW and TES.  From a single-player perspective, there is plenty of opportunity to play through the leveling experience.  The storylines are rich and engaging.  I find myself looking forward to learning more of the story of Tamriel and its inhabitants.  This is indeed a MMO, as well.  There are countless times i have stumbled into multiplayer situations seamlessly through my journey.  Anchors and the like provide a quick way to join fellow players in a quick PVE battle.  Dungeons provide a rewarding instance for a longer engaging grouped experience.  I have not yet participated in PVP battles and may have to revist this down the road.  I'm sure you can find many reviews regarding PVP.  For now I am eagerly awaiting the upcoming Morrowind expansion, and I'll see you in Tamriel!"
Positive,"I've never gotten addicteedd so fast to a game.Its not like skyrim with it's mmo components but it's really a fun game. Highly reccomended, I give it a 87/100."
Positive,"12/10, would milk mau in this game 10000000 timese before dropping it. only mmo that keeps me playing"
Positive,Have to use VPN but at least i can play now
Positive,enough content to survive the corona virus quarantine
Positive,This is a good game on its own.  The story is fun.  the systems are fun.  If you are looking for the core feel of the Elder Scrolls series....well maybe not.  i've already spent some $ on this and at this point i'm not unhappy.  If you have $ to experiment I think you can have a great time here.
Positive,"Many who have played Skyrim and love MMORPGs will play the game for hundreds or even thousands of hours. Quests are simply heaps of, although they are of the same type (bring, take, kill, etc.), but they are interesting to pass. The world is very big and beautiful. Well, what about scrolls without magic and skills ?! With each level you are given skill points and special points for magic. Let's start with skill points - as in any RPG, they are needed to level up your character, namely whether it is stamina, health, or mana. Special points are needed to pump magic, for example, a skill that will cause you to pour fire on your opponents, summon special armor, then they can be pumped, and there are a lot of skills themselves. TESO is a popular MMORPG, which is worth paying attention to, but the game has its drawbacks, but the game itself attracts first with its gameplay so that you will not even notice the shortcomings. Definitely worth playing at least once!Pros:-For an MMORPG with such a scale of 2014, the graphics are not bad.-Quests, bosses, they are the ones that captivate-Price, including Morrowind's DLS, which will make many nostalgic.-Crafts, food preparation, etc-Dungeons, or PVE (players vs. bots), we can say, these are more quests, only with a very large payment of experience, clothes and coins. As you progress, there will be bosses, and at the end of the dungeon, the final boss.-And PVP and the participation of many players.- There are a lot of them, but I have named the most important ones.Minuses:-Bugs-ImbalanceBottom line: a game with very interesting gameplay, quests, it's a pleasure to play through, what is there to think, take without a doubt! 9 out of 10."
Positive,"Solid vision of Tamriel. EOS takes place a couple of decades before the events described in TES 1, 2, and 3. A Fairly standard mechanic MMO, with good to excellent story writing. If you're looking for something new in terms of gameplay this probably isn't it. But, if you're looking for endless adventures in a fully fleshed out Tamriel, where every major area is about 1/3 the size of the Skyrim or Oblivion maps. This game is massive like TES, dark like TES, very high magic like TES, it's got biped cats, biped lizards, and a host of elves, and humans just like you'd expect in a TES game. Lore can be consistent at time, and retconned at times, but that's also TES.Enjoy if TES is your thing, or if you like ultra lore rich, story heavy, massive cohesive worlds."
Positive,"I quit this game 6 years ago on a character with over 400 hours played (a large chunk of my hours are before Steam) because of the quest breaking bugs.Then two years ago due to In game lag causing combat, crafting, market issues, and, again, quest mechanics that do not work even after re-logging. Also, the 'Chapters' cash grab was annoying as an ESO Plus member.What brought me back? New World of Tedium. After 400 hours of that, I thought I'd check out ESO again. A game where weapon swapping and dodge cancel work. I've got to say that ESO is feeling really good right now. The Chapter approach isn't horrible now that they've come and moved on to core content and although there are quest bugs, they are fixable with a zone or relog.Perhaps it's Microsoft's influence? Regardless, the game works now."
Positive,"I played ESO in beta back at the end of 2013 for a few hours and didn't come back... until now.They really changed this game around for the better. Took long enough, but now that I have the gold edition and all these new updates, I'm having a BLAST! Get your friends on here because they'll enjoy playing it together! People like to say it doesnt play like skyrim, combat wise. Well, skyrims combat system wasnt particularly the best thing about skyrim. People mostly enjoy it for the feel and the story and the emmersion, RP, ect. I'd like you to understand that ALL of those things from skyrim are apart of ESO. You feel like you're playing IN an elderscrolls game. You're talking to characters just like in skyrim, finding random side quests, solving problems in the open world land. The combat is really cool either way and the visuals are great enough to cater to the emmersiveness of this HUGE game. There is plenty to do so go out there and explore! Oh and btw the latest one tamriel update puts the icing on the cake."
Positive,"Alright, I havent actually played the game yet, because of the fact that it is still downloading. Four and a half days. Four and a half days it has taken to download the game. And once it finally downloaded, I have to download it again? What the hell!? This review has nothing to do with the game itself, but I still feel obligated to write this anyway. Why would I have to download the game twice? Could someone please explain?EDIT: Someone has now explained to me that the way Steam does this is that it downloads and old launcher, which then downloads a huge update. after playing the game for a bit id say ITS AWESOME! Although in some aspects i think its a little flawed(?), like having to pay actual money for a lot of stuff. But still awesome."

Positive,lav eet yoo.. no pay to win system that goes on this game... and for sure youre gonna sink alot of hours on this... so buy it now!
Positive,Pros: -beri gud-has dragons-Windhelm 1000 years before TES V: Skyrim11/10:)
Positive,While waiting for the anchor...Me: /luteRandom Guy: /fluteRandom Guy 2: /drum10/10Would form a band again
Positive,This is NOT Skyrim online...
Positive,Very story driven. The game is deep. You should only buy if you're looking for a time-sink.
Positive,"Honestly, I find this to be one of the better mmorpg's I've ever played. While certainly not perfect, the game has much going for it, and found myself quite surprised by the extensive content, the graphics, the music, and the sheer number of things you can do. Have sunk almost 900 hours into this game, and have barely scratched the surface. I find myself a bit disappointed that I hadn't tried it sooner. If you're unsure about trying, I'd advise giving it a go during one of their free weekends, or when the base game is on sale."
Positive,Spent afew hours in this game. And all I can say is... well spent.
Positive,Great Game Fun To Play If You Like Games Like Skyrim
Positive,"When the game was released in 2014 april I didn't get it since the membership and the game was way to buggy and I generally didn't like what I was seeing, but now since I found out there was an update which fixed the bugs and no membership i bought the 60 dollar one payment game and started playing, I didn't expect much I just wanted to know the story but I've been playing with a few of my mates and its amazing, I live away from North America and I can connect well to the servers perfectly, the customization is brilliant so is the combat system, the game itself looks stunning while the characters has a good variety, lock picking system is a little downfall as it is quite tricky (For me atleast) but not really a big downside, I enjoy playing this game and I think you all should have a go if you are a strong Elder Scrolls Fan like I am"
Positive,"I really wanted to like this game. I really did. But...I was expecting Skyrim: Online. If you've come here looking for this experience, you're in the wrong realm. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy playing this game. The thing is, it's not what I expected. I'm not really a big MMORPG fan, and I really should've taken that into consideration before purchasing this game. The fact of the matter is that this is NOT Skyrim:Online. ESO is a completely different experience from it's predecessor. It's not as personable (meaning that, I don't care about my character as much), the story line isn't as rich, the character customization is limited, and the skill leveling system does't seem as unique.Don't get me wrong, the game is a whole lot of fun. It just wasn't what I was looking for. When I hear ""The Elder Scrolls"", I expect a game that is going to suck me into an alternate personality in a foreign world full of hardships where I will become the hero. ESO just isn't that. You're kind of a regular Joe.I'm not really sure what to rate this because it's so far out of my element...I would still totally recommend the game if you're a fan of the Elder Scrolls and MMORPGs. Just don't come here looking for an online version of Skyrim because you'll be disappointed. 7/10. Was expecting something different."
Positive,"Deep story arch, semi-canon and lore friendly. I really have heard many negative things about this game, won't deny it till you try it. Once i got my hands on ESO i soon found myself, not point and clicking, but actually being immerserved in a rich combat system. IMO its the perfect blend of MMO elements and hack and slash elements we are used at seeing in most Elder Scrolls games. It doesn't feel like Skyrim, DO NOT EXPECT SKYRIM 2.0 OR SKYRIM ONLINE! That doesn't mean it is a bad game however. It is still young, so exepct some bugs. However, considering how it progressed since the beta, this should't be a problem. I really got what i paid for. In terms of what i expected, it felt like a polished version of Morrowind but online. The game play was very fun indeed. I really am not a fan of point an click MMO's. I even have a WoW account and that got old really fast. In terms of entertainment, i believe ESO is more fun than WoW simply due to the fact of its combat system and story. That said, i actually like this game!Did i mention it will be F2P by March? ;)"
Positive,Best MMO out there at the moment. I don't understand all the hate about this title. It's an MMO with elder scrolls lore. It has nice PvE and great PvP.
Positive,is good game man
Positive,"Australians have to play on 250+ ping.Nuff said.Game is still addicting though although it's not really that similar to Elder Scrolls V, so if you were expecting something like Skyrim online sorry to disappoint you bud."
Positive,"Hated this game during the beta. But time has improved this one.  Plenty to explore and quests everywhere. Not the kill 10 rabid rabbits kind. But in a way the same. 'Go investigate and kill so n so.' 'There is an evil plot afoot that you must stop.' Tho similar quests just with different characters and different settings. There is at least always a story along with them and a feeling of purpose. Plenty of areas to explore and discover. Not impressed with loot, items being worth crap to vendors, so you need to join a guild and sell everything at guild store.Housing, is pretty much useless. A cash shop perk, there is no storage in house. All you can do with it is furnish it and make it look pretty. I haven't gotten into crafting much, seems like quite a grind. But all in all, I'd say it is a good casual MMO, if you're like me, more of a solo player. Good to just jump into and enjoy at your own pace."
Positive,"This is one of the greatest mmorpgs I have ever played (and I have played ALOT) the voice acting is stellar, the gameplay is amazing, and the features are truly unlimited.  It is a buy to play game, you but it once and no subscriptions are required again! Truly a great deal.  I recommend for anybody and everybody to try it."
Positive,STEAM LADDER WORLDWIDE No.4
Positive,Better than Skyrim!Can be a bit overwhelming at first for new players.
Positive,"Love this game! Great graphics, lots of customization, fun guilds for whatever you want to do, social interaction. It's like Runescape on steroids! There is so much attention to detail and I appreciate all of it"
Positive,"Finally able to play, so far so good."
Positive,Its a little different compared to the actua Elder Scrolls series. But it is still decent gameplay and voice acting is still very good. And the story is fantastic. :D
Positive,"Great game, tons of great content and enjoyable combat. One of my favorite skill systems I've ever experienced. Very unique and deep crafting system. The way the game scales to your level is fantastic for playing with friends. I can play as much as I want on my own, and don't have to worry about leaving behind friends with less time."
Positive,I hurt myself today..To see if I still feelI focus on the painThe only thing that's realThe needle tears a holeThe old familiar stingTry to kill it all awayBut I remember everythingWhat have I becomeMy sweetest friendEveryone I knowGoes away in the endAnd you could have it allMy empire of dirtI will let you downI will make you hurtI wear this crown of thornsUpon my liars chairFull of broken thoughtsI cannot repairBeneath the stains of timeThe feelings disappearYou are someone elseI am still right hereWhat have I becomeMy sweetest friendEveryone I knowGoes away in the endAnd you could have it allMy empire of dirtI will let you downI will make you hurtIf I could start againA million miles awayI will keep myselfI would find a way.....10/10 would play again
Positive,"Probably around 1500 hours worth of content base with an additional 500-1000 with DLC, worth the $9 on sale. I am 150 hours in as an experienced player from the PS4 and only completed 2 zones (Still have 2-3 more zones for the Aldmeri Dominion and another 4-5 zones for the other 2 factions, then Cyrodil is about the size of an entire faction area (so another 4-5 zones worth). It doesnt seem pay to win and I have many opportunities as a free player to get premium equipment with login rewards and free crates. Recently Orsinium went on sale for 550 crowns, well it just so happens new accounts get 500 crowns, getting more crowns via ingame methods, to buy crowns you have to buy in packs so you cant just buy 50 crowns but for 5-10 dollars (crowns also on sale) I have enough crowns to buy Orsinium and still have 1200 crowns, currently waiting for more DLC to go on sale and I can buy that as well.."
Positive,"It's a fun MMO.  Nothing groundbreaking but the quests are engaging.  It has good content for groups of 1 all the way to 24. They are constantly adding new content, and having special events.  The in game store is mostly cosmetics and player housing, with some experience boosts and stuff like that.  But everything that improves Xp is craftable in game, it just takes a lot of resources.  All in all a solid MMO if you are looking to play one."
Positive,"I played Ultima Online , Dark Age of Camelot , Warhammer Online and Eve for long term MMO's , I've dabbled in a few other MMO's short term. This game comes in the top 5 MMO's I've touched . ESO has a non locking , 3D action based combat system which is refreshing compared to most mmo's . The crafting will not touch games like ArcheAge but there is more than enough to keep crafters happy. I'm more into open field RVR , ESO has a very Guild Wars type open RVR. The best I've played since Dark Age of Camelot ! They have 3 sides !!!! So far my main hero is almost level 33 , I've yet to see the vet PVP area but even the ""baby"" non vet pvp zone is a blast . You setup catapults , knock down walls , seige castles , gank enemies ... all the fun you want from a open PVP zone. So far they only have one RVR zone but it's broken down into vet ( 50 + heros ) and non vet servers . All player stats are boosted up to level 50 in non vet pvp zones .Most bad reviews come from people who say the game won't have enough immersion. If you want the level of immersion in Skyrim , don't buy this . It's a MMO . MMO's are YEARS away from making a PVE game on the level of Skyrim ... won't happen, stay away . That being said . This game has some of the best PVE in any MMO I've touched. The basic quest are  interesting and well done compared to pretty much every other MMO. They make the level ""grind"" pretty easy to deal with , plus the level grind is pretty fast compared to a lot of fantasy MMO's of the past . Again , maybe that's my age showing. If you pick up a sword and shield , you level that tree line . Fire a bow , you're leveling bow . Just like the single player game. Classes are VERY diverse and open .Overall , great game !!! Great combat , good PVE , amazing PVP . crafting feels well done and lots of players."
Positive,"I've played this game for years! It's a great RGP, I enjoy the dungeons, multiplayer content, and the community."
Positive,Now that its not a monthly payment this game is worth every pennyif you are an elder scrolls fan this is a must havei dont even like mmo's but this game is amazing
Positive,Great game if you have friends to play with.If not it is kind of hard when doing quests above your level.
Positive,"I still play everyday, but mostly just for the daily writs. This game was really good, but it's kind of too late to get going if you havent already. Tons of players left this year and it's not entirely dead but it definitely isnt as fun as it used to be, unless you only play solo"
Positive,"::NOTICE::This review is based off of the free weekend that happened recently.::Thoughts:: :skip this part if you just want to see the pros and cons just scroll down:When I first saw this game I really thought it was not going to be good at all, but after playing it out of bordum I've completely changed my mind. The within the first few hours of playing I not only saw that it was a decent game but its the first MMO I've played that I've truely liked, (all MMOs on this account apart from this one with large amount of hours have been played by the co-owner of the account) and wished I simply had more time to play but of course this review is written after the free weekend and the I can no longer play this game. Anyway enough of me giving my thoughts about the game.::Pros/Cons:::Pros:1. The fighting mechancis are far better then any of the past installments in the series yet, though it could use some more tinkering still.2. The story is very well planned and paced and is the first one that actually made me sad.3. The side quest seem more like their own main story lines which all are connected in one way or another.4. The classes aren't limited really in what you can use with them, all classes can wear all armor and use all weapons and any race can be one of the 4 main classes and each class has 3 sub catagories.:Cons:1. The game is just to easy (not sure if its because I'm actually decent at the game or the game it self really is to easy) and I see no reason that one would need to make a group expect do to the world bosses and maybe some of the dungeons.2. The game does have some bugs one which almost made it impossible for me to progress.3. The fights between the 3 main leaders of the alliances are childish, for example in the story line when you brought the 3 of them togeather to discuss a temporary cease fire to fight a bigger threat in a matter of seconds before you could even say anything they start to bicker and then they all run into their camps.4. The game to me seemed like it should have alot more challenging and fights with many more enemies however the most enemies I could gather at once without running around the room I was in was 3-4 enemies but most of the time the enemies where in groups of 1-2."
Positive,"yes theis is the best MMO ive played, however its not as good as skyrim. The feel is diffrent and the missions are not as good. also i wish the game will support the ps3 controller because i cant manedge to use my controller."
Positive,"I've got 100 hours or so into ESO at this point. I avoided it like the plague this long because I was a dedicated Secret World player. Now that TSW is decaying, I finally got the itch for a new MMO. The amount of content in ESO is MASSIVE. Graphics, voice acting, control schemes....all really nice to work with. I'm still figuring out the depth of theorycrafting that ESO provides but am truly enjoying my experience so far. I highly suggest you install addons to make your expierence that much better."
Positive,Eso is a great MMO RPG if gour into that but 1 thing that made me brake my headset and mouse was that it wouldnt install the launcher and i spent 2 days just nuking the file (Verifying Cache) and i found a way to fix it
Positive,People were expecting another Skyrim yet they don't seem to understand that this is an MMO.﻿Great game overall
Positive,Is decent I think
Positive,i used to be an gamer like you then i took an arrow in the knee...
Positive,"I purchased the game, played for 20mins, realized this was the best MMO/Game I'd played since i was a child, refunded game after realizing i have priorities in life and i can't spend my existence in this game."
Positive,Amazing game good content but you have to lower the price of the DLC cuz in my country paying 40 USD for DLC = 630 EGP BUT the most important thing its an EPIC GAME
Positive,BEST MMORPG GAME !
Positive,I have hundreds of hours off Steam through the official launcher. One of the best MMOs on the market. Great if you like to play mostly solo with occasional grouping and PvP. Supports a very casual playstyle where you won't feel super-behind by not playing for a while.
Positive,"Although I would recommend this game. there are two things that would make this game a lot better for me. 1) I want a monk class, so that i can play a drunken nord. So, that I can walk around skyrim, and karate chop milk drinkers.2) I want more cheesecake related content."
Positive,"This is by far the best MMORPG I have played.The base game alone has tons of hours worth of play without needing to buy any dlc. The graphics still hold up and the action based combat system is fun and engaging.Guilds are active and you will always find people to play with no matter what level you are, obviously the newer areas are more populated but there are specific cities in the game that always are a favorite grouping hub.Housing in this game is top notch and with the right amount of grinding you can buy these houses for in game gold and craft all your own furniture. I have done this for almost all my houses and you can really work to make your house a one stop shop you can travel to for crafting and research. I love it.As far as DLC  costs and ESO Plus. This game will give you content for years. Weigh that against any other games and its well worth the price. Especially since they run sales all the time. IF you pay for ESO Plus you get access to ALL dlc minus the most recent chapter(bigger content area) which is fine because even if your subscription runs out you still get to keep all rewards and items earned during your time. It is well worth the money for the amount of content. The only valid complaint I do agree with that can be daunting early game is inventory management  without ESO Plus and the craft bag all your materials are stored in your pockets which takes up lots of space early game.  So if you want to be a master crafter then there really isnt any other choice. Later on once your almost max crafting level this is no longer an issue because your inventory should be leveled up as well as your bank space and the items you need for top tier items should not fill your pockets if you harvest correctly.For the price of the base game there is no reason you should not at the very least try this game out. 10/10"
Positive,"THey finally chenged my major complaint about the game:The membership. It's a solid game, just remember its straddling the line between Elder Scrolls and MMORPG, so if thats not your cup of tea choose wisely."
Positive,it is a good game for people who like a mmo type of games just  takes long to level up
Positive,certainly not the typical TES experience but a good MMORPG nonetheless
Positive,"Really like this, though the environment is too dull for my taste in some areas."
Positive,Ay yo this the stuff that gets me erecting. Top of the line.
Positive,this game has the best story every it is so interesting i learned that i am a dragonborn and i have to either join the stormcloaks or imperials to help martin luther save the world from hermaous mora10/10 would download again
Positive,Got a cat here. Friends passing by can touch her and click Like to pet her once.　　　　 　　 ＿＿　　　 　　／＞　　フ　　　 　　| 　_　 _ l　 　　 　／` ミ＿xノ　　 　 /　　　 　 |　　　 /　 ヽ　　 ﾉ　 　 │　　|　|　|　／￣|　　 |　|　|　| (￣ヽ＿_ヽ_)__)　二つ
Positive,"This game is a great game for people who enjoy questing, exploring, pvp, and pve combat! This game makes for a amazing game to play with friends and the graphics are absolutely stunning! For people who enjoyed the last Elder Scrolls game, this is the right pick for you!"
Positive,I just really enjoy this game.
Positive,So good I bought it twice (second account) (no im not botting)
Positive,im just going to take a look....ohh champion 380? how? lol
Positive,If you are a MMORPG fan you will really enjoy the game...i've played lots of MMOs and TESO is actually one fo the best in the market. This game is so damn inmersive...If you havent played any other Elder Scrolls game then try this one...you will love the game story and it will make you want more of Elder Scrolls
Positive,Well i've played 130 hours now and not in no lifer mode lol  I really love this game...i played Morrowind & Oblivion (didn't care much for skyrium) and this game reminds me ALOT of them.  A friend bought me the game...little pricey for me...and 3 mths sub...and I will be paying for it every month after that.  Alot of the reviews i saw were from back in April.  Well its October now and i haven't come across any bugs at all and the gold you get in game has increased from back then as well. Ignore these ppl that say it suks cause it really does not. Have fun!!
Positive,"For those individuals who find themselves magnetically drawn to RPGs, ESO is the pitome of MMORPGs.  Elder Scrolls Online won't limit your playstyle.  They won't block you from wearing the type of armor you want to use.  ESO won't stop you from choosing the weapon your heart desires.  If you can imagine it, ESO will allow you to pllay it.  I highly recommend the game."
Positive,"Great game.I even bought it twice just to get the steam overlay lolAnd yes, it’s an MMO so dont expect Elder Scrolls 6, but it still works fine as a single player experience (although i find it hard to feel immersed).The main quest is also very similar to Oblivion (which is okay tho cause I love that game lol), but there are soooo many other quests that it doesn't really matter.And the lore is more expanded here than in any other TES title, so if you’re an Elder Scrolls fan just buy it already!Final verdict:7/10"
Positive,I'm enjoying the game and the stories.
Positive,"I need to reflect a little longer, to make sure i give the most accurate description."
Positive,I spent an hour in real time running to the Imperial city only to find out I need to buy the DLC to enter.......
Positive,"Possesses an extraordinary amount of content and the recent subscription removal has also improved the player base, all in all combat is satisfying all be it a bit repetative in the early game."
Positive,"Well Done! easy to play, and spend endless hours!!! played A lot of hours, and about to start again with the new updates."
Positive,"Don't believe the anti-hype. Even if it the game isn't going to be candid to the lore, and included in the true cycle of the games, it is still a fantastic MMO blending an in depth world, with beautiful landscapes and graphics, with a smooth and effective combat and crafting system. I know the rumors say its got its bugs, quirks, and drawbacks, but as an MMO player and a ES fan for a long while, I say dont pass it up without giving it a fair chance."
Positive,"I can certainly say I am glad that I waited to get the Elder Scrolls Online as long as I did. If you played prior to the ""No Subscription Required"" phase, I hope it was not a waste of your money. The rebranded Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unliminted makes it seem like you buy the game and then bam you get all the access, however, Zenimax Online has cleverly decided to make you pay for mounts, costumes, and anything else you want, including an entire race in their special ""Imperial Edition"". The gameplay is very boring into the first few hours of playing, but it still seems to have that Elder Scrolls feel to it, but overall I would say the Elder Scrolls should stay out of the MMO world from now on and just be what it does best, a free roaming single player RPG. I was very excited to purchase the game and although it has its downsides the game really is great for fans of the Elder Scrolls Series. It felt refreshing to begin exploring new areas and lands and begin seeing some of my favorite Elder Scrolls creatures and races. The world is beautifully made and the cities large and explorable for hours. However, after about 3 hours playing it does get boring since it takes so long to travel anywhere, not to mention the fact that the game crashes just about every 30 minutes, making you have to relogin and reload the game all over again for 10 mintues just to continue what you were doing. Overall, if you are into paying the $59.99 it costs to buy The Elder Scrolls Online Tamriel Unlimited or if you want to give Zenimax a nice contribution by paying $79.99 for the Imperial Edition, be my guest. If you are not really a fan of either the Elder Scrolls or MMOs then this game is probably not for you. Out of 5 stars, I would give Elder Scrolls Online a 3. After playing it for about a year now and seeing all of the new DLC's that have been added, I would highly recommend that fans of the Elder Scrolls series purchase the Online game and begin playing today. Adventure awaits you in Tamriel, so don't hesitate to get your journey started!"
Positive,"It's not bad. I do recommend though that you keep moving after you kill something. It will respawn. I killed a guard and a civilian on the Dark Brotherhood questline and the civilian respawned before I had the chance to leave the room, giving me a bounty of around 50 coins every second until I killed him."
Positive,"Okay here it is... This game which is a MMORPG is acutally pretty good.  Now I've watched Angry Joe (he reviews videos and talks about them in a somewhat angry manner ""hint the name"") but this is one of his reviews that I disagree with.  He stated that the game was boring and very cookie cut MMORPG exsperince, but in truth it is anything but.  Most games would have you go kill 10 spiders and then turn in the quest.  However, ESO (Elder Scrolls Online) is vastly different.  While killing those said 10 spider, you may find a letter in one of the stomach of the pests, telling you of a soldier who feel victim to a spider attack, it would tell you to return that letter to his family.  Only to find out that the family has gone missing and they have been captured by a Cult.  A cult whom worships a spider demon as a god. You destory the cult members and their deity and in the process you put all the dead spirts to rest. Quests like this is why ESO is truly amazing and one of a kind. Tldr; game quests are good you should feel good by playing it."
Positive,Great game after the new content was added.
Positive,"Fun game, lots of content. I'll admit the housing system is kinda limiting but it's still fun. Would recommend!"
Positive,"Ah, Elder Scrolls Online, the game that didn't cure my existential crisis but sure made it more bearable. Who needs therapy when you can spend countless hours collecting butterfly wings and slaying mudcrabs?Pros:- Gave me a whole new virtual world to feel inadequate in- My character has a nicer house than I'll ever afford in real life- I've developed an impressive ability to identify alchemy ingredients on sight (still useless in job interviews)Cons:- Now I'm depressed in two realms instead of just one- My cat judges me even harder for my 18-hour gaming sessions- I've started dreaming in loading screensIn conclusion, ESO didn't solve my problems, but it did give me new, more interesting ones. Like, should I spend my last gold on a mount or a sweet hat? These are the kind of life-changing decisions I live for now.If you're looking for a game that will consume your life without significantly improving it, boy do I have news for you! ESO is that game. It's the perfect distraction from the void, and sometimes, that's all we can ask for.P.S. If anyone needs me, I'll be in Auridon, contemplating my virtual existence while fishing for the next 5 hours."
Positive,"Fantastic game! Unfortunately the PVP is something that they never really fixed, every fix they try the break more things. PVE though is very enjoyable!"
Positive,I have been playing since 2015. I am still finding new adventures and challenges daily.
Positive,all good no bad just play
Positive,"very fun, good lore, i love walking around the open world"
Positive,"I've played 5,700 hours, I recommend this game."
Positive,"Bought the Golden edition with morrowind, summerset, thiefsguild and dark brotherhood dlc. It contained an instant mount 500 crowns and it let me started in Summerset. As a big fan of the TES world and stories, history this is a game I really enjoy. The combat is a little bit on the easy side compared to Morrowind or Oblivion and freeplay your inventory bag is real small. Those are the only cons I can think of, after 2days playing I subscribed myself monthly for ESO Plus. The TES realm is my favorite rpg realm and with ESO you finally can explore almost all of Tamriel, which is f-ing awsome as a TES fan."
Positive,"Ok so I kind of have a love-hate relationship with this game. From a game play and elder scrolls lore perspective, the game is just fine, even good in places. Is it the best MMO out there? No. Is this the only place that is still creating elder scrolls lore that is worth anything? Yes (we don't talk about the elder scrolls mobile games). It is a great place to explore elder scrolls and and very solo player friendly and they do seem to put a lot of thought into the lore they create. I don't particularly care about the MMO parts of it, but they seem pretty standard compared to other MMOs i've played in the past.What I HATE about this game is the obvious greed and seeming lack of care to player requests for features (like story mode for dungeons to enjoy the lore of it). They brag about not needing a subscription to play after buying, but that is only TECHNICALLY true. They will still bug you to pay for the subscription, and they lock a lot of good things behind it, such as the infinite loot bag and all DLC outside the base game that you can't buy except through their in-game store and require crowns which also cost real money. And don't even get me started on their loot boxes. It is clear their main focus is getting people to spend real money and get the subscription, even with this being a pay to play game. If it was F2P it would make more sense, but this is just greedy.If that is a deal breaker for you and you don't care that much about elder scrolls, i'd say pass on this game. But if you are a die hard elder scrolls fan and just want to run around Tamriel and enjoy the new lore they create and are willing to pay for at least the subscription, I feel this game is worth it and why I ultimately would recommend it."
Positive,"It's pretty good, only played for a short time but had fun"
Positive,Мне лень что-то писать. Просто лайк
Positive,Yeah it's pretty good...
Positive,Addictive enough to let you ignore existential dread for a while.
Positive,GOOD GAMEGOOD GRAPHIKAGOOD SOUNDBUT *HAVE TO BUY* SUB FOR INFINITE STORAGE
Positive,O'k I was a late joiner to this game. I originally bought it a few years back dabbled for an hour and walked away. However I was looking for something that was a bit of a time sink yet easy to get into.  Not wanting to be tied to hard core dungeon raiding (you can if you want) but something you can solo yourself.  I decided to give it another go and found myself being drawn into the lore and story as I went along.  I could list pro's and Cons for the game but mine will be different your's so I won't!  Play it and find out for yourself.  The Pro I will say though is you don't need to have ESO plus or pay a subscription to play this game.  A great game that I neglected for way to long that you can drop in and out of anytime you wish.This game wasn't given to me for free
Positive,Sometimes birthday gifts rock. This game absolutely rocks. 16 hours and not looking back.
Positive,This shit is fire
Positive,"This MMORPG can be compared to WoW, BUT because of the immersive storyline This is the superior product. Yes you quest and find objects, but this game offers a MUCH richer set of details along the way."
Positive,"Very fun to play with friends,  found it an enjoyable open world game."
Positive,Great MMO. Would continue to play it if i didnt have to spend a fortune every year for all the new content.
Positive,"I love dragon ass and werewolves dicks, it make me about to explode everywhere"
Positive,Keeps me occp[ied for hours
Positive,"One of the first games I got on my first computer, and now I'm that finally able to play it again. It brings back old memories; I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and will"
Positive,"Highly addictive. Great, engaging story telling. Can't seem to put this game down. Can't believe this game first came out over 10 years ago. They are still updating and adding content all the time. This is the most hours I have put playing the same game. I tried playing other games since I started ESO but can't seem to stop coming back to this one. Lots of content to keep you engaged and interested for a long while."
Positive,"Help me, i'm stuck"
Positive,The cats in this game are pretty hot
Positive,Good community and guilds. I like the combat more than other games like this. Tons of content.
Positive,10/10 Bolog Mals
Positive,Enjoying my re-introduction to The Elder Scrolls.
Positive,"Good, Not as good as Skyrim, but good :thumbup:."
Positive,all of the dialogs are voiced fo an mmo gam is perfect
Positive,makes pp go crazy
Positive,I personally enjoy traveling around and seeing the landscape. The quests are enjoyable and make the experience more rich. I enjoy playing with my adult son and daughter.
Positive,"Absolute fantastic game with endless content and great story lines. You would get comfortable with one of the many portions of the game and realise that you have not event scratched the surface of it. Quests, Dungeons, Trials, Card Games, Home decoration, Many Maps/Locations to explore, Guild Missions, Gear, Group Play, Solo Play, PVP, World PVP, you name it, it is in here. Possibly the best MMORPG out there.I would say the only thing that I miss from other MMORPGs, are flying mounts."
Positive,"We love this game, one of the best games we have ever played in a long time."
Positive,"A perfect blend between casual, explorative, and hard-core MMORPG!"
Positive,"Good game, cool graphics, smooth."
Positive,"one of the best mmorpgs, not pay to win, good graphics, and its elder scrolls."
Positive,its a fun game i have played a lot of it and have not even beat all the dlc
Positive,"I've spent literal years trying to convince every friend I have to play this game with me and so far it has not worked, so I basically play it solo. I adore the game though, beautiful graphics, fun classes and interesting stories, beware the zone chat race wars though... some people take fantasy racism really far"
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) is like that buffet where you start with salad and end up with a plate full of random items you can't identify. It's got everything: quests, crafting, PvP, dungeons, and enough lore to make a Tolkien fan weep.First off, the character creation is insane. You can spend hours crafting your perfect hero, only to slap a helmet on them and never see their face again. I spent more time perfecting my character’s jawline than I did choosing my college major.The world of Tamriel is HUGE. I once set out to complete a quest and got distracted by a butterfly, a scenic vista, and approximately 47 side quests. I swear, by the time I finished, I’d forgotten what I set out to do in the first place. Good thing NPCs are patient.Combat is a chaotic blend of clicking, spells, and trying to avoid accidentally attacking that one guard who will end your entire career faster than you can say “Fus Ro Dah.” But hey, if you’ve ever wanted to get stomped by a giant spider, this is your game.The community is a mix of helpful veterans and new players who still think sprinting drains stamina. I got lost once, and someone escorted me to my destination like a VIP. I think they were just trying to get me to stop asking dumb questions in chat.Crafting is a game within a game. Ever wanted to become a blacksmith who occasionally saves the world? Now you can! I’ve spent more time gathering materials than actually fighting monsters. My inventory is a hoarder's dream (or nightmare).PvP is where you go to test your mettle and/or become cannon fodder. I joined a siege once and spent most of the time running away from flaming boulders. It's thrilling, if you like the taste of humble pie.The graphics and sound are top-notch. I sometimes log in just to wander around and listen to the ambient sounds. Who knew virtual birds could be so relaxing?ESO is a fantastic, sprawling adventure that will eat up your time faster than a hungry skeever. Just be prepared to occasionally ask yourself, “Wait, what was I doing again?” and remember: there’s always another quest to distract you from saving the world."
Positive,"After playing for more than 2000 hours, let me summarize some advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are that the plot tasks are large, the art style is very good, the copy design is relatively people-friendly (most copies are quite easy to understand), and the balance of careers is OK. The disadvantage is that the impact of the battle is very poor (including the sound effects of ordinary attacks, special effects of skills, etc.), and the perspective of the scene is seriously insufficient, which cannot allow the player to clearly feel the distance, which greatly reduces the player's immersion in the scene. What a pity for such a beautiful picture. The texture of scene items is blurred. Considering game optimization, this may be a technically difficult problem to overcome. However, it is already 2024. In order to attract fresh players and have clear picture quality, character modeling requires cross-era progress. When making a plot, the dialogue with the characters is always a separate pop-up window, and the experience is not very good. It would be fine if we could do it in a communication and performance way like the Elder Scrolls 5. The skill tree system has done a good job. Recently, engraving skills have been released, but the degree of freedom is still very poor. In a battle with monsters, I want to have a battle experience where all kinds of magic fly around and weapons and skills are unlimited.I always feel that this is indeed a great game, and I also always feel that it lacks some aspects that can make players say：“COOL”."
Positive,"In real life, I am nobody. In ESO, I am a lizard man who steals bread and likes the winter climates. This game  is great."
Positive,Love it <3
Positive,Kinda pissed that the deluxe upgrades don't include the previous chapters.
Positive,fun n ez game
Positive,Fun if you enjoy addiction
Positive,it's okay i guess
Positive,"Cons:UI isnt the best at takes getting used toQuests can get fairly boring and repetetiveMost good gear is locked behind paywall - sub neededPros:Huge, I mean HUGE, worldInnovative ideas - all factions can play together, joining guild on entire account, ...Combat is unlike any other MMO - block, dodge, sneak, basic attackSub offers a fair amount of content - and lets be honest what is a MMO without a monthly sub"
Positive,"There's lots of mixed feelings about ESO. I like it. Started playing years ago, then got sucked into the world of Fallout, and spent way too many hours in F76, which I still love, but have gotten a bit bored with. A few months ago I decided to give ESO another shot, and glad I did.If you enjoy RPGs like I do, there's an absolutely ridiculous amount of content. Didn't even need a subscription to dive back in. Though after a few months, I played enough, ponied up. But it's really not necessary.I'm a casual player. But you'll notice all the videos by the veteran pros make it seem like there's a whole lot to figure out, but you don't have to take it all too seriously to just have a bit of fun. The challenges are there when you're up for it.While I haven't played many MMO games, ESO is an easy one to jump into. You can choose PVE or PVP. Just the base game is well worth the few bucks to start with, even better if you get it on sale!"
Positive,"Tried this game at launch and it wasn't good. I'm not a big fan of MMOs in general but as an Elder Scrolls fan I decided to give this game another chance now that it has all these new expansions and I'm really enjoying it as a solo experience. It's not as good as the mainline titles but it's still fun to explore the world, the main quests are alright and the combat is fun. Plays well with gamepad and on handheld systems."
Positive,the best MMO RPG Game
Positive,12k hours I guess I like it...
Positive,"Highly recommended, one of the best if not the best MMORPG on the market at the moment."
Positive,absolutely love itso much content and variety of optionsgood for chilling if you dont want intense combat all the timepvp and dungeons for the more intense combos tho
Positive,"I know it's not for everyone. But I, myself enjoy playing this game. You honestly don't have to pay to play this game. Except, you know, getting a hold of the DLC's. But other then that, there is much to choose from and a great game to play with even friends. Anyone should at least try it once, especially if you love Skyrim."
Positive,"After a thorough search for a new MMO, I stumbled upon The Elder Scrolls Online , and it's been a revelation. Initially eyeing New World for its medieval fantasy vibe, I found ESO to be the perfect fit. Despite my limited playtime, I'm already enamored with its skill system, combat dynamics, and rich storytelling, all reminiscent of the beloved Elder Scrolls series. What's more, the game offers ample content even without DLCs, making it a solid choice for anyone diving into the MMO scene. If you're seeking a fresh adventure in a vibrant fantasy world, ESO comes highly recommended."
Positive,"ive been around since launch of ESO playing it on multiple platforms. Aside from FFXIV this is the MMO i come back to. I do recommend this game it has alot to offer new players. It does not require a forced subscription but it is optional. The subscription is worth the price because it pays for itself and you can buy entire chapters or DLC with crowns, if you save them up each month. This game has come along way for the 10 years its been around. I'm hoping for a new race like daedric/dremora like torvesard. Would also love to see flying in this game if ever possible. be prepared to spend countless hours playing this game because max level is 3600."
Positive,"I have so much hours in this game, it is just so good that i cant stop,please join this ever growing community and society thanks sigmas much love"
Positive,Top Tier Game!  Great Content!
Positive,Do not buy it if you think it will be Skyrim online. It is a very different game.
Positive,i havent played it for long but i enjoy it!
Positive,cute pug lizards. 10/10
Positive,"Enjoyable to even play solo as a ""single-player"" game."
Positive,Epic alternative to other MMORPGs
Positive,"After playing World of Warcraft (racking a lot of hours of play time), this game has similar mechanics as wow but feels more immersive when playing in first person. the combat seems to be easier in the sense that there are less spells to use at one time but feel the enemies are harder to combat, which gives me a fresh prospective to play a MMO. If you like Skyrim and wow then this is deffo the game for you."
Positive,"Despite it being the blacksheep of The Elder Scrolls series, it is a good game, it is a fun MMO. It's a fun game to play with your friends. The Elder Scrolls Online is my second favorite Elder Scrolls game, Morrowind being my number 1. The DLCs are also worth getting. I highly recommend The Elder Scrolls Online!!!"
Positive,Better than anything Bethesda will ever make again!
Positive,"Love this game so much! I have some issues being able to play it fully because I currently play on a mac, but the events and stories are so fun I keep coming back for more"
Positive,great time to start or come back
Positive,"It's Elder Scrolls, it's an MMO. Flawed but fun and I'll play it as long as the servers exist!"
Positive,"Very lush open world with virtually unlimited content, profound lore, decent graphics"
Positive,This game got me through the pandemic.
Positive,Base game is fun.Main Story line is good.Combat is enjoyable.DLC regions + story lines are usually excellent quality.Been playing for years and always come back for the annual updates at minimum.

Positive,"When I was sixteen, I won a great victory. I felt in that moment I would live to be a hundred. Now I know I shall not see thirty. None of us know our end, really, or what hand will guide us there. A king may move a man, a father may claim a son, but that man can also move himself, and only then does that man truly begin his own game. Remember that howsoever you are played or by whom, your soul is in your keeping alone, even though those who presume to play you be kings or men of power. When you stand before God, you cannot say, ""But I was told by others to do thus,"" or that virtue was not convenient at the time. This will not suffice. Remember that."
Positive,It does not play like the main games but its actually a lot of fun and you can grab the game + all expansions for under 20 usd/euros/pounds and sub is not required. I do hope for a character model upgrade at some point as the player models are showing their age.
Positive,"Phenomenal game, phenomenal graphics. Really holds up, even after 10 years! Been playing since the game came out. I take breaks from it from time to time but I always come back!"
Positive,Open world madness. You go around and discover interesting places and just spam kill everything while looting.
Positive,Very fun with friends
Positive,"Buen juego, para tener demasiadas horas de juego"
Positive,Really enjoying coming back to ESO and just chilling to do a few story quest. Running mostly maxed on Steamdeck OLED makes this game look great too. Pick it up on sale for $5 usually with no monthly fee makes it a good casual MMO. Everything being voiced is always a plus too for immersion.
Positive,"Yes, this game can be played and enjoyed as a single player game.No, you don't need to buy anything other than the base game.ESO is most definitely not pay to win. The DLC or the monthly subscription just gives you access to more story content, weapons, skins, new areas, game modes, and theyre pretty cheap if you don't go the Steam route *hint hint*.Like every other Elder Scrolls game there are a few main story quests and lots of side quests. The world map is big, huge, immense and there are lots of places of interest to explore. The difference with ESO is there are other human players occupying your map but they won't bother you. They are just doing their own thing, as you are doing your own thing.Frequently there are events which if you join you will automatically team up with any other players that opt in. There are also daily quests which are short missions, and Expeditions which are longer missions. If you are a high enough level you can solo these however, it's easier, quicker and just more fun to do them in a team.Did you like the base building in Fallout 4? Well in 76 it is even better. Did you hate the base building in Fallout 4? Then don't worry, in 76 it's actually good and useful.If you enjoyed the previous Fallout games, there is no reason not to get this one."
Positive,"Just starting TESO for the 1st time. After hours in Skyrim, Oblivion and Morrowind.And wow, this is nice, has all the vibes of a good Elder Scrolls game. Have seen Morrowind only so far but it looks better than any mod, looking forward to see the rest. Maybe not as deep as Oblivion (my favorite game) so far, with a MMO game dimension that is new and I have not yet started to explore. But I always played Oblivion with no care for the main quest so I guess this is what I'm doing in this larger scale game. Interface is pretty good and easy to use.Do I recommend? For now, hell yeah!"
Positive,I have been playing the elder scrolls series since I was a bairn and don't intend on stopping any time soon.
Positive,"""Can you believe it? Dragons! In your own homeland! What are you going to do?"""
Positive,This THING is a GEM! The crafting and the combat are really fun and the story is also exciting to follow for the most part.
Positive,"As a WoW Player, I'm impressed by this MMO. Super fun and a decent change."
Positive,argonian sex update when?
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online is a standout title in the MMO genre. Its vast world is filled with captivating stories that truly shine, drawing players into its immersive universe. While some missions can feel repetitive, the diverse environments and characters keep the gameplay fresh and engaging.The game's end-game content and PvP have a manageable learning curve, requiring some time to master builds but remaining accessible. Social features, particularly guilds, are a significant asset, providing valuable support and enhancing the overall experience.One of the most impressive aspects is the high number of players encountered, which is notably higher than in many other MMOs, adding to the game's vibrant and lively atmosphere. Overall, Elder Scrolls Online is a fantastic game that I would highly recommend to any MMO enthusiast."
Positive,"This game is absolutely huge. There are so many regions to visit, each with its own weather and architecture styles. A wide variety of enemies and full voice acting for all characters. The story is decent enough unlike New World which is basically fetch quests. Recognise some pretty famous voice actors used for some of the roles. People complaining about lack of inventory space just buy more with money you collect throughout the game. I thought Skyrim was huge but this is on another level. Unlike other Bethesda games I have not encountered any bugs or the need to be fixed by modders. It goes on sale pretty regularly and can be picked up cheap from various sites, you will definitely get your moneys worth."
Positive,"Regardless what people say, this is still one of the best mmorpgs out there."
Positive,AWESOME GAME. 10/10 BUY IT! NOW!!! (i suggest buying it wen on sail thouch cuz 20 bucks kinda expensive... it was on sale for 6$!! AWESOME!!!
Positive,i love this game.
Positive,"it was good up until i got bored of never feeling powerful cuz everything scales with you, but who cares about having the fantasy of feeling powerful in a fantasy world huh"
Positive,"Good, if you're an Elder Scrolls freak. There's more Elder Scrolls here than you could ever hope to get through."
Positive,its good :)
Positive,Only recommended to people who are obsessed with The Elder Scrolls.
Positive,"It's a fun game with a lot of content if you can get it on sale. ESO plus feels like an absolute necessity or you won't even be able to hold all the mats. While the questing is great and the gameplay is fun, be prepared to spend some cash."
Positive,"I like that steam counts having the launcher open as me playing the game. Now I have over 2800 hours logged in the game according to steam. Also I guess I enjoy the never-ending quest to collect the best looking armour and weapon styles and spending countless hours changing the way my characters look. I'm bad at fighting the real big bad guys, but that doesn't matter as long as I'm having fun. I can sort of go around them while I'm having fun."
Positive,"There's just so, so, so much content. I've already played over 250 hours and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of how much there is to explore. Very fun to play."
Positive,PVP in Cyrodil is where it's at.
Positive,Graet stuff !   Adventure personified !
Positive,IMA FIRIN MAH LAZOR!
Positive,Great MMO with customization's. I feel able to play with out having to pay.
Positive,the perfect rpg
Positive,"The best thing that works for me is NOT being forced to do PVP but everything else is at a random to do as you please, when you please! The graphics are pretty cool. And since I've been playing this series since Morrowind came out it is right up my alley of enjoyment!"
Positive,The DLCs add a lot to the game and you can spend hours just grinding to learn about the different mechanics or you can go through actual game play. There is always something new to discover. Its fun to play alone or with a group. The community is awesome.
Positive,"Don't listen to the elistist reviewers who write a book about the game (with basically 0 factual or logical arguments written).- Wanna play solo? No problem- Wanna do raids till 2 AM for fancy titles? No problem- Wanna stealthbomb pvp'ers on an assassin? No problem- Wanna RP, read lore, do quests at your own pace, immers yourself? No problem- Wanna spend money on cosmetics rather than P2W? No problem- Wanna mess around with people, have social gatherings and become a wealthy merchant? No problem- Wanna be a thief, or an assassin, a hero, a lowlife, a toxic **** or an achievement hunter? No problem- ........ you get the point nowPvE, PvP, Player driven economy, lore, skill>luck. Pretty much sums it up. Yea you have some bugs, sometimes pvp is icky with balancing, sure there's issue's at times. Remember that it's a 10 year old game now. It's solid, play it, give it a chance if you want to"
Positive,"I love this game, it's just really disappointing how absolutely shit these servers are and ZOS has done NOTHING to fix it."
Positive,"Pretty good game,  not much is explained, tutorial system is pretty lacking.  So still learning the basics here and there."
Positive,★ ★ ★ ★ ☆
Positive,It is a really cool game with a really big world to explore. It also has many things you can do there for example cooking or blacksmithing. So the possibilities are endless.
Positive,"I’ve never gotten around to reviewing this until now. Elder scrolls was the very first game I got on PC and I’ve spent a lot of hours just exploring and dabbling with my build (magic dragonknight dps). I met some of my first friends on here and joined their guild. We had so much fun doing trials and dungeon runs. Although some parts of this game was a little buggy, it didn’t change the fact of how beautiful this game was. Every detail was not left unnoticed. The soundtrack was pretty stellar too for each location.I’ve gotten through all the main quests and side quests in the base game and I’ve also gave in to buying a few DLCs as well as being a die hard ESO plus member lol.Unfortunately my guild disbanded and I kinda slowly stopped playing altogether.For what it was worth, I still remember this game being my safe haven. The start of my love for video games.Definitely still recommend. It’s a good temporary replacement for skyrim. Now I hope Elder Scrolls 6 arrives before I die xD"
Positive,"Skyrim on steroids! Well maybe not steroids, but close. If you enjoyed Skyrim, this is the next game. Absolutely huge, Tons of missions. Lots of countries. A bit pricey, so wait for a special. Pity they don't seem to have specials on the DLC. They have a pay by month option that gives you access to everything, but that is extremely costly for those outside of the US and some European countries.Managing the game and looking at what DLCs you have and what DLCs are available is horrible. It is not user friendly. I currently have no idea what DLC content I have purchased, nor do I know where to find it. Then if I want to buy more DLC, how do I find what is available and how do I ensure I am not just double purchasing what I own already? And at such high prices for my country, we cannot afford to pay multiple times for the same DLC!!! Make your interfaces more friendly!!! Even the monthly PLUS cost is prohibitive. At that price I would expect to play the game and nothing but the game for 2 months everyday for it to be cost effective. Offline games give me that type of experience and time usage, especially or a game that is 10 years old and showing it's age. I am not complaining about the look, don't fix it, you might btreak it, but adjust the costing to match."
Positive,"This game use to be the greatest game I had ever played, I've spent over 20,000 hours playing it and use to be one of the best on stamina nightblade for player versus player content, I've made so many friends and so many great memories playing this, from becoming emperor of cyrodiil, to killing a really big bear in a dungeon 1000 times just so i can get a proc set that gets nerfed the next day. This game unfortunately fell short when they shortened the skill gap, new players can kill expert players based off their gear. I use to 1v24, then the game got really bad making AOE attacks over powered, allowing people to have waaaay too much hp and still be able to do damage. In pvp all you'll find are tanks that zerg people down. Unfortunately the game is over ran now by tanks and healers, dps is no longer a thing since nobody wants to die. Overall game was awesome, not so much anymore. rating : 6.5/10 You could probably spend 500 hours playing this till you get bored."
Positive,I cant express how deep my love for todd is!
Positive,"One of the best MMORPGs, though it's more worth it when you have friends to play with and the monthly subscription. I won't play without the monthly subscription because you do miss out on tons of content and helpful mechanics if you don't buy it."
Positive,Chad Girthquake approves.
Positive,2k hrs. No idea what I’m doing. Love the game. Molag Bal Rules.
Positive,"Really enjoying the game, would recommend it !!!"
Positive,"one of my favorite elder scrolls gamesbeautiful massive world with regular dlcsimmersive worldbuilding and npcsmmo aspects (jobs, farming, crafting) are tedious but fungameplay and fighting is ok"
Positive,Always something to do!
Positive,I had been waiting this game for almost 10 yeears and now i got it. It's so exciting game. Every second it's shivering. Just played 4 hours and felt like i was in the game not as a third person
Positive,"Great Game set in one of my favourite universe!I was hooked to Elder Scrolls since Morrowind, then Oblivion and Skyrim.I might be biased and there is plenty of things that i really don't like but you should give it a try."
Positive,"Ive only gotten to lvl 20 so far. Here's my thoughts. Graphics - Good looking game. Better than WoW graphics, but not a good as Final Fantasy. Still a good looking game though. Controls - Controls seem pretty standard and feel pretty good. I like the fact I get to click when I do combat and it does something.Combat - Feels really good. This is a great change from the standard tab click MMO's. Questing - Quests feel really detailed and I love the amount of voice acting they have thing the game. Most quests are pretty fun. Thus far though, I have not been a fan of the amount of quests that keep you in town talking to 50 different people but I think thats just part of familiarizing players to the game.Playing with friends - Do dungeons with friends is a ton of fun. Questing with them is also fun but I did find it a bit complicated on how to truly start new characters with friends and everyone quest and level together. Not as good as some other MMO's but not horrible. Overall Pros - The game is very immersive and has a lot to do. The leveling system is really straight forward and simple. I love the fact you can have player housing and the dungeons so far have been incredibly fun to play with friends. Overall Cons - The crafting is not very straight forward. Questing with friends has proven to be a bit of a pain. At this point in my game play im not seeing much that's catching my eye and or exciting me for end game type content. Again I may be low level, but in other MMO's i would see other players or see certain things that would excite me to continue leveling. I havent seen much of this, thus far.Still this is a really fun game so far and I look forward to seeing how the end game content is."
Positive,"EXTREMELY helpful community , Although the fact that alot of the game is paid is quite stupid. AMAZING for people who love open world games, as you can go to 70% of tamriel and other places beyond it. a little daunting for beginners, however. Funny emotes too. /danceargonian :mafia:"
Positive,fun and the people playing the game are willing to help out new players
Positive,i love the tambiel universe but combat could be better
Positive,Really enjoy it especially as a temporary skyrim 2 waiting pallete cleanser
Positive,I love that I am able to play with my friends/other players :)
Positive,Why is this mmo actually good

Positive,I love this game.
Positive,"Eso is a game I could not get into. 3rd time the charm is a saying for a reason, my friends told me to give it a try one more time, so I did, best decision of my life tbh, I put 72 hours into this game and it wasn't even boring. I must've been trippin' the first 2 playthroughs. I may or may not have gained a slight crown crate gambling addiction... But the game is fun overall definitely glad i gave it another try."
Positive,100% worth the purchase as you don't need to pay a monthly subscription to play. A way better looking game(once you use Voltan's Advanced Settings addon which allows you to have much higher graphical settings and capability to play at 200 fps if your pc can handle it) and way better game since you don't need to manage buffs like in WoW. Tab targeting in WoW is way too outdated and way too boring to play too.
Positive,It's pretty good fr
Positive,Fun times with friends
Positive,Better than starfield
Positive,There's an American Football team in Wales called the Thunder Ducks; in Oxford there are the Killer Ponies.Those are some pretty good names.
Positive,other then the monthly bill of eso plus biting my ass and the continued addiction to crown crates i love this game
Positive,"A good game for Single Player wanting to play in MMO environment. Rich narrated quests, varied environments and a lot to do. Just forget about crafting if you do not have ESO plus (subscription). There is 4 player and 12 player content too, but this game is very single player friendly."
Positive,"There's something for every play style, from PVE and PVP to crafting and housing. An overall good experience for the price of the base game."
Positive,"Well... I've played it for over 3900 hours (Holy Hanna!) ... that probably says all I need to say, yes?"
Positive,What can I say? I'm having fun. Game is still very active and the comunity is lovely and helpful.
Positive,"It is solo playable too, so you can just ignore that fact that other players are there and pretend it is ES6."
Positive,Fun game to give a try worth giving it a go
Positive,"Super hesitant to buy this myself, as it is an MMO and I already had Skyrim, my friend bought me this as a gift.Ho goodness was I missing out before. It's got all the appeal of quests in Skyrim, crafting is even better than Skyrim, combat's a little worse but definitely way more varied which makes up for it and then some, and there are tons of aspects that don't even compare to Skyrim. Within one year and two months of owning the game I have invested more hours into this game than I have in all of my about about ten years of owning Terraria. It has become my number one most played game on Steam, and quite probably my most played game period. Maybe only Club Penguin would be more hours, as I played that religiously as a child. The highest praise I can give this game personally is that I burn out on games quickly and get bored of games fast, and I have over 900 hours in this game. The highest praise I can give this game less personally would likely be to say that it has as good of an online experience as Club Penguin used to give, and has enough content to keep you endlessly entertained. For its price, it's a bargain. If any game is worth the amount of money a game is sold for, this game is second only to Baldur's Gate 3. Seriously, don't let the MMO tag throw you off like I did, this game is worth it, even if you're not a fan of MMOs generally."
Positive,"This one's a tough one.I wasn't very interested in ESO when it was announced. I'm not a huge MMO player. But a ton of my friends were interested, and they are who got me hooked. When the beta signups went live? That's when the bug hit me.And so I played the game for years. From the release in 2014/2015 times through... Hell, probably through 2019 with some degree of regular activity. Hiatuses too. There were some magical times in the game(s). There are elements of story and immersion that really sell the game well. The gameplay is considered by many to be Baby's First MMO given the small number of abilities. I think it's just different, because at high levels, your APM is the same, just doing different things. (And no, not just clicking your mouse to death, John. That is literally only  you.)That being said, I don't particularly care about the gameplay. I never really found the Everquest MMO model very riveting. I let other people claim it's God's Gift to gamers, and we've all turned our back on his benevolence for evolving past it twenty years ago. No matter which version of it was your favorite coat of paint.ESO isn't any better. Using the Hero Engine, and working off of what it could on a shaky release? It survived. Long enough for someone to gift me this edition after I already had it.So, what now?Now the game has slowed to a bit of a crawl. It had its resurgent height during the Elsweyr release. For a brief moment, its growth eclipsed other games, even Final Fantasy. But that time appears to be past.I have no idea how group content goes. Though, mass content seems to be a slump. With Mass PvP in a lull, with any decently equipped small group prepped to storm over the server with no mass able to stop them alone. Animation canceling was meta for so long that big names revolted when they tried (and still partially failed) to crack down on it.No idea.That being said, there's a lot of decent solo content out there if you're interested in it, and maybe some of that magic could be relived by someone with a passion for the Elder Scrolls."
Positive,"Not repetitive contents, community is noob-friendly"
Positive,"Used to play this on xbox way back when it first released. Having a ton of fun re running through the story, I love a good MMO and chose this one as the one to come back to. Still a pretty big following on the game! Would definitely recommend getting back into it if you've been tossing around the idea!!"
Positive,"I've played since second round of Beta invites and ten years later- Im still playing.  I own most of the game now and have full character content on both sides of the pond. Why? Yes. You're right I don't have much of a social life -but- I have a rich inner life.  All that to say, there are still quests I've not done, places I've not been, and area in ESO I have not yet seen.  True to most of Bethesda's overwhelming content in its games. Rich, lore-full and imo the most, and best beautiful RPG ever created, and yes, real women play (and love) Elder Scrolls online, I am one of them.  I mean, ""Sotha Sil"", how could you not?  It's lovely, fun and if you look hard enough you can still find others who are worthy of questing, rpg, dungeoneerIng and pvping.  If you don't have friends to join you, eventually, you will find a few in ESO.  What I liked? I like it all. What I dislike?  Overly expensive new content, but all that takes is a bit of patience for the sale days."
Positive,Best MMO for me and my personal favorite game ever
Positive,"Love ESO, 10/10"
Positive,Swing big metal stick <3
Positive,"My journey end with vSS gs run, now i can rest, It's was wonderful journey with my guild and friends and of course it's a great game except pvp toxicity"
Positive,"I quit FFXIV for this. Superior systems, in depth story telling, welcoming community, easy to understand but difficult to master. Amazing housing system. Everything you'd want in an MMO and you can join multiple guilds to fulfill your trading/housing/gaming/ERP needs. Admittedly if you're weak to gambling and FOMO you could be wasting a lot of money in the crown store but I don't care about that stuff so it makes no difference to me. I've been able to succeed at everything I want to do without ESO+ or crowns. I paid 30$ for all deluxe expacs and 12$ for a guar. That's like a nice dinner out these days for hundreds of hours of gameplay and exploration on a funny toad monster. A pretty good deal."
Positive,"Played this game for years on console. Decided to give it a spin on PC. As someone who has had over thousands of hours on this game. I will put down notes below.Pros: - Unique and fun builds that can handle normal to base game vet content- Fun house building system that allows for unique designs which can allow for people to create guild halls(crafting tables, mundus stones)- In-depth story that is fully voice acted- Easy and understandable leveling system of skills and Champion points- Nice Daily Rewards which could sometimes be crown crates or small DLCs- Nice cosmetic customization system- Role Queue is simple for Normal and Vet dungeonsCons:- Pay-walled Material bags (specialty inventory bag that allows for unlimited material capacity, without it your inventory gets filled quickly)- Pay-walled premium mounts that are better than in game mounts- Pay-walled classes and race(Necro, arcanist, and Imperial)- Pay-walled Skill lines like Thieves guilds, Dark Brotherhood, Scrying, Psijic. - Inventory System is a mess everything is just on a straight list you have to scroll through, on PC will need mods on organizing- No open auction halls, everything is guild controlled which means you can buy but can't sell unless you're in the guild, several guilds are so nitpicky about selling in them you have to have at least 100+ hours before you can sell at a good trader. - Daily Mount leveling (you have 60 points in speed, stamina, inventory, you can only level 1 point daily to level it entirely unless you buy scrolls with crowns using irl money)- Researching Traits (It multiples exponentially, meaning that the final trait is wait based which could take upwards to 21 days to learn the final trait on a specific item, multiply this across all the items in blacksmithing, Leatherworking, clothing, jewerly, etc)- Endgame content can be quite demanding needing to learn how to parsing and using specific meta builds(Not really much of a Con but there are individuals who are very nitpicky about DPS numbers which could be barring to individuals who want to try high endgame combat) This game has a lot of paywall items that are quality of life come available for ESO+. If you cannot afford ESO+ or do not want to pay for it, you are going to have an annoying time managing a horrid inventory system, still the game is fully playable. Really the worst parts of the game is getting to endgame and attempting mastercrafter feats, aside from that the story can be enjoyable but a bit inconsistent with all the new DLCs that have came out over the years. The game is still a fun social game, guilds will offer lots of fun events and really carries the game for those who do more than log on for an hour to do dailies and log off. If someone is really itching to try this game out, try a trial or buy it when the base game is on sale. There is easily 100+ hours worth of content just on that alone if you want to just go through the various stories and exploring the game. With Add-ons you can really improve some of the quality of life issues with the map and inventory systems. a TL;DR:  A largely pay-walled game, if you can afford ESO+ it's a easy recommend otherwise just buy it when its on a deep sale."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) stands out as a premier MMORPG that I enthusiastically endorse. Its extensive character customization, offering diverse weapons, races, classes, and starting zones, guarantees a one-of-a-kind player journey. What truly distinguishes ESO is its immersive world, complete with a bustling trading system, customizable house decorations, and leisure activities such as fishing. The game's dedication to continuous updates and expansions ensures a consistently fresh experience, making ESO an enticing and enduring choice for both newcomers and seasoned players alike."
Positive,"I think out of all the MMOs I've ever played, ESO is probably the closest to feeling like an actual video game. Don't bother playing it if you're interested in varied builds and deep combat because you'll be disappointed, but if you crave Elder Scrolls lore then you'll probably be satisfied.There's zero challenge to any gameplay outside of the veteran dungeons but to be honest, I'm happy just to wander around and pick flowers and stumble into side quests in unexpected places. I would also say that the recurring NPCs are more developed and likeable than any in the single player ES games.Main problem is that the base game zones are pretty bland compared to the DLC areas so it can take a while to really get going if you insist on playing everything in release order. There is some good stuff though. I like the Thieves Guild and Elsweyr stories the best.Overall a polished and fun but laughably unchallenging game. It's pretty old as of 2023 so I wouldn't be surprised if it goes on life support mode soon, but right now for the relatively cheap buy-in there's a ton of story and exploration on offer."
Positive,"My favorite all-time game!  If you're into RPG's and love to explore in 'Open World' environments to lose yourself in, then you'll undeniably be pledging your allegiance to one of three unique Alliances (Daggerfall Covenant, Ebonheart Pact, Aldmeri Dominion), and to one of seven formidable classes.  You can build up your character in so many diverse ways and specifically to your liking and combat abilities.  I loved this game!  The fighting is calibrated so you're always fighting enemies as strong as you, which makes the battle all the more satisfying.  They have made an exceptional game where quests abound, stories resonate and skills await around every corner.  ESO is a vast world of magic, ideals, beauty and power!  Get your arms ready, get  up and FIGHT!  We're in the lands of Tamriel and you've gotta give it ALL YOU'VE GOT!  This isn't my favorite game for nothing -  it truly delivers...  Cheers everybody and welcome to paradise!"
Positive,One of the best MMO's to play Singleplayer.
Positive,Even after 20k+ hours this Game still does it for me :)
Positive,"Such a great open world game, great worldbuilding, voice acting, game soundtrack and graphics. I love all aspects of this game, and it's something I always return to"
Positive,"This game has the replayability and content MMO's dream of having, a nice, proper MMO with meaningful build crafting and a MASSIVE open world that had hundreds and hundreds of hours of game-play. I'm not exaggerating"
Positive,"I am a ""Plank Owner""...that means... started when it came out... what 2014?It has stories, tales and characters I still remember.  I have 9 toons on Online ESO with 1100 cp's...But came here to start over with a companion and use the stuff I learned over there.Glad to   see  they did something for the   SOLO's.  Me?  I'm 79  going on Octegenarian."
Positive,"Super fun for any mood. Want to experience fully voice acted stories? Done. Wanna go and explore vast areas with heaps and heaps to do? Done. Wanna join in massive PvP battles where three factions vie for power, complete with siege battles? Done. Want smaller, fast paced PvP? Also done. Want to just rumble around and collect resources? You can do that. Hell, you can even collect and play a card game now. Across Steam and Xbox I have played nearly 2000 hours of ESO and absolutely adored every single hour."
Positive,"While the game is an MMORPG, it's still great for solo gameplay. I've rarely played with a group and the game is paced quite well for solo players. For me, the amount of content seems enough in the base game as well as the expansions and players in-game are generally welcoming of the new players.Recommended to buy during sales."
Positive,Truly amazing! Bare in mind the Free Storage Requirement: 126GB!!!This game is Huge
Positive,"It's the Elder Scrolls quests and stories you know and love, but also there are other people like ""Sleeps-on-Bridges"" who make the entire experience better."
Positive,Yup. I think I'll be playing this for a good long time.
Positive,Average oaken soul user.
Positive,Love this game. I've been playing for yeas and have never gotten bored. There is always new content and so much to explore
Positive,It's not bad at all
Positive,"Fantastic MMO. So much content that's either free or goes on sale for cheap regularly, it's almost mind boggling. Very solo friendly. If you enjoy Elder Scrolls and are a lore nerd, this is the game for you."
Positive,this game is on the one hand a MMO and one the other hand a typically Bethathda game like skyrim and i like this combination.
Positive,"So I've played this on both Xbox One and the PC. I have been playing since 2018 and this game definitely doesn't disappoint. I am a huge fan of the elder scrolls series though when I started playing Oblivion back in 2005 as a young girl. Now, well, this just furthers my elder scrolls addiction. I love how they feature some of the og soundtracks from Morrowind and Oblivion. I love Jeremy Soule, the music is part of what makes the whole franchise so immersive. The storylines. Its just beautiful."
Positive,"absolutely glorious. Great lore, immersive quests, and plenty to do at end game!"
Positive,Played this game for 200 hours instead of finishing my senior year of high school. Thanks 2020
Positive,"Keep on coming back to it like it's crack. Played during beta and release, couple years later returned just to leave again lol, and now more than likely here to stay, I love the gameplay, I love the narration, I love you can just do whatever you want and as a new player it's a little overwhelming like all mmos but regardless it really isn't that bad and you can come back to everything. ESO+ is very nice and convenient but it is nice that you can play the game without, you are not restricted by level just convenience wise which is understandable because it is money based. Play style can change a lot while leveling which is fun and you do not have to go out and watch every damn tutorial or youtube video to understand rotation and what to do gameplay wise unless you really want to just get the most out of everything."
Positive,"I played and finished Elder Scrolls - Oblivion and Skyrim (Very short main story) and needed more.I found out about Elder Scrolls - Online and played it for hours and hours as free 2 play and I not once needed a subscription or pay to play.Tons of quests, pvp,pve very fun, massive world really great experience and ambience. Combat system very well done. You can play this game just exploring for hours and not get bored as very map is diferent. I still get WOWed whenever I travel to some other maps. Very great game overall and you don`t need to pay unless you really want to discover dlc`s.And it`s packed with players.Highly recommend"
Positive,Whenever I try to get ESO+ it takes a long time to process and actually get the crowns and other rewards but that might be on steam's side. That is the main complaint from me but there are flaws otherwise good game.
Positive,"I enjoyed playing this with my cousin, its better with people to play with from my experience but I had fun solo farming dungeons."
Positive,Fantastic atmosphere and enless cool quests.
Positive,"The writing is beautiful, the graphics are incredible, and it's a wonderfully put together game. You can tell the people that made this game actually care about it and the Elder Scrolls lore."
Positive,"Large open world. Other players aren't an immediate threat like in RDR2. Lots of options and customizations. Weapons are decent even early in the game. Make sure to research race and class before creating your character.Downside is ""crowns"" are basically P2W and grinding in-game for gold to purchase items takes forever, and crafting skills are slow to accumulate also. Solidifying the micro-transactions as the quickest and easiest way to build up your character.The gameplay and combat are fun. You just need to invest alot of time into the game."
Positive,"you know, sometimes i get sketty in my shoes but it aint all bad"
Positive,The only thing I do not like about this game is that you are forced to subscribe for the lack of bank.inventory
Positive,still exciting even old game
Positive,Nice game for relaxation. UwU
Positive,"I spent many hours of my life playing Elder Scrolls Games and this one has always been one that stands out. I love the Multiplayer capability, I love the expansions every year, and I love the community. It is a nice game to sink hours into. I do wish they would allow you to switch Classes like they do with Race and Alliance, but it will never happen. The game allows addons which I feel are needed to improve the quality of the game. Overall one of my favorite MMOs and my favorite Elder Scrolls Game."
Positive,"G.O.A.T. in amongst the mmorpgs, objectively. Not the first (mmorpg) I played but some other TES games were amongst the first games i played. Keeps the freshness each year, does not require high end hardware and has very large amounts of story. Only downside I can possibly think of that you need to have endz to keep up with content up to date. But that's life.Deserves the celebratory 42nd review and being the first one I write after a fairly large break."
Positive,"I’ve been playing The Elder Scrolls Online for a while now, and I have to say that I’m thoroughly impressed with the game. The amount of content available is staggering, and the gameplay is top-notch. Whether you’re a fan of the Elder Scrolls series or just looking for a new MMORPG to play, this game is definitely worth checking out.One of the things that I really appreciate about The Elder Scrolls Online is how calming it can be. The housing system in the game is fantastic, and it’s a great way to unwind after a long day. There’s something really satisfying about decorating your own virtual home and making it your own.Overall, I highly recommend The Elder Scrolls Online to anyone who’s looking for a great MMORPG with tons of content and engaging gameplay. Whether you’re a fan of the series or just looking for something new to play, this game is definitely worth checking out."
Positive,One of the best mmorpgs
Positive,is fun with many thing to do and roleplay even mystery led quests
Positive,Good time for solo plays
Positive,"I had to go into Safe Mode and uninstall the Zenimax directory to keep the game from running in the background, even from a cold boot of my PC. It's super weird man. The 2 hour refund window almost snuck past me and never got past the launcher. Despite all that garbage, and some of the issues people are having with purchases made on Steam registering to their accounts in game, it's not a bad MMO. I have maybe 500'ish hours prior to it being added to Steam. It's just incredibly easy.  You can get into a serious hardcore guild running trials all week, but there really isn't anything between that and the casual parts of the game, unless you go into PvP which is serviceable I guess, just not something I want to wade around in for hours on end. I really enjoyed the Morrowind expansion, but haven't felt the magic since from any of the other expansions. There's neat stuff to collect, and it's got a decent economy which actually rewards fishing, crafting is super basic, with login timers, but it is at least viable. For 6 dollaridooz on sale it's definitely worth it. I just wouldn't recommend buying the launcher on Steam when you can buy it direct and not have to worry about responding to AI generated conversations from their ""support team""."
Positive,"Nice, Salt farm PVP"
Positive,"my favorite game of all time, making the switch to pc only fortifies this love."
Positive,"Abilities, combat style, aesthetics, and the lore are fantastic.For an MMO it's a bit minimalist but is perfect if that's what you're looking for.Very reminiscent of previous Elder Scrolls games like an MMO-ified Skyrim exactly as you'd expect it to be... maybe more.Downsides are it hasn't solved the common MMO problems like microtransactions and players exploiting the in-game market.Better than the original subscription model but expects a financial investment more than what it offers."
Positive,Best game in my library
Positive,"Ive tried a lot but this is by far the best MMO Ive played in the last 5 years, Looks like they took a good look at all the shortcomings and annoyances in other MMO and really listened to the players."
Positive,Plays great as both a single player experience and a multiplayer experience.
Positive,Love this game. If you like character customization....your bank account will be in trouble
Positive,"havent played for that long, the game has a lot of updates that it has to do, expect to update every 20 days.but for what I have played its quite enjoyable, and a bit much to take in at first, try monster hunter, its about 50% of the complexity of this game"
Positive,"So the game is awesome, complex. Everything is narrated.Keywords: companions, storyquests, map discovery, owning houses,, dungeons, mounts, crafting, flexible skill builds, NPC guilds and player guilds etc. PVP: Normal random battlegrounds (It is a pity that you can not choose the mode you want to play). And faction pvp, meaning one map, tree factions at war for days and each faction has to take the towers (objectives) and Duels...What I don't know at the moment is if this game is P2W, it has an ESO plus (monthly payment) abo which might or might not have advantages in the long run game. I am not sure.If you played BDO or Gw2 and Skyrim, you will like this game. As a total it is a cool game."
Positive,"Best MMO for modern players. There's so much to do as a new player it's overwhelming, but then you find your niche and it's amazing. Everyone plays differently and it's so much fun to do whatever you feel like versus a set amount of tasks and progression like other MMOs"
Positive,"Game is nice. But don't come to this if you are expecting ""Skyrim Online"" this isn't it! This is a MMORPG that happens to be in the Elder Scrolls universe. PvP is not easy to get into if you are not willing to COMMIT for it. PvE is nice for the most part but after playing all story chapters (besides Necrom) I have to say something is lacking. Classes are not much diverse and if you go for meta builds, you are not going to have much ""fun"" as some meta builds for some classes will kill your class skills. You are supposed to use weapon skills on those... which makes things a little WEIRD if you care about class identity. Again THIS is only on some classes! I used to main Warden for both tanking and Stam DPS some will say it's utter garbage but I don't care :D I loved it, I used mostly class skills too! I kind of care about identity to some extent.Crafting is okay for most part. You can do all in a single character if you are psychopath (I did it)Champion point system is nice but at the same time, you feel like the game tried to go for Horizontal Progression but failed. Many things are still PER CHARACTER like most other MMOs with Vertical Progression. It makes it weird sometimes... but that's what we get. Also the fact reconstructing items and changing stats of existing items is locked behind a DLC is ehhh in my opinion (Clockwork City)Crown store is okay for most part. But house prices are RIDICULOUS imagine paying over $100 for a house :D no, thanks. Also as upon writing, they disabled crown gifting. Which was a way of buying crown store items, without paying real money...Mega-server is nice, good to play with friends from other countries... No need to worry about 500 servers and your friend picking the wrong one (looking at you WoW) but also... speaking about friends, questing with friends is not the most ""flawless"" experience I've seen in a MMORPG. Sometimes your friend will be behind on some quest because they forgot talking to a NPC, sometimes your friend will be behind just because they missed an item. Things like that make it painful if you are bringing a group to play with you. Some quests are also buggy and MANY not work with more than one person inside a group doing the objectives at once. Half of my playtime was spent with friends and trust me... it was not fun. Some people will say other MMOs also have such problems and they are not wrong, but for ESO sometimes it's WAY TOO MUCH!Would also be nice if chapters had a longer story line too without needing to spend extra on ""small areas"" like High Isle where the druids lore itself was an EXTRA buy instead of being included with it. Usually chapters have 10-15 hours of gameplay which is not a lot in my opinion if you consider other MMOs.Performance is okay for most part, game would still use some upgrades though."
Positive,"It’s a Wonderful Game filled with great lore and Depth, it’s a grind kinda game but if you’re into those styles you’ll love this, I personally enjoy the crafting and the in depth lore of the Elder Scrolls series"
Positive,it says unsupported but dont let that put you off it plays great on my steam deck after looking for help with the loading.
Positive,"“Elder Scrolls Online is the best thing that ever happened to me. I used to be a lonely and depressed person, but now I have friends, followers and influence all over Tamriel. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want and no one can stop me. I can even change my appearance and gender at will. All for a small price in crowns. Elder Scrolls Online gave me the freedom and power I always dreamed of.” - Clavicus Vile, Prince of Deals“Elder Scrolls Online is a blast. I love farming rare and exotic creatures, especially werewolves and vampires. There’s nothing like the thrill of the chase, the challenge of the fight and the reward of the kill. Elder Scrolls Online lets me unleash my inner beast and have fun at the same time.” - Hircine, Prince of the Hunt“Elder Scrolls Online is a masterpiece. I admire the craftsmanship and creativity that went into creating this world. The lore, the history, the culture, the art, the music, everything is so rich and detailed. Elder Scrolls Online is a source of inspiration and enlightenment for me. I learn something new every day.” - Hermaeus Mora, Prince of Knowledge“Elder Scrolls Online is a riot. I enjoy messing with people and causing chaos wherever I go. I like to prank, gank, trick and deceive others for my own amusement. Elder Scrolls Online gives me plenty of opportunities to do that. There’s always someone or something to laugh at or with.” - Sheogorath, Prince of Madness"
Positive,Fun to play by yourself and with friends.
Positive,So many different things to do it will certainly keep you entertained for whatever mood you're in.
Positive,"ESO is a solid RPG game with decent graphics, expansive zones, crafting, questing and housing."
Positive,yav iyi güzelde eso plus olmadan süründürüyo oyun + istediğin seti yapamıyorsun genelde itemler dlc maplerdeki dunglardan düşüyo eso plus olmadığı için alamıyorsun gold kasıp dlc almakta eziyet olduğundan bazen baydırıyor oyun genel olarak güzel ama dediğim gibi p2w öğeleri içeriyor
Positive,if you like any of the games from the elder scrolls series you will like this it is a little annoying that there is a subscription but you don't need it to have fun
Positive,"If you enjoyed exploring the land and lore, treacherous caves and surprises that each land gave you, such as V: Skyrim, IV: Oblivion, and III: Morrowind, Than you'll enjoy ESO as well. Every place In Tamriel that you visit has its own story plot and side quests, places for you to explore, and yes you can revisit some old favorite places from previous games like Solitude and Riften from V: Skyrim, visit Morrowind to help Lord Vivec, and so on. Play style is unique from other RPG's as it keeps the regular style of previous Elder Scroll titles. I will say there are a few things different from previous titles that may or may not settle with some:1. Crafting system (Weapons, Armor, alchemy, enchantment and so on) is not as simple as it used to. If anything kind of complicated in my opinion.2. Creativity of what 'class' or the feel of play style has now been to reduced to 5  or 6 classes, which leaves little to the imagination compared to that previous titles gave you.3. Though they have the Fighters Guild , Mages Guild, and a new one called 'The Undaunted', The Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood will not be available unless you buy it as DLC (however like I said before, isn't necessary to purchase to experience the entirety of the game).Other than that, the community in the game is wonderful, 99% non toxic (as we all know, there is always that one guy), which can be hard to find in most MMOs nowadays."
Positive,"630 Hours in this game, but only 30 actually playing, the rest is looking at the launcher updating, downloading."
Positive,My wallet died because of this game.
Positive,i lost my RL job and now i'm selling dreugh waxes
Positive,"It's an MMO, when you jump into this game know you are jumping into another job it takes a lot of grinding before you can really even ""play the game"". However if that's what you what like I do then you are in the right place. The monthly subscription is needed not because of the craft bag but that is handy, it's mainly for the DLC. The game has more then $300 of paid DLC but the subscription lets you play it all for $15 a month its also gives you 1500 Crowns (Premium Currency) aswell! Overall though its fun. Much better with friends though!7.5/10!"
Positive,"Much better than i thought it would be, love how you really can be flexible with the skill trees and really build your own version of the class you play, combat is awesmoe, The world feels huge and really fun to explore, really having a blast :)"
Positive,"This game is a great game, i have had the joy of playing it since beta, and it has only gotten better over time.It is always getting new content created and added t it, both by the players and the developers. This Game is for those that are looking for something that takes time to be invested to progress as it is not a quick 1& done style game."
Positive,i like running around and fighting gods on a daily basis
Positive,"Great game, lots of fun."
Positive,It's a really cool game! I like it! It's very entertaining and I love the story line.
Positive,this is a fun game to play
Positive,i was devastate playing this game and i already bought a lot of DLC and in game items definitely must play!
Positive,"Very Good Game :) I played Skyrim While ago and it was Really good,as Story and as the Actions that you feel in Skyrim was really fun,so imagine putting this game into MMo Game :) :)"
Positive,"As an ardent admirer of The Elder Scrolls V, I would highly recommend this game. ESO has kept the world of Tamriel alive with outstanding questlines, immersive voice acting and countless areas to explore. If you enjoy crafting, gathering, hoarding mats and building your character, then this game will ease that itch. The NPCs in this game bring the world to life. At times you would just want to sit back in a tavern and listen to the bard sing tales of heroes and might valors. Watch busy markets, observe horrendous world bosses and be accompanied by a gleeful and helpful community.The world of ESO beckons! Will you answer the call fellow adventurer? Tamriel Awaits!!"
Positive,que rico como las abuelitas en bikini
Positive,I always come back.
Positive,I recommend to my friends! :)
Positive,skyrim meets wow
Positive,"mucho juego, tiene mucho contenido"
Positive,7000 hours in. This game is somewhat playable. Recommend if you have nothing else to do with years of your life.
Positive,"Just started Elder Scrolls Online and already loving it! The open world and lore are captivating, and the character customization adds to the fun. Excited to explore more quests and dungeons in this immersive adventure!"
Positive,"Mostly super rad game, too much stuff is locked behind the subscription though. can't even use some of the basic stations. that said, it's still a pretty cool adventure. the character builds are fun to play with. an okay amount of character customization. content out the bungholio. like i said before about the paywall, some of the content is behind paid unlock. Mostly i'm fine with paying for DLC's because they're really great! but a little bit of it is content that should def have been base game imo."
Positive,Elder scrolls? Skyrim? Morrowid?How could you not have fun playing this game huh?I played skyrim for hours console and pc i only wanted to play online and here it is!Really recommend the game one of the best and most active for its style.(pricing is great)Highly recommended!
Positive,somebody once told me the world was gonna scroll me
Positive,180 hours the last two weeks...
Positive,Fun with friends and stuff. Not much fun playing single player (Content seems repetitive).
Positive,I've been playing this game on console for almost a decade and still haven't grown tired of it!! I just started over on PC
Positive,"Something for everyone! PVE, PVP, Questing, Cosplay, Lore. Great for solo or groups - social or not."
Positive,it's just awesome to play.
Positive,"I hated ESO. It feels like a Ubisoft game with a the elder scrolls paint job, but then i gradually started to enjoy building up my character and farming for sets. Im a solo player and i dont really like to play with friends so i fought the question of if a game like this would even work for me. I ultimately found that if i just sorta play this game a few times a week i do have fun its just if i binge it i get grossed out. its entirely due to the horrendous combat that just makes me miss skyrims shitty combat. i will recommend this game, but just because its a vibe."
Positive,"Leveling system sucks. You almost get no stats for leveling, while leveling up being super hard. If I am not going to feel overwhelmingly powerful and start one-shotting my enemies, what is the point?Edit: played a little, if you had the same opinion with me about this game, as can be seen above, you should read the following for information about all the systems this game has:1-)  Scaling: Enemies are not scaled to you, you are scaled to them. the game was actually buffing your character untill you reach level 50, and you lose some stats every level (literally the opposite of all other games). The only way for you to get your stats back is by getting better gear, and also, the attributes that you acquire as a reward for every level. Almost for all characters, you'll want to put your attributes into one stat only.2-) The Grind: you can get stronger (and yes, a lot more than how you started at the beginning of the game) by getting better gear (look up for your specific gear on the net), and of course, by leveling up. You can level up to 3600, which can be put into powerful/helpful passives. Also, there is animation canceling in this game, if you really want to get better at it, it only takes half an hour or so to learn it, probably takes days to near perfect it.3-) DLC: In my opinion, you do not need any dlc, nor do you need ESO+. I have started during eso trial, and I know how it is like to have eso plus. It really helps to have the craft bag and is worth it if you have the money. I would even suggest to buy for a month, since you will get to get everything in the dlc zones such as some skill lines and item sets, but don't buy it the moment you started the game, wait untill you have a good beginner set (look up on google for your race and class) and join some guilds first, so that you can easily explore and join trials in all dlc areas with your guild mates.4) DLC Exclusives: Items, skills, and anything you need in the dlcs can be acquired with free trials during the year, however I doubt that you will need them anyways, since base game provides really good items and skills already. Also, you can craft dlc items at any time if your guild hall has the crafting table for it.5-) Storage: With an inventory that can go up to store 200 items, with a bank that can store up to 240 items and with a guild bank with 500 item storage for yourself, and with a chest you get for free as leveling reward, you can have 970 storage space, and this is more than enough. The only downside being that some of the materials, like style, trait, furnishing and fishing baits need to stay in guild bank, which is not accessible from crafting tables. Not a huge problem though, since you don't need them all the time anyways. The best part is you can automate micro-management with the help of addons.6-) Attribute and Skills: Attribute reset is just 3k gold, which is almost nothing if you played for a bit. Skill reset is also cheap as I heard, but I don't know the price; however, since you can get all skills in the game, it isn't really important that much. Also you get a free refund of attributes and skills as a level reward at some point.7-) Addons: The game would be near-unplayable if played without addons. Use them, I believe you will have fun looking for them as well.8-) Community: The community is awesome. I have seen many people help others and provide guide for new players.9-) Power-leveling: You can power-level in Alik'r Desert by killing dolmens. Even though everyone says that a new player shouldn't bother with this, I really enjoyed to get to 160 from doing these, it also made me group with a bunch of people and it felt like I was now a part of this community in a way. The materials you collect and the items you get untill cp 160 almost worth nothing, so leveling to cp 160 as soon as possible is just logical. You can do everything else after you reach this goal anyways, and you can make money now, since the items you get and materials you get are of highest level.10-) End Game: As far as I heard the end game is generally housing, I am not that rich and I am not very into housing, so for me, the end game is probably going to be just leveling and getting rich by trades for a while. However, the more time I put into this game I start to feel like, one could either play enough to become an architect, or become rich enough that you pay to become an architect, I guess :D"
Positive,"This is my favorite MMORPG. I have played just about everything, and I keep coming back to ESO.  This is everything that I expected in an MMORPG, plus some. If you like any of the elder scrolls series, you will definitely enjoy the Elder Scrolls Online. VERY active playerbase, that is 24/7. Healthy pvp, as well. Soooo many people online at once. Many guilds that have over 400 accounts, with over half of them, that are still active. Come give ESO a try, you will not be disappointed!"
Positive,"fun game, chill community"
Positive,Easily my favorite MMORPG to play. Even if you play by yourself there is a lot to do. Community is also one of the nicest ones out there.
Positive,good game lots to do playing solo or playing with a group
Positive,after almost 1000 hours my brain has finally become one with the grind. 40 days of my life i will never recover. im still short by 40 skill points for my build. help
Positive,Still a newbie exploring the base game. Need more hours.
Positive,khajiit are hot
Positive,Highly Recommended for players who seek into  Adventure and Fantasy themed experience
Positive,died in a dungeon like 20 times before realizing that the quest required me to be in a group. 10/10
Positive,I like the game. It does get expensive though when you buy into all the extras. Customer service is terrible. I've had to put in a trouble ticket twice and both times was like pulling teeth. The results ended in them saying everything looked fine on their end or they can't help. I'd also wait to buy the newer chapters. They become free the year after they start. There's plenty to do until then. Save your money.
Positive,horrible customer support
Positive,It's a themepark MMO a lot like Warcraft.   Lots of rides to ride and they really want you to pay 15 dollars a month.
Positive,"You can be werewolf, i can finally live out my fantasy of being a blood thirsty furry. ARF ARF"
Positive,you don't need to hold down right mouse button when playing.
Positive,fun to play with GF
Positive,"An amazing game with amazing story line dialogue and beautiful scenery ! 10000/10000 Give it a shot, Join a guild if you are lost or u can just solo it out . You can basically explore anywhere you want and level scales in whatever zone you are in ."
Positive,"Though I would pick up this game since I really enjoyed Skyrim. Boy was I wrong! It resembles Skyrim but does not really play like it. I did pick this game up a bit late so many people have quit playing it or have insanely built accounts. Many of the guilds seem to have high standards, Would recommend if you are looking to play by your self or with a friend."
Positive,"For a MMO this isn't too bad. If you have the need for a MMO and like the Elder Scrolls universe. You should try this out to see what you personally think. Its going to be one of the better MMO's out there on the Market.I bought this game back when it originally released and level a character to max level. Starting zones and almost the majority of the game has changed since then. From when I tested the game again in 2020 they changed for the better. A lot easier for new players to get into the game. Good job there ZeniMax.Main story and Questing is well put together. PVP is awesome but after a bit you figure out its just Zerg PVP.Now for the bad. This game has a lot and I mean a lot of DLC. It also has a in game cash shop. I honestly would tell you what I tell SWTOR players. Get the monthly subscription as its going to make your life easier and the game more enjoyable.   Jump in there play as much as you want. Preferably with a group of friend. Then when you burn out end the subscriptions. Treat it like you would WoW or SWTOR.Yes its not fun having to buy a game, DLC, and Subscriptions. You also have to get a group of friend or randoms together constantly to experience the full game. This however is the state of the MMO Market. Which is why I no longer play MMO's anymore.7/10 - Solid MMO for the current day market. Has Good and Bad things about it. But in the end its a solid game."
Positive,To be quiet honest? most people who play westing games will not like this game it is a little bit of a merry-go-round you end up back in the same place quite a few times. leveling up however is not super difficult. Taking it for what it is it's very good game. It has plenty of quests sometimes confusingly too many however it is a pay to win game in my opinion. Unless you buy ESO Plus and the latest greatest DLC it is an arduous grind. would I recommend this game to just anyone no. This game is meant for serious people who play World of Warcraft or such games that are used to a grind if you like Skyrim world of Warcraft or something to that nature then you will love this game. If you don't you will find some of the fighting very strange you will also find a lot of the questing to be very arduous repetitive and otherwise boring. I would recommend this game for people who are serious gamers but not for somebody just getting into it. ESO can make a lot of changes that would be really beneficial to the people that are playing the game having quests that last you hours is not a good idea for first-timers. However there are benefits newcomers some of the Dungeons and delves are mostly level difficulty in other words your level determines the amount of difficulty that the delve is or the lowest person in your party. This is a smart idea that the game company had when building this game for the simple fact newcomers do not want to die every time they go up against a boss. So it's kind of a learning curve and it benefits the newcomers. If you purchase this game enjoy some of the dungeons are solo there are quite a few that are open community. So if you do purchase this game do not expect it to be super hard. Happy gaming to all who read this I hope it helps you make your decision.  I'm a 63-year-old gamer so if I can do it you can too enjoy your day.
Positive,Keeps my thirst for lore and Elders Scrolls content satisfied... for now...
Positive,run while you can

Positive,The best MMORPG For story an PVE experience.Con: The worst combat system on the market.

Positive,"Great game, feels like playing any other Elder Scrolls game, just with other people also being there. Great RPG, fun content everywhere you go."
Positive,"I have played off and on since its inception, and cannot find anything else I enjoy more.  The graphics and the movement are wonderful."
Positive,Beese Churger :(
Positive,"Not a huge fan of MMORPGs and I like this one a lot. Lots of excellent lore and story telling, as well as exploration of The Elder Scrolls universe. Pretty neat. Could get your TES fix here."

Positive,Best MMORPG. Amazing!!!
Positive,E S O - IT'S IN THE O
Positive,"I'm not 100% sure yet but love skyrim so I'm pretty fond of this kinda, once I get the hang of it maybe more. Add me so we can play I'm on PC, US @GoddessOfTheWind"
Positive,couldn't recommend this more if you like MMOs its such a great game and you never run out  of doing stuff been playing this game for years already
Positive,"Highly recommended and ONE OF THE BEST ONLINE GAMES FOR ME!!!! Though I wish the game doesn't limit the players behind DLC that much and as well add more lands :)NEGATIVE SIDE: The Tales of Tribute is the worst part of the game. It will favor the luck and randomness to your opponent. So yeah, that card game is never recommended. Yes, I do win if the player made a mistake and PURE LUCK, but skill wise, it favors the opponent."
Positive,"i love the Elder Scrolls series, and Am not an MMO fan.  This game fulfills my desire for ES as well as lets me solo PvE."
Positive,The Elder Scrolls Online is defiantly worth the purchase membership is not required but defiantly recommended this is my new favourite game
Positive,Great game i get lost in the world for an mmorpg its very solid there are things that could be better like evey game but its definatly one i can never get away from!!!
Positive,kind of a completely new gamer and fell in love with this game. I think it would be more fun to have a partner or a group of friends to play with?
Positive,Deep rpg with a lot of stuff to do. Overall chill and fun experience
Positive,"If you like MMO's and Elder Scrolls lore then this is for you. Can play mostly single player if you like. Lot's of content. Looks great, plays great."
Positive,greatest game ever
Positive,One of the most relaxing and fun games to play. It's a great game to sink yourself in and there is a lot of content. I absolutely love the lore and the way the classes play. Highly recommend to anyone that wants to get into MMOs or have a relaxing adventure with good narrative.
Positive,"Ive played this game before on console and let me tell you the PC version is superior mainly for the UI.  This game can accommodate to many different players whether you like questing for story on your own or with friends, pvp, grinding for the best gear, or a sense of community.  Its very easy to learn the ropes of the game especially for an MMO.  I highly recommend to give it a try especially with friends and even if you don't its still very enjoyable for solo play."
Positive,"This game in and of itself is amazing. Graphics, stories, customization, choices... but don't be fooled by the price tag. Sure, the base game isn't that expensive, but to be able to actually craft, build your house, or do much of anything besides the main storyline, you'll be paying through the nose. Even if you buy the DLC, you'll still need to pay a fee for extended storage and other perks. Also, you don't need to play much to level up quick, and then after a while you get diminishing returns for each level increase.So as much as I love this game, it can also get frustrating quick if you play without membership if you're like me and like crafting, building, extra storylines, exploration, classes, etc. I'd recommend playing the base game through, maybe in each faction, and then if you want spring for the extras."
Positive,Amazing Game - Content for Days - 9.9/10
Positive,"I like skyrim, this game is like skyrim but it's not skyrim."
Positive,Best MMO until today. Always get back playing this one again after trying other MMOs.
Positive,I wish I played this sooner!
Positive,Great storytelling and lore for people who are into fantasy
Positive,"Game is way different now, and better since the first days of it's release. Game is fun, and more so with friends, yes the ESO plus for only the crafting bag is cringe, and still not sold apart from it. Yes some shady TOS about taking your data and selling them to other companies is also awful but like majority of the websites, etc you visit or use does this anyways weather they're upfront about or pretend they don't so I personal don't care."
Positive,"EDIT: I still play this game, so this is my own perspective on it. If you are into an amazing story-line (unlike other MMOs), ESO has a legendary story out there, and I give it a thumbs up because I do like it; it just grows on me. [But not the combat, skills and animation, of course area that needs slight improvement.]Negative Aspects of the GameOne of the major drawbacks of Elder Scrolls Online is the poor skill animation and combat balance. Skill animations play a crucial role in making combat feel impact and satisfying, but in this game, they often fall short. The animations lack fluidity and polish, making combat feel clunky and disconnected from the player's actions. Attacks often lack weight and impact, resulting in a less immersive experience overall.Positive Aspects of the GameDespite the issues with combat, one redeeming quality of Elder Scrolls Online is its great story. The game features a rich and immersive narrative, with quests and story lines that delve into the lore of the Elder Scrolls universe. The well-crafted writing and voice acting bring the world of Tamriel to life, drawing players into its intricate web of political intrigue, epic battles, and personal journeys. The attention to detail in the storytelling creates a sense of immersion and attachment to the game world, making it a captivating experience for those who appreciate a strong narrative.Suggestions for ImprovementTo enhance the gameplay experience, several improvements could be made to Elder Scrolls Online. One area that could benefit from attention is the quest order. The game's quest structure can sometimes feel disjointed, with players jumping between different regions and storylines without a clear sense of progression. By refining the quest order and providing more guidance to players, the game could offer a more cohesive and satisfying narrative experience.Another area that requires improvement is the class skills. Balancing the effectiveness and visual impact of different class abilities would contribute to a more engaging combat experience. For instance, revisiting the warden class and enhancing its skills to be more visually impressive and impact would better reflect the power and potential of warden abilities. This would allow players to fully embrace the fantasy of their chosen class and feel rewarded for their investment in that play style.ConclusionIn conclusion, Elder Scrolls Online on Steam has both positive and negative aspects. While the game's poor skill animation and combat balance are significant drawbacks that hinder the overall enjoyment, the great story and immersive narrative help to offset these issues to some extent. Fans of the Elder Scrolls universe and those who prioritise engaging storytelling may find enough redeeming qualities in the game to overlook its combat flaws.However, for players seeking a highly polished and satisfying combat experience, Elder Scrolls Online may fall short of expectations. It is my hope"
Positive,"if you love mmorpg like WOW and love oblivion and skyrim, then this is the game you been needing in your life. Hardly any toxic players and lots of things to do to occupy your free time and have fun. Long time gamer here and this is the only game I really care to play."
Positive,"I love this game, lot's of shiny things and silly quests, the housing system is so satisfying and fun to play around, imagine you can create a marvelous vampire castle and live as a Lord/Lady to fulfill your dreams, as a bonus you can be an actual vampire, super immersive. Bless be Azura, Queen of the Night Sky for such thing."
Positive,"Amazing, so much to do."
Positive,skyrim but it's mmo
Positive,"cool game, im eating pizza playing it"
Positive,Love it! You'll never run out of things to do!
Positive,This game is dog shit
Positive,"All I can say at this time is the game is great. There's too many quest, more than a vibrating rattle snake's tail could shake a stick at. First impression when I got in the world is a quote from Shrek 1, ""Quest? I'm already on a quest!""."

Positive,"Amazing MMO for someone who likes a mix of both solo and group content, with a sprinkle of pvp on top. No matter what mood you are in at the moment, if you feel like having some quiet time and playing solo, or want to have adventures with your friends this game got you covered. Loaded with fun activities, great climate and lore. There is always something fun to do. Perfect fit for me."
Positive,fun game lots to do
Positive,"Great game, great graphics, friendly community. The quests and lore are also interesting."
Positive,I smack the shit out of everything. Big Hamma.
Positive,I love ESO
Positive,"So yesterday I just received a notification that now crafting is  free and that it is included in the price of the game. I really liked that information, so I would definitely recommend ESO to you.Now I will definitely come back to the game because it is great. By the way, you can also read my previous review below when crafting was included in +Membership. Previous review:*(Greetings to all who read this review. The other day I bought elder scrolls online of course the game is great, quests are interesting and fun to play also. Of course I played a couple more mmo rpg titles like runscape, albiom online, lotro. When I entered the game nice tutorial introduction to the world of elder scrolls but I did not like the subscription for plus because if you do not have it you can not make things in the game and some additional things that are necessary. I paid for the game, so I thought I'd get at least those basic and useful things as part of that price and not that I'd have to pay for that nonsense extra. Because elder scrolls is really great I don't have any complaints except about the subscription for elder scrolls plus which honestly annoys me a lot. My subscription is fine if the base game is free so you have a subscription for add-ons. There I have for example runscape where the base game is free of course there is only a game introduction and for a better experience you have to pay a subscription which is ok. But to pay for the game and still have to pay for some basic things doesn't make sense to me. In that case, I have as an example a slightly older game of Lotro which is free. So if you haven't heard of that game, in short in that game you can get everything for free with a lot of griding but that's again much better than having to pay more than a base game for some necessary things in the game without which you can not progress. So if you want to try an mmo rpg title and you don't want to spend your money on nonsense in such games I recommend lotro it's a completely free game in which only griing is important if you want to achieve progress.)* Thank you for the time you spent reading this review."
Positive,"Very Good, engaging game"
Positive,its just like Skyrim!!!!!! :D
Positive,"Lovely game, but you really need some friends for it. Oh, and lots of patience tom anage the inventory space if you dont get eso+."
Positive,"4/11/2023 brand new to the game, EU servers, and I only speak English. Plenty of people to meet and fun content to play. Little learning curve but I used Youtube and Google which really helped."
Positive,i fought a large dragon like demon from the depths of oblivion big W
Positive,chicken you too beautiful
Positive,this game is very fun and easy to learn with the right amount of time. it has alot of lore to dive into and story content player base is warm and engaging as well.
Positive,"simple, yet mechanical - a good mixture of story and grind that brings out the inner dragonborn in you (Kart pls play)"
Positive,A great casual online RPG. Not the new Elder Scrolls but a good enough stand in for now.
Positive,"Add Cross-progression and I'll buy it, again. I've put way too much money and time into this game too restart a character just because of a platform change. You guys easily have the ability to offer cross-progression, yet choose not for capital gain reasons. I understand the reasoning behind cross-play not being a feature (Skill or mechanics wise) but having to completely restart is way too expensive too make sense. I wish ZeniMax and Bethesda (Two amazingly capable companies) would work on the topic of cross progression for those who have put in YEARS of time in already. Just seems like a money scheme :("
Positive,PLEASE MAKE A SHEOGORATH CHEESE WHEEL MOUNT or a fliying mount would be cool too. you could make it a reward from a Quest like stealing cheese from mammoths at giant camps
Positive,"[Elder Scrolls Online]Cutscenes: 9/10Graphics: 9,5/10Gameplay: 10/10Dynamic Gameplay: 9/10Pay to win: No, altho there are few things that could be betterFree to play: Hard without ESO+ bag extension, hard to access most of DLC content without ESO+. Free to play just some areas and dungeons/trials.Locked content: Yes, need to buy expansions(DLC) to access certain parts of the game(which is ridiculous). Expansions/DLC doesn't usually add much content either (like one isle maximum, some quests, some dungeons, sometimes a raid, but not often)Main good traits:+ Audio and dialogues for all npc in game(Main good point of the game)+ Really good graphics and effects+ Really good PvE content+ Interesting story+ Nice MMO mode, players can interact with each other basically at all times+ Nice, requiring teamplay in trials and HM dungeonsBad sides:- Leveling system(why is it even there? It's so terrible)- Obtaining skill points on every character(Not multi-character friendly at all)- Balance system between classes- PvP is disbalanced to the maximum- Factionless gameplay, no real feeling of conflict- Very simple raid content that allows bursting through phases- Low amount of DoT gameplay- Healing is quite binary, not balanced healing/tanking(still interesting, but so much disbalanced; Often you either live or die, healers are almost not needed, tanks can do all the job)- Lack of proper dummy, one at homes doesn't reset properly and doesn't show proper stats, obtaining dummy is quite ridiculous as well. - Console based control system, only +/- 12 buttons - Desync/Server issues on daily basis- No aggro system(Tanking is completely timed for time of taunt, which is ridiculous)- ""Autoattack weaving"" system that is severely affected by desync issue, which makes the game unfair and very much connection based. With including desync problems it's very hard to repeat same results even in endgame gear. This needs complete rework for endgame. - Overall score: 8,0/10Personally I've dropped the game after 1677h due to above issues. Still I would recommend the game for checking out, it is it is not this bad. But could be done way better. The beginning of the game is very comfortable and fun. Game gets frustrating when you see that leveling system is a joke(Due to level sync even with same items you get weaker as you level up till you are max level with certain amount of CP unlocked), but after you hit max level it is getting interesting again(and finally you don't get weaker over leveling, just stronger). PvP is worth just to check out, but it's nothing great. PvE is quite another story, it's pretty nicely done. Players overall are not so bad, most of community is okay. If you decide to give it a try, good luck and have fun. If you don't, good luck and have fun searching another title."
Positive,The character choices are great. There are so many custom choices as far as skills and appearance it is almost an unlimited amount of variations. This is good for the fact people will create such different types of characters.
Positive,Fun times b''d
Positive,"I have over 700 hours in this game and I can not tell you a single thing about what is in it or what the main story is. As far as I'm concerned, the moment I hit play I black out"
Positive,"My... my free time, wheres it gone. I can't stop theres things to do."
Positive,Good story line. One of the best MMORPG I've ever played.
Positive,"i have played a lot in the past, but never played more than 1 week, but now with the changes they made, everything is so well organized and well made, really loving the game."
Positive,10/10 the urns restock so I can keep stealing peoples grandmothers over and over again.
Positive,"I have Alot of good things to say about this game, and I have accumulated alot of hours played even before it came to Steam. Unfortunately I can not get into all the details right now as I am busy updating and re-configuring the million Addons I simply can not play without. If you are on the fence about the game. Give it a try."
Positive,"Mass amounts of DLC all throughout the year/s. Although the game's competitive aspect, either PVE or PVP constantly changes. I find that the devs always find a way to compromise to ensure everyone's play style is accommodated. Even casual game play is extremely assuring and fulfilling from queuing up with 3 other strangers for a random dungeon to decorating your home!"
Positive,"The questlines are interesting and well-written, and the scope of the game is enormous and wide open since the Tamriel Unlimited update. Character options are robust but manageable, with class customization you won't find in other MMORPGs. Just don't buy anything in the shop unless you're using your freebies from a subscription, because the prices are utterly ridiculous."
Positive,"Good Game, also worth the money. Only buy if you want to play with friends. If you dont care about that so much buy normal skyrim"
Positive,this iswhat gaming is about
Positive,The Grind. Do Pvp is a Grind ONTOP of the grind to be set foor Pve dungeons to get final set gear. Game is fun and worth a look if never played but the grind is real
Positive,good and fun
Positive,Love the game I have hundreds of hours on console. The Dungeons are fun and the PVP is fun also. My only gripe is not being able to transfer my characters and stuff i bought with real money to the PC with Cross-save.
Positive,"Honestly,I just love this game and that's my hearts opinion."
Positive,Very Good Game
Positive,I played this game at release and put in a couple thousand hours. I quit a few years back because of performance and constant so called balance changes. I recently picked it back up to start fresh and fell in love with the game all over again. For all the problems and issues the game has it still checks all the boxes and its still fun. I don't think it will ever be what it could have been but its still damn good and worth a try.
Positive,"TL:DR Customer service is not good. Game is mostly solo-able. Overall good gameIf you don't have a working ESO account make one before purchasing this game. I had a hard time getting my account activated but got there in the end though (Took more then 2days). Their customer services is not good but will get there in the end. I've had 2 problems (activating my account and receiving my ESO Plus crowns) both times they just sent me the generic troubleshooting you can find from a basic search of the problem even though I'd said in my ticket I already did those things eventually they read what I was saying and fixed my problem.Overall the game is good. The thing I like about this game compared to other MMOs is you don't completely loose that feeling of being the ""hero"" except during events quests (Only encounter one but I imagine its the same during others)I've been playing solo and it feels a lot like playing skyrim. Only things so far I've felt like I needed another player for was the world bosses and anchors. It's not a problem with anchors as every time one spawns (every 10mins) it's very noticeable and players come running but with the world bosses you sort of have to just get lucky to jump in with other players that are already fighting it. I tried fighting one solo but they are REALLY strong. Definitely meant for multiple players.I've definitely enjoyed my time with ESO and will continue to in the foreseeable future. Lastly if you plan to do crafting in this game definitely get ESO Plus. Having to carry all your crafting ingredients in your normal inventory would require a lot of careful inventory management."
Positive,Its my other world
Positive,"worth getting for the lore alone, overall fun game"
Positive,"Great open world and tons of content, awesome way to keep the Elder Scrolls world alive and well."
Positive,its okay i guess...
Positive,Why get addicted to meth when you can play this instead?
Positive,favorite mmorpg hands down
Positive,"This game is fun, but it isn't a one size fits all type of mmo. It has many different activities in an attempt to keep players engaged in some capacity. ESO even attempts to break the mold of previous mmos by allowing players a whole armory of choices in how they want to play their characters, but again this game isn't for everyone. I have enjoyed this game for approximately 565 hours at the time of this review, almost seventy-one 8 hour work days. I love the game. It is fun for me."
Positive,"I started the game somewhere around 2016, I did the main quest from my starting location and proceeded doing them from the next and next location. I wasn't interested to the stories so I skipped all the dialogues and tried to speed run the quests as fast as possible. I was jealous of how other high level players could just kill all the mobs within seconds, I started watching guides of how to deal a lot of damage. After spending 30 minutes of watching that video I finally realized that the set this video was advertising was from a DLC content that I didn't own, so that ended there. I didn't know that dungeons were 4-person content and rage quit the game after spending 2 hours trying to complete the Banished Cells II alone at level 18.I went to beg gold by whispering to random people, one heartwarming person gave me 100k gold and I was so happy. I went to a nearby guild trader and spent 82k to buy the most expensive weapon it had, thinking more expensive = more powerful. It turned out to be trash since I didn't have any of the other set parts + it was a ice staff :)For a long time I was playing the game without any clue, running around... trying things out... and realizing I'm bad at them. Finally after killing crabs near a random river for over 3 days (at that time I thought it was a insane xp farm strategy) I managed to reach level 50 and entered champion levels, I was so excited that I immediately went to pvp a random level 43 player near me.. and got beaten up :/ It was around that time I finally realized I just didn't have the gift of being a damage dealer, and decided to try another role - The tank. Then everything changed and I was immediately hooked by the game, people finally started to show respect. Before in dungeon groups where I was being kicked for having bad damage, now I was never kicked even if performing poorly. Before when people just ignored my questions about mechanics, now everyone started explaining. From that moment a spark ignited inside me, enlightening the path forwards. For the next few years I was entering multiple dungeons almost everyday. Starting from normal ones, completing all base-game dungeons, trying out veteran, and finally finishing my first non basegame hard-mode. At that moment I really felt I had accomplished something great!Over the next few years I had began to master the other aspects of the game, making 10 characters, completing over 1000 quests, fully leveling every in game skill line, collecting every skyshard/lorebook, becoming master crafter/angler, building a amazing house... I also started actively entering the 12-person trials, that I had ignored before on purpose... at the beginning I was afraid to tank them because even my tiniest mistakes might cause everyone else to die, and I was scared of that :/ I started attending training runs in my guilds, joining random groups, my experience piled up, until I was asked to join progressive groups, then came the hard-modes (some of which were finished after trying for months), finally entering trifectas. Now looking back I can't even remember how much time and effort had been behind every successful  achievement, how much pain and suffering was with each failed attempt and mistake, and how much laugh and joy was shown on those that succeeded. It was a long journey, from the start when everything was new and curious to how others now ask me about what the correct thing to do. There is so much fun and joy in this game that words cant express.For you who might be the next to begin your vast journeys, I wish you fortune and accomplishment :)"
Positive,"From the little bit I have played, I have found this game to be quite a delight."
Positive,one the best mmo's i have ever played
Positive,"Been on and off this game since I first started last year during the launch of High Isle.Easily one of the most fun MMO's I've played. Easy to get into, even when playing casual."
Positive,Great game for Boomers
Positive,THIS ONE THINKS GAME IS VERY IMMERSIVE AND FUN.
Positive,"This is a fun MMORPG where you can do a lot of stuff on your own, but also meet up with friends. It has all the best elements of an RPG including crafting, specialization, exploring, and plenty of quests!  There's also a lot you can do without a subscription (meaning for a one-time price).  You can learn at your own pace (so you can succeed at stuff without completely mastering the controls) but it continues to be challenging as you get better. I am very happy with this game!"
Positive,"Wonderfully crafted MMO. You WILL get hooked once you get into the rhythm of this game's grind.One of the greatest gaming communities I've ever experienced, with most experienced players enjoying helping new players. Ability to purchase DLC from players using in-game gold just adds to this masterpiece"
Positive,It is one of the best mmo's out there as far as community goes.  The loot boxes can be an issue but most of the stuff you get in the boxes i am pretty sure you can get in game.  It is well worth the price you pay for the subscription if you are into that.  But the base game is pretty decent too.
Positive,"No other reason that this is the MMO I find myself returning to, time after time. I find it to be very relaxing and enjoy the fact that a majority of the PVE content can be done solo, and a lot of people seem chill and willing to help. I recommend following a guide to help level (such as alcast or justlootit) since the leveling system can be quite confusing to newcomers. I also sometimes forget to log out of the launcher so my playtime is extremely overinflated because of this."
Positive,"Fun, i like killing random citiznes"
Positive,"Easy to get around, fun to play and non-stop amazing quests"
Positive,"I played this game when it was first released and didn't enjoy it. Too klunky, too buggy, and didn't really compare to the Skyrim gaming experience. Since then I've given it second and third tries over the years, with limited success. This was my fourth attempt at this game, and I am so glad I was persistent. Yes, it still has bugs, but the updates and expansions to the sprawling and immersive world of Tamriel more than make up for the imperfections. The scenery is beautiful, the storylines are well-crafted, the characters are funny and entertaining, the combat mechanics are dope, the in-game games are fun, the monsters are bad-ass and the grind is unparalleled. The base game is more than enough to keep you interested for hundreds or even thousands of hours, but after logging over 1,000 hours, I did decide to invest in the ESO membership. I don't regret it. It just made an already awesome game even better. In addition, the devs seem to be constantly improving the game, which I'm sure is a massive undertaking, so kudos to them."
Positive,Great game!! creation of word is amazing
Positive,Haven't played it much but seems like a good game.
Positive,"Well I have over 830 hours played on the Steam release of ESO, and an additional few hundred on PlayStation back in the day. Maybe it's time to do a review.. It is important to remember that this is not ""Skyrim but online"" this is an entirely different genre of game, being an MMO. It certainly is a great game to play for TES lore folks, which is why I got into in the first place. When I first started playing ESO, I honestly didn't like it, it was my first MMO and I just didn't understand a lot of it, and did not enjoy the combat (coming from mainline TES titles). So I dropped it without a fair chance. Some time later I picked it back up again, and have loved it ever since. You have to give this game a fair chance.Its worth noting that if you want the best value, its always best to get the collectors version of the latest chapter (that includes all previous chapters, once individually all full priced).I want to mention some of the pros and cons of this gamePROS- The world is vast and absolutely stunning! Everything from Hammerfell's deserts to the Valenwood jungles, From Morrowind's volcanic ashlands to the frozen mountains of Skyrim. You just can't get bored of exploring.- This game is very inclusive in terms of pretty much being able to use any class or playstyle, andd shaping it to be your own, and not being totally ruined by meta builds.- This game also allows endless hours of fun with friends, exploring, questing, fighting bosses, running dungeons. That's where this game really shines, when you got your best mates in a group.- This game lets your creativity run wild, you can basically be whoever or whatever you want to be, yo can spend hours just designing your armour kits and outfits, there is hundreds if not thousands of morphs and items to mix and match!- The player base is definitely one of the better and more helpful scenes in the MMO genre. It's fairly rare to run into a genuinely toxic player, most players just wanna help you out and group up!- This may not matter to most, but this game is fun and easy to run on mouse and keyboard, or controller!- Fairly well optimised, and can run on almost anything, with some tweakingCONS- This game is extremely unfair in terms of exploiting your wallet.. You can easily drop hundreds on this game.- The fact that you need to pay for a premium subscription just to make crafting not be utterly terrible, is just such a frustrating business model. It is almost pointless to do any crafting if you do not have the craft bag from the premium subscription. - It is easy to fall out of the loop of the game, you get caught up in work or life, and then its kind of a drag to get back into the swing of things. Not to mention this game pushes you to log on daily to collect rewards or they are at risk of being gone forever, so on.- Without any guidance this game can seem overly repetitive and boring, though that can be fixed by making some friends, or watching some videos or streams.Overall, I highly recommend that anyone who enjoys the world of Elder Scrolls, at least gives this game a fair try, you may love it for what it is!"
Positive,good play price is a little much for what it is
Positive,It is good. It gives life a purpose!
Positive,Don't be afraid to reach out to others within the game to ask for build advice and quest help. Found a lot of new friends across the country and internationally that have played the game far longer than myself and have been very supportive and helpful as I explore the game.
Positive,"Playable but somewhat boring MMORPG.I enjoyed this game on the first day I played it. On the second day I already found it somewhat boring. Still I had hope this would turn out to be just a phase and it would get more interesting again if I kept playing. So I forced myself to give it some more weeks. Unfortunately that 'more interesting' never materialized. Instead it got even more boring.I find it hard to pinpoint why the game doesn't grip me. Its not a bad game. Everything works. That's why I'm giving it a thumbs up, not a thumbs down. And the basic game concept isn't much different from other MMOs I have played and actually like, (Black Desert, City of Heroes and Champions Online). Still somehow that same recipe for making a game works (for me) in those cases but not in this one even though the differences are but minor. It is like ESO is a cooked meal that has the correct basic ingredients but not quite in the right proportions and is missing spices.I can name a few things. All are minor and any one of them alone wouldn't turn me off. I guess its the combination of all of them that breaks the camel's back for me:- the biggest issue I found is that ESO is basically a single-player game that just happens to take place in a multiplayer world. I mean yeah you CAN team up. You even need to in certain cases. But even then its not the teamplay that you have in City of Heroes. ESO is just not a teamplay-centric game. Mostly you are alone even though other player toons run around nearby.- I find the quests bland. They are standard 'blabla find this, kill that, talk to x' - fare without any humor, wit, spicy dialogue, psychology or drama. Now it is true that other games also have their share of bland quests here and there but in between those they all have really cool, funny witty etc quests that are just hilarious or dramatic or simply very well thought out etc. For example the quests in Cyberpunk 2077 are so great I can't really call them quests since they are actually really dramatic art, Shakespearean even. Now admittedly not every game can be that good questwise but even old games like City of Heroes have spicy, funny, dramatic, gripping quests. ESO simply doesn't. Running into the umteenth cave to clean it and collect things just gets unfun quickly.- the combat system is subobtimalwhoever has played Black Desert knows how a fast-paced action combat system should work. ESO's simply doesn't. They aren't even in the same league. Now if one likes it a bit slower (BD really IS very fast and combat takes a lot of actual player skill and training there and maybe not everyone likes that) okay, I hear you. But I also like City of Heroes which is slow compared to BD and basically just pushing buttons in the ever same order pretty much like in ESO. Still its fun there in CoH but not in ESO. So what does CoH do that ESO doesn't? For one thing CoH has a lot - and I mean really a LOT - more quickslots to put powers on in order to access them quickly. Ontop of that it has a built-in macro system that lets you custom-configure your keyboard bindings so you can access all your powers in combat quickly. It's all at the tip of your fingers. You have to train your muscle memory to know where they are of course but after that you can play really well (you also have to learn how to use that macro system which is a challenge and fun in itself). Similarily in BDO you use nearly the whole keyboard for your various powers (that's why it needs so much muscle memory training but also is so rewarding). In ESO though you only have two rows of 8 quickslots. (And the 2nd row you can only access by pressing an extra key which already is impractical). To use the powers, items, emotes etc pp that don't fit into the 16 slots you have to use the radial menus. It is simply very cumbersome compared to the other games. That makes combat in ESO (though still some fun) just not as fun it could (and should) be.- the graphics and effects are datedthe graphics is not bad and actually better than in old games like CoH. It still is noticably dated though compared to Black Desert or Cyberpunk 2077 for instance. Now this in itself wouldn't be enough to turn me off (I still play CoH after all). But the graphics in ESO certainly don't really increase the gaming fun either. The same goes for the spell effects etc. They are okay but somehow lacking that bit that would make them cool.- the crafing system is a letdownI really loved the crafting system in ESO at first. In fact it was the one thing about the game that intrigued me. However I quickly found out that I find a lot better items on quests and by farming volcano events than by crafting. (And that is even though I levelled my crafting skills as much as I could!) That let the air out of that balloon. Now I don't doubt (or at least hope) that in certain special cases you might  be able to craft this or that good item here or there later on in the game. But its not something you do on a regular or even semi-regular basis. Back to square 1 and do your boring quests instead. All in all ESO works - but not as well as other similar games."
Positive,It's fun to play with girlfriend :D
Positive,"Short version: 7/10.Expanded:My review is 'recommended', but with caveats. I've been playing ESO for years, hundreds of hours, on and off since release. While it has many reasons I keep dropping it, it also has those which keep me coming back. Ultimately it boils down to a quantity versus quality problem, and it very much favours quantity over quality.Positives:- The game is buy to play - technically there are no further financial requirements to play beyond the initial price.- A *huge* world to explore, comprising the majority of the map of Tamriel, including those from previous games, and some which are yet to appear.- An absolute abundance of fully voiced quests, that will make most completionists hopelessly dizzy.- A somewhat action based combat system, rather than tab targeting, with mouse-click attacks/blocks.- A greatly versatile combat system; you can build your character from a huge and yet ever expanding pool of skills which are learned and improved via a great number of themed skill trees. For example, your chosen class will grant you three trees of various skills you can unlock/level up which are unique to your class. Further, every weapon type has its own skill tree of weapon based skills. Then you come across numerous guild and 'world' skill trees, which unlock even more new unique skills. You can then build your action bar playstyle from any combination of this huge pool of skills, so theoretically your own build will be unique to you.Negatives:- Whilst the world is huge, it usually feels quite generic, rather empty, and visually unimaginative. It's incredibly rare that I will find a moment to simply stop and enjoy a vista, or stumble across a truly interesting dungeon/point of interest. - The music is bland, and very quickly annoying, which is totally out of sync with TES games. Most of the game has the same uninspired vague fantasy soundtrack for every zone. This negatively affects the atmosphere of exploration.- The quests are also generic, and often fairly mindless. This is not really an RPG, and there is rarely a meaningful choice to be made. I've lost count of all the necromantic cults I've fought, and I certainly can't remember their names or agendas. Just talk to an NPC, follow through the story of hugely varied quality, and then do the same cookie cutter steps from every other quest until completion.- The combat is floaty; this is not a Souls game. There's no sense of kinetic back and forth, just a spamming of attack, attack, attack, mixed in with your hotbar skills. I rarely need to block or roll. It's in no way visceral.- While there is a huge abundance of skills to build your hotbar from, the effective endgame builds are far more limited, to the point it will eradicate the initial sense of personal freedom. For me, this is not an issue, as I have absolutely no interest at playing this game at a high level, the effort/reward ratio absolutely pales in comparison to other MMOs out there.- The fight mechanics just aren't that interesting or challenging. There is a lot of potential for cool mobs/bosses, with interesting and challenging mechanics needed to navigate them, but they are rarely, if ever, exploited. - Effectively all mounts apart from the basic, somewhat outdated mesh horses, are locked in the cash shop - most are locked in loot crates. Further, the mounts are limited to a handful of preset models (horse, bear, camel, guar etc), and any further variation is a simple reskin. For me, this is a huge deal. Cool, varied mounts, are my ultimate reward in MMOs, and one of my main incentives for doing/grinding certain content. - The game has been releasing new paid 'Chapters' (expansions) annually. These chapters do near nothing to reinvigorate the game with new mechanics or visuals. It's just more content of the same found in the base game. This is in comparison with many other MMOs, where there can be a stark contrast in the quality of the content of the initial game content versus the later content.- The game's cash shop is predatory. It's always there, offering the cool stuff that's not in the base game. It's expensive. It has loot boxes. My personal feelings towards the game are warm, but not hot. It's entertaining. It's vast. It's a timesink for when you want one. But it's watery. It's mostly uninspired. At its core business model, the developers seem to be lazy, and mostly interested in making as much money for as little as possible effort. The reason for my 'recommended' review, is because it's reasonably priced, there's a lot of it, the core gameplay is tolerable, and there's a lot of Tamriel based story to be found within. Whether that's for you, depends on if the positives outweigh the negatives. For me, they do, until they don't - hence my back and forth over the years."
Positive,"Really amazing and addicting game, I got recommended by a friend and was so sure I wouldn't like it. Now I can't stop playing. It's my new favorite game and my new obsession. Definetley recommended to try the game, preferably with a friend so the concept of everything, if new to you isn't too difficult! I love the story, even though I am currently running around doing side quests, but it is absoloutley wonderful, the graphics are amazing and nothing is too difficult in the game as long as you..again have someone to play with or you're high enough level to fight enemies/bosses.Edit: Started playing it again recently and I never got to try the Anarcist class when it officially released, but trying it out now i have to say i'm really loving it. It's certainly a very strong class!"
Positive,Literally the best MMO on the market today.
Positive,cliff striders everywhere
Positive,Very cool gameplay where u type /soup and u eat soup hahahaha so funny
Positive,"Have been playing Elder Scrolls Online for many years. Although it took me two attempts to get into the game, I now find myself looking forward to the new dlc releases. I love the story line and being able to roam purely as a solo gamer."
Positive,Best MMO RPG game ever. Much better than chinese mmo games
Positive,when i try to log in it times out how can i play if i can't log in need help linking up
Positive,If you like skyrim and mmorpg games this game connects best aspects of both.wait i thimnk ib chraving as troookeeee
Positive,There is so much to do in this game. I suggest playing it like a traditional RPG and leave the MMO aspects alone until after you finish the main story.
Positive,If u have no life and can grind everyday buy (:
Positive,mega servers should be wayyy bigger
Positive,"its just a cool game you can play for hours either alone or with a group. Im still learning how to play, got a bunch of crap and can't drop it or sell it so don't know quite what to do next but Im sure looking forward to learning how."
Positive,"The game brings you in a splendidly developed world where you will easily forget your own-real-life. The story and the lore is not at all trivial and, if you have time, enjoy too the reading of the elder scrolls."
Positive,"insert a thumbs up here, easily overwhelming with how much there is to do, but you'll never run out of things to do"
Positive,"Nice game, improved allot since launch. not a game for everybody. i play this game solo and been enjoying the content so far."
Positive,My vampire nightblade is thicc.
Positive,awesome game :)
Positive,The grind is so reeeeeeeeallll.. but is also worth it if you enjoy hoarding like I do ^^
Positive,"pretty good, wish it didnt have the in game purchases tho, but at least its not a subscription, if you dont want it to be, def worth the money"
Positive,i actually have like 5 hours maybe but i leave the launcher open :)
Positive,great game with friends
Positive,lots of fun
Positive,"i overdosed on skooma, and my khajiit is a gay man who married an elf.Ten outa ten."
Positive,"My experiences in ESO are varied, intriguing, challenging, and entertaining.  Players are free to create a variety of characters with varied growth paths.  All the traditional arch-types are available.  One may focus on many different areas.  Exploring, quest lines (great stories), combat vs the environment, combat vs other players in select PvP zones, archaeology, burgling, and assassination.  ESO is the most fun I have had in decades.  Blessed day."
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online is an expansive MMORPG set in the world of Tamriel. It is the latest installment in the long-running Elder Scrolls series, and it has been a huge hit with fans of the series. The game is set during the Second Era, a time of great strife and conflict between the provinces of Tamriel. Players take on the role of a hero and embark on an epic journey to restore balance to the world.The game offers a large variety of content, including PvE and PvP content. Players can adventure through dungeons, fight in open-world PvP battles, join guilds, and more. The game also features a dynamic world with events and content that changes with the seasons.The game has received praise for its beautiful graphics and its immersive world. The game features a huge array of unique monsters, creatures, and environments for players to explore. The game also features a variety of classes, weapons, and armor for players to customize their characters with.The game also features a unique crafting system, allowing players to create their own custom items. Players can craft armor, weapons, and even furniture for their homes. The crafting system is also used to create rare and powerful items, giving players an edge in combat."
Positive,"great MMO to grind every class can do it all play them the way you want! so many things you can do to to get geared up, Dungeon finder has bugs at times if your grouped up leave que after 3 mins and reque each time is how me and my brother got into dungeons other than that great game!"
Positive,"Originally I was against the idea of ESO merely due to the MMO nature of it. I intentionally stayed away from it when it first came out. I also was one of those old skool people who play RPG's for the lore, story, and the overall hardcore role-play. (Back when D&D 2nd edition was still cool and Everquest had rolled out and if you were not role playing you got shunned by other players.) MMO's today tend to be about players running around as quickly as possible to finish quests instead of actually taking the time to read, take in the world history and lore, and enjoy the scenery.But after considerable time debating, I decided to go ahead and try it out. And while yes, players do in fact do exactly as I describe above, the game does not seem to require players to work together. You can in fact play solo and get a lot done. You can take the time to read everything, go to the library and check out the world history, and spend the time you want enjoying scenery without having to deal with other players nagging you for taking too long because they don't want to waste time reading things that you prefer to read. So given that this really isn't an MMO, but more of a solo-game with other players around you, it's much more enjoyable then I originally expected. The fact that I have 16 hours in and haven't quit yet means that it's a good game in my opinion.Combat is more dice-roll then action (you can actually look away from a creature and shoot an arrow and the arrow will turn toward the creature regardless of where you were pointing. It's also very flashy.The world itself is just as alive as any other TES game, and it have all the world history and lore you would expect.The store that helps pay for the servers and keep things going isn't too bad. Nothing in there is pay-to-win, most of it is either cosmetic or just extra things that will have no impact on your ability to fight.Also, no subscriptions are required, just optional."
Positive,"Wow. I was avoiding this game for so many years without any good reason, maybe thinking that it's not that great and there are better titles, but now when I started playing it... I think it is the best mmorpg out there. Everything what should be in a great mmorpg is in this game. I just regret that I started playing it now and not years ago."
Positive,Easily one of the best MMO games ever without pushing in-game purchases plus a great lore from the franchise.
Positive,This Shit Is Bussin
Positive,nothing like a cross map road trip with the party to form a sitcom level of family fighting
Positive,"If you want to play another MMORPG with one billion questions of ""talk to.. talk to.. solve puzzle, solve the puzzle"" it is fun. But PLAY ALONE. If you have a friend and play in parties be ready to be completely blow away by bugs and having to redo all the quests again and again because they BUG ALL THE FUCKING TIME.I had to redo completely 4 quests so far (long ones). Because items stop working if your party members use them and you get stuck. BUGGY PIECE OF CRAP OF A GAME not even close to the quality of the other elder scrolls games.The quest ""ruthless competition"" is a long one with many steps. We were at step 7 when it bugged. I couldn't use an item and had to re-start it from the beginning.If I knew this I would never started to play this buggy mess. The game is from 2014 and many of the bugs are there for years now. Unacceptable, I am very upset.Edit: After more than a year away from the game I decided to give it another try. Much better experience this time. Faced some minor bug in one quest which we had to do redo (bug reported), but overall way better. Played ~70h since then (in a party the whole time) and having a great time. The game is fun, the dungeon and pvp are very entertaining and the quests ran smoother. Thanks for the developers from the improvements, so changing my review to positive!"
Positive,worth the money
Positive,"The game feels like an old mobile cash grab, yet also plays like an actual Elder Scrolls game. I get extremely weird mixed vibes while playing it, and probably wouldn't recommend buying it for the full 20 dollar price tag(100% not the 60 dollar high isle edition), but as someone who bought it 70% off, it is more than worth the six dollar cost. In my opinion, its the worst edition to the Elder Scrolls series as much of the game's content is locked behind a paywall, it is still an Elder Scrolls game, and as such is worth playing."
Positive,"Game is fun and the quest lines are top notch. The store is a little aggressive and there's not enough of the mounts that can be earned in game, instead you have to buy the vast majority on the store."
Positive,I like it
Positive,"incredible, complex, something to really get your head into. great play with endless content"
Positive,GREAT! am i too late to play?
Positive,boring without friends.
Positive,"Played for 200h and didn't had to grind once. Awesme combat, and wonderfull people :3"
Positive,"If you are looking for an enjoyable single player story based experience, this has it. The stories are quite fun, there are a lot of them, and they are all fully voice acted, which is huge. Just don't expect to be able to earn any of the cool things you see people using. You can't. You can buy them from the cash shop, though."
Positive,"Considering the whole package, this is by far the best MMO I've ever seen. You don't get overwhelmed in the beginning, you can just start slow doing single player content forever. Then when you do seek a new challenge, there's just layers upon layers of gameplay. And the great thing is you don't have to care about all of it right from the beginning. You'll simply begin to dig deeper and deeper as you'll eventually have your party wiped on veteran bosses or get your noob butt spanked in a battleground.When you do ask questions/directions people are generally super helpful. After a dungeon run, players have just given me items I was looking for. The dungeon gameplay is very cooperative by nature, and extremely varied if you use matchmaking, because every fool is different. But oh boy, when people do rock that shit and do watch for their teammates, it can become a beautiful ballet of blasting.One important noob advice: When you're new to a dungeon (especially a veteran one), tell your teammates you may not know all of the mechanics, so they let you know if you do something wrong.So far I have not paid a dime in monthly subscription or paid for anything other than content (zones + dungeons and some mech). Not P2W by any stretch of the imagination. The only mech that's affected by a subscription is your ability to craft A LOT, because without a sub, you have to carry all crafting materials (of which there are many) in your inventory and in your bank. Because I don't like subscriptions, I've simply used a lot of ingame money to upgrade my inventory & bank to comfortably store what I need.General verdict: A game that should be used to teach game design."
Positive,"So is ESO worth playing in 2022? So personally The game is actually still very fun! The game was released in 2014 and still has high number of players!! The game is highly optimised Which is needed since I have a low end Laptop. The world is Huge with content that will last you probably some months. I buy the base game which come with huge content and multiple side quests which are super fun to play.  The storie is a master piece which I have played so far. Hands down the best MMORPG I've ever played. The fact that nearly every character you come across has voice acting just makes it feel a lot more immersive. You can access all weapon and armour skills regardless of class which makes it very easy to tweak playstyles to suit you. And of course the quality of writing is very high, both in base game and DLCs. I highly recommend this to anyone interested.PROS-Huge Open World-Varied Gameplay-Deep Lore-Great Storyline-Tons of Skills & AbilitiesCONS-Can Be Grindy-Slow Early Game ExperienceFor Solo content: PvE. Quest mobs are easy to kill, quest bosses are also fairly east. For solo content / questing, I recommend the Two handed skill tree for the temporary shield as it scales based on how many mobs hit in a swing (perfect time to recast buff/heals while soaking dmg.) World bosses are solo-able with a decent build and some resource management. If you want more challenge, try doing Dungeons and Trials.  For my low end PC/Laptop friends: The game works absolutely smooth on a low end laptop intel hd graphic. Ping is not a problem since it wont really interfere with your PVE.In the end, ESO is still worth playing in 2022. Whether you're looking for your next competitive fix or a relaxing way to unwind after a busy day, ESO offers a wealth of content for players of all types."
Positive,It just works
Positive,holy grind (love the game btw)
Positive,"My wallet is empty, Thanks Todd."
Positive,I truly don't understand how I have played for 383.3 hours.
Positive,ive only played this game for 4 hours
Positive,Gameplay is superb
Positive,best mmo around
Positive,"Awesome game, if there is an experience you can really sink into it is this one."
Positive,"I played this back at release and really didn't get on with it, made a revisit recently and i'm enjoying it considerable more though as with a lot of mmos its a thing where social is a must for me to enjoy. It is feeling a lot more like the old elder scrolls games now but defiantly best enjoyed with friends."
Positive,"Buckle up, this will be a long one.Here are my thoughts. Feel free to take notes, dear Blizzard...-The character development system and the combat mechanic itself is not my favourite, but if I was able to get used to it, then anyone can. I like the idea of spending skillpoints on everything you 'use and practice' and eventually wish to improve - from armor usage through professions to class skills etc. Still possible to hoard unspent skillpoints tho, because, some class abilities are not always that great (for me at least). I'm the type who very cautiously spends skillpoints on active skills. And this is especially true here, where  you have got only 5 ability slots (10, if you want to swap weapons). Soooo, for me, 5 + an Ultimate is somehow below what I find 'optimal', considering, how many skills (weapon, class and world) you may have to use in a single combat. HOWEVER, I don't find the skillbar on a skillbar's skillbar convenient either.Anyhoo, this 5+ is just happens to be enough to defeat your foes and move on, no big deal. This doesn't make the whole gameplay experience less interesting in my eyes. :D- CHAMPION POINTS. My paradise! The party doesn't stop just because you've hit 50. And it doesn't mean, you have to grind yourself to death on pointless reputations, daily dungeons/quests. (BLIZZ?)You EARN Champion Points after lvl 50, just by doing your stuff, questing, delving, engaging in combat, whatever, and you can spend CPs on 3 different ""talent trees"" full of PASSIVE ABILITIES, which makes your character more powerful, or even unique, depending on how you distribute them. I get it, it may be not everyone's cup of tea, but as an avid RPG-er, I can't stop rambling about how lovely and unique this system is. (oh, and the passives actually have vaules.)- I saw many comments saying that how this cash-grab-in-gamestore-lootbox system is trash (which is true, in general, i don't like them either) HOWEVER, in ESO, I don't find it as atrocious, as it is in some other mmo-s. Nobody holds a gun to your head to sub for the membership. You will find plenty of content to play through without it. Only thing you have to worry about in the Crown store is the Chapters and the DLCs. So you wanna play a zone, you buy them. Similarly to any other game. I admit, the Chapters+DLC part can be very confusing tho. Some of us need to do some research to avoid spending our money on the same stuff multiple times ...Many Crown Store/crate stuff, and other epic goodies are also available via an in game currency, for which you have to, umm, you know, PLAY, and therefore EARN them - so, theres that. You have at least the freedom to choose how to approach these kind of things.- The exploration is masterful imo, never gets old - meaning I still don't find it tiring to dismount and tinker with a simple locked chest, or check the crates in a delve. Everything has value in this game.- EVEN GOLD, can you believe it? Blizz? It is possible to spend gold on stuff in ESO, other than transmogs, or paying for a group of players to quickrun me through dungeons or raids I'm too lazy to queue for? Hello?Here, instead, I can improve my riding skills, in 3 different ways from in game gold. (naturally, there is also the demand for the Crowns and raidruns and whatnot, but the zone chats are not revolving around it all day.)OR, I can track down bag merchants to extend my inventory (and it gets more and more expensive, sooo, it keeps the gold valuable - funnily enough without making the player character completely broke! Cause you earn decent amount of gold via QUESTS! In other words I found it's a well balanced system. WHAT  SORCERY...?!)- The content doesn't get obsolete, just because there is a new expansion on the way. You are FREE to choose where to go and what to do, and nothing will push you to the 'LATEST THING'. + The quests won't hold your hand all the way to puzzle things out either.The riddle is in the book? Then open the book. Most of the time, you actually have to solve a problem. And it adds to the immersion. - IN GAME CURRENCY - there are a couple of them, yes, but the amount is reasonable, and the best part is (Blizz, listen closely) it doesn't eats up your inventory space. Not even when you can get access to an unlimited crafting bag through ESO membership - aka real money. Can you believe that?-And the BESTESSST part, the quests, and the attention to the Elder Scrolls lore and all the details, that makes this MMO so appealing to me. Questing and the lore are its greatests strenght, that it makes every conflict, conversation, situation BELIEVABLE and IMMERSIVE.In conclusion - ESO tries to be the best experience for every type of gamer. From hardcores to casuals. I think everyone, even those who doesn't really like the Massively-multiplayer part, can find the treasure here, which this game has to offer. FINALLY, the system is not rigged for the plesiure of  ahem... ""Mithic+"" elitists with superior complexity just because they have the biggest voice via their  purses.And, to address some rather NEGATIVE qualities:-Sometimes the ground clutters can be pretty annoying, especially in an ever moving action-based combat system, and particularly in Boss fights. I'd love to see it improving with time because my boy, those Ayleid ruins... :D- Where the idea of a MEGASERVER backfires is, the sudden and totally random DCs.Since some solo instances and dungeons have the tendency to reset upon ""inactivity"", it is totally NOT fun to start them all over again. No matter how interesting the content is :D"
Positive,One of the best mmorpg on the market
Positive,I have 0 DLCs and spent 600 hours at the time of writing with no plans of stopping. Worth all the money I spent
Positive,Let's see 2000 hours means I've played for over 83 straight days. I guess it's fun.
Positive,"I love the Elder Scrolls universe so much so it was pretty much a given that I would also love this vast MMORPG as well, and I certainly do~"
Positive,"Where should I Start ? First of all, I  followed this game for a while , then the summer came with a little sale and also with the realizationI got bored with skyrim after the 600000x playthrough.So I decided to give it a try and I didn't reglet my choice  . The stories are great , the community is amusing and Friendly the game itself can easily be played individually and the crownstore mostly contains cosmetics . There is literally so much to do in this game ! It's like playing Skyrim or Oblivion at the first time . Unfortunately tho, all this is surrounded by a great darkness  This game has two main issues in my opinion. There are too many dlcs I mean literally you purchased one which contains a new map with a great story and here comes the catch this map has another purchasable dungeond dlc so I'm talking about that kind of  stuff ... The second problem , it seems that the developers are not listening to the community which usually leads to disasterius updates  and then they trying to fix that with patches so they just giving more work to themselfs .I don't know the main reason of it maybe they aren't the one who's making the decisions or maybe They just don't give a fu ck either way it's a shame so that was the cons. However,  I still recommend this game cause of the fascinating story and cuz of the community"
Positive,Game is ok.
Positive,i play for the funny card game
Positive,Cat Boy JerryCann 9/10+ Probably my favorite MMO+ Lots of fun content+ Great stories+ Lots of skills and builds- They ruined scaling so that it feels like you never get more powerful
Positive,Always a pleasure to play The Elder Bugs Online.
Positive,"The ""Labor of Love"" Award. [2022]"
Positive,"I want to love this game. The story is fairly robust. The landscapes are beautiful. The characters are varied. The market is fairly thriving. The only thing is that bugs never seem to get fixed, especially for older areas. New zones keep coming out, which requires more money, but old zones are never updated. A new class is being released, which is a welcome surprise, as it's been a while since anything new and exciting really released. We'll see how it fits into the world once it goes live.Overall, the base game is okay. The music reminds me of some of the great standalone games from this franchise, but that just isn't enough for me to spend countless hours playing and paying to keep this game up-to-date.So yeah, I want to love the game...but I just kind of like it."
Positive,"After spending 300 hours in ESO, I can confidently recommend it. While it might feel like an MMO cosplaying as an Elder Scrolls game, it's a fantastic MMO in its own right. If you're an Elder Scrolls purist who nitpicks every detail, this game might not be for you. However, if you're a more casual fan who enjoys exploring a massive, immersive world with a great community, awesome combat, and an engaging story, and who wants to journey across all of Tamriel, then you'll love this game.Don't be discouraged by the ""Mixed"" review sentiment. Negative reviews often spike after updates or events when some players don’t get what they want. Many of those complaining about bugs are using 100+ add-ons, often causing their own issues and then getting frustrated with having to update everything after each patch.As for the players with 1,000+ hours who don't recommend it? Well, they're still playing."
Positive,i enjoy playing this game :D
Positive,I absolutely love this game... but I am a weirdo so don't look too closely into my opinion.It's a good game and I love it. That's all
Positive,The only downside to this game is that the craft bag is unlocked behind a subscription.But said subscription is worth it.
Positive,"I put 300 hours into this game because the first week I played, I was invited into a guild. Before I knew it, almost every night in the week I would be on discord with these folks and we'd play together for hours. Then the guild leader went through a divorce, people took sides, it was messy. I got all the drama and memories of a real friend group, all from the comfort of my own office. Tyler isn't friends with me anymore but I'll always cherish those late night battlegrounds or dungeons. 10/10 replacement for irl social abilities"
Positive,"Alright, look, i get it, a game that's pretty simple, with basic controls and easy to use playstyle, I like it, ill admit that, i'll give it a positive review,m especially since it's taken such a chunk out of my life, but the skills could use some expansion, and the small amount of classes is ridiculous. However, the fact i can play a vampire who can magically drain your body of blood from a distance and at the same time precisely stab a dagger through the back of someones head and out their eye? Pretty cool. no lie."
Positive,sound track pretty good
Positive,Purchase all the DLCs but haven't touched it yet. I am not sure if I will ever play. My hobby is to buy games.
Positive,"Very beautiful graphics and decent gameplay, idrk what else to write but uh- play it"
Positive,"Great game with alot of replayability. Playing it with friends to show me the ropes, as there is a good bit to get used to. But after you get the hang of it, its super fun and you can play hours on end."
Positive,Love the game however its needs account transfer.
Positive,Fun to play with friends. Highly recommend getting a group to play
Positive,i havent done any pvp and spend 1k hour  just  doing quests and exploring.
Positive,"So much quests and a really good roleplaying elements. I never get bored exploring, crafting and doing quests or dungeons. Some ares are more interesting than others, they really did a good job making Elsweyr regions and whole lore is massive, you have tons of books to read up on as you explore. Definitely a step up from the single player TES games."
Positive,This is a great story based mmo where levels are pretty much secondary. It's nice to hit max level and earn champion points which go across all your characters.This is a great game to play to turn your brain off and go explore various stories in the Elder Scrolls universe.
Positive,"As a WoW refugee, this game has given me everything that I've been wanting from WoW for the past 10 years: horizontal progression, voice acted quest text, non-convoluted storylines, player housing, and yearly new content drops. My only complaint is the aggressively priced crown store, however everything in it is purely cosmetic and anything that would increase player power, is obtainable in the game as well. Overall ESO feels like a retirement home for disgruntled MMO players. You can play as casually or as hardcore as you want, and still make meaningful progress on your character in whatever way you choose. Definitely a recommendation for solo and group players alike."
Positive,"Great game, but the subscription is very pay to win."
Positive,Is pretty gud
Positive,200 hours in still great need more razum-dar It's a  mix between Skyrim huge in scale but more akin to oblivion which suits me just fine disliked skyrim ALSO moar sheogorath
Positive,1/10 Couldn't become dragonborn
Positive,I just treat this like a single player game and search for lore and explore if i was forced to grind and do all the mmorpg crap Id probably eat 5 - 25 cans of compressed air and jump into a fire pit
Positive,"I only bought the standard edition to play with friends. Barely scratching the surface of what the base game has to offer after 240hours.I don't usually do the mmorpg thing and if I do, it's not a title that requires a subscription BUT dear lord on toast ESO is well done. So much so that when I eventually have an income I'm going to get ESO plus without thinking about it.If you are looking for a new mmorpg title to play or you are an old lover of previous ES titles then I suggest you at least try this world of awesomeness."
Positive,"fun mmo, works perfectly on steamdeck with a couple tweaks/setting changes1. during install if you get a long black screen press steam+left (enter)2. once game has loaded press steam and close the launcher (gets rid of stutter)3. when ingame (not intro) go into settings>gameplay change control to gamepad also pick no for use keyboard on character select4. enjoy eso"
Positive,You kill stuff
Positive,This is Elder Scrolls
Positive,good game lots of conentto the point
Positive,"As a fan of the ES universe, this did not disappoint. Love the graphics and immersion."
Positive,"I've waited 2000hrs to play this game to make a comment, All I have to say after so long is... Yeah its good."
Positive,Please describe what you liked or disliked about this product.
Positive,"Purchased ESO during the Beta in 11/20/2013 from the Bethesda website/launcher, it's still my 3rd favorite modern MMO.  Over the years they have made tons of  QoL improvements to ESO. Give it a try, spend a lil time learning about what it has to offer from a single player & or group content perspective, I'm sure you will not be disappointed overall. My personal favorite is the companion system (major thumbs up)."
Positive,"It is incredible best mmo, I have ever played. Best PVP Random Battlegrounds that I have had the pleasure of experiencing. Multi players with linked banks gives a person a more pleasant experience when trying a new class or making a new Toon to welcome a new friend and play along side them. This game worth the money if MMO's are your sort of thing."
Positive,"Excellent game.  I give it 5 STARS!   A massive world to explore.   Many adventures!  Many Challeges!   Many Stories!  And a huge amount of content for free!   Character upgrades for Weapons, armor, experience, and more as you play.   Some perks and character careers like the thieves guild take real money to get the option.   Once you picked the perks and options you want for your character, you can play for for several months without spending any more money."
Positive,Awesome story and game play.
Positive,I've played this game for 8 entire hours and I would recommend it to everyone since I'm obviously a complete expert on the game after spending a full day playing!!!
Positive,kinda mid666 more hours still kinda mid
Positive,Lots of interesting quests.
Positive,"fun, but a fucking pain when a update drops"
Positive,Doesn't get much better than ESO! The game is great at allowing you to play at your own pace.
Positive,cant play game
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online has EVERYTHING! ♦Multiple good, engaging storylines (Every quest has a well written mini story appart frome the main storylines of each zone/expansion)♦Good characters♦Good voice acting ♦Immersive world and cities♦Good economy, crafting and life skills systems ♦Mounts♦Transmogs ♦A housing system that lets you build WHATEVER U WANT (yes iv'e seen incredible houses and castles built from scratch)♦Good combat♦Good graphics ♦Good clases (vampires, werewolves, necromancers are the coolest) ETC!"
Positive,"I like the most the horizontal progression, i can take any break from the game, and when come back the toon doesn't feel like absolute garbage.Very strong crafting system too, and generally very likable people to group."
Positive,"cool game, if youre not an elderscrolls fan this game wont have the same fun feel to it, but as a long time elderscrolls fan ESO feels great to play. its a fun spin on the universe with all the regular MMO aspects. basically unlimited content by this point and so many builds to use."
Positive,"I have played Elder Scrolls Online off and on for over 2200 hours.  I really enjoy all of the PvE content.  The quests and dungeons are great.  There are public dungeons which you can just wander into and sometimes group up or at least cooperate with whoever else is in there.  There are also plenty of instance dungeons with a good grouping system (although if you are DPS get ready to wait...).  The overland content is full of unique quests- some funny, others rich in lore.  I play alone a lot and this game allows for that easily, while also maintaining and good experience for groups.  Most of the game is not super-hard, but if you like really tough challenges the veteran dungeons and the trials will give you what you're looking for.  Plenty of PvP content as well- not my forte' so I don't know as much about it.  However, if you think about playing 2200+ hours and still have content unexplored (I don't even own all the DLC either, btw) you can see how sustainable the entertainment is.  I know there have been changes over time that folks haven't liked, but honestly, it's never really affected my enjoyment of the game- I just don't pay much attention to all the noise."
Positive,I am a late-comer to ESO.  Many on the game have been playing for years. I enjoy the absolutely massive world it is and it runs very well.  There are a few quests and areas where I've found some bugs - but overall it runs smoothly.  There are a wide variety of activities and skills to develop and there are always special events and the like offered.  Guilds have been a first for me -- and I've enjoyed all of that too.  I'm not a veteran gamer as some are here on Steam -- and mainly I've played stand-alone 1st person games that are not MMO with a ton of people online.  That has been an adjustment - but ESO isn't filled with a lot of belligerent young players that I can tell at this time.
Positive,"This is my first MMO, about 100 hours in and I have not even scratched the surface. Total noob review right here btw  ♥You can have pretty much as many characters you want. Stuck between two or three races? No prob - you can create another character and enjoy the game in a new perspective. Graphics surprised me, I expected them to be bad considering the server size and age of the game but nope, combined with a decent graphics card this game will suck you in to its vivid colours and scenery. If you're an open world junkie like me, you can explore this map until the cows come home and always run into something interesting that'll derail what you intended to do. To sum this up, if you're unsure weather this classic is still worth playing in 2022 or beyond - it absolutely is. Shout-out the community for being helpful and friendly also!"
Positive,this game is one of the best mmo prg game i have played in years
Positive,"You have a great world to explore, with controls that you learn to use on-the-go."
Positive,"Pros- You can use every armor and weapon in every class so you can play the game however you want and explore or make hybrids which is fun.- You don't need to pay a subscription to play like WoW. Which is a lot of money if you play the game for years.- Very good community, many players help you if you ask them.- You don't need a very expensive computer to play the game.- New expansion every year.- Fun alone and with friends.- Famous voice actors.- Lots of content.Cons- Inventory management problems can be easily solved by making an ESO+ bag, or it can be solved by gilding a bag and a bank slot, but it's expensive later, or you can get 60 cheaply in the stable, but you have to wait 20 hours to upgrade a slot, so it takes time. Alternatively, you can get a salesman/banker NPC for 5000 crown, or you can get 3 pets that give you 15 slots each, giving you 5 slots for all characters, but that will cost you 1200 crown each.- You have to buy all the DLC if you don't have ESO+ and don't want to miss out on the content, and not everyone can afford it. In WoW, you get everything for free except the latest.- The game has some add-ons, but the community isn't that big, so there aren't that many. In most cases, the developers abandon them, so they become unusable or unstable since the game is updated.- The community is not that big but still better than the other smaller MMO titles it's still playable.Anyway, the game is fun and I really like it, but I feel like the inventory management is a hidden marketing thing. If this changes, it could make the experience much better, especially for newcomers. I know they need to make money to keep the game alive, but I think there are other ways to do that that are already in the game like cosmetic items and ESO+ which gives you the crown and DLCs (The DLC's only when the subscription is active so if it's expires you don't have it after.) I hope i could help you before you choose to get the game or not."
Positive,"amazing mmo, would recommend, more of a quest mmo so don't be upset if u were expecting alot of the game."
Positive,Really enjoying this! Once you get used to the mechanics of the game it is great. Recommended to anyone looking for a MMO based in fantasy!
Positive,I played it a little.
Positive,Haven't played too many MMOs but this one has by far impressed me the most.
Positive,i love the Elder Scrolls. its the best.
Positive,"good game. lots of grinding, very beautiful, good voice acting, deep lore (ofc expected of elder scrolls games), extensive, met lots of new friends, very fun and kind players. i'd like for a bit more flexibility for the classes though like in skyrim. other than that, 9.5/10 game."
Positive,"Been playing the game for more than 8 years across platforms and have loved every single moment of it, lots of issues from Zos don't get me wrong but worth it!"
Positive,i've played eso for like 20h and i think this is the first mmorpg that i enjoyed the system is good the grapics and the lore but you need to learn about the crafting system. i mean its good but maybe for some newbie like me its quite hard to understand it but i think its good because its realistic
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online is ideal for those that love the Elder Scrolls series and have played them recently, ESO allows you to join 3 alliances each with 3 races per faction unless you have the imperial edition which allows you to choose the imperial race and join ANY faction.Its free to play and isn't subscription based unless you want the Elder Scrolls Online ""plus"" which gives you Crowns and other bonuses if you want that extra room in your inventory and so on, its also an ideal game to play with friends too, as you can delve into dungeons and do bosses together aswell as quests, theirs also PVP elements aswell and the ability to join or create guilds too!, its a game worth playing!"
Positive,"My most favourite place to be, ever."
Positive,Great game.  Plenty of features for anyone that wants to lose themselves for a few hours a day.
Positive,I love being able to escape into tamriel. cant wait till theres a full VR version online.
Positive,Very good game and amazing community
Positive,"I love this game, and it is very big, filled with lots of challenges.... It has all types of monsters and maps and one can spend hours in it even if they won't do any quest."
Positive,"ima pourin me hours into da game cuh, like dis game is bussin"
Positive,"I played this many years ago under a different account and though I took a long break, I can't help but dive right back into this game. It's got a bit over everything, in my opinion. You have skill building, crafting, great quest lines, fantastic maps and awesome NPC's. I tend to forget to do some things because I'm focused on others. But I always get to go back. Sharing it with friends or making new ones always makes the game better."
Positive,"Love the game! Played it on Xbox console before & just the base game alone has hours of stories & side missions. I got hooked its easy lore to get into such as vamps & werewolves, several guilds to join from. Its a big map filled with awesome landscapes, i play on console & Steam i must say it is worth the time.  Only thing you cannot Transfer Characters over from other Platforms thats the only sad thing but something to know & what to expect. See ya Online! ^.^     Worth The Money!!!"
Positive,"Well now that I have almost 5k hours on it, I think its safe to say that ive played a little bit of ESO in my time here and ive enjoyed every minute of it."
Positive,really an awesome game.  an mmo that plays more like an elder scrolls game is a neat combination
Positive,"Great game, my favourite MMO. Though certain mechanics are starting to feel dated, and so are certain areas of the map. Could do with some updates in those areas and mechanics."
Positive,still better than many new MMOs
Positive,sucky loading times the first few times you try to log in but decent game
Positive,I suck dick while playing this
Positive,Enjoy the lore while you explore; or gore while you tour.
Positive,"If you like world of warcraft, This is kinda similar with the raids and grinds you got to do."
Positive,Yeah It's Alright I Guess
Positive,"As someone who has really never played The Elder Scrolls games but loves MMOs, I was surprised how much enjoyment I got out of The Elder Scrolls® Online (ESO) mainly playing through the High Isles expansion and stopping. Similar to some other MMOs right now, ESO has the perfect blend of making this a truly single-player experience (if you want it to be) while giving you the option to do many MMO things like dungeons, raids, and PvP if that is what you care for. Although I personally partake in the MMO side of ESO, I think they deserve credit for being able to cater to multiple audiences.So now that we know ESO has a lot of flexibility in how you play, I think the second biggest thing they do well is the free-to-play structure. You can definitely subscribe for bonuses, items, and currencies to make things easier but the game can easily be completed without spending a penny. If you want to spend though, you have a full in-game store beyond the subscription model to keep obtaining advantages, cosmetics, and items to expedite the story.My only negative for the game, and it isn't really a negative for me personally, is that you must like Elder Scrolls to like ESO (which seems obvious) but there is so many nuanced things from the single-player games that ESO will reference, I imagine either you already know and love Elder Scrolls to play ESO or ESO will make you want to play the other games. Either way, it might be worth looking into reviews of ESO or other Elder Scrolls games to get a feel for what you are walking into with this MMO.All in all, ESO is not my favorite MMO and doesn't do a lot of things as well as Final Fantasy XIV or World of Warcraft but similar to Lost Ark, New World, and Star Wars: The Old Republic I think ESO has a perfect niche in the market that will keep it around for a long time."
Positive,Playing this game is an amazing experience for any elder scrolls fan . 100% recomend
Positive,It's a good way to spend 12 hours that feels like 2
Positive,This game has more content than my actual life.
Positive,"Runs very nicely on the Steam Deck once you get past the launcher issues. If you get the ""cannot load application list"" error when installing try using a mobile hotspot to start the update download. After it's started you can switch back to wifi. The launcher takes a while to get to the point where you can play, but after that you're golden!"
Positive,"Great MMO, easy to understand, lots of content (you can solo most of the quests, even dungeons!) and a well written and fun to read lore, it's a Elder scrolls game after all.Very addictive and great for someone that loves the MMO genre or trying to get into it.Would reccomend!"
Positive,If you like elder scrolls this is the mmo for you
Positive,"Basically Skyrim on steroids. I'm really enjoying the game, tons of hours of fun. I got the ESO Plus and it's good value, give it a try."
Positive,love this game pvp is fun exciting adventures
Positive,Great for learning another language & works on linux nicely!
Positive,A very effective alternative to WoW for me.
Positive,What is it? Dragons?
Positive,"Elder Scrolls Online is a wonderfully mastered game, very immersive gaming experience. I love exploring the worlds and the dialogue is both entertaining and quirky. If I was going to suggest any improvements to the game would be where you could explore under the waters. Argonians and the black marshes really make me think they would have awesome explorable areas both under the waters and above. A system of holding your breath while underwater for any non Argonians would be interesting feature. Over all I would recommend Elder Scrolls Online."
Positive,"Definitely one of the best MMO's out there. Plenty of solo content, lots of options for different gameplay experiences and they seem to listen to their user base in terms of game plan mechanics. Been playing on and off since 2014. Has the elements of an Elder Scrolls game but plays like an MMORPG."
Positive,This game is very in depth and captivating. Started the game for something new because I have gotten bored of other mmos and this game brings fun and entertaining game play especially in the endgame
Positive,ESO BORING ONLINE
Positive,"elder scrolls is overall a long lasting , entertaining gamee with a lot of different things to do to stay occupied and remain unique , it has some really boring areas but for the most part its incrredible."
Positive,Plays similar to many RPG online games and I love the Elder Scrolls series.
Positive,"I have spent under 300 hours on this game, I got this with friends when it was on sale so we could play together. The game is great, is updated frequently and still looks fantastic!You can play this with friends and do quests together or play solo with a NPC companion 10/10 would recommend"
Positive,"Eso is a great game most people have sunk hundreds of hours into it so you easily get your moneys worth back through time invested when you sub.  Play at your own pace, do what you want to do and have fun.  It's basically a solo casual chill game with the option to group up or do dungeons and raids with other players.  It's really content rich,  the game is massive you will always find something to do."
Positive,almost 800 hours on record. its fun for an mmo and massive too. youll never see and go everywhere. the leveling system leaves more to be desired. this is not like skyrim
Positive,"you can make new friends with this game, and you always have something to do :)"
Positive,big spider gave me shoes
Positive,I've started too many quests
Positive,By far one of the best MMOs I have ever played.
Positive,Its Skyrim but online with some slight diffrences. all n all. a good RPG experiance
Positive,"An okay MMORPG.I would recommend prospective players to try this game out with a cheap version of the game and then consider the subscription, which is fairly cheap and gives you access to ALL Expansions and Dungeon DLC.The install size is gigantic, over 100GB which if you cannot afford is not recommended.I recommend this game for lovers of the Elder Scrolls and players who enjoy both hardcore & more relaxed styles of play."
Positive,"Overall it was a good game lots of content to explore it is a little pay to win but nothing so blatantly bad it is kinda Complicated so if you don’t have prior experiences with games like these you might be out of your depth another little problem with the keybinds so mess with them a bit. Another good thing is the storyline is very well made and entertaining. One problem is experienced was my game was really laggy but i fixed it by turning down the graphics. In my opinion, if you want to spend money this on a game this game is definitely worth it"
Positive,"I like everything!!! My favorite part is: not fellowing quest, and discover by my own some nex areas, and escape run away from to strong enemies! The bad point (if it's really are one ) the main quest is not easy to accomplish when we must ride over many country to finsh other quests. Because, if we make some of these quests, before making this part of the main quest, it's complicate to find the other quests, it's like a broken chain, and you don't know where are the other parts of this chain. (Sorry for my bad english, thanks to have created this wonderful game)"
Positive,"The story is expansive and open, without limiting your choices or direction, you can obtain almost all available skills if you put in the time and the effort, very alt friendly, and a much less toxic community (very friendly) compared to alot of current mmo's."

Positive,The tutorials are great for beginning players. Plenty of helpful people and access to many helpful guilds.
Positive,"When this game initially released, I wasn't impressed by what I assumed was a half baked attempt at trying an Elder Scrolls themed World of Warcraft clone. I didn't like the way the game looked (by watching videos) and I thought it would be very very different from offline Elder Scrolls games.I don't know if that was true back then, but I just recently got this game and don't know why I've been missing all of this fun all these years. I'm as immersed as I was when I played Oblivion for the first time back in the day, and with a TON of much more content. What's more, you get to decide where to start, which of the many story arcs to follow, etc. It's a truly open world sand box with amazing lore and beautiful graphics (after all these years).Whether you're a fan of the series or not, I don't think you'll regret getting this game. I only regret not getting it sooner."
Positive,"This game is essentially all of the Elder Scrolls games stitched together and filled to the brim with interesting characters & quests, beautiful locations and tons of new lore resulting in hundreds of hours of things to do even with the same character.Now the in-game economy is very different compared to the other Elder Scrolls games, but it fits very well into how the game is built. Mostly this just means that you rarely buy items from merchants, since you get them as loot drops most often or alternatively by just trading with other players.Building your character also feels fairly complete and intuitive, because the available skill trees and their abilities come with completely different ways to play that you can mix and match to your liking, or even swap between two different builds and styles while playing. I do also have to mention that the endgame is a lot of grinding unless you're willing to shell out a lot of money for crowns, buy ESO+ or trade with other players. Other than that, it is still a very good game and I would recommend it any day."
Positive,its kinda fun i guess
Positive,Solo questing player here. ESO does a fantastic job of not holding your hand and giving you the typical Bethesda approach of letting you go anywhere. The main questline is satisfying and each zone has their own storyline. ESO continues to get better over time and the community is friendly. Def worth a pick up.
Positive,"I have tons of hours in this and I don't really see myself stopping anytime soon, the game has tons of content, no matter what you expect from it, ESO probably has exactly what you want.Most people get weirded out by the combat system once they start, either because they're used to the other TES games or by other MMORPGs in general, and what I can tell you is that the game is played very differently than anything else, and while it can feel weird at first, once you get to actually learn how rotation and weaving works, you'll probably fall in love with it.It's more fast paced, engaging and the high end content is much more challenging than most MMOs out there,If you're not into sweaty hardcore content, most of the game is completely casual friendly, you can have nearly the same single player experience you had in the older TES games by just questing around.The housing system is surprisingly fantastic and probably the best any MMO ever had, and the game has tons of outfits you can unlock, dye and mix up exactly how you want.The only negatives, that you will probably see being repeated a lot here is how the game lacks a good reward system for mounts, in which most are only unlockable through opening crates, which are paid with crowns, real money.That however, was never a problem for me, not because I particularly like how it works, but because you can trade your in-game currency for crowns with other players, you can essentially get anything from the crown store through in-game activities and trading, that actually made me engage much more with the game and in the end everything I'd get from the store felt like an in-game earned reward.There's also an endeavor system in which you can get seals daily and trade them for anything in the crates for free, it would take you some time to get a radiant mount for example, but most of these dailies are super easy and fast to do.The second negative for me would be PvP content, which has been lacking for the past few years but it can still be pretty fun, they're finally bringing more content to it this year so let's see how things work out for that.Overall, the game is fantastic, especially if you like the TES franchise, it's rich in lore and can have seemingly unending content to explore."
Positive,"Great for group play, and very likeable as a solo experience.  Much like its predecessors.  The spiraling approach to quests can be tedious."
Positive,Huge fan. Great game. Way more than 7 letters in the title.
Positive,No time to review. Need time to play :D
Positive,"ima cat that can cook and shoot spells, pretty cool"
Positive,Razum-dar is a precious kitten and must be protected.
Positive,I like that you can go anywhere on the map and you do not have to follow the story if you do not want to.
Positive,"They have done well to bring this to the game it is today.. Launch was terribly bethesda-esc 😂But yeah its a good game for TES fans, the only downside is theres so much DLC to catch up with you dont really know where to start with it all"
Positive,"I was searching for a popular MMORPG to play with my friends.  It was a toss up between this and GW2, seems GW2 is more casual so I decided on this instead.  Most my friends only played it a few weeks but my wife and I found a fun guild and enjoy playing it.  I enjoy the story the most, everything is voice acted, even side quests and the world is so huge it's easy to get lost in it all (in a good way)  The combat is engaging but not too complicated.  Gets regular content updates and expansions.  There's also PVP content if that's your thing, but its in designated areas so at least it's optional.  TONS of guilds, something for everyone I feel.  Worth a try at least."
Positive,"Well written stories and characters, engaging group content and an ever expanding sandbox of items that will constantly influence combat. ESO respects your time by never invalidating your progress - with new releases there are also new items which become completely optional for you to pursue on an individual basis. Best MMO I have ever played content wise, community wise and live service wise."
Positive,"I am a long-standing player of the Elder Scrolls series (and foremost a fan of the Dunmer). While I really enjoyed Oblivion and Skyrim, something was still missing for me compared to Morrowind - a game that felt exotic and unique among other fantasy RPG. I am pleased to say that ESO has brought back some of that magic for me. At the time of writing I have spent nearly 100 hours exploring the mystical appeal of Vvardenfell and surrounding provinces, e.g. Deshaan.What I like:- You can play solo. Game-play feels a bit different to prior offerings, but is a compromise and I like that it has the multiplayer option too - joining player guilds can be fun. - Crafting. Lots of opportunity for clothiers, blacksmiths, woodworkers, enchanters, alchemists, and provisioning (including cooks and fishermen). - Quests are as engaging as I remember from prior games - I like that the story is building on the earlier lore of the Elder Scrolls setting.- The game looks fantastic and offers a touch of nostalgia - a big win for me, seeing the lands I remember in high definition, meeting characters like Vivec and Almalexia again, seeing Mournhold and the Clockwork City of Sotha Sil, etc.- Player homes and customisation - options are extensive and open the way for a lot of creativity, with furnishings, tattoos, dyeing clothes, etc.   What I am not so keen on:  - While the Crown Store offers a lot of options for customisation (and I like everything I have purchased in-game so far), it can quickly become expensive. - There is an alternative, in that the game allows you to build up your collection over time, from quest rewards, treasure hunting, crafting, guild trading, etc. though this requires patience and might not suit all play-styles. It can take time to find what you are after (e.g. furniture patterns are random drops in crates, barrels, chests, etc.), or to collect enough gold in solo play to purchase from achievement merchants.- If I am being picky, purchasing dye sets in the Crown Store for outfits does not unlock the pigments to use at a clothing station - that is pity, as I can see that might put some players off purchasing dye sets."
Positive,Skeevers = Rats. Great game.
Positive,It is a fun game and has so many different quests to do. Love that I can play with friends.
Positive,i love making my elf characters very slay and slought
Positive,amazing combat and story
Positive,Very hard to dive in but if you want to have a full on MMORPG with a Elder Scrolls vibe. Subscription is very worth it as well!
Positive,There is time stop.
Positive,"This game doesn't need a review at this point. Reviewing an Elder Scrolls game is like reviewing a Star Wars movie. Everyone knows what it is. Nothing you can say is going to convince nor dissuade people to play it. The Elder Scrolls franchise is less of a game series now and more of a pop culture institution. You either love it and will play any title they release, or it does nothing for you and no amount of reviews are going to get you to partake."
Positive,"Look, I've been playing Elder Scrolls games for a long time. I keep coming back to ESO because I like the setting, I like the combat, and I like the story lines. Every so often I'm like ""Hm I haven't played that in a while I should revisit it"" and every time I discover something new and it's as good as I remember it."
Positive,"ESO is fantastic game, but definitely not perfect. If you're an elder scrolls fan, familiar with the series, you may approach this game with a hate/love relationship. Pros:Its a fun MMO! now you can play with your friends, fight, enjoy the story, build a guild up with the community. Generally, what i've seen is that the community is great, but the occasional toxic player comes from the woodworks.Fun rp elements. While the rp elements aren't the strongest, it's still a very fun game to roleplay in. Play as the character you want! give them the character you want to!Combat system. While i'm not a fan of the combat system through pc, (controller is better imo) it's still fun and great when you figure out a way to create a strong skill set. and there are hundreds of guides on how to create amazing character builds. though, your patience will always be tested when you're killed by that one guy online 1000 times.Not pay to play. okay, so what i mean is, you can play the game's main story without being stuck behind a paywall. The additional dlc stories you have to pay for, but the main identity of the game isn't limited or stuck behind these dlc. they do introduce fun mechanics, but they're not a requirement or anything. not pay to win: while there is an ingame currency, and there lots of items to be bought, but they're cosmetics. Pets, skins, costumes, mounts, these are the things you can buy. Not overly op weapons or stuff like that. though, through this store, you have to buy the dlc.explore tamriel. there is so much to explore! beautiful landscapes, and the different areas. this my favourite aspect of the game, just experiencing different places, and lore and everything.Conscompletionists nightmare. Ok, so if you're anything like me, you have to complete everything and anything you can. collect it all, get the achievments, all nice like that. Well it's definitely a bit tricky here. Every new dlc that's released comes with new armour styles, and achievments, every event comes with new armour styles, the aren't easily obtainable if you missed the event. if stuff like this irritates you, then it might be an uncomfortable playthrough.dlc. So, i really love most of the dlc on the platform. the issue is that there is so many different ones being churned out, that you're still spending a bit of money on it. If you're patient enough, you might be able to wait for a discount, on the ingame currency, or on the dlc itself. for some people this might not be an issue, but for others who are tight on money, it can be a bit frustrating.Lore. so if you're a person who likes consistent lore, then this'll be frustrating. as with a lot of elder scrolls games, there is inconsistent lore. elder scrolls traditionalists. so in my opinion, this doesn't feel strongly like an elder scrolls game. maybe its the mmo aspect, the style it was built in, the main quest. but it doesn't feel like the previous games released, not exactly. I still love, and some people may agree, and some might not. But if you're looking for that traditional elder scrolls experience, i wont say you'll find it here, but i won't say you won't either.the tutorial. okay some might agree, but some might not. This is definitely a con for me. i started playing eso when it first came out, then stopped for a while. last year, i picked it back up (on the ps4 at the time) and noticed a different tutorial. So if you're new, or an old player picking the game back up, you might be confused by the tutorial. origionally the tutorial took place in coldharbour, but was changed to the isle of balfieria (how ever you spell it). this was because of an issue that when you bought a new dlc, you'd have a change in tutorial relating to the dlc. The isle of balfieria solved that problem by providing the play with a tutorial, and a choice of which ever dlc or vanilla game start they'd prefer. though, a small portion of the initial start quest of your choice would be altered, or removed. For me, i didn't like this, and im sure others wouldn't like this. but for some this is a plus. so take it how you will. This is my take on the game. It's definitely not perfect, so take everything with a grain of salt, but it's definitely a game i enjoy. I recommend the pc version, as you're paying psplus if you want it on ps4/5. and it's a bit of money, especially if you decide to get the esoplus. though, you'll have to figure out controller configurations if you prefer that to keyboard.all in all, i recommend this game, but i reckon it's best to wait for a sale, especially for the dlc too,=."
Positive,"I am really enjoying this game at the moment. I used to play WoW, like many of you, but they over-simplified everything and it has become a shell of what it once was. It got to be quite boring, just grinding the same old stuff. I am still a new player of ESO, but so far I'm really loving the solo play quests and stories. It seems there will never be a shortage of things to do and places to explore. I am not a very social person online, because, well, people suck...BUT I love the fact that it's possible to group with strangers and do rewarding things if I so choose. The fact that the base game is only $10, and no subscription is required, makes it THAT MUCH better. This is a great motivator to at least try the game, because if you don't like it you're only out $10. I jumped right in and bought the $60 preorder expansion bundle and am so glad I did! I paid that much for each and every expansion WoW had to offer over the years, ON TOP OF the REQUIRED subscription, so this game in comparison is an amazing deal! I love that in-game purchases are not required to enjoy the game, but are available for those who choose to support the developers. Nothing feels forced. The only downside I've run into so far is inventory space, since I don't have a subscription with the crafting bag access. I am learning to be more selective of what I pick up and what to sell to vendors. I have put 37 hours in, which isn't much, but I've only had the game for a short time and I have 3 children (ages 3, 5, and 7) to look after. If you are looking for a game you can immerse yourself in for hours but does not require you to devote your life to it, this is for you. If you like to play solo, but want the option of grouping with others, this is for you. If you like to play with your friends, this is for you. If you enjoy open-ended character development, where you can LITERALLY be anyone you want to be, and make any choice you want to make, this is for you. There is endless opportunity and plenty of diversity! If you are on the fence, try the $10 base game for a few days before upgrading. This is the best MMORPG I have come across so far, and you can't beat the price when compared to the value. There is something to enjoy, no matter what you're looking for! All the elements of a great MMO, all the elements of a great story-based RPG, a welcoming player base, and endless options for character development and crafting choices, with nothing being forced upon you to progress, how can you go wrong?"
Positive,Ah. Finally a way to release my inner Khajit. 10/10.
Positive,"I loved sifting through the hordes of brain dead rats, 11/10 would watch power creep push lobotomites to end game again"
Positive,i enjoed Skyrim very much and this is even better
Positive,"The game is so huge, and the story missions are quite interesting, lots of political intrigue. There is the irritating fact that players can be in a fight, chased towards guards, and accidentally attack guards causing a bounty, but otherwise the quirks are manageable."
Positive,I just love the amount of storyline quests this game has.
Positive,"""Seven-Bellies would be pleased if I crawled back into an egg. Then he could sit on it and protect me.His concern is not lost on me, but after I hatched, I'd still bite his tail.""This is a good game."
Positive,"Enjoy the game, wish it had nightgales in it ... But, maintenance time way too long"
Positive,"Not bad, not terrible"
Positive,"Some annoying features, but overall a great game"
Positive,"I tried this game before the release of its first expansion as I was looking for something to play after Skyrim. I really did not like it much and left after 15 hours being dismayed by how different it felt... Fastforward to early May 2022, I decided to give it another go. And very surprisingly, I was hooked. I enjoyed the combat I disliked all those years ago, and I continue to enjoy the stories in each of the zone. I cannot yet speak about end-game, I might not even bother with that, but its fun to play :)"
Positive,"-Fully voiced story quests in Elderscrolls lore. NO fetch quests or grinding-Massive amount of content in an expanding world. New DLCs all the time-Memorable moments with 99.5% amazing community. -NOT pay to win, BUT ESO+ is worth it. Really, try it out and play 85%+ of content for free. Paying is for convenience and new content. -Well thought out group and solo content-Player housing! Display dungeon trophies, craft furniture, store items...-A blast to play with family. My wife and kids all play!"
Positive,"Epic MMO with tons of content to keep you addicted. Great character customisation possibilities, regarding both appearance and playstyle, and a large interesting world to explore. You can play almost everything solo, but the game is so much better with friends. I love the Elder Scrolls <3"
Positive,"Highly Recommend, tons of content and hours of fun!!!!!"
Positive,It is good.
Positive,"Very fun game. i recommend you play with friends, but if you play alone it's fun too."
Positive,"Such a fun and engaging game, it's easy to get into and extremely enjoyable to play solo or with friends, cosmetics are locked behind a pay wall, but you can also earn some cool things just by completing quests. Combat is very fun and mostly easy, just don't get swarmed by too many enemies. If you're new, you might get lost in the vast options you have from travelling Tamriel or what ability to unlock, or anything related to the game mechanics, but it's really simple and anything you pick can be used effectively, this is a game where you create the character you can relate to and be something you want to be, without worrying if you won't deal as much damage or heal as much. It's a very dynamic game and I highly recommend it."
Positive,"It isn't as fun as Oblivion or Skyrim was when I first started playing them but I got the free weekend to try it out and since it was less than $6 I went ahead and bought it and it's not like I hate it but so far there is a lot more running around than there is fighting but it's still early on and it seems to be getting more interesting as I get further along. I'm around level 8 and haven't had much fighting yet but it's still pretty fun. I was thinking about buying Elden Ring but this was a lot cheaper and I have a ton of other games so this is good enough to fill my RPG need when I really want to play something besides replaying Skyrim for the 10th time. So if you don't mind grinding away minor quests to get a decent weapon, which mine still isn't that good but again, only level 8, I'd say go ahead and get it, it's cheap, pretty fun and the micro transactions aren't necessary but I may do one later if it gets as fun as I'm hoping it will."
Positive,"Recently returned to this. I'd forgotten how many terrible Americanisms were in this, with pretentious, atrocious attempts by American voice actors to pronounce words like ""fancy"" as they imagine British/Commonwealth/international English speakers do, so it comes out as ""foncy""--who the hell says ""foncy""? There are also numerous instances of ""laying"" being grammatically abused. Case in point: ""...found a magic amulet on a dead man laying in the road."" Unless he was undead or a ghost, how was he laying? What was he laying? Eggs? Bricks? The word you're looking for is ""lying"". Why is it so hard for Bethesda to find professional writers and voice actors who actually speak English well? I'm increasingly of the opinion that Bethesda has a knack for finding the many incompetent 'recognised' American voice actors in the industry that get by on pure luck and 'fame'. Can't you find any actual British people to do your voice acting? Why are there so many atrocious attempts by American voice actors to sound English in this game?Ask Larian for their agency contacts--they seem to have no trouble finding solid UK voice actors.Anyway, one of the only MMOs with some choices, consequences and reactivity, that plays out more like a huge single-player RPG than an 'MMO'. For people who enjoy quests, stories, conspiracies, and reactivity, this is a big sell.I do wish they did a better job planning things out. There's an abundance of quest overload with various DLCs that mess the 'timeline' up, not least of all the dissonance of a number of instances where NPCs yet to be saved are alive, well, and free.Also wish they'd finally provide proper quickslot bars (to PC gamers, if nothing else) rather than the meagre 5+1 x2 offering at present. What's the point of numerous skills if: 1) You can only use a handful of them at any one time, and 2) You only have two bars to switch between to access them.The skill bars are easily one of the stupidest implementations in this game."
Positive,"Love this game, Elder Scrolls is one of my favorite video game series.Good game-play, music, and stories/lore."
Positive,One of the best MMOs on the market rn
Positive,"I was really surprised with this game, at first i was ""on the fence"" but it is worth it ♥If you like Elder Scrolls (atmosphere, story, animations...) and specially if you like MMOs GO GET THIS NOW!Once i got over the fact that i expected it to be a coop Elder Scrolls i really started enjoying it, im not an MMO player at all i just play GW2 from time to time and i have to say, i never thought i could like other MMO but ESO is really good, most stories are great, voice actors are awesome, graphics in really few situations (like a random model of an npc/mob around you or some random stone) are a bit slow loading but it works perfectly, the Add-ons make this game sooo customizable (INSANELY!) the community, oh my gods the community is AWESOME! there is always someone that will stop what they are doing to help/explain things to you, hell even i enjoyed PvP mode sooo much and im not a pvp player at all! can't wait to play around Cyrodiil some massive PvP battles. Most stuff is balanced but the fact that you are limited to 1 class was a bit to much of a change for me, still every class have 3 branches + classes that you unlock in-game(PvP/PvE Skills) + Professions + weapon skills! the options are close to endless, soo it makes it really customizable. I would say it's kind of mandatory to read a liiitle bit about how the game works before beginning your ESO journey, but you can go full Gung Ho into the game without many problems i'd say xDI has several ways to be played, you won't be able to avoid killing others (no pacific run unless going in a party) but it is not all killing, there are SOO many things to do and TONS of content to enjoy!See you around Tamriel!"
Positive,why can i not have flowers on the male khajiit this is racism at it's finest
Positive,Very addicting but can be frustrating at first until you get the hang of it. You can still have a lot of fun even if you aren't sure where to start. My new favorite game.
Positive,Its pretty lit tbh
Positive,"Game is pretty fun. Isn't super optimized so it has performance issues especially with addons. All in all, pretty fun game. Just don't walk in expecting Skyrim MMO lol"
Positive,"I've played over two thousand hours of this game. Admittedly, my actual playtime is probably a few hundred hours less than that, what with afk'ing and distractions and such, but still... Why the fuck would Steam ask whether I'd recommend this game when I have over two thousand hours logged? Obviously no, I hate it and it's terrible."
Positive,"It's World of Warcraft's best features (classic RPG play) in real time. I own over 500 games and this is in the top 5 after playing for less than a week. While a monthly sub will make your experience and level rise faster This IS NOT a ""Pay to Play Game"". The worlds are expansive and beautiful and the game play is amazing. It's so deep it can be overwhelming but there are so many things you can do it's insane! If you love RPG, MMORPG, or just amazing games this is one of them. Be warned, this game is way more addictive than any I've played in my 50 years starting in the 80s! lol Enjoy!"
Positive,"I've been playing since the beta, in February of 2014. ESO is an incredible MMO that I keep coming back to, even now. In fact, I still think it's the best MMO available today. Why?✔️ Easy to learn, hard to master combat✔️ Great questlines✔️ Rich character customization  - you can come up with a build + skillset just as unique as you✔️ Deep and rewarding crafting system✔️ The best player housing system in any MMO - no lottery required, free to decorate however you want✔️ Gorgeous environments✔️ You can play this game entirely solo, and that's fine - in fact, some endgame trials (like Maelstrom Arena) are solo-only✔️ PVP is a bit chaotic, but really fun ✔️ Vet Dungeons + Trials are available for those who enjoy difficult group content✔️ Great community, with an in-game guild finderYou get hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of entertaining content for $50-60. No subscription needed."
Positive,"I really enjoy playing this game, but much more fun playing with friends then by yourself. (I would recommend playing with a few friends you already know, as I found it impossible to make friends in game.)However if your like me and had never played an Elder scrolls game before, it is much easier if someone explains the mechanics and a little bit of the lore to you as you play.As I played, I found that some of the side quests may have glitches that may not allow you to finish the quest, but most of them are pretty good. (In particular, The Unquiet Dead - Inner Sanctum Ward Puzzle, wouldn't allow me to place any objects, which can become extremely frustrating.) Overall pretty good game. I will definitely sink more hours into it."
Positive,One of the best elder scrolls games.
Positive,A lot of fun. Good stories and adventuring.
Positive,"Great MMO going back to it once in a while, definitely recommend it :)"
Positive,"Great game that I have fun playing. Very nice. Nice, cool."
Positive,Good game 100% worth it
Positive,Amazing game! Solo or with people it provides amazing entertainment. If you want the long haul of a main MMO its worth it. My best advice is get on twitch find some streamer communities and make connections cause the people and community in this game are beautiful friendly and amazing people! Long term friendships to be made!
Positive,"An elder scrolls game, certainly. ESO enjoys the IP and executes it flawlessly, through its fantastic visuals to its brilliant storytelling. There is a fun experience to be had with this game, and nigh-endless content.The main issue I have is the endless content. After a certain point, the ceaseless whinging of NPCs becomes a drone, the story becomes an interference to be clicked though as fast as possible. What this leaves behind is a very typical MMO structure. This isn't the end of a playthrough by any stretch, but the structure of the content is blatantly repetitive, an issue which many similar games suffer from. I would argue ESO masks this undeniable truth fairly well relative to its competitors, but in the base game there is a limited amount of subsystems which become loathsome, and other features which downright work against the player. Crafting is fun, but slowly becomes a daily chore, burdened by what can only be described as a criminal inventory management system. Why in this modern day I should ever have to choose not to pick up items because of inventory space I will never know. There is a crafting bag system which solves this, but this leads on to one of the game's biggest failings - the paywalls.This game is a really fun experience that works well, but the base game only serves an an advertisement for this, teasing what can be enjoyed if you purchase all the additional content, AND subscribe to their ESO Plus service (all of which is a bit extortionate IMO). It's worth it for some, but not for others.The base experience is still worth trying, whether you get it on sale or on a free weekend. Just make sure to try it plenty before sinking oodles of cash into DLC and whatot"
Positive,Love this game I could play this for hours with my buddy and wife. Got Blackwood dlc and its sick so far. The skills are cool asf if you choice good ones. I mostly like the dual skills it kills enemies fast. Planning on playing this more
Positive,only fun with friends
Positive,"Really fun game if you're into fantasy, not difficult to get into, looks really good on max graphics."
Positive,"I play solo and I like the quests, there are so many it's hard to keep up."
Positive,I LOVE this game! ESO has a very open play and skill system. The land is beautiful and detailed. Combat is variable and situational. The community is helpful and encouraging. I definitely recommend this game for anyone who wants the open play!
Positive,"I love this game, and do kind of recommend it,  but there is NO way to earn stuff by playing the game have to spend IRL money for cool mounts and pets and cosmetics, there adding less and less every year (companions and now a card game) for the big selling point of the chapters, they claim adding a new class is impossible since its on last gen consoles. Also all classes feel the exact same just with different animation and timings with recasting skills when they fall off and using a spamable when not recasting skill with uptime, there also really pushing hybrid builds between Magica and Stam making things feel even more the same.Overland content is SOO easy you can afk and things will struggle to kill most of the time only really hard for 5 lvls and then the reward for the quest is a gear piece you will never use and 20 gold"
Positive,"V době kdy píšu tuto recenzi, jsem odehrál zatím jen 18 hodin.I to je ale dost na to, abych si udělal názor na základní mechaniky této hry a byl s nimi spokojený.Pokud nemáš čas číst celou recenzi, TES Online je jako Skyrim, jen lepší (alespoň v porovnání s verzí bez módů) a online.Pokud chceš vědět víc, tady jsou detaily.Dřív jsem zkusil nespočet MMORPG a i když v současné době na ně a jakékoli jiné hry kvůli práci nemám tolik času, vím, co vím.Můžu tedy říct, že to jak TES Online přistupuje ke své komunitě hráčů je vzácné, ne-li unikátní. Je to také velmi osvěžující.Rozhodně pokud mám hru srovnat třeba s WoW, kde je všechno uměle natáhlé nebo tě mechaniky naopak  záměrně omezují v tom, co každý den můžeš udělat, jen aby jsi u toho strávil měsíce a měsíce a platila si povinný odběr nebo v porovnání s těmi korejskými, masově vytvářenými kydy, kde je zase vše hrozně lehké. Tedy alespoň za předpokladu, že na každý problém hodíš peněženku nebo tě baví hodiny a hodiny naprosto bezpředmětného snažení a grindu, jen aby jsi stejně zaostával za lidmi, co do toho každý měsíc napumpují půlku své výplaty.Proč si to myslím se pokusím shrnut do odrážek. (P.S: Jsem se pokusil a selhal, tak se omlouvám :D)1.) Úkoly jsou významné.Každá zóna má vlastní úkolovou linku, na jejíž začátek se můžeš nechat navést prostým kliknutím na tlačítko v mapě.To sice není zvláštní, ale je to velmi vstřícné a chtěl jsem to zmínit. :)Co je ohledně úkolů mnohem důležitější je fakt, že jich je poskromnu. Při plnění hlavní úkolové linky dané zóny narazíte na vedlejší úkoly, které jsou opravdu vedlejší a pokud nechcete, přijmout je nemusíte. Co víc, je vlastně docela snadné se jim vyhnout. Což je sice dobře, ale nedoporučoval bych to. Ne ale kvůli tomu, že by ti potom chyběly zkušenosti na další úroveň, ale protože minete hodně zajímavých a především nadabovaných příběhů.2.) DabingPro mě jakožto někoho, kdo nerad čte 60 řádků vesměs bezvýznamného textu v každém, včetně těch nejprostších úkolů.. ano narážím na tebe WOW... je obrovskou výhodou, že je vše dabované. (Alespoň vše, na co jsem zatím narazil.) Anglický dabing je kvalitní, takže se nejen dobře poslouchá, ale zároveň vám díky němu postavy zůstanou víc v hlavě a rychleji přirostou k srdci.Což v kombinaci s malým počtem úkolů a malým počtem důležitých postav jednak dělá ony postavy opravdu důležité a svět o hodně zabydlenější a věrohodnější...3.) LevlováníUž jsme to trochu nakousnul, tak budu stručný. I když jsem ani zdaleka nedokončil všechny vedlejší a vlastně ani hlavní úkolové linky v zónách, které jsem navštívil, protože jsem se vesměs soustředil jen na to, jak se stát vlkodlakem, necítil jsem, že by moje postava byla nějak slabá. Vždycky jsem si se vším poradil. Což je samozřejmě díky výborně udělanému Level scaling systému, co ve hře téměř nezjištně funguje.4.) Vlastní postava, vlastní cestaVelmi mě zaujala i skutečnost, jak si v TES Online volíte talenty a schopnosti. Vše se odemyká a zlepšuje podle toho, co děláte. Podobně jako například ve Skyrimu.Prvně, když vás někdo zasáhne když na sobě máte těžkou zbroj nebo když prvně použijete nějakou zbraň, v popisu postavy se objeví s tím související, talentový strom, do kterého můžete investovat body.Tyto body získáváte mnohými způsoby. Těmi hlavními je levelování, dokončením významných úkolů a také nacházením takzvaných Skyshard, které jsou rozeseté po celém světě a mnohé z nich jsou snadno přístupné. V současné době je možné získat až 386 skill pointů, což není dost na to, aby jste odemkli všechno, ale je to víc jak dost, aby jste odemkli v podstatné všechno pro svůj herní styl. Pokud jím tedy není mistr všeho.5.) Sociální stránkaTES Online podle mého názoru není tradiční MMO-RPG. Říkám to, protože jsem doposud neměl potřebu se s nikým nějak extra socializovat nebo vstoupit do guildy. S postavou na lvlu 17 jsem dokonce ještě ani nešel jediný dungeon, což mě samotného překvapuje.Z toho mála společenské interakce co jsem zažil, ale mohu říct, že jsou všichni vstřícní a milí. Jako příklad uvedu to, když jsem se chtěla stát vlkodlakem a tak jsem zašel na dané místo, kde již čekali hráči, ochotní mou postavu přeměnit.Stačilo jen říct a ochotně mě přeměnil.A pro ty co neví, přeměnit / nakazit někoho kletbou vlkodlaka nebo i tou upíra, může dotyčný jen jednou za 7 dní, takže to není jen tak. Je to o to vzácnější, že dotyčný do toho potřebuje investovat skill point, což sice není moc, ale vzhledem k tomu, že to hráči nedá nic jiného krom možnost přeměnit druhé, je to pořád jakýsi handicap a laskavost k druhým.Krom toho si ale komunita pomáhá a radí i v chatech a je obecně vstřícná. Jsme si jistý, že i tady jsou elitáři jako ve WoW a všude jinde, ale převážně narážím na rozumné a slušné lidi.6.) SoubojeSouboje jsou rychlé a speciální schopností mají dostatečný efekt. Výhodou je i to, že můžete vcelku přehledně hrát a bojovat i z pohledu první osoby. A to i v případě, že bojujete zblízka.NEVÝHODAJediné co mi prozatím vadí, je asi fakt, že některé lokace a dungeony jsou uzamčené za nutností si koupitDLC.To ale není ani zdaleka tak omezující, jak by si jeden mohl myslet nebo předpokládat. I bez těchto DLC totiž máte k dispozici údajně 300 hodin příběhu, během nichž od TES Online buď upustíte nebo si ho zamilujete natolik, že pro vás nebude problém do nějak investovat několik málo euro.SHRNUTÍProzatím nemám víc co říct.Záměrně jsem vynechal profese jako je kovářství, alchymie a pod. protože jsem se soustředil na příběh a nijak je doopravdy neotestoval. Zatím mi ale přijdou jako něco, čemu by se jeden mohl věnovat, aniž by u toho tak jako v jiných hrách buď strávil mládí nebo jen aby plody jeho usilovné práce překonala první věc, co mu padne z náhodného monstra v dungeonu.Můžu se ale plést..."
Positive,"Disclaimer: I have not played much WoW or LoL or pretty much any other MMORPGs....That said, I do think this is a great game at a great price with practically guaranteed new content every quarter, some of which can be obtained for free by playing the game. There are micro-transactions and gambling aspects which makes it very tempting for ambitious players that have to have the best gear and the coolest emotes, outfits etc...IMO it is not a good game for kids that have access to mommy's or daddy's credit card. However, on the positive side, it is completely possible to enjoy this game without spending a lot of money or buying subscriptions to ESO+, it just takes patience, discipline and a taste for grinding and researching forums etc... Sadly, new chapters (such as High Isle) cost actual money, no crowns allowed, but practically everything else can be bought with in-game-gold, which can also be exchanged for crowns using verified crown exchanges. This can literally save you hundreds of dollars. Also, there is plenty to do in the base game and there are constant sales for things like dungeons and older content once they start marketing the latest and greatest, which as I said, new stuff every quarter. Then there's the community which is actually pretty good. ZOS takes reporting other players fairly seriously and does a lot to try and keep the community from becoming toxic. User experiences will vary, no doubt, but after playing a lot of FPS, it was like a breath of fresh air for me. Keep in mind that if everyone is constantly being toxic towards you, perhaps it is worth examining your own attitude and actions to make sure you aren't the one bringing out the worst in people. Another possible downside is that despite the mature rating they sometimes tend to frown upon silly things like cursing, name-calling, poor sportsmanship and cheeky names. However, in some instances it is actually better that they are willing to take these things seriously.IMO they try to make it too kid friendly for being an ""adult's"" game.  I have still made more ""friends"" on here than any other MMO because everyone is not really competing for resources and achievements, its much more co-operative, until you get into PVP, if that's your thing. I haven't explored that very much but even so I haven't heard many complaints about it. That's not to say you will never run into jerks from time to time, but it is still rare IMO.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>(EDIT)<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<One thing I forgot to mention that is actually very essential to enjoying this game is ADDONS...You will want ADDONS (which are free)....I use Minion, but there are others I believe. They are only moderately complex to the average newbie or laymen. I would recommend TTC or MM or both for a guild trader (You can be in up to 5 guilds at a time with 30 slots each for a total of 150 slots where you can sell a majority of items you find in the game as long as they aren't BOUND to your character or account. Many items sell for millions, and many more for hundreds of thousands, and so on, and yes that's a decent amount of gold to buy most of what you may want. Like I said, you can buy almost everything in the game just with gold, including gear and houses that you can decorate almost any way imaginable, with items that provide audio/visual aesthetics, including animations and or sound-effects. And the amount of variety of occasionally beautiful artwork is like a rabbit hole that  never...ends.... John Cleese does the voice of Cadwell, and is quite possibly my favorite NPC, and he's hilarious. He is also part of why I pulled the trigger and bought the game. So far, I haven't regretted it for a moment."
Positive,"I was going to give this a bad review for all the hoops I had to jump through to get it to finally play, but once you're in you get hooked, really enjoying this game. I didn't even wait the full 11 days, bought it at the discount price the second day of playing. Only 1 gripe thought... repairing equipment is a lousy and shameful mechanic and should be scrapped."
Positive,Good game and finally developers are making good changes
Positive,It's addicting if you have friends to play with!!!
Positive,very fun and lore rich with major plot twists and great gameplay plus supports 10+ players. in all perfection
Positive,"Great game, so much stuff to do."
Positive,"Loved all the single-player Elder Scrolls games.  I play ESO single-player as well, and love it.  I may try to group with others some day to do some group stuff, but playing alone has kept me happy for over a thousand hours playing time, and there is still much left to explore.  One of my favorite computer games."
Positive,I have played this game starting on my Xbox but wanted to jump into it on the PC. I am someone that the only MMO i have been into is Phantasy star online. I love the elder scroll series of games and I am really love ESO. I am playing for the first time with keyboard and mouse and this game is making the transition easy. I love the worlds and how much there is to do in them. The gameplay feels just the same as if i was playing Skyrim. I haven't played with anyone yet so i am hoping for a great experience. I am loving the game so much that i pre-ordered the new expansion High Isle the collector's edition. I can't wait to sink my teeth into this game for many hours!
Positive,"This is the only MMORPG I have ever been able to sink my teeth into properly. Obviously, as with any mmorpg, it looks expensive but the 60 dollar edition that comes with the latest chapter and previous ones is a total steal. Epic and Zased"
Positive,"Been playing for almost 3 years and still on this game and havent complete the story lol. Because there are a lot to do that are more exciting than questing. I didnt mean that the questing is boring, it actually very fun with many plot twist story, its just when u play mmorpg, there are many things to do to make ur character stronger and train ur skills first, so whenever ur friend ask you to join them dungeoning, you wont be a burden. Tbh, i've bored sometimes, but not for long until i get excited to play again ahahaha"
Positive,"I wanted to post this before I play my 300th hour and beyond! Yes, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to Collect and Harvest materials from the world, ride amazing creatures, and have wild and cuddly pets!! Oh, and fighting crazy creatures, delving into scary places, exploring dungeons, discovering new places, home ownership, crafting, and going on quests!! I was a beta tester for this game and I thought at the time it was going to be too expensive to play. So, I let it go and forgot about it. Seven years later a good friend of mine gave me the base game as a gift. I opened the game and discovered that I had a cool monkey pet and some other items left over from the Beta test. It has been so long since the beta test that I forgot a-lot about the game. However, I did remember... (spoiler for new people). This has to do with the way you start the game :) Even though I received the base game as a gift and my son gave me a large dlc bundle, I decided to get the subscription. You get the bottomless materials bag with the subscription as well as double bank space which works for me since I love collecting loot and stuff!! There is so much to see and do that even after 299 hours I have only finished Stonefalls :) I have even bought some dlc along the way. So, yes, it is worth the money and the time!! Play On!! STILL A FANTASTIC GAME!!!"
Positive,"This is a fantastic multiplayer game for honestly any age, I just love the graphics, the quests, the gameplay, its a great game. 10/10!"
Positive,"Fun, good community, easy to play with friends. I wish there weren't so many in-game purchases to make the game more fun but it still is plenty of fun to play."
Positive,"10/10 (Long story short) Wonderfully written and beautifully executed MMO set in the Elder Scrolls world. You’re missing out if you haven’t played this.My takeaway: I want to start this review by saying I’ve played this game for nearly hundreds of hours and I have gotten nowhere. I messed around with friends, completed long storylines, and created new characters over and over again. You can really drown hours in this game without even realizing it because it’s just that good. The world is fantastic, the art is amazing, the storytelling is some of the best I’ve seen in any game, the community is helpful and kind, and a lot of love is put into this title that is consistently wowing and surprising its active player base with content that’s worth it. The game is near perfect from start to end from its many MANY things you can do to its character customization; I mean it when I say you can play as any kind of character you want as the class system really works for the player.The game does a good job explaining things to you and is extremely easy to pick up. Although it’s a complex MMO it makes it easy to understand and learn for new MMO players. Even if you’re opting for a more solo experience this game is perfectly capable of delivering that to you and so much more. I truly believe this is a masterpiece.Pros    Easy to pick up and learn.    Gorgeous.    Wonderful characters in a fantastic world.    Rich in lore and easily immersible.    Storylines that keep you entertained and challenged.    Wonderful community.    Can easily be a single player game if you want it to be.    Character customization is some of the best I’ve seen.    Game rewards hard work; not money.    Class system is easy to understand and can adhere to any playing style.    Keeps expanding in ways that pleases its active community.    DOZENS of things to do if you get tired of hacking and slashing.    The special items really feel special.    Leveling is perfection.    I don’t know how else to explain it but there’s a certain ‘life’ in this game that’s very hard to come by.Cons    There is a learning curb when it comes to certain aspects of the game but a quick dip in chat; someone will more than likely explain it to you as people are generally friendly.    Pay for customization. Not necessary but definitely a thing.    I’ve heard of people having issues with support. Cadwell has got to be one of the most charming characters I’ve come across in a long time."
Positive,Simple and easy to play. An MMORPG for someone with no friends and an odd schedule.
Positive,one of the best mmos on the market
Positive,"Great Multiplayer game! Friendly community for the most part in my limited experience. Laggy during peak playtimes. Beautiful landscapes for exploring, entertaining NPC development and questlines. Downloadable content is desirable as it opens more to explore and play, but it comes as an extra cost. The ESO plus is definitely a nice perk with a consumables bank that does not add to your character's inventory limit, and ensures access to DLC.  Highly recommended for any who like epic adventures, dungeon crawling, player vs player, gathering and crafting, and a wide assortment of custom character builds that really do allow for a play style for every one."
Positive,"I have been returning to ESO after a break of five years. It is still an attractive MMORPG. Personally I love the fact that it offers a lot of freedom where and how you level. The characters classes are interesting and allow imho for more diversity than in other games. ESO includes an extensive crafting system, great storytelling and areas to explore. Only downside just like in most games of this category, if you want to play endgame its grinding armor in time-consuming and repetitive trials to finally get that ""top gear"". Some may like this and then its fine, personally I don't."
Positive,"I was looking for a new game after tons of playing a toxic ""Valve"" game (no points for guessing right :P) and stumbled into ESO. The community is so amazing that itself warrants playing the game.ESO is simply the epitome of fun. There 100s and 100s of hours of content in the game, be it may solo or group based. There's soo frickin much you can do here that its astounding. Atm ESO might just be the best MMO that there is out there.Story/quests are as good as they come, after all this is a Bethesda production. There's creative RolePlaying elements, intense crafting experience, well-crafted combat and level design (and much more that I dont know yet).I only have a paltry 300ish hours so my knowledge of the game is nothing compared to the veterans. However what I ahve experienced here in these few hours made me write this review so that others can get into this beauty of a game.So that's it about the game. I'll share a small experience about the community as well. So I was fighting a world boss named ""Queen of the Reef"" and my character ( a Templar) didn't have the sustain nor the required DPS levels to kill it. And I ended up dying 4 times to it(no surprise there). After getting beaten the 4th time, I typed in the zone chat that ""this boss was annoying af"". Well guess what? 4 ppl showed up there to help me beat it! I was just awestruck. Even before the boss fight itself, somehow the boss got reset and each of them waited 5 mins just so they could help a new player beat the boss.  I'm really glad that there are such players in the game. Even the guilds are a joy to be in. So on the whole if you are ever in the need of a game that has solo and group content, a driven and passionate community, look no further- for ESO is the game for u.If you decide to buy the game and have any doubts about which edition to buy or literally any doubt, feel free to reach out to me on Steam.Cheers!"
Positive,Good solo content.
Positive,Fun game all around. Can be overwhelming at first with everything this game has to offer but after the learning curve its great.
Positive,"Could not get into it, and was quite boring, but can be very enjoyable with friends, in which i do not have."
Positive,I just like fishing :3
Positive,better world of warcraft but with lower playerbase /:
Positive,good game many hours
Positive,"The game is absolutely massive with all the areas/expansions that have been released. Unlike other MMOs the old content isn't made irrelevant and you can more or less play them in any order or even jump between main story and DLC zones. It's also very friendly to either playing in a group or going through content solo. Great storytelling with full VO for literally everything, even minor side quests. Also plenty to do no matter what you want from an MMO. End-game PVE, PVP, crafting, auctioneering/economy, exploration, collecting, so much."
Positive,Game good lore make brain go brrr
Positive,"It is okay. Sometimes it is great, sometimes I am trying very hard to have fun."
Positive,nc but the start confused the shit out of me
Positive,"very good game, I like to play it a lot and might make another, more in-depth review, but its 2:30 in the morning rn"
Positive,what can I say... I love this game :D
Positive,"Amazing game, ton of content and alot of fun"
Positive,Invested too much time to stop now. Game needs a change of direction to remain healthy. Content cycle has gotten very stale. Overland needs help
Positive,Just let me do this one thing and I'll log off..likely story.
Positive,"I haven't been as into a game this much since Skyrim. II'm comparing this game to Skyrim. That's a big deal.However, it is a commitment. Playing the game without ESO plus kind of ruins a lot of aspects of the game. Gathering becomes a chore. Remember how fun it was in skyrim to check all the drawers and shelves for any useful potions or items? You can only really do that in ESO if you can pay the monthly subscription. Crafting becomes an impossible task due to the lack of crafting materials."
Positive,"pretty cool MMO. beautiful world, nice community and (I know some people might beg to differ) I find the way it took since One Tamriel very enjoyable for very different styles of play/amount of time you want to put in the game."
Positive,awsome game to play with friends
Positive,"great game, lots to do"
Positive,"A huge amount of quests in one of the best worlds MMORPGS have to offer!Well-crafted stories and all of them ""narrated"" from start to finish, changing the whole concept of immersion I was used to. This factor brings a lot of life to the game, making the solo experience even more pleasant and enjoyable.The community is also very approachable and kind.So go ahead, have some fun."
Positive,"ESO has been changing since the time I started playing years ago, which is really sad, because it used to be a fair and very caring game for it's player community, and offered fantatic value for money.I had come to ESO after completing Skyrim, and loving it!However, now it has transformed into ""any other money-grabbing game"" with high bias towards stats (damage/heal/CC, etc) provided by gear from the latest launched DLCs -- which means that players who have not bought the DLC will lag badly behind (no jewellery, no relics, etc etc) -- not just in PVP, but also in PVE -- with players using older gear unable to sometimes even cross the first boss in end-game Hard dungeons which give the best gear -- if you are even able to play these, as their gear becomes so irrelevant.This is not even the biggest issue -- the issue is that if I paid say, (arbitrary number, not real) $50 for the game 3 years ago, I got the base game plus all DLC to that date.Now three years later the person buying the base game for same $50 will get all DLCs right upto the latest one -- while the loyal old customers have to pay perhaps an additional $200 to keep buying DLCs between the initial time they bought the game and updating each DLC right upto the latest one.ESO Plus is an option, but calculating the cost of ESO plus over the years competes favorably with your mortgage payment-just kidding-but seriously its a pretty penny - and certainly not for a multi-game player.If you play just one game and that one game is ESO - then perhaps yes, ESO Plus is a good ""investment"". Irrespective, I am now rethinking my continued future with ESO -- instead I have bought the new Skyrim from Steam, as well as several off-line"" games to break this cycle of leeching."
Positive,"Fun game I have played a lot of! The best part about it for me is that it can essentially function as a solo game if you don't want to run with other players. There is a TON of story, tied to every area, and it can be pretty interesting!I love the housing decorating options, as well as the various classes you can play.My biggest gripe is that this game really wants you to spend a ton of money on loot crates and cosmetics. Houses can literally run close to a hundred dollars for large ones, and a lot of those things are limited-time only to increase the pressure. It's totally optional and not pay-to-win, but there is no way to avoid the advertising for it. I think purchasable loot crates are questionable morality but the arbitrarily huge costs for things like houses are ridiculous and feel predatory. Collecting all the DLCs and whatnot can also be expensive if you don't have a sub that includes them -- but even with the sub, you will need to purchase expansions. Stuff goes on sale a lot, but there is a very regular stream of money they expect you to spend to play the full game. It is what it is.It is possible to play the game without paying for a sub or any of that additional stuff, but I will say that once you have a sub, it is nearly impossible to go back. Freeing your inventory of crafting stuff is super nice and I'd never buy all the DLCs on their own because it wouldn't be cost-efficient. I've yet to have a crash or technical issue even once after getting it properly installed; that said, the installation process has run into issues on a couple computers before if my internet fluctuated in the middle... causing everything to reset. It's a big download, so that was very frustrating. Overall, if you don't have issues with FOMO/gambling/in-game purchases and want a story-focused game with MMO capabilities, this is a great game and usually runs very smooth on PC."
Positive,"I tend to dislike MMOs, but I decided to give this a shot since I'm an elder scrolls fan. I'm really enjoying myself - apart from the PVP modes, you can basically ignore all the other players and just go through the game pretending its a regular ES game. The story still treats you as the main character, the only difference is you have a bunch of random people running around all the time."
Positive,"After long time doubts about prolonged exposure of massive multiplayer online gaming, I am finally healed and addicted to this. For all the right reasons, of course! I can stop anytime! Annnnytime. Really. Help?Seriously though, this is fun -- and has been for over two years. If you are into MMO games or the Elder Scrolls Lore, check it out! Bring a lot of patience to the game though. And be ready for some bugs."
Positive,"Amunet Sokhti loves the married life. Her wife, Shahvee, and their two adopted daughters enjoy living in Windhelm. However the spirit of derring-do and the power of the Dragonborn is hard to ignore for long. With the help of Parthanax, Amunet used an Elder Scroll to travel back 1000 years. The goal: To prevent the events that would lead to the White-Gold Concordant ever being signed.Backstory aside I absolutely love playing and Twitch streaming Elder Scrolls Online. One of the best experiences I've had in gaming in a long time over an extended period of time. Takes a little bit to ease into but anyone whose combed through everything Skyrim: Anniversary Edition has to offer will find much to love here."
Positive,jackson robert becker apex north carolina concierto court likes it
Positive,Its like Witcher 3 but multiplayer... perfect
Positive,It is an okay game.
Positive,"Best horizontal progression mmo. Lots of content, all npc's are voice acted, good visuals as well."
Positive,"I like the community, the questing, and of course the lore. The stories in this game have such range. Absolutely love some of the random dialog that NPCs have."
Positive,"An absolutely amazing game. I have over a thousand hours in the last year or so. The main storyline is awesome, and quite interesting. It is certainly a good game. If you're expecting it to be an online version of Skyrim, it is not."
Positive,"Very good MMO to start with (3000h on the Playstation).However, the game is developing negatively despite the new class.- The game lacks epic scenes- Game gets a lot of content but it all feels samey and generic- There is no sense of achievement anymore, progress in the endgame is not noticeable through the champion levels. Generally no feeling of progress"
Positive,"First time playing this game. Pretty fun. I like the leveling of skills and the different ways it lets me level. Quests are kinda meh. Go to this guy, do this, do this, kill this, quest done. Hitting level 50 you get into end game..... kind of. I play this game solo. It's interesting. There's a lot to explore. Should you get it? Yes. It's a time sink and i'm sure it's better with friends."
Positive,a very solid mmorpg definitely worth trying
Positive,9/10 Game became way more enjoyable after watching a build guide
Positive,best mmo rpg for me <3
Positive,"It worth Buying the game, Interesting and nothing's complicated about this game there a simple stuff but time consuming... watched a lot of guides to have a better understanding"
Positive,Good fun :-) So far worth the money and enjoyed the game play.
Positive,"Love this Game :) Great graphics,Super fun to quest and do dungeons and to connect with others who also love the game .... lots of friendly players on here, lots to do and awesome to play.... <3"
Positive,"When this game first came out I was skeptical. I bought the base game on a steam sale and tried it for a couple hours and wasn't impressed. However, recently I went ahead and tried it again with expansion packs and was blown away. It's turned into a really great game! Oh and ESO Plus membership is highly recommended unless you want to have no inventory all the time."
Positive,"Awesome mmorpg. Great visuals/character design :) Enjoyable quests/tasks. I have spent waaaaayyyy too many hours in this world and I love it. Mostly play solo if that's important but you can do group events/ dungeons, etc."
Positive,It's okay I guessClearly ripping off Skyrim though
Positive,"This is a fun Romp , plenty to do and lots of classic places to visit if you played Skyrim and wanted to see the rest of Tamriel."
Positive,It's a great game with great things and great stuff.
Positive,whats new world?
Positive,Its Elder Scrolls
Positive,"While I might not be a huge MMO fan and don't have the willingness to put as much time into this game as required, it can undoubtedly keep you entertained for hundreds (if not thousands) of hours. The story and amount of lore alone is a TES fan's wet dream. All of the updates and expansions for this game over the years have done it wonders. Huge props to the developers!"
Positive,One of the best MMORPG fantasy games i have played with how in depth the tales are. If you like tales of adventure and magic and enjoy engaging lore that captures your imagination then this game is for you.  If your not so much into story and lore and more into graphical quality and constant meta updates and complex gameplay loops and move sets then this game is not for you. Stand along side The Order of the waking flame or the many other factions for the future of Elsweyr and Blackwood.  The one thing i with they could add is being able to side with all factions including the antagonist ones like Mehrunes Dagon.
Positive,me shoot skelton wth stik
Positive,must watch grandma so she is careful on the internet
Positive,"I played a little to evaluate better, but it seems to me a very good RPG"
Positive,best game I've played in a while
Positive,"One of the most (if not the most) friendly community, interesting skill system, mostly lore friendly content (except for this is MMO, so much of shiny stuff and fluff and puff and animations)Solo friendly, even though you'd better join the guild. Many relatively interesting stories (again, this is MMO, but not your common MMO nevertheless).I personally find the game very appealing!10 out of 10 pony guars."
Positive,this game is not addicting. been spending every single minute while im working in Home-Office farming specific blueprints to make some money ingame. how ironic - i should be working for a company but instead i'm working in a video game to make in-game currency.
Positive,"Switched from ZOS' official launcher to steam just because why not.Spent over 1000 hours on this game before I bought a copy on Steam.OST is unbelievably good, graphics are awesome, gameplay is also awesome.Community is very helpful and welcoming to new players. There are a few toxic players, but hey, you have them everywhere.TL;DR - My favorite MMO thus far, I warmly recommend it to everyone."
Positive,"Very immersive with a play how you want style.  You can have many characters from a wide selection of races and classes.  Lots of things to do from solo open world exploration and dungeons to group dungeons and trials or large scale multiple faction battles.  The huge amount of quests with rich story lines and lore could take years to see, hear and read it all.  You can join up to five guilds for trade, game play or role playing many of which have Discord accounts so you can voice chat with your group while battling through trials or in PvP or just hanging out chilling.  There is something for everyone."
Positive,"9.932/10 ""Not bad."""
Positive,Best mounts... period
Positive,"Immediately Absorbed, Always been a fan of the Elder scrolls games. Was not disappointed in the slightest."
Positive,Tons of content. Great lore and questlines. Good skill builds and dungeons/trials are fun.PvP is terrible though. 8/10
Positive,no subscription fee... player count still high
Positive,"Out of all the MMOs I've played, this one's community is the one that makes me want to kill myself the least."
Positive,at the beginning it may be boring but 31h in and it's pretty fun. I suggest u get a clan or one or two people to play w bc then it is more fun
Positive,Very nice game with interesting storylines even for random quests you find on the road. It's what I'd hoped: a typical Elder Scrolls game but with MMO elements - it's nice to group up with others but you can also do most questing etc solo.There were some issues with getting into infinite loading screens but once I managed to fix this it's been mostly smooth sailing since then.
Positive,No cross play or cross-plat progression sadly.Because coming from a Xbox account to PC is painfully denting in the overall experience of ESO.
Positive,"I do recommend this game if you are looking for an MMORPG and like any of the Elder Scrolls games. It is fun, and for the most part what I have played the game has a very friendly following. That said, if you are running dungeons for story line make sure you have other friends that will want to run it with you as it is very hard to get a group that wants to run it for story if you just search for people to join. Also as with any MMO do be ready to spend on a Plus account if you are looking to play often and always have enough crafting supplies for all crafts. The Plus account also grants access to all DLC areas. These are the two major reasons for getting a Plus account. However the Plus account will sometimes give you discounts and get your free gifts in the store.Great points about ESO aside from the draw backs of most MMOs:1. You can get very pretty stuff with out spending a dime. 1.a. There are quests that will give you cool stuff.1.b. Events can also get you mounts and other very cool items.1.c. Walking in to some areas gives you a free pet1.d. Leveling will get you a free mount (I want to say level 16 or so, but don't quote me)2. Most of the events are pretty fun and you don't have to stray too long from your main quest2.a They seem to have events once a month (Haven't played for a full year, closer to 4 months, but there has been one every month so far)3. Great way to hang out with friends who normally you would not be able to see (also recommend something like discord or the steam chat so you can all communicate) (also this is just kinda given with any MMO)4. I have had good luck (within 24 hrs) of having a glitch and them fixing the issue. (no communication about it though, but I did send a bug report and it was fixed. I just had to play to find out it was taken care of) (only have had one story stopping bug and it was in the new DLC area that was only weeks old.)Downsides/Suggestions I would give to improve the game:1. The mail system doesn't have anyway of knowing if you sent mail. Once sent there is no record.2. They really need a way to say I want to play the dungeons for story vs I want to just speed run"
Positive,"la primera vez que lo probe no me gusto, pero despues de un año volvi me gusto y se conecta con skyrim. y eso me gusta."
Positive,amazing if you like to grind!
Positive,"Best MMORPG around, change my mind."
Positive,Smexy ass game with friends
Positive,I like this game
Positive,"Every time I have a chance to play this game, I've always enjoyed it so deeply. From the vibes of the world around you to the gameplay with friends.. It's a little sappy maybe, but I can drop this game for a few months and know that when I return it'll still be fun! Though to be fair, I do play it casually haha. I think it's worth especially when the base game goes on sale as it does!"
Positive,Better than WoW right now.
Positive,not enough game breaking exploits for me but ill still play it
Positive,"Pretty fun game, alot to do, just need to purchase the dlc.Good thing it comes with trading cards #finance"
Positive,One of the best games ever played
Positive,"As a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls series, I would absolutely recommend this game."
Positive,The real WoW (world of warcraft) killer.
Positive,"I'm definitely enjoying ESO so far. The MMO style combat is a bit simple, but not bad. The inventory and bank limits make it very difficult to do tradeskills, but the monthly premium features fix that issue. Unfortunately the launcher refuses to exit when closed and instead just breaks and you have to use Task Manager to close it properly. I absolutely have not played for 166 hours, I just keep forgetting to manually shut the launcher down ever time which is annoying."
Positive,"I was very hesitant to play ESO because I far prefer to play as a solo player as opposed to an MMORPG.  I'm really happy I took the plunge into the online version.  The game has an absolute ton of content, and I can happily play solo if I want, or I can join the rich online community.  I highly recommend any fans of the Elder Scrolls series try it out."
Positive,"I think it's important to note, that first off, I played this game on another account that I lost, but a good amount of my hours are still on PS4.Second off, Steam seriously needs a neutral option for reviews.Without further ado, let's get into this muck.Alright, so, to start this off with a bang, I want to talk about the game state, and community as a whole. ESO's community is very full, packed with tons of people that have a love for the Elder Scrolls all together. People in chat are generally self-aware within the game while making jokes about how the game is bad, or how it's a garbage game, not unlike league of legends, although the latter is quite true. The community itself is generally pretty open in comparison to other bigger MMOs like WoW or BDO. This is probably due to the fact that all they care about is having fun themselves, so they don't let negativity affect them as much. Now, obviously, this could be biased. I haven't interacted with absolutely everyone on the NA megaserver, but this is a review, so I'll be as bloody biased as I want. (not really, please stay)The game state itself isn't horrible, in comparison to what the reviews say. The game is overall an enjoyable game, that you can spend hours upon hours in without spending money. I think there are several drawbacks, however, to ZOS' current attitude towards the game. There are tons of minor bugs which, from what I've seen, have gone unfixed for years. On top of that, if you look at the Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood (Upgrade), it's essentially a scam (although the best term is misleading) for people that don't understand what it means; only 1 DLC, not the same as the collector's edition upgrade or the full $80 game. I feel if ZOS put as much effort as possible into listening to the community, this could be such an incredible MMO, even alongside giants like FFXIV, WoW, and OSRS. (even though OSRS has a pretty big glaring problem itself)Now, we can move on to the story. There's quite honestly, not a lot to say here, as the story is pretty simple. You're a hero, one who is needed to save the realm from Molag's Balls. The things that happen within the story are pretty interesting, but the story itself as a whole is a ""go forth, and kick the bad guy's ass mr. hero"" type story. In my opinion, the DLC stories are much better, and are consistent throughout them. They don't exactly make you feel too special either. You're just ""some dude who showed up at a pretty good time"". Overall, I'd say that if you grinded early classic WoW, the story will move at lightning speed, if not, just find a pace, and try to stick with it. Once you find a pace that feels good, you can run through it feeling comfortable.Over to the questing. This, in my opinion, is a part that could be improved upon a bit. That's mainly due to the fact that, when you're questing in the main game, you don't really feel, if that makes any sense. It feels as though you're just doing chores, and then all of a sudden, boom! A big bad appears. Now, how the hell did you get to this? Weren't you just gardening a minute ago? Or looking at that really nice house that's infinitely out of your price range because you just started a new character? I feel as though the story in the main story of ESO doesn't make you feel too attached to the people, or the world as a whole. Once again, I feel as though the DLC does this much better. Obviously, there are decisions you can make throughout the story, which I find is a great way to let people interact with the world; but if I go to some mountain, kill a guy who was ""a threat to the world"", only to find out that there's just a bigger ""threat to the world"" and that I need to go through that hell again? Come on, I think some variety would be cool. Things like missions that involve you getting involved with some of the trades in the game, encouraging people to check them out, or even quests that get you directly involved with dying. Even plain-old survival quests where you have to outlast something and you get saved. Variety in quests I think the fact that each region you go to having an independent story is good, and the overarching stories of a lot of them are amazing on the other hand. They give variation to the stories told, and you get to interact with each region, each person and learn stories about the world along the way. Too much variety can be bad, as it can skew the goal of the task, but if the a sweet spot is found, limitless possibilities open up.Now, we can move on to marketing. This, in my opinion, is the worst part about ESO; at least, on steam. The way they have set up everything with the DLCs is incredibly misleading, and can cause people to waste tons of money without knowing. It's awfully sketchy that there is no description for the upgrade, after all. It seems as though they're trying to make as much money as possible out of players, without concern for the damage it could do to the community. Other than that, I personally think the membership DLC function is great. It gives people that have played the game before the ability to rush through the story, on, say, another platform without having to buy all the DLCs. Obviously, in the long run, it's much more costly; but if you know the game, or know the limit of time you want to spend on the game, it's not bad at all, especially for the price. Say, if you dedicate 1 month to each DLC, or even 15 days to each, you're getting your money's worth.There's problem some stuff I left out, and some other stuff I got wrong. I might even come back to this later and change my review. As for now, I realistically don't recommend this game, but I also do. It's a situation where YMMV with your game experience. All in all, not a bad game, it's got a pretty good and pretty supportive community, and if you have free time (and money) it's worth a shot. I'd suggest waiting until a sale to get the game. Getting it as cheap as possible is obviously the best outcome anyways.alright, have a wonderful day lads, and stay safe"
Positive,i love this game and will not get tired of it beautiful and story rich
Positive,Tis good int it
Positive,Lots to do Fun game
Positive,"The community in this game is one of the most kind hearted and fun loving people i have seen in any MMO, makes the game or the more fun with trials, guilds, housing, dungeon runs, quests and chit chat.Also growing up with elder scrolls, this gives more points to those who love the lore"
Positive,"I came from playing World of Warcraft and skyrim for years to this because I loved both but wanted something with lore like skyrims and ESO did just that, it's an awesome game, whether you just like to take in the amazing scenes/views or join up with other people for dungeons etc, it's got something for everyone. I also love the fact that it doesn't stop you from going further if you want to do things solo, the only time you have to group up is for achievements/dungeons etc which I like because sometimes I want to cruise about at my own speed."
Positive,"I never thought, I would turn into an Elder-Scrolls-Fan but this game somehow made it happen and I'm not mad about it"
Positive,This game story are amazing
Positive,taking cat girl to a new level
Positive,"Stop spamming me with reviews a$$-0-'s, this is why mfer's are going to Epic Games. I have over 1500 hours in this b1znatch you think I like it?"
Positive,"The only issue with this game is that you have to use a vpn in order to connect to the server(in my and my friends cases anyway), and because of that the ping will be so bad that you can't even participate in any kind of group activity. other than that the game is awsome, graphics look good and the quests are so fun! the map is HUUUUUUGE and there are lots of cities and places to discover, lots of monsters to fight and lots of dungeons to explore!"
Positive,"This game is beautiful, well thought out, and story driven. It can be a little overwhelming just jumping in your first little bit, but once you grasp the basics, it's lots of fun to flesh out different systems in the game with your own style."

Positive,"My only wish for this game is for the devs to add a difficulty setting to the solo content. A majority of my hours in this game are spent questing, and I would absolutely love if I could have a debuff applied that would make me weaker and increase the xp/gold/currency/item rarity rewarded from the quests. I love the quests in this game, but the enemies in the overworld (including most world bosses at this point) just melt to the touch. This makes it very dull because I never feel like I am in danger.I love challenging solo content, and I think the game would benefit greatly if there was a difficulty setting. In theory I could just unequip my armor/ disable my champion points, but there would be no incentive to do it/reward for the harder content. It could be as easy as reducing my stats/damage output by a certain % and increasing xp/gold/rewards by a certain %. The player could go to a npc and set the difficulty for all quests, or potentially have it set at each quest giver, with the player having the option to have a default difficulty preference so you don't have to change it every time you start a quest.The biggest issue with this system that I can think of would be a person with an easy difficulty setting carrying another player with the high difficulty setting through content. I guess they could split up players in server shards based on difficulty preference, but logically the company would not want to mess up their servers any more than they have to. I am not a game dev and I don't have a good solution for that issue.TL;DR: it would be cool if they added a difficulty setting with increased rewards. Other than that, I love this game and strongly recommend it :)"
Positive,"I mean, I put 1K hours into this game, I'd obviously recommend"
Positive,"Played a bunch with max characters on the XBox first back in 2017, just recently downloaded it again in 2021 and its even better the 2nd time around!"
Positive,best game ever fro me top 5#
Positive,Coming from WoW I find this a nice change of pace.  The quests are all unique and not 'kill 25 of these'.  Fun and different enough to keep me going for a lot of hours.
Positive,pretty good game rate 8/10 pps :) :-Edit: after 1200+ more hours now its 9/10 pps :) :>
Positive,Well I've got 782 hours in the game and can honestly say I'm still enjoying it and still have lots of the game to explore and experience. They continue to update and improve the game. Provide engaging events for both PvE and PvP. Its definitely worth a try and community is always helpful to new people. Pretty sure its like $10 CAD on sale so pretty much a no brainer to give it a shot
Positive,"Hello.I have had Eso for near 1 year and I love it it's amazing! XDand now I just want to purchase the blackwood chapter.but under purchase box said it includes the base game, Blackwood, Greymoor, Elsweyr, Summerset, and Morrowind Chapters.I have those chapters+Base game already!Why should I buy them again?is there a way that I can buy just the blackwood chapter?!"
Positive,good game reminds me of my amazing taco
Positive,Its a really good game for those who love MMO
Positive,"It's da GOAT of games, better than World of Warcraft."
Positive,"Love this game, 10/10, i recommend harassing your brother into playing it too :)"

Positive,"Named my Argonian druid Identifies-wood, got to identify the wood of every gosh dang gamer in all of Tamriel."
Positive,"Gotta say, one of my favorite game franchise would be the elder scrolls. Very happy with how the game operates. From the dungeons to Trails and arenas, there is so much anyone can do. The player base is amazingly high and hardly full of toxic people. If your trying to find new friends to play with or just something new over all ESO is something I recommend."
Positive,I would quit my job to play this game full time if I could
Positive,It's got all your Elder Scrolls goodness. Recommended.
Positive,Tons of content. The questing is phenomenal. Very easy to solo and you can level at whatever pace you want.
Positive,why not just takes time :/
Positive,"Good gaming experience, loads of story lines, constant updates, and a pretty helpful community to interact with. ah and the tales of lusty argonian maid ;)"
Positive,Ive played on console since day one and just started on pc. I love this game. The pve side gets plenty love from the devs but honestly pvp is where its at. Just wish we would get more love on the PVP side and the game would be 10 out of 10. As of right now id give it 7 out of 10
Positive,"It's like playing Skyrim together with friends!  There are a couple of bugs that can limit enjoyment of playing together: (a) sometimes only one player in a group will hear dialog and (b) some interactable items that should be simultaneously usable but aren't.  Beyond this, I have genuinely enjoyed pretty much every aspect of the game.The combat system is simpler than Skyrim to an extent, in that it doesn't require precision aiming.  Several other things have been simplified as well, such as soul gems.  However, this is by far offset by the immense amount of content available.For best enjoyment on mid-to-low end PCs (or in general PCs with slow storage), I recommend setting VSync ON, which will improve load performance of resources and textures."
Positive,"Best MMORPG that doesnt require a sub or force you to AFK farm every second you are not at your pc just to be valid. You know like blessed unleashed or Black desert online. Only other game i can think of that is close to this games content and lack of greedy developers.. is Guild Wars 2.After more then 1k hrs invested. I am still enjoying the game, still have content to complete too. The game can be overwhelming. Just find a guild or guilds that work for you. Do not get overwhelmed by the DLC in the shop. I would focus on clearing all content and filling ""sticker books"" (item data base) of the content you have unlocked. Then do research on what gear you want. Get ESO + for a month or two.. farm the gear you want. then let the sub lapse. Do not have FOMO let the dlc/chapters unlock or become part of the eso plus sub.. do not chase them. So much gear is STILL valid despite ""meta"" peoples limited view points.\Vet dungeons / raids is where the skill and fun group content comes.PvP is lacking. tho it is still fun and enjoyable. Cryodil can be rough if not impossible if you are soloing. I Really love how you can take a break and come back and pick up where you left off.. you are not nerfed every time a new dlc comes out like in WoW, FF14 or SWTOR. Play what you want though.After 2k hours im still playing. Wish i had $$ for the necrom expansion. I will probably wait till its on sale tho like i did with High isle. So far i have only dropped $85 since 2021 (black wood chapter when i started playing again on PC). Not bad for all the story content and classes. Warden,necro, templar are by far my fav classes. But i am still learning and enjoying the others. try different sets of gear and dont be afraid to step out of meta pve/pvp. The game has given a lot of options to help fit different play styles."
Positive,Game worth buying
Positive,"Skyrim was always my all time favourite game so when I stumbled upon this, spent a good 800+ hours in a spawn of a few months. Safe to say it is addictive and fun to play."
Positive,"very good, maybe a little confusing"
Positive,better then wow
Positive,"Excellent lore, questing with voice acting, decent crafting."
Positive,"ESO is now my most played game on Steam. There is just so much to do and so many things to collect. Sure, it can very repeative sometimes, but I don't really mind. I love collecting everything!!! I would definitely recommend if you are into MMOs or just love collecting stuff."
Positive,"I'm not going to touch the eso shop or any of the cosmetic stuff. Every MMO on the market has one of those and you pay to get pretty things. There are tons of reviews where they cry about the ""grind"" and cry about the ""cash shop"" and cry ""ooh pay to win"". I do agree the ""lootbox lotto"" is a bit of a rip.My opinion is this game is fun, and a great way to wind down at the end of the day. I play this with my wife, brother, and daughter and we have done all the end game content with thousands of hours of play time. I love the game. Yes there are some detractors, some quests are generic and grindy, some dialog is really cringy, but overall this game is the number one game in my opinion. I've tried most other mmos and I always come back to this one. The graphics are top notch, if you have the hardware for it, which I do. The expansions for the most part have been really good, especially the last 3 expansions. The end game content has the perfect level of difficulty. The developers keep making more content to keep us engaged. And this content in my opinion is really good. Also there are ingame events that take place periodically to add to the fun. Overall in my opinion this is the best MMO out there and my go to for gaming."
Positive,"This game has morphed into my ""comfort"" game. Whenever I tire playing other games or get the MMO itch this is the one I come back to. I have played most other big MMOs out there and would consider myself a veteran and I can without a doubt say this is now ""Home"" for me.What I Like (PROs):Tamriel is an amazing world!Elder Scrolls Lore! Aedra, Daedra, Dragons, a massive library of well written Quests that are based in Elder Scrolls Lore famous from the single player games!Decent Graphics for an MMO especially in the newer Zones.Mostly friendly and helpful community with whom you can tackle group content but If you're an introvert there are loads of Solo Content waiting for you like Delves, Arenas and you can solo Dungeons as well if you have the skill and gear!You can experiment with class/weapon/guild specific skills and aren't locked out of playing melee or caster just because you picked a cerain class. But this can be a double edged sword, more on that in my CONS...CONs:because everyone can do (nearly) everything it lacks a bit of ""class fantasy"". For example there are builds out there that solely rely on weapon and guild skill lines making your class specific skills take a back seat. As someone who likes his class more fleshed out this is not optimal.Combat in this game is not for everyone. Sure as long as you level up and are playing mostly solo and normal dungeons it doesn't matter much. But as soon as you delve deeper into the mechanics of the game and progress to vet dungeons and trials ""animation cancelling"" becomes a must. Coming from WoW and GW2 I needed some time to adjust and practice to pull decent DPS in this game but I managed.I see how it's not to everyones taste though as it requires effort and practice to pull off to be competetitive. Also it makes your Character jerk around and it doesn't look cool.But this shouldn't distract from the fact that this is an amazing MMO well worth your time. You really have to try it for yourself to decide."
Positive,"This game is a lot of fun. At times, it is not intuitive but there are tons of guides for new players such as myself. I am really enjoying it."
Positive,"You can get lost in this game forever with all the expansions that have come out if you were an original fan of Skyrim-type games. Really enjoying it, and was well worth getting it while the sale was going on."
Positive,"Best MMO out right now, imo."
Positive,"Flexible character development, intriguing storylines! I especially like the assumption that you, the PC, are a hero.  Really fun and addictive game!"
Positive,I should have played this sooner.
Positive,"My first impressions of this game are good! I'm having lots of fun, and the scenery, quests and everything so far, has been good. If you're a fan of Skyrim, then give this a try. It is more of a RPGMMO, rather than MMORPG. There are MMO aspects, but I mostly play this game alone for that RPG experience."
Positive,"It's my favorite MMORPG at the moment.  The combat is action-oriented.  The story is actually interesting.  It's an Elder Scrolls game, of course, so familiarity with the lore already gives you some buy-in to the story and the world.  It plays really well with a controller, which I prefer to a mouse and keyboard nowadays for most games."
Positive,"Game is awesome, player interaction is alot better than most mmo's, exploration feels like a top notch single player rpg. so far so good!"
Positive,"talking lizards are a staple of tes culture, and i like them. the lizards, not the culture."
Positive,A wonderful experience of MMO. An open and easily adaptable environment.
Positive,Great for helping to spend time while waiting for TES 6!
Positive,if skyrim and diablo had a child it would be called Elderscrolls. a strange hybrid of them both and i recommend having as many friends possible to get further in the game because playing Solo is gonna take loads more time to get the good stuff.
Positive,"The amount of content in this game is literally obscene, I've been playing this game for almost a year and I STILL haven't completed all the zones and story quests. One of the biggest bangs for your buck I've ever seen. The world is huge and there's always something to do. As a plus it's by far one of the nicer player experiences I've been a part of, second only to early Runescape, and as I play on the NA server I've heard that the EU server is even friendlier."
Positive,"PROS:lots of cool fashion and character customizability.Well-thought out zones and a great experience for learning the various cultures of The Elder Scrolls worlds in a very immersive wayFun and interesting boss battles, dungeons, and trials.cool armor/weapon sets, and lots of them,  a hundred or so, at least. Enables lots of different playstyles.nifty level rewards,  well-thought out.LOTS of quests.  Agruably too many, in the capital of each faction, at times.  Everywhere else is less demanding of adventures here there and everywhere--but that does help sell the liveliness and bustle of a major capital quite well.(I could go on, but I must sleep.)CONS:Doing zones out of a particular order may result in having repeat characters pretend you did things you haven't yet, or seem to have amnesia regarding meeting you before.If you want to look cool, and have lots of cool stuff, and to reduce grinding, be prepared to at minimum get the Plus Membership, if not various crown packs as well.  (Yes, you can look cool without it. It will just take a long time and lots of loot-getting and style-learning. Yes, you can manage inventory without it..  but gold for bag and bank upgrades...  may be a mild to moderate annoyance, depending on your patience, and loot-hoarding tendencies. Yes, you can still level up quickly...  using daily login rewards, crafting quests, and double xp events as your means to do so.  Being in a guild/learning the training trait will also help.)"
Positive,"This game is one of the best mmo's out there, your time feels valued and the combat feels very familiar whilst being nothing like anything you've seen before. The story is there if you want it and with incredible voice acting from people like John Cleese and Bill Nighy the game feels deep and enriched. I've never really cared for elder scrolls lore until this game, it really give a new perspective especially if you come from games like Skyrim or Oblivion. The game really opens up after level 50 it's such a shame it take so long for the new players to see what the game truly has to offer. 2000+ hours on console here's to the next 2000 on pc."
Positive,"I played this game when it first launched and it was decent, but lacking the element to retain players and was too far off the traditional Elder Scrolls formula.However, after burning myself out with New World I decided to give it another chance while already knowing it's not going to be Skyrim Online. That's when the game really shined. The sheer size of the PvE zones and build malleability already offers enough to grip you for 200 hours easily, especially with the new armory system allowing you to change your build on the fly.It's worth to mention though ESO is a different MMO, in the sense that it doesn't push you ever forward, and there isn't so much of a push to reach end-game as there is in WoW or New World. ESO shines on vast horizontal content that can be done at any order, tons of group activities and a robust social system to rival that of FFXIV."
Positive,Quite the time eater
Positive,Good game for spent ur time with something.
Positive,"Best MMORPG game ever, love the graphics , open world concept, many cool outfits and mount to buy, game play is great, beginner friendly, love the trading in game, dungeons & fighting!"
Positive,This review is just for Nominating badge XDD
Positive,its destiny but medieval
Positive,this game will give you a reason to live. but only so your reason to live is to play ESO. annoying wife? child? fucking two german shepard puppies???? get ESO you can build your dream life and forget about your shitty life. excuse me my dogs are body slamming each other
Positive,"As a long time TES fan, I was excited for ESO when it was announced. And was it bad at launch? Yes. But after many years of listening to fans and changing how the game works, Zenimax has crafted a game which it open to everyone, even non-TES players, and has created a rich and wonderful world with compelling gameplay."
Positive,Make an SEA server.
Positive,"Finished the tutorial, looking good so far."
Positive,Wish I could invest more time into this game. Why didn't I start playing this sooner ;~;
Positive,"its good mayne, just buy and play already"
Positive,My boyfriend hates the day I started playing this game!
Positive,Easy to get into and hard to master game has tons of content and you will never run out of things to do. You can play the game in tons if different ways making very repayable and the game has tons if dlc to get a new story and over all games very fun
Positive,"Apart from a very mediocre combat mechanics, the rest really deserves recognition.  A large number of quests, storylines and a huge world with deep lore. Great music and a decent visuals. Really solid experience even when playing solo."
Positive,I wanna play it again but just can't cuz my inventory is full... FeelsSadMan
Positive,The best MMORPG after the New World
Positive,Khajit has wares
Positive,Ton of fun! You can play this game however you want so no need to worry about grinding if you don't want to.
Positive,"Absorbing, great after-work activity."
Positive,"There's so much to do in this game, from the very rich lore to the battles in Cyrodiil. You will not get bored playing this game Solo and you can enjoy it even more with friends (those that have compromise to play with you). I have spent 421 hours, but let me tell you that if my friends returned to this game, I'll more than likely put double the amount."
Positive,"If you like the Elder Scrolls background and lore, the large world with fully voiced decently written quests should keep you busy for quite a while.Restrictions for non-subscribers are not too bad - the inventory limitations are the only thing that's really annoying, but if you are not a compulsive looter like me, it should be OK.Mechanics and gameplay are decent, though nothing overly innovative/special.""Endgame"" is OKish.TLDRWorth it for some casual questing through the storyline and various regions."
Positive,Best mmo you can solo. Devs are always adding new useful content.
Positive,"If i were to describe my relationship with this game by kill/marry/fuck, i would choose them all."
Positive,very good 10/10
Positive,"Good: story, voice acting, visuals, gameplay, social aspect.Bad: worst inventory management i have seen for a while"
Positive,"good game, has the actor for albus dumbledore from the harry potter movies to voice the prophet, kinda pog ngl"
Positive,If u played other elder scrolls u will like this
Positive,"Tried it once, got hooked for a week bought the DLCs while still subscribing to the bag, cause now I'm addicted. Elder Scrolls Online is a story rich game with interesting dungeon game design, where you can build whatever you want, explore, customize to your heart's content, good for solo, much better with friends, one of the best MMO games I've played."
Positive,yes iz gud gaem xd
Positive,"Neat game. Just wish the jumping wasn't so jank, but you'll get used to it fast. Cool community and awesome characters and voice acting! :D I love the Argonian bookworm Not-Really-Here."
Positive,Good game. I have friends now. they buy dlc me
Positive,Uh 79.4 hours in 2 weeks pretty much says more than words...that's how long I played in my first two weeks.  The graphics and interactions are very well done.  Definitely recommend.
Positive,Its not bad
Positive,Skyrim on steroids with other players .Whats not to like about this game ?. The fact that it runs well on an older low spec machines is a bonus .
Positive,The intricate and numerous story lines woven through each zone draws you in. You truly feel the champion's story arch in unique situations requiring your mind and your skill. The artwork is gorgeous. It blows my mind how many voice actors were paid to sing songs for random NPC's to play just to create ambiance. Simply beautiful.
Positive,"Lots of content, sometimes hard which means grinding etc. But it's worth it. As someone who is fairly new to this, O'm still learning about stuff. Definitely recommend this game."
Positive,Better than New World....
Positive,WOW way better than WOW
Positive,Fun game have never played it untill now after friends dragged me into it as a gift XDand it really is good.reminds me of old PS2 game called champions of Norath
Positive,Its really good
Positive,Yes.My pet goat got demonic glowing red eyes due to the Halloween event.
Positive,"the name of the game is diversity, no matter what race and/or class you choose, you can still choose to be anything in the role trinity (damage, tank, healer) that you prefer, not to mention the magnificent lore of the ES series in general"
Positive,"Just shy of 100 hours, I'm enjoying the game, as of November 2021 The community is generally very nice and easy to talk to, gameplay is subjective it's an mmo, stories are good and voice acting if generally steller, without any DLC there's plenty within the game, I'm not even a 3rd of the content in an I have yet to pay for anything, so that's about 300-500 hours of content without paying beyond the cost of the game. At a stage f my life where I am suffering long term sickness off work, the game and community have been great for my mental health"
Positive,"1000+ hours on console200+ on dedicated ZoS launcherWorld is massive, graphics are nice, combat isn't tab-target BS, grind isn't absolutely horrendous thanks to Patch 34.literally thousands of hours of content in here, everything is voice acted. Character customization is unmatched, Build freedom is 1776 USA, this game is a crack cocaine addiction"
Positive,"MMO skyrim, skill trees are nice."
Positive,pretty good mmo give it a go if its on sale
Positive,"good chill mmo for sweaty and casual players alike, you will never run out of content playing this game either"
Positive,really fun especially the events
Positive,"Greatly improved since launch.  If you like lore, this MMO is great."
Positive,i liked it. its a vibe and a great escape from reality
Positive,this is by far one of the best games i have ever played on pc. it has been a little over 15 years since i have been on a pc i went and bought one just a week ago and this is the first game i downloaded i absolutely love it!!!
Positive,"I like magic wands, magic potions that enhance my attributes (specifically my stamina), magic spells and high elves with big pointy ears so yeah you could say I really like this game. But I also dislike this game because my elf girlfriend dumped me when she found I didn't have ESO Plus. Her name is Alfred and we had a good thing together but ESO Plus ruined it! Damn you ZeniMax!! We would take walks on the shores of Auridon, drinking wine until the moons went down... wow those nights were enchanting"
Positive,"In some ways this game is a scam.  If you consider being able to pay money to level faster paying to win, then this game is pay to win.  Even after spending $60 USD on the base game, and after purchasing all chapters each of also which cost $60, I still have limited bag space, which is a huge pain, given all the materials needed to craft.  One of the most annoying things about the game is when I purchase a chapter, I also have to purchase extra DLC to run dungeons within the chapter.  I am giving this a thumbs up because I have had many enjoyable hours from it with my family but had I known how much of a money sink this game would be, I would have stayed away from it."
Positive,"Without a doubt one of the best rpg/mmo games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. With that said it is not to be compared to other elder scrolls games such as skyrim or oblivion. The freedom of choice in the matter of wich you proceed through the game is not as varying. I mean to say that if you are into deep lore and story telling then the quests in this game are not that satisfying (they are good/fun/intriguing don't get me wrong). But you wont get the same depth since alot of it will be ""my brother went down into this cave"" quests.When it comes to the leveling system though it's absolutely wonderful with champion points and whatnot. Reminds me a bit of games like Path of exiles in the way you progress through tree like points to reach your sought after focus. And the fact that basically any class can be made into whatever you want it to be, tank, healer, damage is such a brilliant idea.Not to mention the crafting! Very much fun! Since this is basically one of my favorite parts of the game! Not to hard and complicated to learn and understand but not to easy to not make it satisfying to advance in your skills.That's pretty much my PVE view of the game. I dont really play alot of PVP so I can't say that much about it other than for the little that I have done it, it has definently urge me to give it another go. The open world battlegrounds of Cyroldiil are really fun since it mixes the aspect of both PVE and PVP players. Bottomline, fantastic game."
Positive,Fantastic story and gameplay!
Positive,First time on PC and this the first game I get :))) I love it!!!
Positive,molag bal touched me
Positive,Love playing with friends anywhere.
Positive,"its stuck on loading screen , what do i do?"
Positive,"It's pretty alright, I guess."
Positive,"I've only logged a little over 1,000 hours, but this is easily my favorite MMO. So much to do, so much to see. So what's wrong with taking the back streets? You'll never know if you don't go, you'll never shine if you don't glow."
Positive,I think over 600 hours means I like this game lol. So much better if you find a wonderful guild and friends to play with :)I have made some amazing friends through this game and we still play together after all these years :) I recommend :P
Positive,This game has a variety of options on how you can play/create your character and you are not locked into you first or any choice. Plenty of things to do in the game too.
Positive,"- ""Dragons? In your own homwland? What are you going to do?""- ""This one does not know but he hopes his family is safe in Riverhold"""
Positive,Cocaine is less addictive. Cant stop. First mmorpg I look forward to playing every day.
Positive,"This game is, imho,- Enjoyable enough."
Positive,i like chicken
Positive,295 hours in and still don't know what I'm doing.EDIT: 1900 hours and have a vague idea of what im doing.EDIT 2: 2500 hours and i have a loose grasp on what im doing.
Positive,it is a game form my childhood and to show you haw much i like it i have had it on this account for four days
Positive,Amazing experience! Been playing MMORPGs for a long time and this feels very fresh. I love the freedom in choosing the weapons and classes.
Positive,As a Skyrim fan this game was pretty refreshing. I have played it days straight before and talked about the game to many friends.
Positive,Just really nice Elder Scrolls World
Positive,I finally get to hear about the High Elves.9/10
Positive,"Looking for Adult Only Guild, that allows marijuana smoking and Bourbon consumptions"
Positive,"It's an MMO so that should tell you everything.The difference is that it isn't horribly obnoxious or complicated, as many MMOs tend to be.The Elder Scrolls Online takes the Elder Scrolls world and makes it like World of Warcraft. The key difference is that it doesn't absolutely BEG you to spend hundreds of dollars to keep a subscription alive. There is ESO Plus, which gives infinite crafting inventory and other goodies, but nothing too serious. I've heard it's worth paying for, but I survive without it just fine.Combat is really fun, with monsters scaling based on your level so you aren't going to wander into a level 1,000 Dremora and get smacked when you're level 2. I tend to go more toward the Magic build, but swords and bows are just fine as well.Crafting is hard and I still don't get it, but I survive by looting better items from corpses and from quest rewards. It's basically like Skyrim in that regard.Playing with others is preferable too, since you can do the major raids/dungeons and get really cool stuff. There's tons of starter guilds that work together to smack dragons and/or various other baddies every day. Ok, annoyances. The inventory is limited, and the gear you get is kinda bad sometimes. Leveling up things isn't explained too well, and the various crafting mechanics aren't explained at all. The shop is mostly not worth looking at, and you'll basically be walking in blind to various mechanics 99% of the time. Luckily it isn't as complicated as, say, Black Desert. Most of it is just ""point and attack"", with some abilities sprinkled in. Overall a really fun game. Perfect for Elder Scrolls fans.  Yea"
Positive,Elsweyr was the best expansion no kap
Positive,I think it is well worth the $20
Positive,love this game. fun exploring everything.
Positive,kool game but armor design hurts my eyes
Positive,Addicting in the way most bethesda games are! Play at your own risk!
Positive,"Great game, but allow PS4 to PC transfer plsssss"
Positive,Hands down the best way to explore the exciting land of Tamriel by yourself or with your friends!
Positive,Is fun and chill. No need to invest lots of time in it.
Positive,One of the few MMOs out there where the good stuff starts once you create your character.- The questing is awesome and fully voice acted.- Dungeons and trials are very enjoyable and not too linear.- The different ways you can build your character is even more sophisticated than Skyrim.- Lore-heavy if you're a fan of the TES franchise- Total freedom to explore areas with no specific order. Feeling like a true TES game.The combat is hit or miss though. You either enjoy animation cancelling or you hate it.
Positive,This game is awesome.  Plenty of fun activities and quests.  The combat is excellent and there are people people people everywhere!Guilds take the game to the next level.  I recommend joining at least a couple ( you can belong up to five).  The game is still expanding.  Always new lands to explore.  Come join me!
Positive,"I have known this series since my very childhood, and this particular one was not as appealing to me when it first came out. I played Skyrim, Morrowind, and Oblivion. The enjoyment of those games, I thought, could only be achieved in a single player game. But it turned out to be a false point of view. After Six years since its launch, I have finally decided to give it a try, and this is how my first 80 hours if gameplay started. I really enjoy it and want to dive in it more and more day after day, touching that series' world and feeling it as it were your own. It does really fulfill its purpose as a game and as an Elder Scrolls game. I wish, more of us, TES fans, would know that"
Positive,y e s
Positive,"litty mcgitty, much to do"
Positive,WHATS THIS? EPIC ADVENTURES AND DUNGEONS WITH GUILDS AND A GREAT COMMUNITY?!?! This must be heaven 0.0
Positive,"Very fun! I waited on this game for awhile because i'm not super keen on mmorpgs, but this one plays JUST like ES5! Very much enjoying the game."
Positive,The game can be enjoyed solo or with friends. So much to explore with the best voice acting. If your tired of playing skyrim then its a good mix up. Being a mmorpg certain things you can no longer get away with. Like reloading on a failed pick pocket or adjusting the difficulty and rage murder the world. You can try which keeps up with the freedom of elder scrolls but know you take responsibility this time. I can not recommend the game enough but its best to be enjoyed with a friend. Plug in a 360 controller and have a good old time.
Positive,"This game is amazing, 10/10.I will warn you though, it's so good that it becomes very addicting and will eat your life away. I had a wife and 2 kids, did not feed them because I would sit in my office all day fighting Molag Balls, they are unfortunately not with us as of the writing of this review due to severe starvation. At least I can still spam biting jabs in battlegrounds :)P.S: All jokes aside, really good and I would recommend to anyone, I also played on Xbox before with MUCH more hours."
Positive,"One of the best MMO's out there in my view. Character depth and customization, HUGE map, great dlc, seemingly decent community, and just overall most bang for buck without a monthly sub. There is something for everyone and public events feel like people involved. I've tried many MMO's but this one feels the most alive."
Positive,"At the very basic level it is like every other MMO out there, ability spam being the main thing, but that is right up my alley. I enjoy playing this more than any other MMO (besides Destiny) because it's super smooth and I already know a ton of Elder Scrolls Lore. There is so many skills and things you can do in the game that I can always find something new and exciting to keep me entertained."
Positive,Enjoyable and adventurous.
Positive,so in love with this . I dreamed about playing it again last night . I think its safe to say I like this game
Positive,Love the housing - wish they would allow more items per house.../hint hint hint
Positive,"Pretty fun and basic mmo for people who love the elder scrolls. I, personally, LOVE the crafting system. Exploring for materials in the way the game has it set up is just really relaxing."
Positive,It just works.
Positive,"All my friends hate me for playing this game but I still play it, it's that gooood. lol"
Positive,"It is a fun mmo, it made me develop a taste for mmo's as well as World of Warcraft. Now for the serous matter, buy Garfield Furious racing for £10-12, now thats a deal. But i would recommend get elder scrolls online, but get in on pc, console version can get in the bin."
Positive,"If you're looking for a Traditional MMO, with tab targeting, then this isnt the game you seek. That said however, I think its one of the best Action MMOs out there at the moment, enough to compete with Guild Wars 2. Nice diversity of races, with unique passive traits, and several classes to choose from, all that can be played in several different ways.Story is great. Combat is fluid, pvp can be a bit broken sometime, but overall a fun time. All content, including side quests is fully voice acted, and well done too if I might add.The community isnt the worse, but it can be pretty toxic, especially to low levels. Highly recommend joining a new player friendly guild, and getting jumpstarted with info!~"
Positive,It's very addicting with so much to do and so much content. The dungeon designs are genius .... great game :D
Positive,Take my money
Positive,"I like it for what it is, a one time fee MMO. kinda odd but feels like a ESO Game."
Positive,"Character making is so nice, only played it for couple hours but if you keep playing you can be one of the cool guys with cool stuff over thousands of levels and i think it's all worth it."
Positive,Nice game with plenty of options and quests
Positive,"Jelikož tento profil se mi zdá moc ""suchý"", přidávám recept na výborný Hospodský vepřový guláš, jako od babičky!Cibuli očistíme a nakrájíme na kostičky.

Positive,michael made me quit
Positive,"If your a fan of the Elder Scrolls series, this game is for you. If you're a fan of MMO's with unique combat, this game is for you. If you're looking for Skyrim online, this game is not for you. While this is a great game it's missing those mechanics and features you've seen in Skyrim. This game has spoiled me with all of the voice acting which isn't common in most MMO's that I've played. It is so easy to get heavily invested in the world and the quests, even the random side quests you might pickup along the way."
Positive,I put on my robe and wizard hat.
Positive,"very good, very addicting and not rage inducing <3"
Positive,its a very fun game but i wish the powers would be better
Positive,Hehe I am Cat Persom
Positive,Playing with my husband and we're loving it so far :)
Positive,"I love this game, I'm more of a single player gamer and love the story and exploration aspect of the game, the lore is really well written, with immersive ambient and a really nice character-building system, it is worth it, the only thing that I don't like is that some regions are locked and you have to buy it and it is apart from the DLC that uses the premium currency but, I get it, they have to make money to keep the game running, I respect it."
Positive,"I recommend this game but I feel I need to give a warning despite that. I only recommend if you plan on getting ESO+ and you aren't vulnerable to compulsive spending or manipulative marketing tactics. I would definitely not recommend this game for children.The monetization in this game is aggressive and shady. There are premium items (mounts, player housing, pets) for sale in their microtransaction store that cost as much as the game itself. There is a slot machine mechanic (loot boxes) that they of course give you some free rolls to try and hook you. Also inventory space is extremely limited unless you get the subscription. Trying to play with the base inventory space they give you is extremely difficult, and you will likely be throwing out items left and right just to have enough inventory to keep playing.So yeah, it's a fun game, but it's also subconsciously pressuring you to spend money constantly to either improve the experience or remove inconveniences that exist just to rent you the fix for it. Honestly I didn't even feel the need to talk about the gameplay or community because I really felt like the most defining thing about this game is it's monetization and business model. It's sad that my takeaway from this game was ""wow, if I want a mount that's not a horse it's 10-20 bucks!"" and not ""Vvardenfell is just as cool as I remember! These quests are great!"" because that's praise I could actually give this game. But instead it's overshadowed by ""Shit, I need to throw out more alchemy ingredients so I have room to do more dungeons with my friends"" then having about double bag space dangled in-front of you with a monthly subscription attached."
Positive,"good game. I was addicted all week for free. the community is very orderly. Except for the haters, angry at new players in their early days in guilds or daily group activities.I think it is a good recommended game to play with friends, try to find one. I like to play alone and the work to get: resources, experience, gold and equipment was quite heavy.As a new player, your character customization is overwhelming, so much so that you can spend hours searching for your tastes. This test greatly increased my expectations of purchasing the game.score 6/10Recommended if you have nothing to do and are a lover of reading and exploration."
Positive,Great graphics and very interactive gameplay.
Positive,FUS RO DAH!
Positive,Elder Scrolls: Molag Bal's Massive Erection
Positive,i like it it's like if you want to play an mmo without being a total sweat
Positive,If you're looking for something different than World of Warcraft then this is your go to!
Positive,love picking mushrooms. :D
Positive,"Honestly, this game is so amazing and immersive! The community is friendly and helpful and the story quests are absolute perfection"
Positive,"no bugs, very fun, low specs, easy to play with friends (like i have any)"
Positive,ESO is a awesome TES-themed MMORPG and i rly enjoyed it. I wanna thank the team that created this art of piece! <3Hugs to y'all!!
Positive,One of the best modern mmorpg games
Positive,Killing people costs less than teleporting
Positive,cash shop is ridiculously stupid for a game you already pay for + a monthly subscription. But I guess gameplay/world is atleast worth an upvote
Positive,"the download is absolute aids, but other than that, good game"
Positive,Great graphics and game play.  The world is immersive and I really am enjoying the dialog with NPCs.
Positive,nice mmo quit my job and played this game with my uncle from wake to sleep for 6 months straight gained 47 ibs and smelled really bad but id do it again no questions asked
Positive,"an never-ending storieeeeeeeee do do doo do do doo do do doo, no seriously there's so much to do from changing the colours of both your shoes to questing and messing. looting and scooting across the map. its and extremely fun and is for everyone give this games ago and you will know."
Positive,"I only have a few hours in it, but it’s all right I guess."
Positive,"This game is amazing  , the elder scrolls experience"
Positive,"I rate this game 11/10 for the lore, story and gameplay. However, the match-making for daily pledges/dungeons can be very tilting and frustrating, queue time and toxic teammates.  I bought most of the DLC's for this game and I have no regrets. This game gets my recommendation !"
Positive,"I'm not sure why I neglected this game for so long. If you enjoy the Elder Scrolls series then you will most likely find this game extremely pleasant. However, don't go into this game expecting it to be Skyrim 2.0, because that's not what this game is trying to accomplish. I only have a few minor complaints, and they all have to do with the crown store. I really wish that there were more prestigious items to earn through actual gameplay rather than crowns. You can earn a lot of the cosmetic armor/weapon sets through gameplay but as far as I know mounts are only obtainable through the purchase of crowns. I don't really agree with this system and I hope that they can start introducing mounts as drops in the future.Aside from that, I do thoroughly enjoy this game. I purchased it back upon release but never really put to many hours into it. I can easily see that the developers have effortlessly poured countless updates and DLCs into this game which has made it a great MMO to play in 2021. I feel like I could sink thousands of hours into this game and barely scratch the surface.10/10 would recommend."
Positive,"I have over 2,500 hours into Black Desert Online which I love for it's huge open world (no loading screens between areas), amazing graphics, character creation, style and great combat. Whilst I think ESO actually looks quite good graphically and the voiced NPC's are great I'm not willing to commit to putting in serious hours into ESO due to the points below:1) The combat is REALLY clunky (especially coming from Black Desert Online and even coming from playing Bless Unleashed). 2) The loading screens between areas and entering buildings really break immersion and don't give me the sense that I'm playing in a true open world. 3) Just a couple of hours into playing on a new character tonight I ran out of inventory space. Whilst I totally understand managing inventory is a thing in MMO's, having to do it so soon is just not fun (and I'm not into the idea of paying a subscription to free up my inventory, did that with Fallout 76 for 12 months and I still feel feel ripped off to this day).  I've uninstalled ESO (for the second time) but I'm still giving it a thumbs up as I don't think it's a bad game, it's just not for me!"
Positive,"It's really easy to recommend this game. If you like MMOs you are going to like it. If you like singleplayers like  I do, you are going to like it.The combat system is way better than Skyrim.You can still play on first person.You can play with controllers.Each area has its own story. And every quest is memorable, quest are not like any other mmo you need to farm and that's all. You can keep playing just doing quests and forgetting the need of needing exp. You can just have fun.Characters are memorable, and they return during your playthrough. They are not npcs that you find them just one time. Their story evolve and the game reminds you of the consequence of your adventure.Decisions matter in this game, and you can see how the story progress.Each class is unique, Each class can play as DPS, Healer or Tank. There are some classes that are better as healer etc if you want to go with other people. But if you play alone, it does not matter which class you play, everything is useful.You can use every weapon, you can use every armor, like in skyrim. You can be a mage with two handed weapon, tanking. It's really fun.You can play with controller!Everything is voice acted!The map is huge and there are so many interesting places.The game works very well, they did a very good job to optimize the game.You can play the game absolutely alone, and  if you have the last chapter, Blackwood, you can get a companion. In other words, the game was made to play it alone or with other peoples.The music is fantastic!Only BIG difference with others Elder Scrolls, it's that there is not the same feeling while exploring. Everything feel more connected and close. Also enemies respawn faster.Absolutely fantastic!edit:09/20/21After finishing the main story (Covenant) and also doing a bit of others quest, the game is fantastic. The music, the atmosphere etc. Only problem is that character emotions are sometime over the top. Or they are the best of the best or they are the worst of the cowards. I don't mind much because the game wants to target any age.I'm having fun! And I'm still have to finish the other two stories."
Positive,this is one of the biggest games i have ever played its amazing if you like fantasy i love this game because you can travel anywhere and conquer this is a great game if you like to have your own stuff ot has magic as well
Positive,"shit ton of unending content, would recommend 10/10"
Positive,best game ever
Positive,Good story writing. All dialog voice acted.Mediocre combat mechanics.Nothing bad.
Positive,What can I say.... I love it and hate it at the same time!
Positive,"Great game if you like questing in MMO's, elder scrolls lore is always entertaining and all expansions and DLCs are great and further the lore perfectly (Unlike other MMO's I've played), combat is a bit weird and takes some getting used to but it's great fun doing vet dungeons and trials once you've learned. Only negative thing I can say about this game is trading, I prefer a simple trading system like in GW2 and AH from wow, the trading in ESO is complicated and hard to get into. Cheers"
Positive,"I get clowned on my friends for playing this game, but it's way worth it. ESO is one of the greatest MMORPG's I have ever played. There are many classes and races you can choose from at the start of the game which opens a world of exploration and adventure. If you like games where the PvE scales to your level, youre going to really enjoy it. Although It can seem quite non-rewarding at times due to the scaling and certain quests, it makes up for it in the immense amount of quests, boss-fights, and the map sizes. If you are hesitating purchasing the game, I recommend you give it a shot, if you enjoy it ESO+ is a monthly subscription you can purchase which grants you access to a crafting bag which lightens your inventory space incredibly; access to the dlc's in the crown store, and bonus crowns every month which allows you to spend them on what-ever you want!"
Positive,"As a fan of the Elder Scrolls franchise I am very pleased by this game.  To me it feels just like another Elder Scrolls game but with MMO elements.  I wish I played sooner but noticing the crown store made me second guess, however now that I play I notice there is no P2W or game breaking elements to the store.If you are a new player I recommend just getting the base game and trying it out, if you like it sign up for ESO plus so you can access most of the DLC and crafting bag (so you don't have crafting materials bogging you down).  I been playing for 300 hours and haven't spent a dime outside of the subscription."
Positive,A little change up from your go-to Elder Scrolls but it is awesome that Tamriel can be accessed in one place. Still settling in to all the basics but just like any Elder Scrolls.... there is always room to expand and explore.
Positive,"I absolutely love ESO. I have close to 1,000 hours on PS4 and it's even better on PC. The only problem was I couldn't just switch my PS4 character and progression over to PC. Oh well, I started over. NBD I don't need my big Arteum mansion anymore, I guess...I recommend the game, but there is one big caveat- The community for this game is absolute trash. They are the most elitist pieces of crap to be found in an MMO. One bad pull in a dungeon and they will kick you. Not high enough CP at the beginning of dungeon you get kicked. Never done the dungeon: kicked. No death run rewards encourage this kind of bad behavior. The game has tons of content you can do alone or just kind of teaming up with people out in the world, but doing dungeons and trials leaves a lot to be desired from a terrible community full of terrible people."
Positive,"Other then the really crappy super limited amount of storage space and clunky combat mechanics. I have nothing else bad to say about the game so far. It is eye candy galore. After playing many more hours I still pretty much feel the same about the game. Combat is clunky AF, the 2 skill bars having to swap between them while using WASD and use 1-5 keys on pc keyboard just sucks. Also you need sub or be a wallet whale 🐳 to spend thousands of dollars on DLC content.  EVERYTHING in this game comes at a premium price tag. This game is monetized like a mobile gotcha game. I used to have massive love and respect for Bethesda as a developer and game company but playing ESO has shattered those delusions. I still enjoy playing the game thanks to friends that gifted me some of the DLC content and the blackwood expac. I know that when reading my criticisms people my think I do not like the game but that is far from true. I just want better from the triple A gaming company Bethesda. I do not want Bethesda to turn into a triple F mobile gotcha game company."
Positive,easy going game
Positive,"Coming from WoW, I fell in love with this game once I got a handle on controls. It is immersive and realistic, and so huge that I feel like I will never run out of things to explore."
Positive,10 / 10!
Positive,"Much fun, game is full of quests to the point that ive never gotten close to finishing them across both PS4 and now PC. First and third person bot work well and have full functionality unlike many MMORPGs. If you enjoy elder scrolls and combat like Skyrim or Oblivion you will enjoy this game."
Positive,"I'd recommend the game, but wouldn't advise to putting too many hours into it. There's not a lot of gathering, and if you're new to the game, then you'll probably put in too many hours just trying to figure out what to do or where to go. Game is alright to pass an hour or two if you've got no other game to play."
Positive,"after nearly 2000 hours of play Ive found that there is just so much to do, even without the dlc and eso plus you could sink an ungodly number of hours into this game, I would recommend it even to someone who prefers solo play as its absolutely possible to enjoy the game without the multiplayer nessesary content"
Positive,Real time Skyrim
Positive,Best MMO-RPG right now!
Positive,BEST MMO RPG
Positive,Simply one of the most beautiful games I have ever played! A breathtaking beauty. Everything about this game is stunning!
Positive,This game is addictive to me. I absolutely love it. Always something to do whether questing or just exploring in the world.
Positive,TASTE!! Is a matter of opinion. I for one like the game wish I have got it when it came out . I love story and questing games!I like playing with friends and meeting new ones. i am old as dirt but still gaming. Rock OWN.
Positive,"============| This is The Champion of Non-WoW MMO in my opinion |===============If you don't like Subscribing to play a MMO, then this is the best choice for you. ALL you need just buy the game (I suggest to buy on Summer/Winter Sales) then you can grind up to max level, learn how the game work. If you need a Subscribe for this game, it just to unlock ALL DLC Content and another minor benefit like more % EXP, etc.Pros :Once you learn all the mechanic of the game, you can choose which DLC that you must owe, so you can be a Smart SpenderThen you will realize :1. ALL OLD Content still playable and useful till the end game, because the gear rating will scale up through your level and champion point.2. You can Mix The Gear Set, yes there will always a Meta Build, but you can create your own gear set to mix this set and the other set. This point ""The Thing"" that the other MMO like WoW doesn't have, if another patch comes up then the old content will be leave behind3. There will be lot of content you can do, not just PVP or PVE content, but the specific zone content that grant you pretty good rewards4. You can do ANY RAID, every day , if you just not bored 5. The Dungeon System really dope if you can try Hardcore Mode Cons:1. The story of this game is sucks, every expansion they released, the story in my opinion didnt match with the story of the last expansion. and its not really strong character based story telling like WoW did .2. There are no World PVP on this game, so you just feel like playing on RP Server all the way you level up your character3. Dont do GATCHA just for costume or mount lol__________________________________________________________________So after all, still this game is one of the best MMO for me, especially when you get the best community to make you step up for Dungeon Hardcore Mode and Raid"
Positive,"I don't do a lot of reviews, but given that this says i've got over 1k hrs play time (i don't really probably a third to half of it's probably where I forgot to shut down the login thing, and I've noticed it logs steam hours that I don't play and I've left the login thing up for days at a time without logging in.)  I  thought I'd leave a commentary. I've played a lot of mmorpgs, including WoW, various MUD's and a lot of FTP. ESO has to be by far my favorite of the games. I've been able to play without having to worry about shelling out a small fortune a month for the privilege of playing (well except where you have to have a sub for Xbox live but that doesn't count for steam where you -don't- have to have a sub) unless I want special perks, which do help but they're not important in the grand scheme. In short, yeah it costs in the beginning to get it set up, but unlike some other games you don't have to buy the product repeatedly to play something you supposedly own, which is the biggest selling point in my opinion. Aside from the beginning opening, the story line is comprehensive and each chapter seems to build onto it. There's a lot of different things you can do, and if you're a solo player or a group player it's got everything you need, especially with the addition of companions, they can make a bit of difference in a difficult battle. In short, as of today, I definitely recommend getting the game. Good luck to anyone who wants to grab it, and hope to see you out there!"
Positive,"PROS:- Fair price for an MMO of this size and quality;- No subscription required to play the game;- New content every few months;- Helpful and friendly community;- No p2w;- All content (not only DLC, but everything in the Crown Store) can eventually be bought with gold, since you can trade gold for crowns (the cash currency) with other players;- Amazing lore;- Interesting action-oriented battle mechanics (run, dodge, normal/heavy attack, block, break CC);- Fun and rich crafting system;- Housing system, with lots of different houses and furnitures to collect (for those of you who like a The Sims inside an MMO);- A lot of PvE solo content;- A lot of PvE group content;- One of the best PvPs I've ever played (in my opinion, only GW2 feels better, and I explain why in the cons);- You can DPS/tank/heal with ANY class in the game, with little to no difference between race/class combinations. This means races/classes are REALLY balanced and you only really need to care about what you WANT to play, not what you SHOULD play;- The game has almost no need for grinding and the end game Champion Points system actually rewards you for having more than one character, since you can keep on leveling your CPs no matter which character you decide to play. This makes it easy to learn, test and play all classes/races in the game, without feeling like you're ""behind"" for not focusing on a single character;- The PvE mechanics are easy to learn, hard to master, with the same instance having three levels of difficulty (with rewards varying accordingly);- There are no choices you can't undo when it comes to your character, so you can test as many builds as you want and only pay a few gold to reset everything. The amount of gold you pay to reset your skills escalates the more skill points you've spent, but there are more than enough skill points to make your character useful for more than one thing (dpsing/tanking/healing) at the same time, so eventually you don't really need to reset your build, just grab more skill points (which you get by doing PvE content or buying them directly from the Crown Store, if you have the cash/gold for it) to make up for your mistakes.CONS:In my opinion, there are only two cons.- The game doesn't feel... ""Epic"" enough. The clothing and skills' visual effects look too ""simple"". Sure, they do look a little more realistic than other MMOs, and maybe that's the whole point of it, but the truth is that I really don't care about going after transmogs or collecting different colors/weapons/patterns in ESO simply because they all look just the same or ""meh"" to me. The lack of better, more epic visual effects on skills also makes the PvP and PvE battles less appealing, and classes don't look and feel ""unique"" enough because of that (and this is intensified by the fact that all classes can do all roles). This is why I think GW2 PvP ""feels"" better: in ESO, characters (spells, appearances, classes) don't look/feel unique enough;- The trading system, tough realistic, might be a little frustrating at times: you need to be in a guild to sell your stuff to other players, and guilds compete with each other in ""bidding wars"" to get the best guild store sellers for the next week. All of that is interesting, the problem is that you need to ""physically"" go to a guild trader to buy stuff players from THAT guild are selling at THAT trader (and there are traders scattered across the entire world, so... not fun). On top of that, there's no real-time in-game UI or website to check for items being sold AT THE MOMENT, so the community uses an addon/website (Tamriel Trade Center) that tracks items being sold across all guild stores from players that have the addon installed. Almost every player uses this addon, so we kinda know everything being sold in all guild stores, BUT the problem is that this addon/website takes a LONG time to update and delete items that have already been sold, so if an item has been posted a few hours ago there's no way for you to know if it's still being sold or someone already bought it (you need to go check it for yourself at the guild store NPC). I mean, I like the idea of bidding wars and trading guilds, but a good old server-wide auction house (like WoW or GW2) just seems less annoying and time-consuming, if you're the type of player that does a lot of trading in MMOs like myself. I think a simple in-game UI that tracks all items being sold across all guild traders would fix this issue, because travelling to a guild store in another part of the world isn't annoying... IF at least I'm certain the item is actually still being sold there."
Positive,great game to play with friends
Positive,This game is one of the best mmo's you could buy
Positive,"Pog game, I love all of the skyrim related games but this brings a whole new concept to skyrim with the even more open world + multiplayer aspect"
Positive,Enjoyable gameplay and great storyline 10/10
Positive,love the battles and being able to act like a ninja
Positive,Better than the rest
Positive,"I never really liked MMO games, but when I got this, I just couldnt stop playing it, I really like the game, the quests, dungeons and everything, what I dont like tho is that some of the people who play dungeons, they take it too seriously, I'm just there to chill and have a good time and then toxic people like that turn up and mood is completely ruined, but anyways the game is really good!"
Positive,"A decent MMO not as good of a ""story driven"" game, but it has most of the typical elder scrolls game feel. I like the level progression and classes with their abilities. The mana and hp feel to the game starts really easy and you can spam abilities which i personally dont like in MMOs I like the need to add auto attacks into abilities, but maybe it changes later on in levels. I do think the npc's and quest are decent as well as item interaction basically all the mechanical aspects from the other elder scrolls like skyrim feel great, but it does still have that too easy feel like the leap from diablo 1/2 to diablo 3 or world of warcraft classic or burning crusade to retail. Side note: screw world of warcraft retail it's awful."
Positive,"The Cash Shop (Crown Store) Is All Cosmetics And Convenience Items And Has Nothing That Is Any Way P2W. They Do Have A Completely Optional Monthly Subscription You Can Purchase To Get You Instant Access To DLC Content Without Having To Pay For Them Individually, Which Would Cost More In Total To Purchase  Individually Than A Month Of Subscription Ever Would. The Other Thing The Subscription Offers Is An Unlimited Craft Bag, Which Stores All Your Crafting Materials In An Infinite Material Specific Inventory And Save You Hundreds Of Bag And Bank Space.With Over 3k Hours Clocked In, It Is Hands Down One Of THE Best MMO'S I Have Ever Played And Would Highly Recommend For Anyone Wanting To Play One."
Positive,"Bought the game 2 weeks ago, 180 hrs played. Please, I need help."
Positive,"Disappointing at launch, but has gone from strength to strength with every update."
Positive,It is a must play if you like this type of Role play
Positive,"Out Of All The MMO's i Played So Far This Is Definitely My Favourite One,  Best 100 Hours I've spent On The Game So Far"
Positive,10/10 Your inventory is full
Positive,"Very interactive game, very positive story with many hours of gameplay.recomended for skyrim or oblivion players, Very big player base with player interactive dungeon system"
Positive,"There is a reason it has won awards. There is a reason it has millions of players worldwide. There is a reason all the reviews are positive. That reason is this is one of the best games ever made. Absolutely spectacular. Thousands and thousands of hours with challenging quests, interesting story lines, in depth character creation and epic multiplayer battles. If I could choose only one game to have, it would be this. Do yourself a favor and get this game. 10/10 from me."
Positive,"In my experience the only MMO that has me coming back consistently. I prefer to play for a while and take breaks in between, but I ALWAYS enjoy coming back to the game despite it's ups and downs. From what I have seen Zenimax actually listens to the players, perhaps not on everything, but I've reported some bugs over the years and actually watched the bug fixed within a week or in the next update. To me this is a game you can play either for a single player experience or multiplayer experience, there is VAST amounts of content to satisfy any type of player and the game is amazingly well tailored for roleplay content as well for those who enjoy that (myself included). The only complaint I have is that they focus way too much on the crown store.I think I speak for every single player when I say that releasing cool new houses, assistants, crafting styles, costumes etc etc etc purely through crown store is a HUGE disappointment.There should be a way to also EARN these amazing mounts, craft styles, houses etc through gameplay. There is so much cool stuff you can only get with real money, and I feel like it's unfair towards the players to lock 95% of all the coolest stuff behind a paywall.I get that it's about making money, but making money means nothing if people stop playing because all the stuff they want costs real money on top of the subscription they already pay. 1500 crowns per month for a sub is the equivalent of working 8 hours for 1 hour pay. So to the Devs at Zenimax if you see this review: Please at least increase the monthly crown reward for subs to like 3000 per 1 month or freaking stop putting a paywall on ALL the cool stuff, I'd rather have to do a super hard veteran trial or questline to gain cool new mounts, houses, you name it. If you can show people you're not all about microtransactions you will attract more players and proportionally increase number of subs. But when push comes to shove this is just my opinion and I still love the game, I just try to ignore all the amazing stuff locked behind paywalls.."
Positive,"I have been paying this game for years, building my opinions of the game. The easiest way to describe it would be Pros v.s. Cons.Pros:Easy to learn, hard to master.The Questing only gets better with each expansion.You don't NEED to interact with anyone. Treat it like a single player game if you want and call it hard mode.Fun dungeons that don't get boring with just a couple of runs.Tons of ""End Game"" content to keep one busy far after they reach max gear level.Super Fun PvP system with Cyrodil Tri-Banner WarIf you want to specialize in something like crafting, it is diverse and fun enough to keep you entertained, then become extremely profitable in the future.Cons:To be a crafter in the most efficient way, you NEED to subscribe to ESO Plus (but as a little sneaky pro, ESO Plus gives all the DLC bundled with it plus ""crowns"" equaling the price paid for subscription""VETERAN MAELSTROM ARENA IS UNFAIRLY DIFFICULT favoring Magika DPS players with very good sustainability and constant shield action. A bit of tough love that pushes away newer or less experienced players.PvP, though really fun, has a very steep learning curve that leaves many unsure where to start, luckily PvP isn't the main focus of the game."
Positive,"My wife and I quest together and are having an absolute blast.  IMHO, this is not an MMO for someone looking for hardcore PvP or super difficult PvE.  ESO is a casual MMO that you can easily hop in and out of without forgetting where you are or falling behind.  The world of Tamriel is rich with lore and is an absolute pleasure to read and discover every possible piece.  Combat isn't groundbreaking but it is fluid, fun, and works extremely well using an xbox controller.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun, not extremely hardcore, and lore rich MMO.   If that isn't your thing, go elsweyr....  ;)  If there is one recommendation that I could make to the developer, make the craft bag available to all players with or without a subscription.  Access to all dungeon DLC and small updates is perfectly acceptable as well as the crown allowance for ESO plus members.  I myself am an ESO plus member.  However, not having the craft bag severely hinders F2P players from experiencing the crafting system.  I honestly feel that crafting isn't something that should be hidden behind a paywall and without the craft bag, it truly is.  Inventory/space management for F2P players is expensive in gold and really unnecessary."
Positive,muito bom pra quem quer gastar um tempo no rpg
Positive,Surprisingly addictive. This coming from an ex-WoW player.
Positive,GOOD game . really have to try
Positive,"My favorite MMORPG after 10+years of WoW, GW2, RIFT and TSW."
Positive,"If you like any of the Elder Scrolls games and MMORPG's, this game is for you."
Positive,"a lot of grinding, a lot of things to do, very fun, very addicting, best played with friends although playing solo isn't bad either, having company to play with makes this game more entertaining, be warned there is some toxic players within the community who will kick you from the dungeons if you don't live up to their standards of ""everyone who plays must join the game knowing the knowledge prior"" type of toxicity."
Positive,I like the Game that is all.
Positive,"Kinda like a laid back WoW, the lore and questing really makes it stand out. Killed a dragon today and screamed like an over excited hyena. Definately worth checking out. Strong 8/10"
Positive,Still better then shadowlands
Positive,is fun. More like an elder scrolls game than an mmo imo but is fun
Positive,Best game ever!
Positive,it is very epic i like slaying things and making my character a hot vampire gf
Positive,"The best game in the MMO style in my opinion ...Of course, I am also very interested in WOW, but I prefer this game for several reasons:First of all, I prefer the face-to-face war system of this gameSecondly, the world of Elder Scrolls is more interesting to me than the world of WarcraftAnd thirdly, the control of the character, the angle of view and many of the character-building mechanisms of this game are more in line with my taste.In general, I highly recommend this game for those who are fans of MMO-RPG games, as well as those who love Skyrim.Another good thing about Wu is that you do not have to pay for its game time every month :)Also in terms of environment design, graphic effects, and especially the game's storyline, character building and many other influential elements, I think this game is one of the best games in history so far.I hope you enjoy playing it."
Positive,nice and sexy
Positive,"Been playing for years, great game with lots of content"
Positive,"This will be a quick review: ESO is a great game if you're willing to put either the extra legwork or fold a bit of cash. I'll separate things by pros and cons and i'll explain from there:Pros:- Character building. ESO has great character building. Albeit i tend to agree that classes shouldn't exist in the game, and instead you should have spell domains to which build together with your weapons, i also find that as it is, ESO is pretty passable. Most MMOs nowadays prefer to shelve player options in the name of balance, and ESO goes on the opposite, which is something i appreciate. I am completely for shelving 20% power if i get 20% more fun out of it.- World. The world in ESO looks and feels great. Zones are a thing of beauty, and traveling through them feels good. Quests are spread and overall exploring is on a decent place. Since questing is also scaled, you can choose ANY route you want and be satisfied with it.Cons:- Character graphics and fashion. It's clear that ZOS either put the entire budget on the zones and spells or just wanted to follow the ES recipe and make the characters look like crap because dear god. Models run like they're in love with the floor and will faceplant on the ground at any time. Combat animations are piss-poor and look a lot unnatural ( specially dual wielding ). For some reason, ZOS forced most of the classes to summon weapons as their main spammable, which means that if you're a Necro you'll be using a scythe even if you wanted to wield a sword and board. Nightblades get daggers and shortswords, DKs get a flimsy fire whip, Sorcs got nothing until last rework where now they get a crystal imbue on their next attack, Templars spam a light lance like a doped gorilla, and Wardens summon a kamikaze bird. It's weird.Skills like Brawler/Carve lack impact, Steel Tornado looks absolutely unacceptable for today standards and overall character animation is weak. Add that to the fact that the game has animation canceling and it looks even worse. ( Also, autoattack animations are terrible too ).- Balance: Remember what i said about animation canceling? Yeah. Everything is balanced around it and it's a mess. Because you have to consider every attack a double hit, you must balance the game accordingly, and ESO's PvP is mainly a battle of attrition where your heals have to be as potent as the damage you take. It's no surprise then that it's a sustain battle. Tanky mobs are also healthsponges simple because of this bu...""feature"" that increases your dps a LOT just by doing it and takes no skill at all. ESO's balance is all over the place, and i don't have a issue with it because i play for open world soloing but people who want to play competitively might find it clunky and clumsy.- ""Features"": Outside animation canceling, other features i find problematic are: Proc sets, racials giving too good stats developing a meta, and my most loathed feature: Weaponswap. The way i see it, games that abuse weaponswap, do so in a way to cheapen their class development, and this is exactly what we see here. Clearly ESO has issues giving you enough tools to use one weaponslot without a clunky mechanic, but instead of increasing class and weapon capabilities they just force you to use another one. Thank god for One-bar builds. Oh, and before i forget: The guild trader system is also terrible. If you're going to make Guild Traders, at least allow us to SEARCH the goddamn items globally. Jesus.- Monetization: I'm going to have a field day with this one since this is my biggest issue with ESO: ESO is a B2P game, but B2Players are treated as lesser players. Monetization in this game is an absolute mess and not in a good way. I've never been a fan of the DLC system, and ESO has one of the worst: Locking essential features behind DLC content that is not relevant in any other way ( Clockwork City transmute or Blackwood companions ), putting the craft bag which is ESSENTIAL for crafting behind the sub, which means you either build dozens of mules or you sub because fuck you B2Player, and less crafters in a MMO is NEVER a good thing. Also, ESO's crafting system is clearly designed to overflow you with crap. Why is there a item for level 50 from CP 10 to 140? WHY? Why are different items used to craft things from 26 to 44 for instance? What the hell? Why creating so much clutter? For the crafting bag to be appealing, of course. Add all that to again: putting essential features behind DLC and you have a terrible monetization system.Conclusion: All the heat i gave here looks worse than it is honestly. ESO is a really fun game and if you don't play with optimization in mind, you can enjoy it a lot. Sure, it's a REALLY inconvenient game if you don't sub, but it's passable.My final rating, if it's even relevant is: 7/10. Really good game. 9/10 if you sub. I do recommend it, just go with a open mind and don't play for perfection."
Positive,u can go wild with your power.
Positive,"I bought the basic version and it worths every penny, I had really good time so far. Im planning to buy the whole package depending on the end-game experience but thats gonna take a while with all the content this game offers at the present.If you dont have a membership, inventory and bank space might be a problem at the beginning so you can safely spend your gold to increase your slots, Other than that both pvp and pve content were so smooth.I really regret not trying this game before, The gameplay feels way different compared to youtube videos and twich streams. I think you can play for free at weekends, try to hit 15-20 and see for yourself when chracters starts to flow in combat with the wide array of skills."
Positive,"i know a lot of people aren't a fan of this. most of my friends don't even play. but try not to think of it as skyrim as an mmo, think of it as an mmo with a skyrim skin. its still got the great lore and stories and quests. the pvp is really fun as well. You've got dungeons and 'raids' and enough things to collect that you'll be at it forever. The classes aren't restricting either. you might be a sorc, but you could go a stam build with daggers or bows. Give it a try and if you find yourself invested get the sub (yeah i know it sucks) but it gives a lot of quality of life improvements like inventory space and DLC access."
Positive,"As Turkish player community and ESO players, we want Turkish language support."
Positive,"really fun game, keeps you wanting to play more"
Positive,sexy demons and monsters. would reccomend
Positive,"If you like Skyrim and are tired of waiting for Elder Scrolls 6, this is the next best option"
Positive,Huge MMORPG game with various kinds of mechanics..Highly recommend if you are a fan of elder scrolls series.Player base is very friendly and will help you in any game related matter.
Positive,"One of the best MMORPG I've ever played!!!Doing another review after playing for 450+ hours. So far, it is still one of the best MMORPG in the market!! Just purchased High Isle Collector's Edition today. Let's go!!!"
Positive,"****, add my console hours we're looking at 2500+ ...you need a good MMORPG to play this is it for now at least ..best in its genre ... for now at least .. 10/10aside from that LET IT DIE & give me Elder Scrolls 6 already....."
Positive,"This is probably the most fun mmorpg I've ever played. The mechanics are great, the rewards are awesome, even the subscription to the plus membership pays for itself in its benefits and additions to the game. The story-line, quests, all of them really engaging and interesting. The voice acting is very good and you actually feel bad for the characters who suffer. You can choose however you want to play it, and the freedom is really sweet. If you're a fan of the elder scrolls games, you'll find this to be an amazing addition to your library. I'd recommend it to anyone."
Positive,"If i already purchased the game, but want the upgraded with DLC do i really lose out on the money previous or does it decrease the overall value of the DLC? And there are collector additions past base game but if i get the blackwood chapters collectors its 20$ more? but doesn't come with any of the other collector versions... I am just looking for the best way to acquire all collectors passes without spending 100s of dollars.. :( any help would be awesome!"
Positive,"Worth getting for the money. Lots of different play styles and if you invest the time to get used to the game and the mechanics there is almost an unlimited amount of play time. My only suggestion is to not start grinding out XP immediately, it is a very boring process that leads many people to leaving the game. I even took a few month hiatus after levelling up my third character, but when I came back I focused on other skill lines and achievements and it is still very fun :)"
Positive,Wanna escape reality and do some magical sh!t? Play ESO!
Positive,"One of the best MMORPG's on the market. F2P and worth checking out. Great stories, pvp is fun, quests are great for getting your elder scrolls story fix. ALOT of character customization."
Positive,Can the crown be reduced in price?
Positive,Loving the game so far... Looking forward to seeing all it has to offer (3 hours in)
Positive,It's friggin amazing.
Positive,It's like Skyrim with guns!
Positive,"I used to play Skyrim awhile back and enjoyed it however, when a group of friends showed me this game I was immediately interested! It is highly immersive with literally so much to do, it would take someone a looonnngg time to get through all the content. I enjoy how you'll never do the same dungeon twice in a row and there various trials, battlegrounds, dungeons, and story lines to go through. Highly recommended!"
Positive,"This game is so deep and rich with stories and things to do that I am over 400hrs in and I have barely scratched the surface. The community rallies together well, advancement is not stressful, nor does it take a long time. The learning curve for crafting is quite large, but you will lose yourself in this game to the point of figuring it out eventually. It feels natural to just hop into this game as a newcomer and just hit the ground running. Character customization is phenomenal. Even if you pick a class to play, that doesn't mean your play style will be anything like someone with the same class. Characters are able to be SO unique in this game that you won't find anyone else like YOU, but you will find plenty of help along the way."
Positive,"I find it hard to fault Bethesda/Zenimax for what they're doing here. As an MMO, it's really solid. It's got all the features you'd want from an MMO and they are all very polished. Many people dislike the combat, but it's subjective. I think as far as MMO's go it's more action-oriented with aiming (not tab targeted) like Skyrim, but in my personal opinion better than Skyrim which was way more brainless and spammy.As an Elder Scrolls game, it's got all the great story-telling; every quest is voice-acted, encourages exploration, and includes most of the features you'd find in the single-player games (including stealing). I have even had experiences in ESO that I would have only expected in a single-player game, such as personalized, scripted NPC's doing something in the wild in response to a quest I'm on.Monetization feels like it errs on the side of not angering the player-base. You can purchase the base game (or an expansion) and play without paying a monthly fee, or feeling compelled to buy MTX. My only complaint is that ESO Plus gives you a bag with unlimited material storage -- you know, the stuff that you vacuum up constantly and fills up your bags within minutes of playing the game. That being said, it truly is just a convenience thing and I remember having the same issues with weight in Skyrim, so it's technically still ""on brand"".Speaking of ESO Plus, the value really comes from the fact that it gives you access to all the DLC. While there are hundreds of hours of things to do in the base game and expansions, there are some fun DLC's that have released and having Plus means you don't need to keep track of which quest-lines you have access to.Finally, the main reason to play ESO is if you are reading this within 5 years of 2021, there is not another Elder Scrolls game. If you have exhausted all the TES III - V content and need an Elder Scrolls fix, this is it until TES VI. But, really that's not a bad thing. They could have done SO much worse than ESO. But it stays true to the Elder Scrolls series while offering a polished, modern MMO experience."
Positive,"8/10, a good grind. This game will swallow your soul like it eats up time. Whether you want to be a tank, healer or damage dealer - there is a build for everyone. Make sure you put in the effort to get good, no one likes trash teammates."
Positive,"I love how you can play at your own pace! I should have started playing this game years ago! Also as far as I can tell by reading the chat in game, the community is very helpful!"
Positive,"Really enjoy the game play even with the challenges.  Great graphics, good quests."
Positive,Just love mmorpg's!
Positive,best game to just play
Positive,I only was going to play for a few weeks. Well then i got hooked in many hours ago
Positive,"Personally one of my all time favorite MMOs. Your character development is easily defined as well as the crafting system, and the ability to make use of 3rd party addons really increases the play-ability and enjoyment of the game.On the flip side, i do wish that they would open up more areas and content to non ESOplus members and that you can have npc companions and that you can explore side story content with.overall 8/10"
Positive,"ESO is still a great game to play today. The story is solo focused so you don't have to group up unless you want to, the combat is action oriented and skill based instead of that slow boring tab targeting garbage of more ""traditional"" MMOs, the crafting system is the best I've ever seen (its genius is its simplicity), you have near-infinite flexibility in your character build and the order in which you do quests, the world is greatly detailed, and there's SO much content."
Positive,"I can admit, it is a little hard to get into, and their isn't to much direction when you get thrown into the game.But, once you figure out what to do, this game is an amazing MMO. It is the MMO I have been trying to find for months."
Positive,Well.. I love elder scrolls. lul
Positive,"A really fun MMORPG almost exactly like other Elder Scrolls titles, if not a little more grind heavy. A literally endless fantasy game with optional pvp and story elements. 10/10 Loving it"
Positive,"Take Skyrim and make it better, this is it. When people talk about FF14, they talk about the story and how blah blah blah. ESO takes the story and lore, ups the content with a non-tabtarget combat system and lets you freely roam. The journey to end game is amazing, ESO plus allows you to take your time and not break the bank to get all the DLC. You can rush to end game and still have fun, or take the time to read and listen to what the world has to offer. Join and guild and most people will help, answer questions, or even give you gear to help make the game easier for you. Buy the base game on sale and then get ESO plus for 14.99 a month. Thank me later, enjoy."
Positive,"Have put in about 1,300 hours of gameplay and I've only just completed the majority of everything on ONE character. There's so much content to work through. It's fun and such a nice game to play. Being able to play with others or just by yourself depending on your mood is a nice touch. And now that they added Companions, it makes soloing stuff a tad bit easier. There are some bugs here and there but it's not bad enough to put me off from playing it. I've been playing Elder Scrolls games since I was a pre-teen so I'm being a little bit biased, but ESO is definitely one of the few Elder Scrolls games that I like to play and keep coming back to."
Positive,"Immersive, and fun to play even for a solo player. Especially if you're looking for an Elder Scrolls Fix."
Positive,King Udaroth eating lots of Nords yes!!!!
Positive,This game have best lore and mechs which most mmorpgs doesnt have this anymore just a disadvantage this game has is pings are a bit high for most people.
Positive,"This game is so fun to play with friends. My buddy and I are cruising through the story line together! If you're curious, we're starting in the the Morrowind DLC zone called Vvardenfell. Trust me when I say that one zone can be as large as the whole Skyrim game... or maybe two zones combined, there are many of them. If you like fantasy and friends, I definitely recommend this. Elder Scrolls is Elder Scrolls, so expect an adventure."
Positive,46 hours in and i still have a lot to learn in this game but it has been MAGICALLLLL
Positive,Best Game!! Very addicting and so much to do!
Positive,Doesn't hit my account like WOW every month for a subscription fee. :)
Positive,"There is so much to do in this game, it's crazy! The price is totally worth the amount of content you get (base game or expansions). It can be overwhelming at first because there is so much to do but if you pace yourself, the game play is endless. It's fun to play the game with friends/significant other or by yourself. It's an upgraded Skyrim feel. There guilds you can join and make new friends and most of them do daily/weekly/monthly events, raffles, etc. There's always something to do! My husband has over 3,000 hrs and it still finding stuff to do in the game. The game value is worth every bit that you pay for!"
Positive,I have played a mmo before called neverwinter as well as the elder scrolls game franchise. I would say that it is a wonderful experience on the mix of the mmo experience with the fun elder scrolls lore and nostalgia from the older games. The only thing I would say is that it has a hard time introducing mechanics aside from that its awesome! Great Job Bethesda I hope for your success in the future!
Positive,lets you pay for things and play at your own leisure without the pressure of not getting your moneys worth from subbing. sure some stuff is behind a pay wall but the base game is only like 20$ and i have definitely  gotten that much moneys worth out of the game already with just base content. Very fun especially with friends.
Positive,"My first MMO, lots to learn, but realizing there is no one way to play it and to enjoy the journey and not grind makes this game exceptional. Love the different races and classes. But what keeps me coming back are my fellow guild mates and almost daily guild events. Amazing social aspect and story."
Positive,Played Skyrim decided to try Elder Scrolls Online  Absolutely No Regrets Reeeeeallly Enjoying it!!!
Positive,"don't go into it expecting ""online skyrim"""
Positive,"This game has so much to offer, It is great for passing time or for going hard as a solo player. You can play with friend's but there are ways to enjoy the majority of the game without anyone at all just like the good old Elder scrolls games. I recommend this game to any ES fans and MMO fans."
Positive,"Great game , if you like to journey in a awesome RPG Open world game with good class designs and fun CO OP dungeons this game is yours , i have not finished the late game content yet but still love to play this with my friends"
Positive,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. I used to hate MMORPGs, but after I made myself play it for about 50 hours, I now have the understanding of why I was wrong about them.Just updating, I'm now over 700 hours in lol."
Positive,"if you like any elder scrolls game you have to pick this up at any price. there is so much to do and they always add more content (even if it is another 60$ it still worth and gives you so much to do) you'll never be bored while playing. 10/10 the only problem i have with the game is the prices of the dlcs and the prices in the crown store, but if you have the money to spend then its def worth it, but if you don't just be wary that you wont have all the cool things like dark brotherhood and so on."
Positive,"Most of my playtime was spent literally unconscious because it also counts time the launcher is open. Game is enjoyable for people who enjoyed Skyrim especially of the Elder Scrolls games, and doesn't offer much more besides subjectively wittier writing and a streamlined combat system that you can't apply mods to. A fun diversion with neat character creation and build options, but the crafting system is very hard to suffer through if you're not a premium member. tl;dr Give it a try if you enjoyed Skyrim and wouldn't mind that but with the joy of other people"
Positive,Good. Kinda buggy but better than it was.
Positive,"Good MMO, has come a long way since launch."
Positive,"Large and various enviroments.  Lot of various things to do in game, quests, dungeons trials. Lot of soloable things plus group, always something new to do."
Positive,"Only gets better with time. Amazing graphics, immersive MMO experience. Highly ranked on my personal list!"
Positive,"nice game overall, new update should unlock more things give it a try"
Positive,"if you like the elder scrolls series then you will dig this. its fun, and incorporating online stuff like multiplayer dungeons into the elder scrolls setting is pretty sweet. if you ever wanted to play oblivion or skyrim with a bunch of other people, then here ya go."
Positive,"Great game and great community. You can always count on great help in zone chat or you can say something dumb in zone chat and people will join in and it can always lead to great conversations. The game itself is so fun, there is so much to do. As a massive TES fan it's amazing to see these lands I have only read about in person. If I am bored (which is rare) I can chose to go on a fishing trip, scry for an artifact, go resource collecting and explore as well, or find a fun quest chain to help save a town from some threat. There is so much to do and I am excited for whatever is to come."
Positive,"Please read the privacy policy.  I was interested in coming back with Blackwood and saw the first review saying they will sell your information.  Reviewing the document it doesn't say that exactly and their list of those they would share that type of information is vague.   1 for ""vendors and service providers"" is defined in the same document incorrectly as ""vendors and providers"":: https://www.zenimax.com/legal_privacy_us.  They aren't selling your PII.  That would be illegal."
Positive,"An MMO different from all the rest.If you want to play in an immersive world, with an interesting story line, fun combat system, huge amounts of end game content and developers that throw updates and new content all the time. This is the game."
Positive,1000 hours and counting
Positive,The time span that I played ESO was one of the happiest times in my life. This game is truly amazing.
Positive,grate game and one can play for free but membership is worth it.
Positive,"I'll be as brief as I can with this one cuze there's not much to say. Also  this might contain spoilers for those who care about that sort of thing  : Pros:-Decent storywriting and voice acting-Tons of fun houses and accessories-Endless skill customizing potential-A huge world to run around in, even in the base gameCons:-Locking out certain pieces of the map behind DLC is stupid-The grinding is insane, unless you want to spend actual money-The digital Crowns conversion rate is terrible (normally)- After the major storylines, there isn't alot to do until the next DLC comes out Final Thoughts: This game is definitely a step forward in the quality of the game, but there's clearly still some Bethesda weirdness in here. If you really want to get into this game, get it on sale.Final Grade: C-"
Positive,FASHION IS THE TRUE ENDGAME
Positive,i sperm im pants
Positive,"The game has a bit of everything -- lots of fighting for those hack-n-slashers; or or team, or big team up players -- there are some excellent questlines, well voice-acted and lore-heavy, and there are all the collecting possibilities -- I could go on and on"
Positive,"I was thinking to buy this game for like 2 years and finally i bought it last week. I never liked mmo games, cause I knew mmo means tons of brainless grind and other repetive stuff. I heard a lot about ESO that it is different than other mmos and it turned out be the truth. It is different in every way. I mean, there are still some typical mmo stuff in game like dungeons and other mmo bullshiet grind missions etc, but fun fact about this game is that you can literally play it like it is a single player game, which is awesome. You do not need to do this dumb repetive mmo stuff. This is the reason I am in love with this game. I'm playing it like it is a single player rpg game. Just doing story quests and exploring the world. I do not care about dungeons and other mmo dumb grind.Area's storylines are really fun. I really enjoy them. :) They are really well written and they are not some fetch quest like ""bring me 5 potatos or 5 bananas"" bullshiet, plus all of them are fully voiced which is awesome.This game has also really good soundtrack, I just feel so relaxed when I play this game. Music is fantastic.Also I need to mention about community. They are really helpful, always trying to help. Even two players gave me 5k gold each to help me at the beginning. :) Now I'm doing it sometimes too. Trying to help If I can.Also add some addons to the game. I'm only using 2 for now. Minimap and adblock to block this dumb guild spams on chat. :) Minimap is freaking awesome and very useful. There are tons of addons on esoui.com. Check it yourself.Just buy it, my dear players, and enjoy the ride and do not be shy to ask for help on chat."
Positive,Better than wasting time on Warcraft
Positive,"SOOOOO MUCH CONTENT. Almost too much to be able to focus on specific quest lines. However, the ability to install and utilize add-ons makes this MUCH easier to mitigate. 11/7 Stars"
Positive,"This is a awesome game, even i can play it with a pc that isn't that good"
Positive,possibly the best game i've ever played! very well thought
Positive,"very good game yes, even better with friends yes! ._."
Positive,Epic stuff right here
Positive,This Game Is Awesome.. Biggest Down Side Is Doesnt Transfer Xbox Mounts and Characters... but still worth it!
Positive,I've loved this game for a long time and have convinced many friends to buy and play it with me.
Positive,"The combat is different from the other TES titles but its unique, it's pretty fun and the story has full voice acting."
Positive,"Ranked by severity of the problem  Lack of interaction between devs and playersAs a result, many useful QoL suggestions have been ignored. For example, the unsatisfying bank/inventory space. It would be a tremendous QoL improvement if an extra furnishing bag could be added, and players have been requesting this for years to no avail. Inventory is a constant micromanagement hell. It's tedious and boring.  Spaghetti codeSometimes I suspected that it's not that the devs don't want to add QoL improvements—they just can't. Extra inventory space means more server load, and oh Lord the server—it deserves a separate bullet point. Bugs are constantly present in this game, and don't expect them to be fixed, who knows what else they might break if the spaghetti code is tempered with?  Overcrowded serverOne of the megaserver's biggest downsides is the overcrowding problem. Expect to be constantly competing for resources with your fellow players. Wanna farm some gears/levels? Too bad, the campers in public dungeons will insta clean the bosses and mobs. Wanna collect some nodes? Better pray no one outruns you.  LAGThe infamous LAG makes PvP in ESO unplayable, which is unfortunate because PvP in ESO could've been so amazing. Apparently, the lag is getting worse and worse with the release of new expansions, as the servers are getting older and the spaghetti code being piled up.   Homogeneous zonesWhat you don't want in a game is boredom, and the repetitive zones certainly won't help. Just how repetitive the zones are? Well, they are all EXACT same except for the color palettes.The level-scaling system This system means that there's no sense of progression in this game as you level up. I immensely dislike the level-scaling system in MMORPGs. What's the point of leveling up if you can travel across the entire map at level 1?monetization The monetization model of ESO is questionable and ineffective imo. It's advertised as ""cosmetic only"", but you can purchase all sorts of boosters in the cash shop. Not to mention the infamous crown crates (loot boxes) and crown gems (a type of currency only found in loot boxes) which are predatory in nature. You can only find the coolest cosmetics by opening up loot boxes, and oh boy they're expensive and unrewarding. Just look at this hilarious video: ESO - OPENING $150 OF CROWN CRATES (and then killing everybody) - Elder Scrolls Online - YouTubeAnd the list goes on...and on...and on...To be continued!"
Positive,"Aside from all the bugs in this game, it is really enjoyable."
Positive,its a good time spender if you and a few friends want to play together. Lots of lore if you're into that sort of thing and crafting isnt bad
Positive,3rd platform I've owned this game on and I still get addicted.
Positive,Loving the game. Definitely recommend.
Positive,If you haven't played this game yet you should try it on a free weekend to make sure you like it but its tons of fun if you have friends and if you don't there are randoms in game who will help you
Positive,"TL, DR: Solid MMORPG, I was never able to enjoy or even like this genre, this game got me addicted to itself.There is no Pay to Win mechanic, but there is so much more added to the game with DLCs, Chapters and ESO Plus subscription. It is both worth its regular price or discount, but it goes on 60% sale from time to time. I really did not like MMORPGs but, this one hits different. It takes a little bit of time to get used to it and to let the game show its true colours, then it gets a bit too addictive. It is also really easy to get back into after you take a break (long or short) away from the game because the gameplay mechanics are super fun and comprehensible for casual gaming experience. If you want to devote a lot to the game ESO rewards that generously as well, there is a lot, A LOT of things to explore and learn. Even as a single player it is a solid game. DLCs and Chapters are not game breakingly over powered, but they also add a lot of things and mechanics to the game for enhanced experience. ESO Plus is also worth after you decide that the game is enjoyable and fun for you because it has so many advantages. What can only seem as a disadvantage at first is the grind for crafting and the vastness of the world. Not knowing what to do, or how the mount system works. A TIP: if you want 30% mount speed just do a little pvp to level up the Assault skill line, then add a point to the first passive which is called ""continuous attack"" or something like that. Everybody used rapid maneuveur (an active skill) before but after a patch I missed they made Major Gallop into a passive apparently which is just much better."
Positive,"Story = 10/10 |(Even sidequests are interesting!)Graphics = 7/10 (only thing I hate about the graphics is the character creation. I can't make a hot elf. characters looks lifeless if you look close enough)Gameplay = 9/10PVP/PVE are exciting on their own way. with 5 skills per skillbar using skills is as basic as it can get.Replayability = 9/10Yep you can grind and grind if that what you love. Farming items would force you to replay this again and againSound/Music = 10/10From relaxing ambient sounds to rock hard boss music. ESO got it right!Population = 10/10As the game gets older, the population also grows which is a good thing for an MMORPG"
Positive,Decent MMO all in allNot pay to win as far as I can tell besides a few things in the store but nothing to greatly effect game play in a major way just something to speed up mounts and a few starter packs to give to a starting boost. Other than that its mostly cosmetic and/or just a tad over priced.Ton of content for base game players and even more if you fork over some dough for DLC or a membership. Just note as a person who just bought the base game just expect a few small things out of your reach and a few areas non-accessible but again nothing major you'll have plenty to do with just base content.Haven't delved into PVP (not really my thing) but it seems to have an alright system but wouldn't say its a big focus in game but its there for someone who wants to knock skulls together.From what I've seen it'll definitely scratch that MMO itch you've had for a while that WoW can't seem to get anymore. Either way if you do buy the game good luck on your adventures and hope to bump into ya. If not I hope you find the game you're looking for.
Positive,Queen Ayrenn is really hot
Positive,get ready for a grind
Positive,Y E S
Positive,For those who enjoy hours of grind with skyrim elements and a great soundtrack this is the MMO for you!Defo find yourself a good guild as it's way faster and funner with friends.
Positive,"My first proper experience with an MMO was World of Warcraft which I started back in 2006. That was a game I really cherished and enjoyed right up until Cataclysm came out. It was when that expansion released I first realised the ship had sailed for WoW and it had peaked. The sense of wonder and adventure gone, the reward for hard work tarnished. Then when Kung Fu Panda aka Mists of Pandaria came out I realised my WoW days were behind me. I did try a few times since going back to it but the game is very different now in terms of the overal experience whilst being very dated in some of the gameplay. However, as a fan of The Elder Scrolls games, Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) caught my eye when first announced and was a no-brainer purchase back in 2014. So a friend and I on the day of launch jumped on together. To begin with, it was a mixed bag. The game was very polished overall especially for an MMO at launch. It had a lot of quality of life improvements that WoW definitely needed whilst having a large dense world to explore. However, that is where it fell down at the time. It was quite natural to come to ESO wanting an experience like the previous Elder Scrolls games albiet with friends. The downside with this is ESO was very much like other MMOs with zones with set levels meaning you could not go off and explore at will. It made it feel more grindy and linear. This put me off, for a time.....Fast forward to 2021 and I decided it was time for a new MMO, I recently tried WoW Classic but it wasn't going to cut it. So I looked at what was the most popular MMOs and highest reviewed to narrow down to a small selection. I will be honest, I went straight for ESO with my love of The Elder Scrolls series as strong as ever. I started a new character and well, a month and a half later I have got the character up to Level 50 (CP220) with maxed crafting and a large manor house. I can honestly say I will not be playing any other MMOs in the near future. So let me break down the current world of ESO and why I choose to call it my home.--- Graphics ---Despite the game being 7 years old, ESO looks really good. It runs great even on modest hardware (my laptop from 2015 runs it super smooth on  a mix of Medium/High settings at 1080p. It has a 4th gen i7, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA 970m GPU). On my desktop cranked up to max the game really looks fantastic. The water looks superb, the world feels lush and detailed. Character models look great even up close. It must be said the newer expansions definitely do show where the Zenimax have pushed the engine further, Summerset looks stunning especially during sunrise/sunset. --- Sound ---Sound-wise it is a big of a mixed bag. The sound design and sound effects are in general superb. Hearing a thunderstorm roll in overhead as the sound of the first rain start to fall truely is atmospheric. With voiced NPCs including quests it really makes the story and lore of the world come alive. However, there are a few niggles. The first gripe is often you will hear NPCs repeat themselves when you walk near them, this can become quite tedious to hear the same lines spoken again and again. What about the music? Well the music is very good but I would say it isn't as memorable as the music from Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim. The music is good, but you probably wouldn't be wanting to listen to it after your game session has ended. I think this is something that WoW has down is a fantastic soundtrack though maybe partly helped by nostalgia.--- Gameplay ---Gameplay wise ESO is very welcoming to new players with a great tutorial that walks you through each game mechanic whilst still leaving certain parts of the game left to discover on your own. It strikes a good balance between hand-holding to get you going whilst not spoiling every single game mechanic that you will stumble upon yourself. Now unlike when the game first launched, the world scales with the player. This is fantastic for PvE as you can do what quests you want where you want or explore as you want. It really is fantastic especially if you want to go and explore or find treasures. The downside to this (depending on your perspective) is you cannot grind to level yourself up beyond the area you are in to make the game a bit easier. Likewise, you cannot have a high level player boost low level players through dungeons as the difficulty will scale. You can solo dungeons at very high levels (depending on your gear/class and which dungeon). However, the game isn't about grinding to top level. It's about enjoying the stories within, doing these in any order in any zone is great.Overall though the game focuses more on story telling and exploration than other MMOs like WoW. You will rarely find a quest where your objective is to kill 15 enemies of one type or to kill a number of enemies in the hope of an item dropping. No, ESO is very much a case of ""here is the world of Tamriel, go have an adventure"". The difficulty in questing is also quite a bit easier. You will rarely find yourself in a field pulling several mobs at once, ESO just isn't built like this. You will not find hundreds of enemies in a field close together. However should anything go wrong and you find yourself dead, it is not a big deal. You can either use a filled soul gem to resurrect on the spot (soul gems are very easy to find, by level 50 you will have a few hundred) or resurrect at wayshrines which are fast travel points. Really it is not a big deal. Talking of wayshrines, in ESO you do not wait to travel from one zone to another and pay to do so. Instead, you go to a wayshrine which are scattered around the zones and can teleport from one wayshrine to another (or to your home) free of charge instantly. You can teleport from anywhere to a wayshrine but this does cost some gold.What about crafting? Crafting in ESO is a bit more in-depth than WoW but is a lot more involved in a good way. You can choose how you want your items to look, you can use dyes on clothing to change their colour, you can craft furniture for your player home etc. It really is impressive. You can also do any crafting, unlike WoW you are not limited to two. If you want to max level your clothing, jewelcrafting, blacksmithing etc etc you can. Or you can choose to focus and go all in one a few of them. It is up to you.As you can tell by now, ESO is about telling a good story and having a good adventure without anything getting in your way or making it a grind. I'd say levelling is a bi-product in ESO of you enjoying the world around you rather than everything being a race to max level like other MMOs. --- Conclusion ---There is really too much to do in ESO to go into detail. For anyone wanting to know if the game is worth getting, absolutely! You do not need to pay a monthly fee (though ESO+, the monthly subscription, is worth it), you can just pay for the game and if you wish any of the expansions after and play! So it really is less of an investment and it is nice knowing if you are not going to play for a few months you will not be charged.You do not need to have played the previous games or read the lore etc. Though The Elder Scrolls universe does reward those who do with an a world that truly feels lived in and fleshed out. But if you want to ignore all of that and treat quests as self-contained stories then you will still have fun, but this is game that is best not rushed through instead lose yourself in its world and lore.There is just so much to do in ESO. PvE, PvP, Guilds, Crafting, Player Housing, Exploration, Dungeons(both 4-man or Solo which are called Delves), Trials(Raids), amazing stories, hugely in-deph lore with a world fully fleshed out since the first Elder Scroll title back in the mid-90s. If you are a fan of the series you should already have this game, if you want an MMO and WoW is not for you, then this is definitely the best alternative unless you enjoy lots of grinding."
Positive,fav game ever
Positive,"Been playing this game semi-casually for the last 2 years. The game can be played at any pace you desire while surrounded by either great company or just great scenery. The game is wide on several levels, without a linear way to be played. I ended up creating a guild which has evolved to become the given place to be several evenings a week where we as a group decide to take on the more difficult challenges the game has to offer."
Positive,"If you want a true TES online experience, have more patience, this is not it. But if you want a really good MMO, ESO is one of the best choices.Even without any DLC, expect hundreds of hours of good content."
Positive,Makes me cream
Positive,really good game to play very additive
Positive,At first I thought it was shit and now i know its shit but also fun in a way so eh
Positive,"I still haven't figured out how to beat the city guards.Update: They haven't slept yet, so that plan seems to be a stalemate."
Positive,"Literally spent too many hours in this game. Wonderful for RP, if you're into that. Fun characters and great stories, and tons and tons of content. Plus, HOUSING."
Positive,After 600 hours I still find reasons to play... it's for you to decide whether that's good or bad
Positive,"This is one of the best games I have played in a long time. Largely, things don't change so much that you always have to replace your gear to continue into new challenges - but there are always new builds and new ways of playing as the devs give out more little things over time. Fantastic game with a few minor bugs (don't let the fears run you into walls!)"
Positive,"Been downloading updates for 9 hours and its only 9% done so havent even got to play itHowever the loading screen is pretty good so i think its safe to assume this is a good game, I would even go so far as to say one of the best ganes I have played"
Positive,"Amazing Game, lots of content, the base content is enough... i have 300 hrs, and doing my last alliance of the base content!! Wuthout couting many other base content stuff... highly recommend ESO plus if you plan on investing time here."
Positive,"ESO is love, ESO is life."
Positive,one of the best MMO RPG games u can play  guys very cool
Positive,"Its come a long way from when it released, if you bought it on launch and were very disappointed like i was, i would give it another go. Its a great game now."
Positive,Played it on PS4 and i loved it! i highly recommend this game to anyone that loves the Elder Scrolls games
Positive,"For a sword and sorcery game with all kinds of story content, PvP, trading, 1st and 3rd person play, and lots of shenanigans This game has beaten all my single player games for my attention. Also the on-line community has been awesome."
Positive,"After knowing how launch was from AngryJoe, I knocked this off my wish list for a long time.  A family member told me how it was now and I convinced my friend to hop into it with me.  My friend is very picky in games he invests his time into.  After playing it he has become addicted non stop wanting to play it when we have free time.  Something I have noticed is that there are multiple reward systems in place to replay content you've finished with either random dungeons, Undaunted pledges, and gear farming among going into harder difficulties.  This game is easy to get into harder to master.  I continue to dump my free time into this game as making new characters/classes is encouraged and fun to change up gameplay."
Positive,"If you have liked Skyrim, then you will enjoy and come to like the ESO. Set in the second age, it's going back in time for sure. However everyone will spot something they remember for sure."
Positive,"I already play this game but not through steam.I've 2 Caracter lvl 50 with 300 champion lvl.for me this game is almost equals to World of warcraft for the pve about his content.- all the quest are not repetitive,- you can improve you caracter by your own choice, like you can create a tank heal with the race you want.- lore is good and the lore of each DLC are pretty imersiv too.- i do not test the PVP longer to say this is good so for now.- All the DLC are pretty expansive. their is none bundle to buy them all just the ESO PLUS is usefull to have them all (without the big DLC like blackwood and else).- Just with the inital game and Morrowind DLC you've thousand of hours to play and this is pretty good."
Positive,I think this game has so much to offer! I keep coming back for more.Its all worth it
Positive,"good game, good job devs made, this story continues about 20 years, and its still interesting to play"
Positive,"Very fun overall game, recommend playing with friends!"
Positive,"is fun too much to do though, so make sure u have your anxiety meds on deck lmao"
Positive,"This game has so much content, whether you enjoy PvP, questing, dungeons, trading or even housing, you'll definitely find something in this game that suits your play style. This game saved me from going crazy during quarantine."
Positive,"If you enjoy Skyrim and the Elder Scrolls overall, this is a fun entry into the series.  I have mostly played solo through the world and found the stories very fun and engaging, the quests unique with interesting characters, and some decisions that provoke some real thought as a player.  I've dipped my toes in dungeons and pvp as well, both of which are fast paced but entertaining."
Positive,"It took me a while to get sucked in to this game, but when I did, I greatly enjoyed it. Funnily enough, it was the daily crafting writs that did it for me. They take 30 seconds to complete and give you an extremely generous amount of gold and experience. That instant gratification then motivated me to explore the world, go on quests... and before I knew it, I was deeply immersed into the game. The main storyline is great, the plots in the quests are engaging and interactive, and even the ones that you've done before have re-playability. Playing with friends and delving into dungeons is a lot of fun. Greatly recommended."
Positive,You can be a kitty. :3
Positive,www.google.com: how do I do the dragon shout
Positive,"I'm a long term MMORPG gamer and thought I'd try ESO as a free trial.  My first impressions led me to notice the menu system for information and travel and to notice the combat interface which is well made with a simplified combat bar and a diverse amount of combat skills and options available, This game makes it very easy to get into groups with other gamers and has a guild system where you can join more than one guild depending on your desired playstyles..  I've never seen a MMORPG with such a varied amount of content that can go from very simple to a time consuming legacy to master. I've found the other players on the EU server very friendly, helpfull, and mature and as a new player I had many questions.If you like RPG games and MMORPG games you can play this game on a budget and you'll have enough content for hours, weeks, months of content and gameplay.  I would recommend a ESO plus membership as this will give you more content and a bonus of an unlimited resource bag which is clearly a huge advantage.As with many games your equipment can define how well you survive and last in the game.  The game is well balanced for new players up to lvl 50 and equipment is constantly being changed.The crafting system is the easiest I have ever seen, and yet it is still a lot of fun. The harder part is getting the recipes you want which take looting or travelling around.The game has a feature to use add ons which many players use to enhance their menus and playstyles, and there is a host of downloadable content available to keep you occupied.I thoroughly recommend this game where there is tonnes of story driven content by some very well known actors in places.  Be warned some adventures are longer than others with lots of opportunity for fun and adventure.Game Rating 5/5Game Value for money 5/5"
Positive,"i get lost in this game for hours, i always seem to be on a quest and end up no where near it! i am enjoying it and i highly recommend"
Positive,"Love the game, but not the fact that it's pretty restrictive if you haven't bought most of the dlcs."
Positive,"This game is definitely worth your time. You will enjoy the levelling up (I do), some of you may hate it cause it's pure grind but at the end of the day the  grind is rewarding. It's such a vast game that you will always have something to do here, the daily dungeons can get boring but they help a lot in getting to lvl 50. Just get a game, Youtube a video for beginner's guide and you are set."
Positive,The guddest game.
Positive,If you like Any of the Elder Scrolls games you will love this!
Positive,very fun game so far
Positive,"Dope, nice game"
Positive,"So far I am really loving the story line, side missions, and community. Overall, I am having a blast,"
Positive,love the game
Positive,"It can be hard to step away from an MMO, especially when you also Role Play, and ESO is no exception! As a former WoW player, I've gotta say this game is both more fun and more challenging. You can quest your way up to the max if you want to go the solo route, or you can do dungeons, PvP, RP (as I mentioned)... There are daily quests, crafting, player housing of all sorts of varieties, and endless lore to keep you intrigued! I highly recommend this game!"
Positive,Do you want to disappear into a rabbit hole. Go out on Great adventures see the most beautiful art. Every part of this game is special. From harvesting for materials fighting monsters following storyline. This game overs the best of so many worlds for single player to full blown multiplayer. For year of fun on PVE single or group content to years of fun on PVP for single to multiplayer groups. This is the game for you come join.
Positive,it is amazing
Positive,Probably the best game I have ever played.
Positive,Bought this game because my wife wanted to play with me. Now she's my ex but the game is great.
Positive,"I have played every Elder Scrolls game to release. I can say with confidence that ESO is a great elder scrolls game, however not a great MMO. The MMO side of the game makes the combat a little dull, trying to blend typical RPG combat with tab-targeting MMO style combat. With that being said, I do recommend this game. The vast amount of content available for free can't be understated, and I would be wrong to state otherwise. If you like Elder Scrolls, or you enjoy RPGs, play this game now."
Positive,"Endless content, amazing biomes, every NPC is fully voiced, countless varieties of animals/monsters with their own skills to fight. I can see why we haven't received Elder Scrolls 6 yet, lot of attention being used in this game."
Positive,Great game! A must play in 2021. One of the best MMOs out there with tons of expansion content so far.. There is a ton of lore related content for elder scrolls in all the areas. Story quests are way better than WOW generic kill quests or gather quests as they are actually engaging and well made. Playing with sub is a must since crafting items is a nightmare to handle without the crafting bag. I would recommend to get subscription as early as possible to save time in inventory management. Only setback is the pvp matches are limited and hard to play for new players compared to WOW or swtor. 9/10 overall rating. Great game
Positive,"By far my most preferred MMO. Good lore, helpful community leads into a fun over all experience. The freedom to level in a multitude of ways is quite enjoyable, it doesn't feel like you have to level through just hordes, or questing.....but but are time sinks as to be expected. Expansions come out quarterly for added content with new major expansions once a year. Lots of purchasable cosmetics, as well as some unfortunate pay to win mechanics. How ever having done the grind to 160cp more then one time it never comes across as more then a huge time saver. The purchasable XP scrolls are given away for free quite often to a point where i have stacks with out actually buying them but it is a present mechanic. having played WOW BDO FF14 and a few more over the years, I always return home to eso!"
Positive,It is definitelly way over my expectations. I give 5 stars.Tons of youtube tutorials makes life much much easier when u play first time. I strongly recommend to watch few tutorials for beginners and to install some add-ons if u play it for the first time.I find myself so excited doing quests (at last main quests)... and this is really a big deal. I did not find such ingame storie lines since Baldur s Gate !
Positive,"Mr. Howard and team killed it, it's flexible, innovative, and they welcomed female staff members on board!"
Positive,"For a player who is not really into MMOs, I really enjoy my time with Elder Scrolls Online. For solo players/non MMO/Skyrim players you can play this game as a single player adventure ie Skyrim because the quest in this game is top notch, You'll care about characters and their backstory. This goes for main quest and side quest, hell even the story connected to the dungeons are great. For the more MMO heavy players, you can venture into dungeons, PVP, crafting, guild, Alliance vs Alliance etc. There's something for each player in this game. Give it a try! This game has an amazing community compared to other MMOs.A must try for elder scrolls fans!"
Positive,great with friends.
Positive,"its ok, its an mmo so its inherently trash. But it has a shit tonne of tes lore so theres that, its combat is trash, and its souless asf but its fine."
Positive,looking like a big fool like a big fool a big fool looking all like it like a what it is the big fool the big looking like fool the looking big fool the fool
Positive,"Absolutely love this game and recommend it to anyone who enjoys story games, RPGs, and CO-OP. You can play the entire game with as many friends as you want. I never get tired of this game as there is always so much to do and so many different types of characters you can be, from a necromancer, to a blade wielder, to a vampire, etc!"
Positive,"I used to hate this game immensely. Even asked for refund before, but got cancelled. Kinda glad though as I decided to give it another chance since it got cancelled and I spent money to buy it. It turned out to be a fun game if you are willing to spend time into it. Rich with content. I always thought the game combat mechanic to be as same as Skyrim, but forgot it is a MMORPG. But it is still fun. Don't get me started on ESO Plus because it is very addicting, like Skooma.However, if you're from Asia, or maybe Africa, and looking to buy this game, forget it. ZOS seems to forget that there are still huge number of players from Asia and Pacific Oceania. The server is so bad since Blackwood update. It used to be already bad but can be comprehend, but now it is even worse. Consistent ping 999+ even with great internet, and the best that I could have on certain hour (12am EDT - 6am EDT) is 250+. All because of ZOS refused to make Asia server. I get it, it may not be a very profitable investment and I totally support the decision, but they could at least upgrade their ""Mega"" server to be decent enough for us Asians/Pacific Oceania players. With the problem regarding the ping, I can't fully play the game as some part of the game is PVP. Do you have any idea what it is like PVP'ing with 750ms? I wonder how opposing players see me during PVP.All I ask is something below 400ms and it is good enough for me. Above that, is just horrible. Is it still a good game? Yes, definitely. Do you need to be patience? Yes, very much especially with the game going on frequent server maintenance plus the ping issue."
Positive,It is a very good game to play with friends and i have fun doing it.
Positive,ESO GOOD AF!!!!!
Positive,i have nice day
Positive,Para haber terminado el tutorial en este tiempo esta bastante bien / To have finished the tutorial at this time it is quite good
Positive,Top 2 best mmo
Positive,I'ts one of the best MMORPG i've ever played
Positive,Only one word that could describe ESO (Massive!!)
Positive,"I came with low expectations, due to the game having a bad reputation, and it being an MMORPG.At the same time I came with some high expectations, since it was an Elder scrolls game, and Skyrim was perfection itself..Ive spent 1500 ingame hours. Let me say this: - If you came for the content - this is the game. The quests are unique, always interesting, never repetitive. The dungeons are gorgeous pieces of art, and the storylines are spot on as always. Immersion? its got heaps of it. Theres casual housing systems, social guilds, minigame content like archeology, crafting, collecting things for collections... You never get bored here. You never feel completely in control, like you know it all or did it all, learned it all or mastered it all. Before the next update is released, you wont have finished much of what already exists ingame from seven years of development.- If you came for the PVP and, social competition about whom did the most amazing build and whatnot, dont bother. Theres constant updates, tweaks, nerfs, glitches, lag, skill buttons not firing. Queue systems that break and unstable servers leading to long maintenance hours that far surpass the beforehand given time/date. This isnt your fancier version of WoW, and if you walk in here expecting that you will be disappointed, overwhelmed, angry at the strategic mechanics and the learning curve, the ammount of details and choices you will be forced to make without having anyone there to tell you what to choose.If you subscribe to one game and one game only, where you want to be fully immersed and at home, it should be this one."
Positive,I Was hoping for a Skyrim online experience but instead i got Oblivion Online. Awesome game so much fun. A great combat system and endless quest to have fun with your friends for days and days. 10/10
Positive,So far a pretty good game.
Positive,GOOD GAME MUST BUY
Positive,"im no lifeing this game and im enjoying it, its worth the money i personally love it and it is alot of fun i mean its and elder scrolls game what else do i need to say? a big YES from me"
Positive,Uh yeah give it a try its free and fun
Positive,"E.S.O. IS A GOOD GAME RUINED BY THE WAY ZENIMAX CHOSE TO MONETIZE THE GAME. ALSO IT'S INFERIOR TO W.O.W.ESO Pros: - Interesting story, interesting world, very very good soundtrack.- Quests are engaging, even side quests have good story, voice acting is top notch for an MMO.- Class system + specialization very interesting. Each class can fill each of the 3 main roles while feeling very different from each other.- Devs respected Elder Scrolls Lore, no major logic loops, I.P. was treated with respect.- The update system of 1 major content release per year + a few extensions (not sure how they're called) seems to be better than WOW's big patches with a new expansion every 2 years.- Crafting system. (nothing to explain here, i just bloody like it).ESO Cons:- First and foremost Zenimax wants to sell you a full price game, have you subscribe to them AND have an IRL cashshop. This spoils the game in terms of things to do outside character progression. Also, when you're greedier than  Activision-Blizzard you truly are lost.- Mount is obtainable too early in game (lvl 10 for free) also too many Wayshrines in each zones. Why create a beautiful world if people will just zappy zappy teleport all over.- Daily rewards, daily quests, etc. basically everything that will get you addicted to the game is presented too early. Give a new player at least 20-25 levels to get used to the UI, the way quests work etc. Don't bombard me from lvl 1 with 100+ rewards if I jump through your hoops. Leave the hoops for later like WOW does.- World scaling is a bit weird, for me it went good, didn't have any issues killing mobs etc, but if unlucky or a newbie you can shoot yourself in the foot.TL;DR : ESO is a hooker and WOW is your girlfriend. The first wants your money upfront before giving you the goods, while the 2nd one gets you addicted ""organically"" before stealing your wealth and sanity. I like the game and will continue to play it, but for a new person not into MMOs everything is happening wayy too fast and people will get overwhelmed ."
Positive,I love this game. strongly recommend this game for people who are looking  mmo and Love Elder Scrolls as well. I have never subscribed to this game but I can enjoy it. because of that this game has become one of the games that I have bought the most dlc
Positive,"Very fun, a lot better than it was when it launched"
Positive,please help cant stop playing
Positive,yeah it's alright
Positive,"I tried to do the main quest, got lost, activated 18 side quests, was under powered for all the side quests, finally did the main quest, was too op for the main quest and 7 hours in a still don't know what i'm doing"
Positive,good and fun
Positive,"A lot of fun for a mmo because I have been hard pressed to enjoy any since WoW got lame imo. Yet somehow this one sucked me in and i think its a large part of the fact that they maintained their roots from the game they came from which I immensely loved the 3 games I played before this(Morrowind, Oblivion and of course Skyrim). Give it a try! Doesnt to me feel as grindy like WoW got for me and the battlefield is really fun albeit difficult at times!"
Positive,"wait what? I said, I'm just going to try it. already at 8 hours?.. @@"
Positive,A nice game to be honest maybe a little bit to centered around pay to play tactics but i see a lot of potential in this game
Positive,"When they put a server in Latin America, it may wich stop collecting dust in my library, and please assholes a Spanish translation!!"
Positive,I have been playing this game for a little over 300 hours and i feel like i only scratched the surface and there is still so much more to discover. I hope someone else will find this game as exciting as i did
Positive,Its pretty fun some of the best quest in a mmo give it a try
Positive,"I really like this game. I played it a long time ago and then stepped away to play other MMO's like WoW and GW2. Coming back to this after a long break is so refreshing, especially coming from WoW. I really love how you can build the character you want. You want to make a caster who wear all heavy armor and swings a 2H greatsword? Go for it. I still have so much to do and see in this but I would definitely recommend this to people looking for a fun MMO."
Positive,"One of the best games I've ever played. I'm new to online playing (outside of a little Dota) and I can't be more happy about this one. It caters for both very serious players and people who just want to have some fun. You're not pressured into being competitive and magically good like you usually find with online gaming. This game gives you space to grow on your own pace and join in on the more serious side of things when you're ready.It's a genuine escape if I want to relax after a long day, but also has so much to offer when I'm in the mood for playing with friends."
Positive,"I remember in the early days, this game had such a bad wrap. I avoided it at all costs, thinking it just was not a good game despite me loving the Elder Scrolls series so much. My current boyfriend introduced me to ESO, and for that I am so grateful. This game is amazing! I wish I would've give it a chance sooner. So many quests, and customization to your character. From PvE to PvP, there is a wide variety of builds you can create ( For multiple characters ) , and overall just feels like one of the best MMOs I have played. I personally am mostly playing PvE, questing, crafting, etc. I heavily recommend this game. It runs very well, is visually appealing, and their frequent updates add more and more content! Fun to play with friends, and overall is, and will always be one of my favorite games!"
Positive,"This game is freakin awesome. It's not really Skyrim online, but it definitely is super fun. Played it for hundreds of hours alone and another few hundred hours with my GF over COVID quarantine to stay connected and it was great. You can quest together, battle together, do dungeons together, PvP is pretty fun, etc. If you play often, I'd recommend getting ESO+. It's a life saver bc inventory space becomes a problem really quickly. The only issue is that now I can't hop back into the game whenever bc all my chars' inventories are full, so I'm waiting til life clears up a bit again to hop back in with ESO+ (no point in paying if I can't play often). So for now, I'm relegated to lurking on the ESO forums until I can play for good again :P"
Positive,"Mehhhh. Love to hate it. Hands down the most toxic relationship I've ever been in. It pulls you in with the fast paced, adrenaline rush of something promising. Expertly camouflaging all the toxic traits until you're utterly elated. You think, this is it, you've found the one.. Ha! Suddenly, you're Padme, paralyzed in a choke hold. All the red flags you've been ignoring become impossible to overlook. So you decide to give it some space and see other games.. Some time goes by and you hear rumors of improvement and change.. You should know it ain't never gonna change, but you stick around because it, very occasionally, does that lil thing you like better than anything you've experienced... Giving you false hope that this time things could be different.. Then it continuously stomps on your hopes and dreams... And the toxic cycle starts again."
Positive,"This isn't the newest game, but it's got so much content and so many players, and new stuff constantly coming out, so it's always fresh"
Positive,I liked it! What's more to ask?
Positive,It is a good game
Positive,It plays a little differently than WoW and took a couple days to get used to but I'm liking it so far.
Positive,"It's a beautiful game with tons of lore rabbit holes to wander down. There's something here for everyone; the solo gamers, the guildies, the endgame players, the casuals, and the RP community. Fantastic game with lots fun thrown in."
Positive,one of my absolute favorite mmos. i just keep coming back to it
Positive,Very enjoyable game.
Positive,Great game story line very good and big open world game
Positive,"A simple, fun exploration game."
Positive,"i have over 15k hours on this game across multiple platforms and to say im addicted is an understatement lol with thousands of hours of content and so many paths of gameplay to chose from, i cannot recommend this game enough. now that im on pc(the best version) my enjoyment of the game is even more so. zenimax has made an amazing mmo deserving of praise. Sure it has its issues, some worse than others but its still worth it. this game has been basically the only game ive played since its release and i regret none of it"
Positive,Good MMO. Not your typical tab targeting system. Beginner friendly where a level one player can play with a level 160 player. Strong story arcs. With plenty to do. Easy dungeon system with little wait time for tanks and healers.
Positive,"Better than WoW.More involved than FFXIV.And a far more established universe than other options out there.It's not, and never will be ""Skyrim Online"" (Praise Sithis for that.) but as an MMO, it holds it's own and survived a very, very rough launch to become one of the best options on the market. Go for it, especially if you're in to the lore of TES."

Positive,Good Game. People who like D&D or people who like roleplay video games would love it.
Positive,"Little broken, but all around a good game. Lots of stuff to try. Would not recommend buying it if you don't have the money for ESO plus though."
Positive,is game play game
Positive,"it is so good, and runs fine on my trahs PC!"
Positive,Just amazing would suggest playing with friends though.Still love the game even as a solo player now
Positive,Very good lot of things to do. Big fun all time never stop yes please some more.
Positive,If u are looking for an online mmorpg to play for a long run then this is the right game fr u
Positive,"Skooma, mud crabs, and lusty argonians."
Positive,with almost 2000 hours of game play i most definitely recommend  ESO to anyone who played skyrim and loved the lore surrounding that game. ESO is full of great voice acted story lines and a huge amount of lore you can find through story lines or books.
Positive,I loved the mmorpg style very similar to WoW but there are areas I don't like because they are not possible to complete if you don't have a friend to jump in on your pc and do the quest when  you have Vertigo ( fear of heights)
Positive,"The game was strictly designed on a spectrum of outcomes with maximums that could never be reached due to their Denominators, or what gamers call, Hard and Soft caps. These denominators become counter productive making a variety of character setups no better than the other.  As there are 6 classes and 10 races total in the MMO, the advantages and disadvantages make no difference as each will end up with nearly the same top values of offense and defense.  The racial perks will allow a player to race up to a soft and hard cap sooner, but will immediately prove more beneficial to allocate wasted stats into inferior areas of character development.  This ugly reality of denominators diminishes any one Build from being superior to the other. I do recommend this game to new players because it will be fresh and enjoyable every step of the way. Unfortunately, like all games, there is always a downside. As the relaxed enjoyment of the game experience revolutionizes itself into more combat oriented content, the exploration of becoming a better fighter will eventually hit its hard limit.  Having to waste more time and in-game resources to produce the many permutations of gear and stat allocation in hopes of improving your character, it sinks real deep as the Development Balancing efforts become crystal clear. Whatever goal you strive for you will reach effortlessly, but it will be no better than a different class or race. Aside from the sad truths, this game offers a lot of Story Telling and is a great game to experience at your leisure."
Positive,good game love how its based of off skyrim :D
Positive,great game for the fans of elder scrolls
Positive,Ye. It ight.
Positive,We enjoy this game a lot! There is always something to do and it feels like a new game every day.  I recommend this game also if you are looking for a couples game.
Positive,"ESO is a fun game if you're looking for a game with a massive amount of content and you have the time to commit to going through that content.This game is highly complex and unfortunately it does not have even the most essential explanations about some of the many detailed aspects of the world, so you'll wind up having to go to 3rd party sources if you want to figure out how to do various things.The physics of the virtual world feel a bit dated. For example, you can't mantle up onto ledges like in most other games, so climbing is tedious at best. Also the direction your character is facing does not correlate to where you are looking when in first-person view. So when playing in co-op with people, it's really challenging when you are trying to give directions or interact with other players. Additionally, there doesn't seem to be any support for in-game voice chatting (like in most games) so you literally have to TYPE messages while fighting through dungeons etc. which can be a really painful process. Many of these issues and others (like not having a mini-map !?!?) can be solved via 3rd party plugins.Outside of the items listed above and outside of the many other out-dated features and the incredibly confusing UI, it's a good game. I don't expect it to retain much popularity as time moves forward though, especially if another MMO comes in with a more modern game engine and user-friendly UI."
Positive,"I like how there's more diversity than some other MMORPGs. I like the questing. The voice acting is okay, not as great as KotOR, but decent. Sometimes it's funny, so I'll listen to the stories the NPCs tell. I like the class I chose--it fits my style of playing."
Positive,I find the game very fun when playing with buddies or when I'm on my own. As long as I have a balance of the two I'm very happy with playing this game.
Positive,"Saw a lot of comments complaining about certain mechanics of the game when I first decided to try it out and basically feel like I need to give a review just to let anyone know that those people are wrong. Biggest thing I see people complaining about armor sets and to be honest in most MMOs you only have a select few to choose from and you spend all your time grinding to a high enough level to use something you might come across just to equip and find out it doesn't match anything or that it is crap compared to the basic rewarded armor that literally everyone is running around in... Well in this game the armor is based off you level and yeah a lot of the cool armor you get in the beginning isn't much different from the higher level stuff, but that is because its based off of the different races and factions and you can get cool armor right at the start and don't have to settle for raggedy sub-par aesthetically speaking armor (obviously at lower levels the stats don't compare to higher level armor but you can still look cool).I don't know to sum things up that was the biggest complaint I saw people making that I though was ridiculous because so what if low level armor looks the same as high level armor if its cool armor and there are plenty of choices and different styles to unlock as you progress. On that note the graphics in this game are amazing and the armors and weapons in the game are no exception anyone complaining this stuff I just feel like I don't even know what to say to them. Its obvious a lot of hard work went into making all the components in this game and it looks nice. So there is that...Another thing the real time combat and amount of customization is really something you don't get in a lot of MMOs so I really love that about this game also. The only thing I've ever noticed is the champion point system was really unbalanced, but that just got changed and I'm actually waiting on that update to download as I write this. From what I've seen this update looks like a fix to the only flaw I've encountered from playing so far. So basically this game is really quality and now is a good time to get into it!"
Positive,"YES MAM, Very big world nice game. WE NEED THOSE CHAMPS"
Positive,I THINK GOOD GAME
Positive,i love it it is fun good team stuff like that
Positive,best game in the world
Positive,Definitely not the traditional elder scrolls experience. Not bad overall though.
Positive,"TESO seems to be a rather civilized game rich in story, lore and scenery.There also seems to be a more civil social environment without much 'trash' talking, denigration or other verbal abuse, though when there is, it is usually put down quickly.  There are helpful guilds and helpful players which contribute to a fun experience.  The graphics are exceptional and game play robust"
Positive,"What more can be said. It's a great game, tons and tons of content with more coming all the time. I have two accounts and my Steam account isn't even my main one. Usually just use it to play together with my kids."
Positive,is very good game
Positive,To much content. kinda stupid eso+ doesnt include the latest chapter
Positive,yes indeed cheese
Positive,when i go through my eso phase i'm never seen for 2 month intervals
Positive,"The best MMO out there right now! Great graphics, gameplay, endless things to do. My favorite part of this game is exploring the armor sets! It's such a fun way to create goals for your character and test things out. Honestly, for me - it's not playable without addons. I need to know my dps, and have a mini map. It's essential! The treasure hunting is beyond fun, so many mini games to keep you occupied. Lots of group content which is so important in MMO's! Combat is a blast and I just don't get bored. Been playing off and on for years, definitely recommend if you want something to commit to! :)"
Positive,"Finest MMO but needs patiencePros:- Story telling is amazing- Quest are better than any other MMO most quests are story based not fetch/kill quest- Music, do i need even mentions music of an Elder scrolls game?- Community is Friendly and guilds are very active.- Cyrodil is HUGE! its so massive.- Dungeons, new players get to experience dungeon from lvl 10 and they are pretty good, ofcourse normal dungeons are easy. But Veteran mode is really challenging.- Crafting, this is my only MMO where i actually prefer to do crafting. Its different it pulls for some odd reason.Cons:- UI, because the game is released in Consoles, PC users have to add so many Mods to compensate for Zenimax not providing QOL changes to UI. It is worst that Keybindings are character based and not account based.. there are so many elements in UI that makes u pull ur hair.. But luckily we have Mods. However u need to have around 30 mandatory mods, that just shows how badly designed UI it is for PC players.- Combat: i would give combat 7/10,  its not as good as Guild wars 2 but again it is really not bad.. but it feels something is just pulling you whenever you swing your sword. Combat does require improvement but i think Zenimax wants just add new content rather than improving the game.- Inventory management: it is awful, i have to spend 20mins everyday to clean up my inventory, the material bank is accessible only for the sub players. Which is the only thing that is paywalled. i am pretty sure if ESO makes Material bank like Guild wars 2 people would be happy to spend money or crowns.. Overall the game is amazing it is a buy to play game, but you can play this game without spending money just by converting your gold to crowns, then unlock most dlcs. 8/10."
Positive,I have over four thousand hours across two platforms. Used to really enjoy the game but over the years I've watched it get worse and worse.
Positive,I love this game. I am in love with this game. Would 10/10 Pledge of Mara tf out of this game. Thank you. That is all.
Positive,"I loved all the TES games and while I was a bit sceptic about ESO at first (different setting and story, etc. from what I was used to), I have to admit I really came to love this game. The wold is huge, there are tons of quests and frequent events. And what's more important, there are frequent new content patches. More than 700 hours into the game at the time of this review, I have only even scratched the surface. The downside is, that the game has quite a high price tag. The base game is fairly cheap, but every chapter has the price of a full game. Getting all in one for new players is a cheaper option but with prices of about 70 to 80 USD still hefty. On the other side, being involved in development myself, Zenimax needs to make money, since the game itself is free to play. And free to play in this regard means, that you can really play for free and enjoy the game. In my guild most players are free players. If you dont need access to all the DLCs or prefer to buy those you need and you can make without the crafting bag, you will be completely fine. The other benefit you get as subscriber is the monthly free crowns, which you can use to buy DLCs out of the store and use them even without a subscription or you could buy mounts, houses, or whatever you want. Aside from my subscription and the price paid for the game and chapters, I have not spent a single buck for the game in the store.  If you like TES and the world surrounding it, you will probably like ESO, albeit maybe needing some time to get used to it. I also have to point out, that the game is quite complex and in depth. So you should expect a high learning curve at first. You should look for sites like ESO University and do your reading in the game. I think, that even after about two years in, there is still quite a bit of stuff, I don't understand. Which is just proof to how extensive this game is. So really cool."
Positive,Hell Good game. Very Fun worth Money!This game is better than league of legends.
Positive,Great RPG. Feels open world even though its not a sandbox
Positive,love this game i have no idea what i'm supposed to do cause every time i get a quest and try to complete it i get a new one...
Positive,very fun game if you play it seriously - but you gotta invest time into it to enjoy because it has a steep learning curve
Positive,Pineapple on pizza is a no no FOr mE
Positive,"Fun, lots of stuff to do, and the Expansions are fun and rewarding. Starting off as a new player can be EXTREMELY confusing especially if you buy the bundle expansions. A nice feature would be a 'new player' guide so they can easily look for the main story of the game instead of being bombarded by tons of new expansion information. It's overwhelming, and you most of the time need to look up where the main story is.I've played this game before starting on steam, when it first came out, and it is miles ahead of what it used to be. If you're a fan of great graphics, fun storylines, good side quests, and achievements, you'll enjoy this game. If you like to craft, i'd recommend an ESO Plus subscription for extra storage."
Positive,"after playing this game for 700 hours, i can conclude that is it the road to being a twig. The bloat federation does not approve of such twigness. PRAISE THE BLOAT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU WAN TO SKINNY.HAIL THE BLOATNESS"
Positive,This has always been my favorite game. The quests are enjoyable and the story lines are all well written. 10/10 would recommend .
Positive,"what happens in ESO, stays in ESO."
Positive,worth the money..awesome gameplay
Positive,its alright i guess
Positive,you can spend more time playing this than doing a phd and still not have everything done.
Positive,"The game is gigantic, each quest feels unique and the characters are written very well. The graphics are also stunningly beautiful."
Positive,"yeah, im a beyblade werewolf"
Positive,This is a very fun game with friends or on your own because you are likely to make some here. Having a wide selection of armour and weapon skins you can express your style all while looking around at the beautiful landscapes. New zones coming each year along with new dungeons and sets. Sets are the beauty of this game. Almost an unlimited combinations of these different items can change the way you play and what your role is in a party. With the hybridisation update a while back. Play styles can be versatile.
Positive,"wait, there's a main storyline?"
Positive,The name's Obadiah Clartartan! HURAAAAAAH!
Positive,"Hands down the best MMORPG I have ever played and I played *many*. It offers the most complex and lively world-experience I have yet found with any MMORPG. I will try to explain why.Other than in other MMORPGs, the world isn't just divided into areas where players grind to reach certain levels. Rather there's lore-, cosmetic-, skill-driven activities everywhere in Tamriel and you're free to go wherever you please. Want a specific title? There's this neat quest in this far-away region over there. Want a specific polymorph (changes your entire character's looks completely)? There's this quest in this country to be found. Looking for specific gear? Visit these overworld bosses there.... and so on. The fact there's many different places with their own things to get from and discover, no matter the player's level, makes zones, instead of specific level areas for specific level people, a uniquely lively world.This brings us to the next thing: Quests. Damn I hated questing in most MMORPGs I played. They had uninteresting stories, grindy tasks, laughable interactions between characters... Not so in Eso. ESO offers fun and compelling quests throughout — not just to level up, but to be rewarded with deeper insight into the world's lore, unique rewards and to experience compelling characters and stories. All quests are fully voice-acted on top and have fair and challenging, instead of overly grindy, tasks. That puts questing in ESO to a level hardly any other multiplayer-RPG can compete with — for every level character.Man, where do I go from here. There's hardly anything the game lacks in terms of character development and offerings for all playstyles. Want to become a vampire and feast on NPCs? Can do that. Werewolf? Equally possible. Thief, assassin...? You can do all that. Also, PVP is very deep and offers countless possible builds for every class to experiment with. I am pretty sure, whatever you're looking for can be found here.Regards!"
Positive,"great mmo, i already have 44.8 hours and i love it"
Positive,Words cannot describe how much i hate the filthy-blooded Argonian race
Positive,"Like any other Elder Scrolls game, with all the trimmings. 'I'm still free to play'  I'd totally recommend this as an rpg, let alone an mmo. Many world regions will have their own 'main' story & side-quests also; as well as lesser dungeons. And there's plenty of law to find & learn.  There are a lot of pay to play type elements in this game too, but one can manage around them easily if running as a causal player.The game does however have a finite lifespan, as ultimately you're playing variations of the same thing over different locations.  In and of itself a fairly standard mmo expectation that, but it does start to get a bit old. And add to that higher end 'community' content requires hardcore hours to grind gear and practice, for both single but more-so group content, it can become more like 'another job' than a fun game.  And newer content/updates often means nothing quite works as it did in gear and damage, then you've to grind and spec a-new.. grrr. This happens a lot.Things to know:  You can do the main storyline and many of the side-quests single player, but some of the side-quests and a chunk of the dungeons are set-up to be 'group'. This means you can run through with other players you run into, or form a team; but there's NO VOICE CHAT in-game.. just a clunky txt message thing. There are however plenty of Discord groups for all levels of play; many associated with player guilds too.  It can seem a little overwhelming at first, the menus and controls etc, the size of the game.. the ammount to learn.. but it is designed for you to simply take things at your own pace and take your time, so no need to panic. And the game sets off at a very sedate pace.There's a huge chunk of content available to buy too, additional world-map areas etc; much of it available within the 9£ subscription package, but world-map content 'chapters' are still at a fixed ££ fee on top of subscription. I'd advise playing through the main original base -game story first, if it tickles you enough only then give thought as to subscriptions or buying extra content."
Positive,still love this!
Positive,A really enjoyable game with a lot of content to explore. The mechanics and feeling of the game are a bit finicky at first but you get used to it very quick. The community is also quite nice.
Positive,If you enjoy Elder Scrolls series this game is perfect for you. Just take your time grinding and do what you want. Its about the journey not the end game. (My opinion anyways)
Positive,Better than WoW.

Positive,This game is crack send help.
Positive,"Excellent game!This is the best MMORPG out there in my opinion.the stories and quests are excellent, very intriguing.They've done a good job delivering the lore and history of the Elder Scrolls franchise.Good combat system, Good Stat and Skill system, the crafting system is very hard to master but so is the game itself. It is a huge world full of opportunities, side quests, stories and wonderful places to explore. You will find yourself investing a lot of time in completing each area's objectives, leveling up your character, leveling up your skills, leveling up your crafting skills if you wish to and getting into the PVP part of the game which is fun non the less.if by any means you find yourself completing so much of the game that you actually don't know what to do, most of the DLC's are actually access to even more parts of Tamriel.it is a 9/10 on my list only because there are a lot of  ""Pay to Play"" elements like the subscription system which gives to access to a crafting bag and a lot of more necessary stuff in the game which actually make it more fun and less grindy."
Positive,its fun to play solo and with freinds
Positive,"Atavar, where are you?"
Positive,"Its a great game. I used to play the offline versions of the game and was interesting since then, but the fact that i can play it with my friends makes it even better."
Positive,"Very detailed MMO. So many different things to do. Every NPC comment of any substance is fully voiced with well-written comments, making even simple quests immersive and interesting. Many quests offer difficult choices as well, making them truly thought-provoking. The wayshrine system makes traveling the vast world very easy. Combat is fast but complex with a limited number of skills available at a time, but with two skill bars available to switch between, linked to different weapons. I've played over 100 hours already, and I've not even completely finished the story content for a single one of the main zones yet, although I've mainly been working my way through Summerset. There's that much content. Like Skyrim, you can just wander around and fight bosses or craft and ignore the main story, or you can systematically work your way through the quests, or a mix of different things. Most regular quests can be soloed, but between dungeons, PvP, world bosses, etc, there's plenty of group content as well. The world is truly beautiful, detailed, and interesting. NPC portraits get a bit samey after a while, but they're reasonably varied and effectively represent their characters, especially with the wide variety of outfits available as well. Speaking of outfits, the collectible options are truly vast: hundreds of different styles and pieces of clothing, armor, etc. Not to mention mounts and pets. This is a game I won't get tired of for a long time."
Positive,Coffee is the best healer in the world :)
Positive,I Love it!
Positive,pretty sweet I guess
Positive,"This game has come a long way. It was quite mediocre during it's first couple of years, but it has really come into it's own with more recent expansions and content."
Positive,I am having a blast playing this game!
Positive,"The game is expansive enough to keep my attention for a long time.  I have played for well over 8 months now, and I still haven't seen everything the game has to offer. Even at max level, there is plenty of game content to play, and I am not discouraged by the constant need to just raid for gear and pvp for ranking.  I love this game."
Positive,"No idea what is going on, but it do be a vibe.edit; still no idea what is going on.double edit; I've become a merchant of fine wares.triple edit; Do be killin lots of thingsfinal edit; I've been trapped at skyreach catacombs for the past 6 months please send help"
Positive,i like the vast options quest and build-wise and the community in this game
Positive,I've had this game for 2 days now and I love the way that it reminds me of an over-hulled Skyrim
Positive,I JUST FIND IT FUN TO PLAY TONS OF STUFF TO DO
Positive,"Bought the game 6 years late and I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm having fun."
Positive,A solid MMO which does get grindy after the first 5000 hours
Positive,"It's generally known that MMO games feel like a dime a dozen in the features they introduce. Finding an amicable middle ground of making a game that is both compelling in single player content while allowing for hours of dedication into end gaming is the challenge only those 2 of 12 MMOs ever seem to reach.ESO is one of them. Being set in the familiar world that I had come to know since TES III: Morrowind forward made the game more approachable than trying to grasp the entirety of say, WoW's lore. All quests, NPC dialogue and such are voice acted and animated. Stories used aren't rinsed and repeated as well as quest objectives. End gaming content is done in an attractive way that once you hit the ""end game levels,"" you can take a several month hiatus and not be left in the dust. Making the player's focus in combination of set bonuses rather than raiding for specific items give way more customability into how you play, than being forced into a cookie cutter role that make seven the most diehard fans of an MMO lose motivation.Game World economy is super active, and allows players hundreds of different ways to make money and obtain what in game they need. ESO is an MMO that has existed for several years at this point, and as the time goes on - they keep making under-the-hood changes, as well as new content, to keep the game alive and feeling fresh.Unless the story in the Oblivion DLC just kills any continuity to TES IV: Oblivion, then Zenimax is gonna have a lot of apologizing to do."
Positive,"A splendid experience, surprisingly flexible towards solo- and 2-player play. It combines the breadth and mechanics of an MMO world with rich, fully-voiced quests and crafting systems very reminiscent of the single-player ""Elder Scrolls"" games. Its UI may sometimes present some challenges — some features like inventory management feel noticeably better-suited to keyboard play, rather than the game's 'joypad mode'. However that is balanced by a staggering amount of customisation, and excellent in-game hints which really help the game feel more accessible. I must also really commend the visual design and audio, which never fail to impress and immerse."
Positive,"game is fun if your into adventure games a lot to do the main story is nice and i would play it again, great to meet new people online."
Positive,"So I have played this game since closed BETA in 2014 and can tell you flat out you wont find a more beautiful looking MMORPG out there. Are there aspects where say WoW is better? Yes, but this is a different game with a rich deep seated lore to it.If you are an Elder Scrolls fan this game will likely be for you. Though set centuries before the other games, the alliance war is a great PvP experience for an MMO with massive sieges taking place all the time. The achievements within game will give you plenty to do, even if the thousands of quests don't.At the £5 price tag I have seen this game at sometimes, it would be offensive of you not to get this game when its cheap."
Positive,"eso is sooooo addicting and theres soooo much to do i just recently started playing because my friend someone to go do dungeons and hang out with. I absolutely love this game! However eso plus membership comes as a price and grants you an crafting bag with unlimited space, I just wish there was another way to obtain it without paying monthly but at the same time i see why they did it besides you get 10% more xp and all the dlc so you dont have to spend a butt load of money but if your member ships expire you wont have the dlc's but you'll keep the crafting bag with the items you have in it but just cant put anything into it can only withdraw it. highly recommended game! if you like mmo's and rpg games!"
Positive,Best MMO! End of story!
Positive,Really cool game! Character customization much better than Skyrim.
Positive,This is the best RPG  game that i have played .
Positive,Uh new game dont hate
Positive,get the jalapenos ready for quESO
Positive,Everyone that plays this game is very bad except for me. Muh flawless conqueror
Positive,"i use to play AD&D with dice,screens,paper  & books. Now my group plays Elder Scrolls Online. Open worl endless Adventures a way to meet people from all over the world. Truth Be Told there is no game even close to a open world game."
Positive,"I enjoy playing MMORPG games from when I discovered it back about 6 years ago. I also love The Elder Scrolls game series such as Skyrim and Oblivion. The games are awesome. I played WOW (World Of Warcraft) and SWTOR (Star Wars: The Old Republic). As much as I enjoy those 2 games with the multi move list that you use in the game, this game takes away to a new experience in MMO games. I had some trouble when I started out playing the game, but that is pretty much it.________________________________________________________________________So to summarizeGraphics☑ Mind Blowing☐ Great☐ Good☐ Decent☐ Meh☐ Just plain badGameplay☑Brilliant☐ Good☐ Decent☐ BadStory☑Interesting to the point that you dont want to stop playing☐ Great☐ Good☐ Alright☐ Bad☐ Why did I buy this game againMechanics☑Extremely good. Hard to learn when you start playing, but it could just be me☐ Awesome☐ Decent☐ Cant even bother to play the game_______________________________________________________________________There are many more point that I could name, but this is the most important ones I could think of. I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys playing MMORPG games and that is also a fan of The Elder Scrolls game series."
Positive,"Fun game for those who enjoy the MMO genre. The PVP is by far my favorite part, but just like many MMOs there is a lot to learn so finding people who already know the game or watching guides on YouTube is a must.Otherwise, you can play this game however you want. You can RP, dungeon, run trials (raids), PVP, or just 100% zones. You are never locked out of zones based on your level, everything scales to you so you can go everywhere, and you can play with no subscription completely fine. I have 150 hrs on steam and 500 more on Playstation 4 and I have never purchased the subscription."
Positive,Hands down best MMO and best PVP.
Positive,open world and endless possibilities.  So much fun for every type of player
Positive,i wish there was more rag doll like in Skyrim that'd be really fun and cool; but like everything about this game is fun
Positive,This is one of the best games I have ever played.
Positive,Best MMO ive ever played. So much to do with alot of content and alot of updates and events to keep you busy.
Positive,"So far so good. Basically multiplayer Elder Scrolls. No sub fee for the vanilla content (of which there is a lot). Leveling is slow, but it doesn't feel like a grind because quests are actually interesting and not just ""go here - kill that - bring this back to me"" as makes up 99.9% of FFXIV's content, and that game actually has a sub fee.Map is huge btw."
Positive,"This is by far the best MMO i have ever played, and after all these years am still crazy for it. Tons on questing for those loving lore, extremely amazing dungeons and the trials are one of a kind. just started getting in to pvp and have never seen such a open world vib and still action driven pvp thill within a MMO like this. i am truly having a hard time disliking this game regardless of the bugs and issues the game has within its development, this game and its community is truly the best i have seen in many a games. This is a must have game for endless hours of fun and enjoyment"
Positive,I always loved elder scrolls and an MMO was a change of pace. Frequent DLC's and new things to add to your characters.
Positive,It just works.
Positive,"So much to do, honestly no other MMO's come close for content."
Positive,"An awesome MMO- I've been playing several years now, and before it have never touched a MMO. It is one of the best communites I have ever joined in my life. Even if you start out playing solo- you'll love it!"
Positive,i button smash.
Positive,Game is okay I guess
Positive,"I've clocked 30 hours in 3 days so far, looking forward to clocking just as much in the next 3. What a game, what a story. I've never been this hooked on a mmorpg and I knew nothing about TES before launching the game. Big W in my library"
Positive,My favorite MMO of all time and it still holds up today. has sort of a slow start and its hard to level but if you like grinding out quests and dungeons then this is for you. it's 10x better with friends and having other people makes it easier to level up. top tier game that I plan to revisit.
Positive,"Such epicness, such adventures. This game is lovely.I love the way the skill tree works, and that questing doesn't feel like a second job! :DI always play this game with this music playlist in the background, there are also some of the best ES soundtracks in there.https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzn6tuD_wG1lIZe0gtH3B0WI0IL7iVupehttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/3MY82d3rDHi2Ey4ji3trga?si=dBnrlXYcTZ6cSvc_Ex8QugCheck it out friends, what an experience!"
Positive,Beware Mo-Lag Bal
Positive,If you have a hesitation that whether this game can playable just for the story or not: just buy it. This game has a brilliant storyline not just for the main quest but with the side quests.
Positive,only if you like complex mmo rpg's that you have to figure out. Do not go in expecting a skyrim experience
Positive,"It's great with great friends, awesome with awesome friends, terrible with terrible friends and unplayable without friends :)"
Positive,What is there not to like. Only problem I have is buying crowns cost are kinda high but other then that this is a great fun game.
Positive,Fun with loads to do
Positive,The only fix I found to solve the black screen startup problem was to completely reinstall the game and then run it through the application file 'eso64' found here:steamapps/common/Zenimax Online/The Elder Scrolls Online/game/clientSet your brightness and proceed through to the login screen/character creation screen. Leave the game and then rerun it through the external launcher from Steam and it should work properly!
Positive,This game is a rip off of Mario Party 8
Positive,[Sio-Val]: „dps 4key run FG and sally web vet“
Positive,Good time waste
Positive,"So I have played many mmo's and this one has alot to offer, but you don't get to enjoy all the things this game has to offer because of the insane RNG this game comes with. Of the 290 hours I've played this game half that time has been spent doing vMA over and over and over again and still can't get the item I need to drop.  Running the same thing over and over again is not fun, this is a game, not a job and the developers need to realize this and at least give people hope.. even if the game had some extreme trade in 50 bad items and you can get the one you need.. I'd have 2 by now... but I've lost hope and feel like I am just bashing my head into the wall over and over again at this point. All my enthusiam for this game has been crushed...  sad..So after almost 200 tried I finally got it drop.. only to find out there are dozens of other items I am going to need to get, but luckily I can bring friends along to help out... still would not recommend this game, unless you can't leave your house for covid.. then this game is perfect for you, can waste an entire month farming one peice of gear :)"
Positive,"Played this game when it was first released, was majorly disapointed. now is a very differernt story, gameplay is great, story is great, voice acting is great, and pvp just wow. highly recoment."
Positive,There's too much content.
Positive,"Yeah, it's alright."
Positive,Best MMORPG ever! Stunning.
Positive,"Moving from World of Warcraft, this game was a breathe of fresh air when I found that that every patch does not make the previous content obsolete. Which allows me to play the game at my own pacing instead of bum rushing to max level so I can do 'current' content. This also means gear is not as important like in WoW but you use the gear you earn by playing the game either doing content or crafting, to compliment the build you want to play on your characters. Combat plays similar to the single player Elder Scrolls with blocking, heavy attack and light attacks with some new additions like dodge roll. You have classes in ESO (at the time of the review, 4 are available with the base game, with 2 that can be available when owning Morrowind and Elsweyr)PVE is enjoyable to play, especially with friends and you can do the same dungeons as your mates if they're low level, even trade the gear you get if you're max level to them as well. PVP is enjoyable as well (have not experience Cyrodiil to the fullest and BGs are kinda hilarious to play).Crafting is way more useful than WoW's professions since you can use them to create furniture for a house (if you own it) or sell them to other players. You can also have all crafting professions on a single character (if you can find enough skill points in the world)People may have issues with the subscription and the MTX store (which contains no P2W elements in it, just pay for convenience with some of them require you to do the content before you can buy them for other characters). The subscription contains a lot of perks but the biggest ones is the unlimited crafting bag and the currency you can spend in the MTX store.Overall, ESO is my preferred MMORPG over WoW and FFXIV and the amount of content, even from the base game, there's plenty to do."
Positive,"The game is awesome to play with friends and at some points, it is just impossible to not play it without any friends. You will never run out of things to do. The scenary is absolutely fabulous as well.Though, the game isnt perfect. There is a lot of DLC content, and I mean A LOT of DLC content. In fact, over half of the game is DLC, including larger inventory and half of the map. While the map also initially seems large, it is filled to the brink with unaccessible areas like mountains you cant climb, which while making the map seem large, are just bandages to hide that it is a bit smaller than you may think.In conclusion, I would absolutely recommend you to play this game and get a few of your friends to play it as well. This is the most fun I have had while playing a video game so far."
Positive,I hope my family is safe in Riverhold
Positive,It's pretty ok.
Positive,Good game worth the $20 or so it costs and then some
Positive,"Plenty of time, my sweet. Plenty of time."
Positive,Different but a fun multiplayer game.
Positive,its relaxing to play for me in this stress filled world
Positive,9 scrolls and a half unscrolled out of 10
Positive,"Been having a blast. Glad i picked it up,"
Positive,I know that the newest content had so many problems but trust me this game is much more better than black deseart online it has more content and NO FORCE PVP like BDO. And tips for anyone of you wanna play this game and enjoy the content no need to rush buy those new expansion everytime it comes out relax and wait until its being discounted better use those money on eso plus LOL
Positive,"I love this game.The main story line is packed with side quests as well as main quests and there are literally so many ways to play this game and have it feel difference each time. Just being in a different pact makes the game feel different. The quests don't feel to repetitive and i find ESO has by the far the lest repetitive quest styles in any MMO RPG I've seen.And lets say you get tired of the main story lines, there are so many DLC's that are so amazing to play that can also add to your game play afterwards. You can have literally hundreds of hours in the game and still not have touched certain parts the game. I used to play this game on PS4 and i played for a whole year, everyday, religiously, probably a full 8 hours if not more per day, and i still had only completed two pact story line, barely touched PVP or guilds, and completed only 2 out of my 5 DLCs. there is so much to do and i love it.Even in terms of how to play your character, just in one class there are countless ways to make play your class. A mage can be a battle mage, a summoner, a support, a healer and so much more. You fighter can be your tank, your close combat mage, an assassin, your DPS character, there's so much you can do in each!Although there are in game purchases you can make, none of them really matter or are ""needed"" most are simply cosmetics, some ex buffs, extra loot, a faster mount and DLCs. You don't need to buy anything to still have hours of fun."
Positive,The dungeoun crawling is superior.I enjoy this immensely.Highly recommended.
Positive,P L A Y I T
Positive,"absolutely addicted, this is the most fun ive had with any mmo in a very long time"
Positive,"The most immersive, engaging and visually stunning MMORPG I've ever played."
Positive,"i just recently switched from console to pc. initially, i was irritated because i couldnt transfer my character... but starting over again reminded me how much i love this game"
Positive,"One of the best MMORPGs on the market right now. What I found to be the highlight (besides decent combat, fully voice acted quests, building your character the way you want) compared to most mmos is that older content (base game for example) remains very relevant even today."
Positive,"I was originally hesitant to buy since it's an MMO, but ended up really enjoying it. Even if you want to avoid the multiplayer aspects of the game, there's hundreds of hours in the story content and open world (pve parts) of the game."
Positive,"Honestly, really enjoy the game myself. While the combat is something to get used to at first, as it is jarring when coming from a different MMO like FFXIV, BDO, or WoW. Or even coming from a game like Skyrim or Oblivion. Once you get used to its combat. Sticking to one character is pretty rewarding. There is a lot of hidden rewards behind a lot of its content, and the story telling is actually pretty good. Some of the content hits nostalgic points, referencing some of the previous Elder Scrolls games. While other content is new and exciting. In terms of alternate character friendliness, its better then WoW or FFXIV, as a lot of the things you get are account wide excluding the skill lines, and quest progression. Which is reasonable. In conclusion; Solid game overall if you're looking to do either mindlessly grind, do story, or just RolePlay in the Elder Scrolls universe. It has a pretty solid story to add."
Positive,"If you're a fan of the franchise there's a lot to take into consideration before playing as an MMORPG is a lot different from Skyrim, Oblivion and the previous games. While there's a the usual character creation, there's a lot more to do such as multiple armour and weapon sets to boost your skill trees, craft furniture for your house, scry for hidden treasure, group dungeons etc and there are always loads of other players about (great for helping fight world bosses) and a LOT to explore. There are also a lot of DLCs too including the Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood and loads of lore to learn about. Only drawbacks are there is often loads of drama involving group dungeons (you have to queue and wait for a group who may or may not want you there depending on your role) and there are also loot crates which can get you mounts, pets and other items but not always guaranteed so can get pricey as you need to spend real money to get them. Aside from this I would highly recommend the game especially if you have friends that you can explore with."
Positive,"Best game,perfect for ES players"
Positive,"big game, even bigger micro transaction shop.🍷🍷🍷 3/5 microwine rating."
Positive,Made difficult if not  subscriber. Best played with friends
Positive,"Very good game to play with mates and without, and over 250 hours of content to play"
Positive,"The combat feels stale and boring. The stories are well-made and somewhat remove the grind of the game but still not worth it. If you want to really give it a shot, wait until the game is on sale.EDIT: After playing it a couple of more hours it starts getting a bit more interesting. It brings the nostalgia of previous games like Morrowind. Graphics are nice for a MMO. I changed my review to ""Recommend"" but it is nevertheless borderline good."
Positive,mmo go brrrrrrrr
Positive,"Very fun and good lore. Felt very true to Elder Scrolls in being able to do what you want, go where you want and wear what you want."
Positive,Game is great. In my opinion its top notch in its deliverance. Would definitely recommend to an Rpg fan!
Positive,"Extremly nice game, can recommend it very much. You can play it alone or with friends. Feels like there are endless Quests. (But you will buy so much crowns it's unbelievable)"
Positive,best mmo ever
Positive,"Warning: Long post, a rant and a review. TL:DR is the game is worth it at a sale price, so much content even if u arent a subscriber. Fun solo or with friends. OG players like me were basically ripped off and it sucks. I'm just playing again cuz my friends are playing now.Honestly I'm disappointed. I'll rant a bit. I paid full price when this was released as a buy to play game, back in 2016. I paid 1430 PHP (around 30$ give or take). I didnt play very long cuz i was alone and got a bit sad lol. My friends now recently purchased it for 368 PHP(7.72 $) cuz of the sale. Color me surprised when I couldnt enter Vvardfell along with them because I do NOT have access to morrowind. Even tho I was one of the original purchasers of tamriel unlimited. Even tho I paid more for it. And now that I finally have friends to play with, who paid less than half of what I have, it just leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I have to either shell out MORE money to buy the dlc for 3500 crowns, or sub for ESO + just to play with them. Or have them come to me to my base game making it even more sad knowing I paid significantly more. Even sent a support ticket and read some forum posts. Nothing can be done I guess. Overall, still a good buy for newcomers, but OG buyers like me are ripped off lol. End of rant. Review below. I'd recommend this game if you either play solo or with friends. Both can be viable, as the lore is rich and side quests are plenty. I used to play solo templar, and it was fun surviving most content alone but I myself got bored playing alone. Now that my friends have bought the game, I truly have experienced what an MMO feels like. I've embraced the role of a healer, and my skills can make or break a fight with a boss. It's pretty fun knowing you really do contribute to a group. + the vibes and nostalgia of playing skyrim is constantly present thus making it even better. Me and my friends are still not at the end game but we are having tons of fun so far. Go buy it, it's pretty cheap right now. I doubt you'll regret paying for it!"
Positive,"An excellent game with endless content. Map exploration, quests, crafting, dungeons, PvP, and much more! Doing a variety of these things (changing it up now and again) keeps the game from becoming monotonous. I am over 800 hours into the game and i'm nowhere near completing it on even one of my characters. The community is extremely friendly for the most part (every game has its 'bad eggs'; mainly to be found in PvP & dungeons). There are however, minor glitches within the game (mainly found within particular dungeons, where starting a battle with a small boss results in the game freezing/ being kicked from the game). Those glitches and the frequent maintenance though, should not keep you from playing this game!"
Positive,"If you are new to mom's this is a great place to start. It has simple but deep gameplay, A beautiful world a good story and a welcoming community. What I personally love is that it does not lock my character if I want to dps I can do it if I want to tank I can do it if I want to heal I can do it. Of course you have to either respec or work to be able to just swap out you skill. The only negative that I have is the lack of free mounts."
Positive,"its an amazing game loads to do you'll never get bored there is crafting, tansmog (changing your apperance), farming gold, materials, mounts completing all the DLC zones completing the main quest line getting the best gear reworking all of your talents to get the most optimised spec. The only thing id say that it is not Alt friendly meaning you should only really focus on one character because champion points and leveling takes long it really is a grind."
Positive,The tolerance is high. It is worth trying.
Positive,You need it.
Positive,Kha staso RPG games khowakh wi nu da game tolo best dai dena kha RPG game bal nishta pa tol steam ke da tolo na kha di da game agesto laek dai
Positive,"Play as an MMORPG. Good MMORPG. Lore bad, big stinky. But game, good. Just lore bad."
Positive,This game is ok.
Positive,"It's definitely not the same experience as Skyrim, but it's great value for $9 (on sale) as it contains hundreds of hours of gameplay. There are many areas in Tamriel with their own questlines in addition to PVP. Just the dodging ability makes combat better than Skyrim, but the enemies' abilities are too predictable and linear, so I would say the combat is still not as great as other games like the Witcher 3."
Positive,"After many years of trying to play this game and quitting, I can finally say that once you get to the max level and start earning Champion Points (CP) that the game is very fun.  I do have to say that the game is a lot more fun with friends and it has a lot of content that are easier with groups.  The performance issues I ran into were the frame drops when looking towards populated sections of the world in certain zones.  It would drop to around 40 fps.  The combat at times can feel like spamming, but with some addons for the UI it helps by adding cool down timers and it will make the UI look much better."
Positive,"ESO does many things right where other MMOs have failed recently. I've only put ~80 hours in at the time of this review, but here are some of my impressions thus far:1. The combat is actually far more interesting than it might look like at a quick glance. It's no BDO combat, but it's also not just 5 spells + an ultimate as you might think. The game uses a weapon swap mechanic where you gain a completely separate bar after swapping weapons (which you do quite frequently), bringing it up to a more reasonable 10 spells + 2 ultimate choices. Furthermore, there is a fairly decent skill ceiling in that high DPS is not earned just by mashing keys, but by weaving light auto attacks in between each ability to ""cancel"" the animation of the attack.2. There's a shitload of content. Even with just the base game, there are so many solo/group delves and dungeons, a seemingly great questline for every region that isn't just fetch quests, and many grind spots if you'd rather grind mobs than do the other content (which isn't recommended if you're a new player.3. To build off of #2, there appears to be almost no ""stale"" content in this game. ESO scales all mobs, quest rewards, etc. to your current level at the time of participating. Many times, as a low level, I would have high level players join me in the group finder for a random daily dungeon to complete dungeons that are unlocked very early in the game - the rewards are still fair to them and as a low level I'm able to still contribute to the clearing of the dungeon. Of course, higher levels generally end up contributing more because they have added bonuses unlocked through the skill and champion trees whereas the monsters seem to be scaled mostly by level/gear. Nonetheless, this drives activity up massively and the game feels like people are actually playing it, doing group activities and world events rather than just sitting at some bank all day.4. The community is actually pretty nice. I'm not into the role-playing aspect that many others seem to be, but generally when I ask for help with obtaining a piece of gear, travelling quickly to a spot, assembling a group, or even just a piece of advice, people almost always reach out to give a helping hand and often times turn down money that I've offered.5. The game does not have any alarming pay to win features that I can see as of yet. I purchased the Greymoor bundle (my one gripe with this game is that the upgrade doesn't work in the way you'd expect, you need to purchase the bundle to get the content that came before it) when it was on sale because it was a great deal, but didn't even touch it for quite some time because there was nothing that made it overwhelmingly necessary. It feels to me like most purchasable stuff is supplementary and just provides additional ways to enjoy the game, though I do know that having additional areas technically unlocks the ability to gain additional skill points for that area. Nonetheless, I don't think any of this is necessary as you could easily make an alt character to take care of all your crafting-related skill tree activities, as many people do even if they have those regions unlocked. Furthermore, you seem to be able to purchase cash shop currency with in-game gold (obviously this will be a little pricey and hard to access in the early game), but it leaves a possibility open to unlock those DLCs just by playing the game, which is always neat to have.Overall, I'm quite impressed with this game so far."
Positive,better than WOW hands down
Positive,"Very interesting game, lot of options in it, big map and its fun !! I recommend this game to everyone who is into some good MMORPG !!"
Positive,"Once you play with addons, you can never play without addons."
Positive,This is a great game for Casual players as well as the try hards.
Positive,Never thought i would like it cause i am not a fan of MMO games but turns out it is one of my favourite games and it will be for a while because there is so much to do.
Positive,If you played this game at release and didn't like it just know that it has completely changed and is now one of the best MMORPG's on the market today.
Positive,gAME PlAY GoOD dO It
Positive,"After a long consideration, I have decided to recommend this game. You have a huge variety of different sorts of areas to explore and a lot of different tasks to do. However, you should not be fooled by the low price. The game will not give you content like Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild or the choice to become a werewolf or a vampire for free. If you want all the content, it will cost you like couple hundred euros. In my opinion such content should automatically belong to the buyer of the game. The game itself is not bad and I like the details and the different possibilities to play with old or new friends. To sum up, I really like the game and want to recommend it, but be prepared for a ridiculously high prices.💸"
Positive,"I bought the game when it came out, played it to Level 50 and quit because there was nothing else to do and I had an Xbox One. Fast forward six years, the game is on sale (Greymoor edition) for $18, bought it with a month of ESO+, and now I am in love with this game. Endless hours of fun questing, characters are amazing and well acted (Alfred Molina, John Cleese, etc.). The game does not do well at explaining all of its aspects, but that is just because there are so many and player builds typically navigate the game progression. I play a Khajit stamina nightblade build, and I am having a blast. I should also mention I solo PvE, so even without friends, I think this game is still great, but having friends would break the monotony of some of the questing and repetitiveness of certain parts of the game. Overall, great game and it has come unbelievably far since it came out. The world is much more fleshed-out and it plays really smoothly. No gamebreaking bugs so far either! Add me @Prozac_ParadiseEdit: After another 140 hours, this is one of my favorite games ever. The community is amazing, and it always feels like there is a new part of the game to explore and build your character. It is so easily adaptable to what you want to get out of it, and that is amazing to me. Come quest and dungeon hunt with me!"
Positive,Best Game Ever !
Positive,"There's a lot of cats, 10/10"
Positive,"Much fun, very game"
Positive,"Fun game get it on sale if you aren't 100% you""ll have fun gaming with friends. It's a huge world to explore"
Positive,"Its a game that does not get repetitive, instead if u play it too much every day it makes u feel kind of like you are wasting ur time because there are higher level strongler players that can always one shot you, they probably dedicated their lives to the game, so play for 3hours tops every day and enjoy whilst also not sending people duel requests."
Positive,"This is a great MMO set in the Elder Scrolls universe that brings you and your friends into the world of Tamriel during a deadric princes planemeld and a struggle for power among the different pacts and clans. There is some lore breaking occasionally, but otherwise is a very immersive experience. Fully voiced with hundreds of hours of story, PvE trials and dungeons, and PvP battlegrounds at the White-Gold tower and the Imperial City. I have spent almost 400 hours and plan on spending many more, as this is a wonderful game to play with others."
Positive,Fucking sick cunt game this
Positive,It was good.
Positive,not ur average elder scrolls game but its still good
Positive,Wonderful game if you love the Elder scrolls universe the open world is very fun & engaging. It's closest thing you can get to playing Oblivion or Skyrim online with friends!
Positive,one word legendary
Positive,haha game go brrrrr
Positive,Great game! One of the best MMORPG's out there!
Positive,"Even though I'm pretty new to the game I'm having a lot of fun. Very easy to pick up for new players and theres a lot of interesting storylines in the quests. Especially since I got the whole game with the expansions for $21.05 it's got a ton of content for the money, even without an ESO Plus membership."
Positive,"Didn't know Steam could pull play hours from Xbox. Anyway, this game is sort of like Fallout 76 in that there are micro-transactions, it's online only, and it can be buggy at times. It was a bit annoying having to purchase the Dark Brotherhood questline, but it was worth it as it gives me something to do in-game and allows me to travel all around Tamriel (at least, in the base game areas and Morrowind upgrade areas) and be the Dark Elf Assassin I always play as in every Elder Scrolls game. The voice acting and characters are amazing, and the story, while not very deep, is great for a game like this. Basically feels like Skyrim but online. I love how Skills work, and while the controls are a bit unorthodox, they make sense for a game like this. Magic abilities/spells work pretty well and are easy to cast. And of course, I bought the Breton Terrier because he's very cute. I have a small room at an inn somewhere in Stonefalls (I think) and the home editing system is great, if a little finicky. Most micro-transactions range from $5-$25 and, while I don't think they're worth it, they are cool nonetheless. 7/10, very epic, better than Fallout 76."
Positive,"needed skyrim online, this feels like skyrim online"
Positive,Its banging m8
Positive,I Love Elder scrolls all version..and this mmo is the best
Positive,Great game. Very immersive MMO game.
Positive,Good if you're lonely...
Positive,"I saw this game once, and loved it, but I had no idea what game this was before, until a friend of mine shared this to me and I was so happy because FINALLY THE GAME THAT I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR WAS FOUND And now I'm downloading it to play with my friend who shared it to me. :DD"
Positive,"The possibilities are endless in this game. Wanna be a sneaky rogue, ambushing your foes from behind? Wanna use various spells to confound and obliterate your enemies? Like to stand tor to toe with the monsters and slam their ugly faces with a shield? This game definitely has it all, and more. You can litterally mold each character into something new and exciting, even if you only play one class. The storyline is well written and highly immersive throughout the game. Like to play solo? Completely viable. Prefer to wreak havoc alongside friends? Also completely viable. This is one of the best games from Bethesda in my opinion, well worth the purchase. And if you can, don't miss out on the subscription either. The benefits of the subscription help tremendously from beginning to end-game content. I should also note that i have played this game before on a different platform. Through Steam ive only played a little, but otherwise i have spent hundreds of hours on this game."
Positive,"this is one massive game, will take forever to see all the quest lines in the game. totally worth it, no pay 2 win and playable without buying subscription"
Positive,JUST PLAY IT.
Positive,Takes me back to when I would sink hours into Skyrim. The questing and exploration is fun and I could sink hours into this as well
Positive,Absolutely love this game
Positive,Base game is trash only DLCs are playable
Positive,great mmorpg for elder scrolls series fans. reviewing for the badge
Positive,"Highly recommend this game for those who loves RPG and MMO games. I love everything about this game. May the gods watch over your battles, my friends"
Positive,Fun online game for elder scrolls fans. Lots of content. 7/10 recommend. Can get pricey and gimmicky.
Positive,"Very Good MMORPG for solo gamers,But i played it with stubid friend)))."
Positive,"So. Much. Content. Even in the base game, there are so many things to do, and there are nearly infinite ways to play. The continued support and updates are incredible."
Positive,grinding with the boys
Positive,"10/10Honestly this MMORPG was something that I could never get into on day one with the ps4, but after coming back a few years later on pc, it is one of the best MMORPG experiences I've ever had.In order to have fun on this game buy friends."
Positive,"I first played this game when it was in beta, and at the time, I really wasn't impressed. It was trying too hard to be World of Warcraft and had an only vaguely Elder Scrolls coat of paint, certainly not enough to bring me back when it was released. Then, back at the beginning of 2020, they offered us a free weekend, and my partner and I decided to give it another shot. We'd heard there'd been changes, and for free, eh, why not check it out right? Changes was an understatement!! They'd overhauled the whole game! The One Tamriel update was exactly what this game had needed from the very beginning, and the updates and expansions that came after built on that success. This was the game as it should have been, and now it is among my favorites, and a truly worthy title in the ES series. There are still issues of course, but as in any TES game since at least Oblivion, many can be addressed with mods (though if you need more than two or three, get Minion to manage them for you, otherwise it's a pain in the neck keeping all the dependencies up to date by yourself). Another minor complaint is that the game isn't always quite responsive enough to you as a character, by which I mean that the NPCs and choices don't always reflect your race, class, or conditions (such as whether or not you're a vampire or werewolf), and that can sometimes break immersion or suspension of disbelief. But on the whole those are minor. And there are still bugs, some of which have persisted for years, which isn't great. Overall though, I still very much enjoy my time in this rendition of Tamriel, and I expect that to continue. See you out there, heroes!!"
Positive,I loved how the game is multiplayer with other players and how there are so many major/minor quests including small tasks to help you boost your skills and mastering your character. If you have never played the game I would highly recommend researching it on Youtube or via internet if this is the type of game your interested in.
Positive,Love the game!!
Positive,Great MMO to play with friends online. One of the Best Online games out there at the moment
Positive,Morrowind for zoomers
Positive,I've spent way too much time and money on this game to even consider writing a bad review
Positive,Not bad actually
Positive,"I tried this game a long time ago, and it wasnt great. Recently though me and some buddies itching for an mmorpg decided to give it another go, and let me tell ya in 2020 this game is fantastic if you are looking for a good mmorpg to play on the cheap this is it. The monthly subscription is really not needed at all."
Positive,"They keep updating the game with quality of life improvements and implements a system that rewards those who play regularly to buy ""crown crate"" items which are cosmetic items so basically you can play this game for free after you buy it one time."
Positive,"ESO.One of the best MMORPG's ive ever played not to mention its very kind to is subcribers! taking Eso plus each month gives you access to all the games DLC content except the most recent one. [] If you arnt able to purchase the subscription back to back you can always just buy the dlc individually! Player housing is extensive, as well as an amazing helpful community and many ways to interact with your guild weather it be personal events pvp or pve large scale events such as Trials [] or the open world PVP area.Open World PVPIS the most amazing feature all factions fight over multiple stratigic points to take control of the Throne. Included with a siege system allowing you to break down the walls of an enemy faction and seize the castle for your team. Best Mmo out there."
Positive,We found. We love. We know.
Positive,The best game of my life
Positive,Great MMO for those who don't want something SUPER involved. Best PVP for games of its type.
Positive,dungeons raids fun with friends. Simple and fast paced
Positive,"Been playing this game since the Beta days.  It's grown a lot!  I usually stick to PvE, so I don't speak for the PvP aspects of this game.  It's fun, has a lot of good quests, and it's entertaining enough to last me years of waiting between Skyrim and Elder Scrolls 6. ;)  I'd recommend all the extra content on sale, not full price, but that's what I'd recommend for any DLC for basically any game.  If you like fantasy MMORPGs, good visuals, and fun times with friends, then you should love ESO!"
Positive,"Never runs out of content. There will be always something to do. I originally started playing this because I felt lonely playing TESV (Skyrim). Even with mods, I was still alone. With a MMORPG like ESO, the game is fun when I want to play with others. I do not feel lonely. Being in a guild is great, there's lots of friendly people I could do stuff with. Doing world events is fun. Update: Please do something about the trolls in the Dungeon Finder. They waste a lot of people's time who actually wish to do dungeons."
Positive,"Have been playing this for three years. This games had its ups and downs but it never disappointed.  I once took a break from the game too but soon returned as i could never leave it and with its constant updates and events it never gets boring. I also found a lovely community to play with and i think  i will stick to this game for a long time. I also inherited a guild so feel free to join up in ""Last Stand"" if u wanna join."
Positive,"A very immersive adventure game that takes the player whole across of Tamriel in Elder Scrolls. Be a hero on our own adventure, discover new places, traditions, ancient civilization and much more. One of the best MMO's I've played besides The Old Republic. I really recommend players who are into MMO's to give it a try and check it out."
Positive,real great if you love grinding games. i like the leveling system the only thing is that in early game it is hard to grind foor good weapons
Positive,Grindworthy. Extremely fun with a group of friends.
Positive,so much good content - I've played for years and still I really have to reign in the OCD
Positive,"Pretty cool game, pretty broken as well."
Positive,It's pretty good.
Positive,I'm over 100 hours in and have so much more to do!. Great game with a little bit of something for everyone.
Positive,"It gets really boring solo,  grab all your three friends and play. If you do that it's worth it"
Positive,"A fun game to play to explore the world and lore of Elder Scrolls in the 2nd era, has content for solo players as well as content for group players. Though some of the group stuff can be done via group finder or maybe even alone, the trials need you to gather a 11 other players to do. Overall, vanilla game has a lot of content with seasonal content being added on just making the game more interesting."
Positive,"I purchased ESO when I found out that it had transitioned from a subscription based service to a one-time purchase (while also still having memberships available). I never really got into it until now, and I regret that. MMOs aren't really my forte but I can say with confidence that ESO is one of my favourite games at the moment."
Positive,"Good game for playing with friends, alone. interesting world and story <3"
Positive,"only game i've bothered buying a year long sub for, and it isnt even required"
Positive,Great game for wasting life with pleasure :)
Positive,"Beautiful graphics, intuitive combat, and cool worldbuilding! I've played over 300 hours of this game, and am pretty sure I could spend another 300 without much trouble"
Positive,Blinding game.... Go for it
Positive,"Great game, I recommend."
Positive,"Fantastic Open world nice story in quests , The bad thing is in battleground mode some players are higher level than you and you cant do much in fights . and the other thing is that its not that much great tutorial for newbie players .The good thing is that , This game allows you to play with ur friends and make a strong guild playing with friends in this game is very Fun and useful ."
Positive,Great Game But If It Wasnt Pay To Play -Wanna go dungeon ? U Need To Buy DLCWanna have a camel ? U Need To Buy It with real cashWanna be a F*&$ing Necromancer So Buy It With Real CashWhy it is like that ? Pew
Positive,This game encourages my hoarding habits
Positive,buy game get charged with 13 counts of arson in the state of ohio from 2002-2004
Positive,i make shit loads of money selling myself as a lizard wife with my friend
Positive,best game i  think  cause it imagine it is 3 or games in one
Positive,This Game is very good i just dislike the combat aspect of killing normal mobs they are tooooo tanky to be honest. But the rest is all good.
Positive,Fun with friends.Boring by myself. Would still recommend
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online Pros/Cons and Mini-guide:This is my second account playing ESO, both accounts have logged 200+hours. (RIP girlfriend's steam account)ESO, like many MMOs, has a massive world with a lot of stuff to explore. Your play style will determine what content you clear, but it can be a very fun game for gamers who love a challenge, as well as more casual gamers. The game has various types of content. Here's a breakdown:PVP: There's a big area of the map devoted to strategic PVP where you capture castles and forts and fight other factions, as well as small PVP arenas called Battlegrounds. Overland content: Basically the easier PVE areas of the map, including quests and mini-dungeons called Delves, and World Bosses which can provide a nice PVE group challenge.Underland content: Dungeons and ""Trials."" (Trials are like dungeons on steroids). This is group content, usually. Trials require 12 people to complete. (1 or 2 tanks, usually 2 healers, and 8-10 DPS) All Underland content has both a normal mode and a Veteran mode, where the enemies are more effective and the bosses hit harder. Within Veteran mode, you can also choose to activate Hard Mode for the final boss which provides even more of a challenge. But if you just want to clear the dungeon, complete the quest for it, and have fun, normal modes are not too challenging!There's alsoCRAFTING: within the game, and I find the crafting experience to be well-designed and rewarding. There's your typical crafting professions: Cooking (called Provisioning), Blacksmithing, Woodworking, Tailoring, Alchemy, and Jewelry Crafting. These professions can be leveled up on any character, and can be helpful for making money or assisting your guild with Crafting. Which brings me toGUILDS: Shop around for the right guild. Don't feel like you have to be locked in to one guild, as you are allowed to be a member of multiple guilds. Guilds usually use discord to plan group content, and there are various types of guilds, from PVP guilds, to Trial guilds, Social guilds, and Trading guilds (guilds that focus on commerce). There are a lot of really nice people who play ESO, but some of them might rub you the wrong way, just like real life. Find your group. I recommend trying a few guilds before you find ""your people."" There's a guild finder in-game, as well as lots of guild listings all over Facebook and Reddit. It's easy to find a guild.This game has a way of continuously challenging you, if you choose to become really good at your role and complete veteran content. You will find yourself learning from your guild members, and becoming proficient at the game as you complete harder and harder content. Try not to get overwhelmed by the sheer scope of the learning curve. There will always be something new to learn, and people who go into this MMO wanting to learn and improve usually do very well, and are respected by their guild members. CLASSES: Theoretically, you can play any class in any style. However, some classes are better-equipped to handle roles like tanking or healing than other classes. My advice would be try a few classes, as you have multiple character slots. But before you level up too high, check online or with your guild to make sure you are playing your class in a way that's effective. There are lots of class ""builds"" online that can give you a benchmark on what is most effective in the game. This advice doesn't apply if you just want a casual Overland experience only, but using your class effectively is very important for finishing veteran content. No Class is ""the best overall"", they're quite balanced, but some classes like Warden or Templar are better for healing, for example. Finally, BUGS/CONS:MMOs are really hard to program. You have millions of players running around an open world, finding bugs and reporting them (or not reporting, if the bug provides an advantage) and Zenimax is basically always patching and trying to improve the game, as well as fix bugs. Therefore, if you're the kind of gamer who loses their cool over one small bug, I DO NOT recommend this game. Some reviewers have also mentioned that the game feels like a cash-grab, but I disagree. Yes, there is content that you have to pay to unlock (a $14/month subscription unlocks most of the content for you), but considering how much money it costs to pay programmers and 3D modellers to constantly debug and improve your game for you, I believe it's worth the money. On one hand, I find being a part of the ESO community, and helping ZoS fix bugs and improve the game is rewarding. On the other hand, I would really love to not be accidentally teleported to the beginning of a dungeon mid-boss fight. It's not perfect. I play this game for the community, and for the constant challenge. There are other people who play it to roleplay with other players, similar to DnD, but in-game. And some people want to buy a house in-game, decorate it, and craft weapons and armour. There are different reasons why people play ESO, all valid. My advice for players who want to challenge themselves is this: Open your mind to learning new things. Watch youtube videos on your class and role. Find a helpful guild. And take your time. It's impossible to be perfect at this game from day 1."
Positive,There's so much content on this game.
Positive,"ESO is a fantastic game that give's meaning to the word Fantasy RPG. The only remarks i could make that are negative, is combat needs to be more fluid, more responsive to easily chain abilities together. Any plausably add flying mount's."
Positive,"It takes a bit to learn, but if you do some research and join guilds it makes the whole game so much more fun! I honestly love it. Its a little challenging, which is great for me. It keeps you on your toes and is 100% worth it."
Positive,"I absolutely love this game! It's so much fun and I love that you get to give characters abilities and weapons you want to give them. It's so annoying when a game gives you a character with a sword and that's it.Although I do think they should add more weapon types such as Boomerangs, Throwing Knives, Martial Arts Staffs, would be super cool! All my characters have the same weapons so it gets a little redundant after a while, more weapon versatility would be great."
Positive,"Quick little reviewI honestly really enjoy this game, i never have disliked it (besides some insane bad luck when it comes to stealth/stealing/thieves guild quests.Its a bit odd feeling comparing it to other elder scrolls games for gameplay. but it is still quite fun, most things are useful from crafting, cooking and just good ol' dungeon running, nothing is speicfically above each other.Bag space is an issue, but it can be slowly remedied as you get higher levels and get gold to buy upgrades. Also if you are a lore person, there is so much lore in this game is absolutly wonderful!"
Positive,Big Nice Good Guild system
Positive,"It's one of those hard to define, but fun enough to be to worth a recomendation, story is pretty decent, and for the ones not interested on it and just wanting to level and do dungeons and focus on endgame it's also viable just do your own thing on those lines.The game is pretty alt-friendly as well, what for me is a big bonus, and allowing multiple guilds is a even bigger plus letting you have your small friends only guild, as well joining others for endgame/roleplaying/whatever you want.Still worth warning that the Zenimax/Bethesda been kinda scummy setting part of the events needed to complet event mounts in expansion maps to force people to buy them or end risking not being able to complete those event mounts.That bit is not the end of world, but still pretty annoying."
Positive,All this time i was waiting for the game launcher to complete downloading files so now can't do a refund. Good game i suppose - never actually played.
Positive,Action RPG - play reminds me of guild wars 2 style
Positive,"I will definitely recommend this game to play. I've been playing ESO since June of 2014 and I played on XBox One, PS4 & PC, but I spend more time on XBox One and PC. I just love the content and the story lines of the game. There's so much to do and to explore the game. You will love the game and you will enjoy it. The ESO community in general is very helpful. And the game is just getting better and better."
Positive,"GREAT GAME CONTENT (Elsewyr) PLUS A HELPFUL AND FRIENDLY COMMUNITY (European Server)I bought this after a friend and I reminisced about Skyrim where it sat in my library for almost a year because, well, it feels overwhelming to jump into an epic adventure again. And while I don't play multiplayer games (all that communicating and adventuring together--too much work for me lol) I find the ESO community wonderful. It's probably not enough since I've only confined my adventuring to Elsewyr (for now) but there's just so much to do, see and experience! Whether you're adventuring by yourself or with friends, it's great. I like that there are synergy skills so playing with others make sense and that feeling after a bunch of strangers band together to defeat a world boss or a dragon is just pure adrenaline. Another friend commented that ESO is dead, that nobody plays it anymore but a not so crowded server works for me-- it feels like you've got an entire world to yourself so, it's reminiscent to playing Skyrim again (a plus for non fans of multiplayer games). And depending on the time of the day, you can choose to play with others (which is something you'll eventually need if you want to do the daily quests). I feel like there is no right or wrong way to play this game. Other people find joy in being tedious (working on optimizing their built, reading everything, etc.), others just want to be rich by trading, and there are others, like me, who just want to experience that joy from adventuring in Skyrim again, many years ago and wondering what else is out there in Tamriel. As to the question of is ESO Plus worth it? If you love the game and enjoy it, then yes-- it unlocks so many things for you (that inventory space is very much appreciated) and imagine all the DLCs you can play, but, if you are on a tight budget, or simply think ESO pales in comparison to other Elder Scrolls games then it's fine too. There are plenty of us who don't have ESO plus membership but still enjoy the game.Not to say it doesn't have flaws because it does (the missing Impresario bug, for one) so if you have little patience for that, then please take this review with a grain of salt-- I really just missed playing Skyrim, is all."
Positive,"Nice game, really like it. One of the few MMO games where you do not feel gated for playing alone."
Positive,"Remember playing Skyrim on the old Xbox and having that feeling of ""man, i wish me and my friends could run around and do all this at the same time""?Well, now that childhood dream is real, my dudes!I never subscribe or pay2play but getting the subscription for this is 100% worth it, opens the whole bad boy up for all sorts of different shit to do.Im big on customising etc and this has costumes so you can look all sleek and dyes to change the colours of all the different costumes you can wear (not including the actual armour sets you wear underneath thats a whole other thing in itself)I aint got the time nor the strength to type out all the fun shit you can do, Battle grounds, one big giant war for the pvp boys, duelling, guilds, thieving, vampire, sharing dungeon raids, allll that and more, baby.95% sure this is my favourite game ever."
Positive,"After thousand hours on Zenimax launcher I moved to Steam. Few hundreds hours later I think I'm ready to say something. Overall game is awesome. So much content, that You don't know where to start. Graphic is relay nice. Non target works pretty cool. Super lag on PvP area makes it hard to play. From time to time, when to many people play, the game servers cannot handle it.Years long story are just great and add so much lore and story.Game is relay worth to play. But it need time to make You love it.I would say hundred hour on start. After that decide, rather it sucks or not. From me its 8/10 -2 for potato servers"
Positive,"Неплохая игра, именно для фанов тески, потому что мне кажется, что люди, не игравшие хоть в одну из частей свитков, её просто не поймут"
Positive,enjoyed playing this game for many hours. there's alot of things to do. worth your money.
Positive,Amazing.  Best MMO out there.
Positive,"Its a great game with a variety of play for people with different play styles, end game, housing, etc. The community is also great!"
Positive,Like a heroin once u start you cant stop
Positive,"If you liked Skyrim, you'll like EOS...........there are no sex mods....but it gives you more incentive to actually try to complete the game."
Positive,a lot of fun when with friends. fun storylines. ;)
Positive,Walking and just exploring this beautiful world is rewarding enough. Rest is just bonus.
Positive,Really good aand extensive game.If you love rpgs and good quests it is really good.if you love mmorpg there is a really friendly community
Positive,Played a bit. It's alright
Positive,so fcking  good
Positive,"its ok, played it a bit here and there"
Positive,I have been playing this game on an off for the last 4 years and all I can say is that still to this day even if I don't play it as much as I used to it's still one of my favorite games I have played! People like to shit on it a lot and yes its had its ups and downs but I think its well worth it even more so if you pick it up when its on sale which I think most of the time you can pick it up for like 10 dollars and that comes with DLC.
Positive,Way to addictive.
Positive,"Great game with lots of content, and thousands of hours of gameplay."
Positive,Its a great game to play with friends or by yourself
Positive,"ZOS hope this reaches your team:- Improve connectivity and add server locations - I get disconnected 2-3x a day. I play for 2-3 hrs only per day, I have a life.- Reduce ESO Plus cost. Give option to pick what benefits we want for the sub. Or give different sub for craft bag and bank space OR DLC accessOverall good game, very immersing quest stories. Engaging mechanics and systems.Not repetitive and mind-numbing as you can do different things when you get full of one thing."
Positive,"Kinda a time investment of a game but honestly when i played this game at release I loved it, although I was younger at the time and I didn't understand mmo mechanics at the time but it was always a pretty fun thing to play. but it was even more enjoyable with friends I hope it helps you pick on whether you would pick up a copy, and give the entire game a try. I promise it feels fun as long as you get involved in the community, dont be rude or a pain in the side and the community is pretty generous."
Positive,"+ Engaging story telling and questing.+ Support of add-ons, but that community is bleeding out every year.+ Voice acting. This is so cool, to actually hear the NPC's explain the quest and what is going on.- Terrible UI customization (or the lack off).- Limiting bag space and asking 10 euros for 10 extra slots... disgusting.I know you have other options, but this is a big no no for a old player like me.- Confusing pay walls / DLC. So whenever you get lost in the clunky UI, you sometimes read you need item X to unlock this ability, and for item X you need DLC X ... like it's a circle, everything leads to them wanting money.- Every time you login you get a pop-up promoting their currency shop. Again ... greedy... very greedy...I found a thread with 7 pages from 2018, all people complaining about this. Do you think they listened? No. The solution is simple, you have to install an add-on created by players to disable the pop-up. Please fellow gamers, stop giving extra money to a company who does not care about you. This is a clear indiciation.But honestly, if you ignore all that stuff you can have some fun for the 19.99 euros you pay for it.You are at the mercy of add-ons for customization of the UI. The only thing you can move is the chatbox.I would give this game a 6-7 out of 10."
Positive,"This game is well worth the money. It's not that expensive anymore and ESO Plus isn't necessary to do well in the game, though I find it to be advantageous and affordable for what you get out of it. The only complaints I have about the game are that 1. the cash shop is extremely expensive, more than it needs to be, & 2. as a solo player, I hate that I have to beg map chat to help with the ""group"" areas, I'd much rather not have to do those quests to progress in a main story questline.This game is a lot of fun, especially if you don't care about the meta and just build your characters they way you like to play. The possibilities are endless. You can basically choose any playstyle you want and just go for it. If you're unsure about whether to play the game or not, you definitely should."
Positive,"You know, its pretty awesome."
Positive,It's just the best.
Positive,im a cat thats good enough for me
Positive,"ESO was the MMO that I chose to play after 15 years of playing another MMO. I had played the ESO Closed Beta for free in 2013, but back then I wasn't entirely impressed with what I saw. Coming back in 2020 (while needing a break from the other MMO) has been a refreshing and rewarding experience for me. The game feels like any other Elder Scrolls experience, from Morrowind to Skyrim, and has much of the same character customization of those games. While you begin your journey with a selection of six classes (if you have all of the DLC to play Warden and Necromancer; otherwise you only have four: Dragonknight, Nightblade, Sorcerer, and Templar) for a starting base of abilities, the game allows you to customize what kind of armor and weapons you want to play with as you go, as well as a selection of different skills you can obtain through guilds and interacting with the world in different ways.***I will say, the game isn't perfect by any means - I do have criticism regarding some of the character pathing, combat, controls, questing, and tutorials:I've learned that questing is... interesting. While I enjoy each and every location that I've been to, as well as the stories that are being told, the game does a very poor job of directing you. While this is great for games like Morrowind and Skyrim (Oblivion does a better job than either), it seems out of place for an MMO. It's very easy to get lost in DLC missions and other side quests (where you meet characters you shouldn't be meeting yet) instead of taking you along the main story. My opinion of this is that the game should have some sort of phasing so that you can follow the story more directly, unless you have already completed it on another character already, then you can play in a more open environment.Tutorials are lacking in this game. It does a very poor job of explaining things, such as map markers, bag vendors, banks, stables, and controls. There is a lot to this game and it sort of drops you in with little explanation of what all you can do (and should do) in order to advance your character and understand the controls.On the topic of controls, the game does a very poor job of introducing you to useful and important key bindings, and the amount of key binds that there are can be very difficult to conceptualize and remember as a new player. If it weren't for having a friend tell me some of the controls, I would have never known that they existed. I also felt like it was far too easy to double click a directional button and accidentally roll somewhere (or off of a cliff) without meaning to.When you are running around in the world, it can be very easy to get stuck in certain locations if you were trying to jump over a rock or barrels, unknowing that there is no way to escape from the small gap on the other side. A friend of mine has gotten himself stuck on numerous occasions because he likes to hit the spacebar a lot. There are even some locations where your character will not be able to walk over very small bumps in the environment that you should be able to walk over with ease; such as a wooden plank laying across the path. It looks nice, but it will cause your character to run in place or strafe as they try to find a spot where their pathing isn't interrupted, forcing you to jump where you shouldn't have to.Combat can be frustrating. Some enemy abilities are impossible to see the radius of without changing your in-game settings to make them more clear; enemies may reset inside of a boss room because you walked around a pillar just outside of their leashing range; enemies can attack you through walls, even though you should be considered out of sight; it can be difficult to see certain attacks coming that you are able to block or roll away from, as their isn't always a clear wind up animation; and, finally, the animation for your character being stunned or locked in place can be hard to make out before you are one-shot by a bosses ability because you couldn't roll.***Despite any, or even all, of those criticisms, I find that I truly enjoy this game. I would recommend it to anyone who likes classic RPGs and MMO's and is comfortable with challenging and immersive content, while still being accessible to both casual and more hardcore players.Unlike other popular MMO's on the market, Elder Scrolls has very mature and dark undertones. The lore and story telling alike references realistic themes of war, violence, politics, intrigue, and sex... but it also has the ability to keep things light with interesting and amusing characters living their daily lives. All of which are mixed in with the world of fantasy, magic, and gods that truly exist and interact with the world in amazing and fantastical ways.This game is also completely LGBTQ+ friendly: with many stories, characters, and references of queer couples, bisexuality, sex changes, non-binary individuals, and more.I highly recommend it."
Positive,11/10 Consumed my future.
Positive,First time playing I only meant to spend an hour in here.  When I logged out I had 6 hours in
Positive,"I originally purchased ESO in 2018 and only played for a few months solo before putting it on the shelf so to speak. in 2019 I gave it another try this time finding myself caught up in PVP and joining a few guilds. There's tons of solo content and I still haven't finished the main quests for all factions, but it's the group content that keeps me coming back. There are dungeons and trials with varying difficulty, events and an awesome community. It's been over a year now and I've logged over 2k hours and am still enjoying it and always have something to keep me busy, may it be dungeons, farming materials, collecting gear or just handing out with friends. This is definitely one of my favourite games.Reasons I would suggest picking up ESO or giving it another try: The graphics are greatTons of content including both PVP and PVESupportive Community"
Positive,"16 hours: love it nothing else to say, i dont give a da mn that i have to pay for some dlcs there is a lot of content without92 hours: Love it more than before <3213 hours: Didnt buy any dlc and i have a looot of things to do. Just give it a try this game is so beautiful and the community too, very friendly and helpful317 hours: i dont play anymore because i dont have that much time but i miss the game :("
Positive,best game ever
Positive,"Great game! Excellent graphics, and a freedom from some of the restrictions found in similar games—e.g. the ability to equip any kind of armour regardless of class. Highly recommended."
Positive,Best MMO ever.
Positive,dobra gra mozna kotem grac i strzelac złuku
Positive,"Highly addictive! Enjoy the game at your own pace and follow whatever path you like. There are plenty of quests available and tons of places to explore. Have fun and don't stress. Just do you! Oh, and don't follow cookie cutter builds. That will lead to not having any fun at all. Create whatever kind of character you wish to have!"
Positive,"A great MMO, despite its bugs and glitches. In terms of content, there is something to suit every gamer - open-world PvP, group PvP, open-world PvE, group PvE, and much more such as roaming/questing, housing, even fishing. No need to be an elite player unless endgame achievements are your thing, the game itself is very casual friendly, and it's even better with a friend or two."
Positive,"The game sucks up a lot of time. I played this on ps4, but should have played pc app along. Some quests are meh, others are pretty good. Def better to play with friends(ofc), but can be played just fine solo. Race, class, equipment and skill points makes for a pretty good system. Downside, a lot of content requires a subscription, and a lot of content you have to pay for after the subscription."
Positive,"As a friendly newcomer and now a member of the hammer cult, i find this game to have improved since the years i last played it and the feeling of battling among various beasts across the vast lands of Tamriel with the omnipotent hammer god watching your back, is just grand"
Positive,"I love the scope of the game and its world.  The character options are plentiful, as are the fight and play styles. The quests are legion. And i love that players help each other in tough situations in the PvE version."
Positive,very bien !
Positive,"If you play any Elder Scrolls game, probably you like this game."
Positive,"Sort of like being able to play Skyrim with friends. If you like mmos and you like the Elder Scrolls games, this is probably the mmo for you."
Positive,"This game is super fun. I have been able to enjoy it by myself or with friends. I enjoyed, but didn't love Skyrim, and while there is a lot of overlap, good and bad between them, ESO fills a unique space between the two and have kept me more than engaged for my current 42 hours. I'm going to keep playing for a long time I am sure."
Positive,I tried the game when it first came out. It was just meh.... I just recently downloaded it again and was blown away by the mount of content on it. This game is soooooooooooo much better than when it came out. I actually feel like im inside the Elder scrolls lore. Highly recommend.
Positive,"This is truly one of the best games on steam!If you are a fan or not, you will enjoy playing this game. It has good cinematography and good graphics as well!Some might be a bit expensive to buy but you can still enjoy the game by earning through numerous quests in game. You can get so many loot from fighting off in dungeons and doing side quests which I think is enough. However, there is still a difference when you avail the ESO plus membership. There is an allowance of crowns and you can purchase so many good loot from the crown store."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is my fav MMO. I've played it on PS4 (years ago) and here, on PC. With my bro! And I am also huge fan of Elder Scrolls series. I really love Elder Scrolls Universe, I really care about it, I hope The Elder Scrolls 6 will be awesome RPG. Anyways, I really like The Elder Scrolls Online. And I love that this game is getting updated with more contents. ❤️ I also really like that you don't have to pay monthly in this MMO unlike many other MMOs. :)"
Positive,"SO many hours, so little time to discover anything xdi love this game, bc all the mission have a different story and some of them, has a suprisingly ending.I love how you can become a werewolf and be part of an amazing family like the Dark Brotherhood.even if I know, it take alota of time, to lvl up, but it part of the game, telling ''do your quest'' because you should do it! xD"
Positive,"Lots of fun, especially if you're familiar with the EOS games."
Positive,"good when it works, which is like 10% of the time"
Positive,Good quest system and story line
Positive,dick and balls
Positive,"So I am obsessed with Elder Scrolls since I first played Morrowind and this game is now my life. I live here now. If you are a fan of Elder Scrolls games, you will definitely enjoy this. I highly recommend getting Plus, as much as I HATE shelling out MORE money it really does make gameplay more enjoyable, especially if you are like me and have to loot ALL THE THINGS and want to do crafting."
Positive,"Hi, i am a veteran of playing multiplayer online role-playing game over 20 years and i can tell you the honest truth, this game is very good mmorpg almost perfect, have a unique experience, very fluid without any type of error and has tremendous potential, has a great story with tons of dungeons and quests and the classic classes to choose, healer, dps, tank or support-dps. Don't wait and try it you won't regret it and you will play for a long time."
Positive,"This is the sequel to Skyrim. In it, lots of things happen. Like a lot. There is a bunch of lore here. It is almost too much. If I had known the hugeness of this game, I would have started working on it release day. I am late to the party. But there is no time like the present to get started."
Positive,"Yeah, I've only played like a couple hours of this game. Its alright."
Positive,cum and shit all in one
Positive,guilt free MMO and a must have for elderscrolls fans! i have the skyrim morrowind and elyswer expansions and they keep becoming more and more incredible!
Positive,this game is like meth to me
Positive,Great game.  I mostly solo play and love the stories and lore (and plethora of lore books).  Getting more involved with some friends in the game and that is a blast.
Positive,"very fun game, worth the $20! and its on sale currently id say its a must buy"
Positive,One of the best mmorpg's I ever played.
Positive,"Im not really an MMO fan. Ive played single player open world RPGs for decades and they have always been my go-to type of game. I really like The Elder Scrolls, but have played them all to death. I thought Id give this a try to see what all the fuss was about. Im glad I did. I really love this game. One of the great things about ESO is you can play it on your own if you wish. You dont HAVE to engage, join a guild, or play with others. You can, but you dont have to. The quests are better than Bethesdas more recent efforts and theres a lot of them. I will be playing and enjoying ESO for a very long time."
Positive,A fun romp through skyrim the dlc costs do add up but the content additions are worth the cost if you get them on sale. Maybe even if you donʻt get them on sale but use the eso plus to get them for 15 bucks a month which is like the cost of sub to other mmos.
Positive,"The current best MMORPG imho!I think that say there's no pay to win in this game is a good start. There's a Crown Store in the game where you can buy a lot of cosmetics, DLCs and account upgrades (such as additional character slots and stuffs like that). You can buy EVERYTHING said above with the game currency. The only thing you will need to pay for is the yearly new chapter (as Greymoor on this year) *IF* you want to play it. Or you can wait for this chapter becomes DLC when the next year chapter's release and buy it with game currency. Also, you don't need to pay for ESO+ (monthly subscription) if you don't want. It's an optional feature and you can play without it with absolutely no problems. And NO! You don't need ESO+ to be a crafterAlso, I would like to point that ESO has an amazing community. If you're totally new to MMORPGs, always will be someone there that will be ready to help you when you need, so don't be afraid to ask. And if you're not new and simply love to socialize while play video games, then be happy! Because I'm sure you will find countless good folks to play with.But well, what if you're a PvE player? ESO is definitely the game for you! Lots of things to do in PvE. There's a lot of lore in this game and also, the game is fully voiced, what can bring even more immersion into the game. Also, you will be free to play as you want with your class, since there's no classes that are premade to be a tank, healer or DPS. Every class can be everything in their unique ways AND you will have a lot of gear sets that you could combine and make a unique play style for yourself. As with your character build, you're free to play how you want, which means that you can start dungeons in the early game, you can focus on quests or maybe you can focus on being a crafter, who knows?And what if you're a PvP player? ESO is the game for you too! There's 2 modes of PvP that you can start already in early game (keep in mind that you won't be totally competitive, since you're in the early), which are Cyrodiil (a Faction x Faction map) and battlegrounds. They're very different from each other and there's a lot of different play styles that you can go through on both of them. Also, you will have a lot of builds to play (since you can combine a lot of gear sets and skills to make a build that fills your play style) without being deleted by someone (as in some other MMOs). Of course that exists *BUILDS* (not classes) that are better than others, but nothing that you can't deal with. What decides who's going to win in ESO's PvP is the personal skill and game knowledge from each player. Don't be afraid to play as you want and learn to play your way!No matters if you're a casual, balanced or a hardcore player, it has stuff for everyone and you can be competitive in both play styles.Plus all of that, addons are supported. You can add a lot of things into your game, such as interface changes, combat mods or mods that will help you with bag organization.The main problem you will find in this game (not much in PvE, it's most in Cyrodiil PvP) is the latency at some times. When the zergs starts doing their job in Cyrodiil, you will notice soon. ZoS is always doing their stuff to improve that, so it's not a dead cause. Personally, it's not a BIG problem and I still can enjoy the game a lot, but I think it's an important point to be said.And one last message for anyone who's going to play: think out of the box! Explore, test new classes and builds and mainly, play your own way!I don't regret any second playing this game, I'll play whenever I can and I HIGHLY recommend everyone to try it too!"
Positive,A slightly better version of Wow in particular of graphics and the fact you can purchase and customize houses.
Positive,"Started to play because i'm a fan of the TES series, i knew its not gonna be like skyrim or oblivion in term of gameplay but I still enjoy it very much.At first i was amazed by the world, you can actually explore almost all of tamriel, lets say if you know and enjoy the lore its amazing because you get to actually see all of these places in one game.Lots of stuff to do like quests, dungeons, group activities, exploring and If you looking to customize the heck out of your character this game is definitely for you.Graphics pretty nice, all NPCs voice acted, thats a big YES (of course you dont have to listen but its nice to have the option).I do find myself sometimes taking a break for a couple of days because it does get repeatedly after some time but it depends on your choice of activity, if you farm expect to get bored.Overall I recommend."
Positive,"This game is probably one of my favourites and delivers everything that you would expect from a high tier MMORPG. However if you're thinking of buying this game for the story I would give it a miss as there isn't a whole lot of story from missions and there isn't much of a narrative but with that being said it does include some incredibly interesting pieces of lore scattered around. Gameplay wise the controls are fine nothing spectacular but nothing that takes away from the game and the fighting itself is rather interesting and unique. The graphics and customisation are where the game truly shines, the graphics are far better than previous vanilla titles which give a more immersive experience and the customisation goes back to how it was before Skyrim. You can choose what boot, gauntlets, trousers, pauldrons, helmets and chestplates you have compared to the much more simplified version of Skyrim whilst keeping its weapon customise-ability."
Positive,can be... a lot to someone who has never played any part of the previous series but the community is usually very welcoming to newcomers and always happy to help. 9/10 overall for mmo/rpg
Positive,Definitely pick this game up when it's on sale for about $10.
Positive,"Its a lot of fun, especially when you play with friends. Personally I love playing the tanky class."
Positive,I like every single little thing in the game
Positive,Best MMO I've ever played!
Positive,"Amazimg game, really fun even if played alone."
Positive,very entretainment and awesome to play in the waters like been pirates
Positive,"Where do I start? It’s beautiful visually and there’s a play style for everyone. Unlike most similar games, if you see something chances are you can interact with it. Majority of the NPCs are voiced and you can interact with them. The game doesn’t require a NASA grade super computer to run smoothly. There isn’t an end to all the stuff I could say about this game, love it.- Nox"
Positive,"I like playing solo like I did in the other ES games and ESO keeps that a choice. You don't have to play Player vs player and can skip the group dungeons. You can still do the quests, craft, level up, and enjoy the game your way. And you can join guilds for several perks. You can also join other players several ways for dragons, dungeons, and other quick events if and whenever you want. It is a big big fantastic world with cool scenery and lots to do and see. I wish the cat banker  offer would come back though as I wanted to purchase it but missed the window."
Positive,"This game is honestly probably the best MMO ive ever played. The game has so much content and replayability it would take thousands of hours to get through it all. I have 100 hours and have barely done anything in the game. However, I do think DLC is way to expensive and also dislike how i need to keep up with subscriptions for the craft bag."
Positive,"I would 10/10 recommend this game to anybody who likes a good MMO experience and playing with friends in a fun community. Most everyone i have interacted with are very helpful and friendly, there are lots of add-ons as well as SOOOOOOOOOOO many things to do across Tameriel as well as so many seasonal events and things given away for free. i love this game and always will."
Positive,I would argue is the most interesting mmo on the market because it feels like a living world. It lets the players decide what they want to do for fun.
Positive,Game is good
Positive,id say buy it
Positive,Very strange game. i bought it soon after it was released and by 2020 now i have played just 796 hours . The game is good and amongst best MMOs out there . Its only near Christmas that the servers lag and there is an insane queue to login. Great game nonetheless.
Positive,"I am a 18 yo father, probably one of the youngest fathers playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he joined my server and made a character. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
Positive,"Do you like the Elder Scrolls lore? GOOD BECAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE IMMERSED IN IT!Do you like solo play? Cool, you can do that.- Immersive storylines, spanning across multiple zones, with choices that ACTUALLY make a difference to how things go in later events in the story (nothing gamebreaking if you make a ""wrong"" choice - just nice flavor differences - different minor NPCs are alive, etc).- QUESTING FOREVER FAMDo you like group PvE? Great! We have that too.- Public Dungeons, Delves, Group Dungeons, World Bosses, Dolmens, we've got ALL THE GROUP PvE here. All of it feeling just enough different from each other that you never have to be stuck in a rut.DO YOU LIKE BATHING IN THE SALTY, SALTY TEARS OF YOUR ENEMIES? WE ARE HERE FOR YOU FAM!- 3-way foreverwar PvP/PvE mixed-mode zone, with a focus on map control and teamfight tactics. Want to siege some castles? WE GONNA SIEGE SOME MOTHER****IN CASTLES FAM. BOIL 'EM IN OIL WHEN THEY BRING THE FIGHT TO US, TOO.- 3-way 5-man random-gametype Halo-style matches. Capture some flags, dominate some points, UTTERLY DECIMATE YOUR OPPONENTS' MORALE WHEN YOU STOMP ON THEIR FACES.tl;dr get this game."
Positive,"One of the best mmos out there, with probably the strongest pve (story) content out of anything I've played, as in it really could be played as essentially a single player elderscolls game with the other multiplayer and mmo related activities as a bonus. Additionally with the game on sale its almost free to play with a sub that's cheap and gives literally all downloadable content aside from the most recent large one!"
Positive,"Okay this will be super long, but heres the short version, if you love PVE and exploring but also creating your own role play even with friends, this game is superb. PVP can be fun if youre good, but this game is meant for PVE so if you want this game for only PVP, youll be missing out on 80% of the game. Now the long Version: unlike WOW you dont nescessarily need the ""ESO Plus"" subscription since you just paid $60 to $100 for the game... so porbz best to get it on sale. but it will help, so when you get into the game, youll be super over whelmed, theres a steep learning curve, but if you watch streamers and ask questions all of them will help you out, i personally watch LuckyGhostTV, hes very helpful and will even go on dungeon grinds and late game trials with you pretty much any time you ask and hes got a spot. with the newest dlc (greymore) adding a part of skyrim everyone remembers, it has seen a huge surge in popularity. makes it fun, meeting all new people, mostly its through the in game chat though, not alot use voice, except for late game Trials (12 player super dungeons, very difficult and different mechanics in each). the tutorial is quick but help screens will popup to help you, and if youve seen streamers play youll learn that basic stuff too. plus LuckyGhostTV has a website for everything youll have questions for about this game, just check out his twitch links. helped me alot, and we did like 30 hours of dungeons together, was fun. important info: ESO PLUS: a subscription service that will give you all the DLCs, extra storage, 10% bonus gold and xp, unlimited crafting material space, and thats just the major stuff, theres a bit more it gives you too, but youll have to check out the webpage for it. as i said before, not really needed for a Must have purchase but i bought it for the year subscription (cheaper) overall. and i got all that stuff, super helpful of course, but what really matters is that it gives you about 19000 ""Crowns"", crowns are the ingame store currency, mostly for cosmetics and stuff, but to get the major dlcs (other than morowwind, summerset, elsywer and greymore you get from buying the Greymore edition(recommend)) you need crowns, they can be from 1500 to 3000, but you dont need them all, there are heaps of guides on it, or youtube vids. but thats what the 12 month subscription gets, and so instead of cosmetics, you buy all the dlcs (which youll already have for 12 months coz of the subscription) so you can play them all anyway after the year ends makes it worth it in the end.but only for 1 year then theres not much use for it, other than the crafting materials space......trust me you need crafting material space if youve played mmos or rpgs with crafting, youll know what i mean. DLC's: the major ones Greymore, Elsywer, Summeset and Morrowind (MUST HAVES) all come as part of the greymore edition, AUS$ 100 atm, but it comes on sale ever now and again, so worth it then. they are the ones youll spend the most time doing.....since they the best and longest. the others are split into minor and dungeon dlcs, minor dlcs are new areas with new quests, they are fun a cool but not must haves and then dungeon dlcs are well.....dungeons....dungeons are you main source of xp and gear as soon as you hit lvl 10, especially since your first dungeon of each day has an insane amount of xp, easily between 1-3 lvls worth. they are great but the base game and major dlcs come with plenty. so even more-so not must haves. learning curve: insane learning curve, but with appropriate prep, (streamers, youtube, website, guides) it will be super easy to jump into. and can be very overwhelming, though to someone who played rpgs or mmos, youll be fine. just focus on one quest line and the main questline dumbledore (actor who played dumbledore voiced the main quest giver) will pop up and tell you to go somewhere, and you just teleport there and all gucci. all in all, will be tough at the start but when you get to lvl 10, youll fly through it. start: there are 3 alliances, each with 3 races, and 6 classes, each race has prefered weapons (will grant quick progression in that weapons skill tree) and each race will have a more suitable class (some better for magika and some better for stamina) now usually you pick your race and they will be especially good for about half the classes and kinda shoddy but defiantly playable for the others. classes aresoccorcer (magic, legit emperor palaptine mode super fun) Dragonknight (FIRE IS MY FRIEND, stamina or magicka) templar (healing and SUN POWER, stamina or magicka) nightblade (assassin and sneaky, stam or mag) warden (tree huggers and pet bear  who will eat you quicker than winnie eats honey, more mag than stam) and necromancer (obvious......isnt it?? note some illegal spells in cities...but it tells you that, surprisingly Stam or Mag can work here) each class has 3 skill trees and each tree has 1 super ability, and 5 active abilities (passive ones too but basics here come on) and you can morph each ability into one of two morphs.....each with different damage types or additional effects. so you could in theory have 54 different playthroughs....usually you just do one per class though so 6 but you can have 9 characters to start off and can switch between them very easily. so heaps of different variety. Servers: there are two locations, europe and North america, american streamers play obviously on NA, but you can switch servers but you will not carry any characters or progress from your NA server to EURO. LuckyGhostTV plays on NA, and streamers will tell you which server they play on so you can join their ""instance"" like mini unseen servers so you dont have 10,000 people lagging out one, though you dont notice until you and your friend go to the same place and cant see eachother, you just send the other a join party request or add into ingame friends and youll join and see and explor together, most quests except for the main story are multiplayer, so you can play with mates so long as you both havnt done it previously on that characters. and make sure your friends join the same server location (Euro or NA) otherwise they will have to start from scratch again. PVE: obviously being a elder scrolls game, pve is what its famous for, and my god........easily 800 hours + of content just in quests. each different and unique to eachother, voices are really well done, and combat against creeps is super fun and boss battles are epic and challenging. Dungeons are superb, going along with 3 other heroes, beating a few minor bosses until the major boss, each with different mechanics, then at lvl 40 you get the Vet dungeons, often the same dungeon as youve probably already played......but 300% more difficult, then......the creme de la creme......the 12 player trials, mics will mostly be needed, intense and long are these trials, with multiple bosses, and if you dont kill one and skip to the main super boss youll fight all the skipped ones as well. can take someitmes an hour or more, depending on deaths, and each with a multitude of mechanics, you will need experience players for each trial to help you......they will test your nerve and skill. PVP: this game has a dedicated region for PVP, so by no means did they ignore the mmo aspect, there are even two skill trees for pvp related instances, and questlines. but most of all its a battle between the three alliances of races, each viaing control for the elder scrolls, and territory to be proclaimed emperor of tamriel, personally not a massive pvp player myself, but there are specialised modes, like team death match, capturing flags and things and also the free roam pvp area. META is king and constantly evolving, beware. Overall: this MMO RPG is a up to date, surprisingly good graphic for its age (updated severalal times), very populated, ultimate role play and customisation, endless hours of quests and exploring. Cheers (ran out of characters)"
Positive,"in my opinion this game for the people that love skyrim will be their new favourite game of all time it has a lot of things for example gear farming leveling, killing, playing dungeons with a group of 4 or taking trials on with 16 people, pvp has its own open world area where you do as you wish. A wide choice of builds and ways to play the game. I have put a lot of time into this game on xbox and now i am on PC and still want to play more i highly recomend this game to all the skyrim fans out there."
Positive,This game is huge. You can play for months and you will still discover new features you did'nt know.
Positive,Tons of hours of entertainment!
Positive,Dont buy this game.Ditto's wife
Positive,very good game beside people calling other people names l
Positive,it's okay i guess
Positive,"It is old and the user interface stinks, but there is so much content and the people are fairly nice for an mmo. Lots of different game aspects, housing vampires werewolves (if you like that idea)queuing dungeons role play raids pvp.  I tried it when it first came out and decided it was awful, but they have really worked on it and it is pretty fun."
Positive,"""Play the way you like"" ??Yes.By this, these devs obviously mean stopping every 2 minutes to drop useless garbage from your inventory.Wasting your time because you aren't forking over $15 a month for inventory space.You'd think in a game designed around grinding dungeons for rewards, farming enemy spawns/world bosses or just completing some of the hundreds of side quests there are, that they would give you some good inventory space.Nope. But then again, that's how it's designed. It is, by every standard, designed to frustrate you to the point of paying them $15 a month for an upgraded inventory.My core issues with this game: They force you to download 100+ GBs of a game that should only be, what? Maybe 20 at best? Unless you buy DLC, you can't access 90% of the ""content"" they wasted your time with forcing you to download. Limited inventory space and a bigger inventory being tied behind a $15/month subscription is literal garbage. With how many DLCs this game has (18) and countless bundles they sh-t out constantly, you'd think they make enough money as-is without having to tie inventory space behind a subscription, but no. Mounts/pets are absolutely ridiculous to obtain. Thankfully they actually give you a basic horse mount and a basic dog as a leveling reward. Player base is meh at best. The poorly-dated UI can sometimes be really annoying and buggy. Leveling is extremely boring. Play quest, kill stuff, collect reward/xp on repeat. It never changes unless you go farm dungeons or bosses or enemy spawn locations which is just as boring. Forced-LFG dungeons. YEET solo players, I guess. PVP seems unbalanced and ridiculously difficult/unfair at times, but what game has balanced PVP, right? Keybinds are weird and confusing AF by default. Game taunts you with in-game purchases constantly each time you log in and there are references to the store/premium currency literally everywhere in the game's UI. Very typical. For whatever reason, this game running @ 1080p with no downscaling makes the framerate die half the time, even on a 1050ti. Game grows increasingly boring unless you've got friends to play it with. (I took a year-long hiatus after roughly 106 hours of solo play) Plenty of professions and homes you really don't need and just exist for xp farm/things to do outside of quests.The good about this game? Mods are useful. Especially UI mods or damage number mods, because it helps with adding useful info to the game's UI that should've been there to begin with if ESO wasn't such sh-t. Game can probably run on a toaster powered by hamsters, so.. yeah, that's good I guess. Probably thanks to how dated the graphics are.In short, this game forces you to struggle with your dignity.At every turn it tries to push you to pay $15/month, but if you're diligent, you can slowly farm gold and buy inventory upgrades yourself."
Positive,"When ESO first came out, I was absolutely disappointed.  After they patched the game up and took away the monthly subscription fee, it has gotten much better.  The dialogue is amazing and the lore goes in-depth (if that's what you're into).  Definitely a fun game to log into for a few hours and play or just level up here and there."
Positive,"This game is a lot of fun! It is more of a challenge than some MMOs. The normal stuff is there but the carryover and crossover between characters is great!Your total hours played can be very wrong though. Leaving the launcher up counts as ""hours"" so close it out all the way if that matters to you."
Positive,"Good looking, very big game :)"
Positive,"i ate a cheese wrap once, i dont remember what it tasted like"
Positive,"After spending 100+ hours on this game. I think I will make a review. This game is fantastic. There's so much content to do that you literally can't complain about not knowing what to do. You got the main quests, side quests, zone quests, pvp, and pve (I think I am missing a few more). If you don't have membership, don't worry. There's still plenty of things to do as a free to play, but obviously it's recommended to have ESO+ if you want to experience everything. I will want to point out a couple of things to the devs though and i'm sure they like the way it is set up. The grouping system is terrible. It's hard doing the same quests with friends if majority of the time it doesn't count towards progress on half the quests we do. I get the whole point of the grouping system is meant for group dungeons, but I like to use it to do the same quests with my friends with all of the progression gets counted for all of us instead of doing it individually. The other thing. I personally think we should get Steam achievements as well. I think it will make some achievement hunters feel good about getting achievements for this game through Steam as well. I will rate this game 8/10 since it's not too perfect, but it's a really good game. I recommend buying this game even though it has a bit of some issues like the group system for example."
Positive,Oh god so many hours.
Positive,A must play
Positive,I like how quest level with you so you have time to do them
Positive,"At launch i did not enjoy this game really due to many issues but it has slowly come together to be a truly great game. The devs keep it fresh by adding content constantly, i wish there was not such an emphasis on the microtransactions but you can ignore them if you so choose and still 100% enjoy your time on eso."
Positive,"If you wanna play ""Skyrim"" with other players, there you go."
Positive,I like the gameplay and some realism in the story and progression. It makes you really feel you are living in a fantasy D&D type of world.
Positive,"like warframe, can be put down and picked up at any moment, 6 months or 3 years apart. always an active community and a fun fantasy MMO"
Positive,not bad fun with friends and worth on sale only
Positive,This has been one of my favorite games since it came out. I love the different areas of the map and the quests. It's got a high replay value and something just keeps me coming back to it. ^^
Positive,"totally awesome MMORPG, played a lot from this genre and I can only recommend ESO"
Positive,i like game is good
Positive,"I murdered a dark elf in cold blood.A guard came running towards me.STOP CRIMINAL SCUM, I'M HERE TO COLLECT YOUR REWARDI payed 7 gold and returned a recently robbed lemon.Never steal lemons.Stealing lemons is illegal.10/10"
Positive,Honestly got no idea what i'm doing but it seems alright so far
Positive,"just like console, just better mechanics"
Positive,"i love mmo's, i love skyrim, i mean come on, how do i not enjoy this?"
Positive,"Apart from the extremely expensive premium subscription plan and the in-game currency ""crowns"", it's a pretty neat game. All quests have background stories, which I like, it makes the quests feel meaningful."
Positive,"I'll start with the Pros:So, I've played this game on and off since about 2017-ish. Hands down, this is the only MMO I've ever thoroughly enjoyed. I played a lot of WoW back in the day, and I just can't anymore, too many bad memories, and the community is so extremely toxic. I've tried a dozen or so times to get into games like Guild Wars 2, Black Desert Online, Terra, and many others, but this? This one is where it's at. I mostly enjoy playing by myself. A good 80% of ESO's content is soloable. The rest is obviously not meant to be soloable: pvp, trials (ESO's raids), World Bosses, etc. The sheer amount of soloable content is astounding though. 3 Alliances, 20 zones between them plus a few others are what you get in the base game. Each Zone has an over arcing story line that ties into its Alliance Story. Best of all, it *feels* like an Elder Scrolls game. The quests feel like Elder Scrolls quests, and while not all of them are ""exciting"" they all fit well. That's my biggest issue with other MMO's the quests are either *too* bland or they feel forced, or added on at the last second, or they just outright don't fit. That isn't the case with ESO for me. Now for the Cons:A frustratingly large amount of content is locked behind pvp walls. Cyrodiil is enormous, and you cannot just do Cyrodiil without queueing into a pvp session. It's annoying. I don't care for pvp, if that's your thing, ESO has a lively pvp crowd, yes they can be toxic at times, but I've found ESO's community to be one of the least toxic. The game is also very Pay for Quality of Life heavy. I understand it, but it's there, and it is a con. One of the biggest examples is the Craft Bag, without it, every crafting material you collect goes into your regular inventory. That can very, very, quickly fill it up. The Craft Bag is infinite though, and is granted upon purchase of ESO+. I think ESO+ is worth it, but at $15 a month it's a bit pricey. ESO+ Also comes with other QOL things that should just be for everyone, I feel. Such as the ability to dye armor and clothing, extra bank storage, and double furniture space within player owned housing.   Changes I'd Like to See:***Mount upgrades to be account-wide*** this is a big one, I understand Zenimax makes a lot of money off of this, but still, that's something I really want. I'd like to see less content locked behind PVP, or a way to get to that content without having to engage with PVP players. More response when it comes to Taking Action against toxic players, there is very little to no indication that reporting people *does anything*, it's important to know that people who are actively harmful are held accountable. All that being said, I have surprisingly little bad to say about ESO. If you've been thinking of trying it out, go for it! There's an enormous world for you to explore, with just the basegame, and ESO+ gives you access to all but the very newest of Large Chapters."
Positive,"I'm gonna make this first point VERY clear here, if what you want is a 'traditional' Elder Scrolls game of which Skyrim is the only one I've played you probably won't find what your looking for in the Elder Scrolls Online.The Elder Scrolls Online does have it's fair share of issues like unoptimal performance and 'unnecessary' patches that change seemingly minor things, though, to be fair the latter part can come with any MMO.Despite that the combat is more active and engaging than in most other MMOs, with no real cooldown aside for the one second global one that's mainly there for the sake of balance and performance, the graphics are also pretty good as long as you're not playing on low or minimum, and the soundtrack is fairly decent as well.As for the endgame it's mostly Veteran content which is a higher difficulty mode that applies to every trial and dungeon except for 'public' ones which, like world bosses which, I don't perceive as endgame content.In terms of PvP we have Cyrodil, a massive PvP oriented zone that suffers from various performance issues, along with Battlegrounds which is a 4v4v4 battle royale kind of thing with various game modes like 'Capture-The-Flag', Deathmatch and other classics.If you're looking for a relatively fun MMO experience with active combat I'd definitely recommend this game. If what you're looking for is an Elder Scrolls game or the likes I probably wouldn't recommend it as much."
Positive,very very naise game
Positive,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this game so much that I've willingly accepted the crippling gambling problem it has caused me. Loot boxes with the illusion of equitable rewards and implementing the ""gem"" system to elude future legal action has put me in a vicious cycle of spending money until I receive my 50$ spectral chicken pet.The gameplay is good, but not nearly as good as the sensational rush I get when opening a couple dozen crates. I feel physically high whenever I think about it.I laugh when I think about my past self playing this game with the impression that is was going to be anything like Skyrim. It is so much more then that. Thanks to the pure adrenaline I feel whenever a new set of crates is released or an expansion comes out.The best part about this game is only having to log on for a few minutes to shovel some cash into the store and get my fix of crates. When they added the daily log in rewards my routine strengthened and I was easily becoming more invested, sometimes buying more then one set of a dozen crates in a single day.I joke with my friends sometimes that in the future I would be on my deathbed and my last words would be ""please... someone get my daily"", but I don't think I'll ever be able to tell them that I'm being sincere."
Positive,"As someone really new to MMOs, this being the first one I have committed to heavily, I have found the community and game play really the highlights of the game. It's very much a choose your own adventure and I believe there's something for everyone."
Positive,"Very big, open world game and you're able to play with your friends and practically unlimited lore? This game is a win for my first online game/experience."
Positive,Fun to play with friends.
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls universe is one of the best rpg I've played and TESO is no exception. The world-building and lore keeps improving and the cultural designs are just wonderful. The vast cast of characters with their amusing dialogues and personalities and their numerous quests to do is what makes ESO interesting. Plus, the soundtrack is so beautiful to listen to. The graphics are also amazing but sometimes, because of internet connections, the game does lag a lot and I get kicked out often. But if I get a chance to play uninterrupted for 3-4 hours then I find the gameplay worth it. Still, since it's a MMO, it's better to play with friends or a group to maximize the experience and increase your chances of surviving a boss fight. This is a game for all players!"
Positive,"Yuh, YuhMoonlightSpotlight I don't even really wanna spotlightBut they really put me in the limelight[?] with the spotbite And I got that, new pipe, what I wanna do with this new pipeGot a Desert Eagle and it's FortnitePlaying like it's FortniteYeahUhYeahIn the moonlightIn the spotlightI don't really wanna limelight Niggas put me in the motherfucking limelightNiggas put me in the motherfucking limelightYou can move me out the motherfucking limelightCause I really really really wanna blow pipesYeah yeahYeah yeahLil purpp really go yeah yeahYeah yeahYeah yeahLil purpp really go yeah(sounds)"
Positive,"Like lemon butter on a honey sweet roll, bathed in moon sugar fresh from a Dwemer oven."
Positive,"Action-based MMORPG. More active than WoW, and class customizability is high without being complicated."
Positive,"As a WoW player, this game has plenty to do with a cool weapon swap mechanic"
Positive,Fun and addicting. Easy to play with a good community. Good graphics with a strong story line. Would highly recommend.
Positive,good game recommend killing the guards good loot ;)
Positive,"Got it on sale for 2$, base game, it's absolutely worth that price, wonderful game, lots of improvements over its offline predecessor, and you can enjoy it like a single player campaign or a multiplayer experience as you fancy."
Positive,"Probably one of the most fun MMO's i've played in a while. randomly came back after playing WoW and other things inbetween, and it was so refreshing and interesting."
Positive,Good game for those who want to put in the time.
Positive,Its a good game
Positive,Amazing! i love it so much!
Positive,<3 looking for people to play with :D add me
Positive,pretty fun so far. but the feels sorta buggy not bad tho.
Positive,"I am an old school early 80s D&D and Ultima 3 kinda RPG player. I have been playing this game for several years with over 1300 hours invested in it and I still think it is one of the best. The community also seems less toxic than some online games, and people will usually help out if you ask. Most of the events are alot of fun and the game is good for solo or group players. I enjoy the crafting system but tend to get my butt kicked in PvP due to this, but still. Tons of fun to be had."
Positive,"Its fun, you don't feel obligated to play for skins and stuff like other games, its just quests, progression, and it feels comfortable to go at your own pace. I love it"
Positive,This is a great game to play with friends!
Positive,"Ich spiele das Game bereit seit 400 Stunden und ich liebe es immer noch <3 Es ist egal ob man Eso + hat oder nicht, es macht Spass. Egal ob man Questet, PVP, Housing oder das Antiquitäten System macht, es ist für jeden was dabei :)"
Positive,"The game is pretty old, but it has aged alright. Player Statistics on Steam is irrelevant, the game is on different Store platforms besides Steam. It doesn't matter if you pay2play or slay on the base game that's free after the initial purchase - there is plenty of content, many public dungeons, delves and dungeons to do before you are done with the free content. Most of my hours has been as free2play, and I am not done with quests and exploring yet so this game is great if you want to play for long without spending more than initial costs.Endeavours lets you get microtransaction skins after doing weekly ""challenges"", it isn't fast but for getting mounts and such - it works.Compared to other ""F2P"" games, this game is definitely among the better ones, but considering there's a initial cost to play, I wouldn't call it F2P but that's how you will hear other players constantly moan about players who aren't paying to play. Just ignore them, the game is great as is. The only change I would ask for is a way to buy ESO+ using gold, just like RuneScape or World of Warcraft does it with RS Bonds or WoW Tokens. As mentioned, there's plenty to do as a free player, and you can wear any gear in the game so if you need a specific gear that requires a certain DLC to grind for, luckily you can buy it directly from Guild Stores which is basically Auction House like World of Warcraft but there's different Guild Traders that player-made Guilds have to win the location for in-world using in-game gold, the normal currency you get from trading with NPCs or other players. A bit complex system, but as long as you're in a trader guild, you can always access your own Guild's store from any Banker NPC.Of all MMOs that I've played, which include RS3, OSRS, WoW, JD and GW2 - only ESO lets you basically play whatever gear you want without having to use specific abilities, you can use any weapon and any armour - most abilities will work with your armour, and for Staff/One-Handed/Dual Wield-specific abilities, those will also work fine if you run Light, Medium or Heavy armour. I've had the best time making my own gear setups and putting those to use to slay veteran dungeons or help people out by healing. Yes I play Healer, and you should too. Easiest way to get into dungeons besides tanking. DPS queue timer sucks, healer is instant-queue. ;)"
Positive,"Never really played a MMO before, so I'm just enjoying this as a single player game with some coop possibility. And I'm loving it. 36 hours in, and I've barely seen anything, but:- The quests are great. Darker than I expected. So far at least two people have chosen to ""die"" in order to save somebody else. (I'm guessing they're not dead, but will return in some badass way.)- The skills feel great. There is a magic whip that goes ""whaaaapah"". With the Dark Brotherhood DLC, you can do some horrific assasinations. OR try join the much nicer thieves guild, who don't really kill anybody.- The graphics and setting are lovely. My only complaint is that people keep queuing in front of NPCs, but I guess this is common in MMOs, And for every queue, there are somebody who shows up and saves me from being killing. Fun game."
Positive,"Quite a good mix of singleplayer experience, exploration and there is some elements of an MMO in there. I cannot say i explored those very much. But the nostalgia of morrowind was there in some forms, and I enjoyed those moments. Tried during the free week during some spare time."
Positive,"This game is HUGE. The open world, I mean. There are some crashes in this game. You will need good wifi to enjoy this game but other than that, it has a beautiful world with a good story into it. Finishing quests is so rewarding. This game has a skill tree, class system, character customization, and you can chose your own race. It is an amazing game. Oh, and I forgot to mention that you can learn alchemy, woodwork, forging and more!Lastly, I want to point out that the ESO Plus is basically the extension pass and a monthly fee, so if you dont want to pay monthly I would suggest buying the $59.99 Greymore pack"
Positive,"Fun, but what a huge time sink.  There is no going back, so research your choices if you want to optimize.  Or just play and not care."
Positive,"really good MMO, so many potential. I love this game."
Positive,dope game fo sho
Positive,its a lot better then it used to be worth the buy if you catch it on sale
Positive,great game love the story line
Positive,now this is pogchamp
Positive,"Tot un món per a descobrir i habilitats per a ajudar-t'hi.La communitat sembla agradable, a més :)"
Positive,so fun good game
Positive,"for me atm one of the best mmorpg, still has some bugs and some balance to do but nothing to badbut every new player should watch some beginner guides on youtube to make the start easier"
Positive,this game is very fun i fully recommend it to anyone. the quests are really good .
Positive,"Good game yes yes, lots of quests"
Positive,"when i first got this game back in 2013 i was too used to WOW and didnt like some of the things from this game but since then i have noticed a lot of ease of life changes and this game is far more enjoyable than the current state of wow in its BFA state right now. I suggest trying this game out for sure if you're looking for a change of pace in your MMORPG. It reminds me of what it used to be to play MMORPG. This is a great game yes it does have a few issues like most games do, since nothing is perfect but i easily sunk in 200+ hours within the last few weeks."
Positive,"Solo players= PVE story stuff and maybe PVP after getting a decent buildGuild=RP & Good system from what I've seen (I am mainly a solo player so not much experience here)Small group=RP, dungeons and trials + PVPOnly thing I'm not a huge fan of is the combat system is pretty dull especially if you come from things like BDO.Overall I would recommend this game to anyone that wants an MMO that pretty much checks all the boxes."
Positive,"The best thing about ESO is easily the graphics, for an MMORPG they are amazingstory is as good as the other elder scrolls games, but there is a lot more story in total due to the size of the gameI would appreciate if they stop with the game and start making TES VI after they did every province for Tamriel (except the deep swamp in Blackmarsh, the lore says its 100% jungle and you cant really make a game where 90% of the screen is filled up by trees, bushes and angry wildlife)c0da forever, praise ALMISVIoh and Morrowind best dlc till now"
Positive,"Back when I was soul-searching for a new MMO, ESO popped up on sale and I figured it would be a fun weekend. A little romp in the sheets, a little something something for each of us. I didn't realize how hooked I was going to be with the gameplay and the RPG systems. I never really reach endgame status with MMOs, but getting hooked into ESO got me their in almost no time. This game was special, and it hit me at just the right time."
Positive,better the second time around
Positive,Hands down the best mmorpg available right now on the market. Lot's of content to do. Only bad thing is no SEA servers and i have 230++ ping at best. So 9.5/10. If you can look past the ping issue it's really great!
Positive,"Good MMO that you or your kids can play, starts out easy and the dungeons get incredibly difficult with a group of 4.Haven't done trials yet, but looking forward to doing them.Very grindy to get to the harder dungeons."
Positive,"I have loved all of the Elder Scrolls games, and this one is no different. Although Skyrim is my all time fave, ESO is the most played game in my inventory (currently) and with new DLCs coming out almost regularly now, I don't see myself getting tired or bored anytime soon. If you enjoy MMORPGs, questing and running dungeons, even PVP events, then this is the game for you."
Positive,"Picked the game back up after last playing during the beta and first month of launch. Games come along way and is pretty fun to play. Has it's flaws like most games but I've yet to experience anything that genuinely puts me off playing. The quest system and sync system have a good feel to it, you're purely free to explore areas like Skyrim and do quests when you feel like it. The world and lore are amazing and every zone I walk I find something new or see an entire landscape that has my attention the entire time i'm there. Great to look at, great to explore. Definitely worth the 1 time purchase."
Positive,mt friends got me this game and i love itso many side quests to complete!
Positive,dd mega doodoo
Positive,I love the story.
Positive,still very good m8.
Positive,Its a MMO that is fun to play. It is singleplayer as much as multiplayer.
Positive,I love the Elder Scrolls series so I was super excited when they launched ESO. I love it! Grey online multi-player game :)
Positive,I like it
Positive,"i dont care what anyone says about this game, i love eso and everything about it. ive played it on and off since release and i still love it. i enjoy the community and barely encounter ignorant people. i dont encounter bugs or connection problems, i always have something to do, i have 357 hours in the game right now on pc and i still have a ton to do. tons of customization, you have a chance to buy some in store items if you grind hard enough for it. i would recommend trying eso plus though so you have a ton more space in your bank and inventory, plus you get to play in a ton more dungeons and such that are dlc dungeons. it kinda blows not having it in my personal opinion. but yeah i love the game and i love to see others play this game."
Positive,"Whilst I did have a problem beforehand with the whole play button being changed to the words, ""Purchase,"" and directing me to the store page just for me to press Play Now and have it only refresh the page, I simply waited and it's completely fixed now. Overall besides that one problem I'd definitely recommend this game."
Positive,"Never played an MMO before, but I'm loving it!"
Positive,it wont work :((((edit: I played a lot of it now and I have no life and I wanna get ESO married :((((
Positive,"Game plays great, when steam allows you to play the game"
Positive,"So much customization, very fluid game play. No auto attacking in pvp or dungeons. Aswell as a very helpful and bustling community making your trade skills very useful. This game is great!"
Positive,it is fun but repetitive in my opinion
Positive,"first and last mmo i will ever play , im enjoying the game , but it take alot of time to learn and to lvl but its very good game"
Positive,"This game has very immersive combat, easily to understand skills, and a comprehensive crafting system. The graphics are easily on the eyes as well."
Positive,very good game. i love the story and the fact that its all voice acted
Positive,everyone looks malformed
Positive,"Cool mmorpg , graphics are great . Definitely will be getting back to this game . Mounts are solid good too . Part of the holy trinity WoW ESO and FFXIV !! 8.5/10"
Positive,Perfect for MMO and Elder Scrolls fans. Majority positive and helpful community
Positive,i love this game can be a bit of a grind
Positive,It's fun and painful at the same time
Positive,Dragons!? In your own homeland!?
Positive,"Very immersive.  Deep enough to keep your interest.  Challenging.  Just picked it up again and was reminded why I stopped playing 2 years ago.  I was putting way too much time into the game.  Just wanted to do one more thing, then another, etc.  Am going to try to be more disciplined this go around."
Positive,i have a sever addiction please help me.
Positive,"Let me start with the good: the game overall plays really well, and provides way more challenge than other MMOs I am used too. The controls are slightly different coming over from World of Warcraft or RuneScape, so expect a bit of learning curve.The mixed feelings: Zones arent levelled. You may quickly find yourself getting killed by something you arent prepared to see thinking that nothing strong can be this close to the starting areas... they are. Experience is also challenging to acquire if youre new and not sure what you are doing. These arent necessarily bad things though and I find it extends game play.The really not good: lots of bugs in the game. Lots of restarting and reloading the game. Overall the game like I said plays really well and I look forward to continue playing despite the bugs."
Positive,"I was never really into online gaming at 1st... even though I been gaming for well over most of my live back when Dos and Donkey Kong was the Sh*t. When Elder Scrolls Skyrim was released it became one of the best games I have ever played..because apart from being a really good and immerse game in my opinion.. it brought me out of a dark time in my life back then. Then ESO was released at a later stage and I was even more excited to play it.. ESO was the very 1st Online Game I have ever wanted to play.. but at that time I could not due to circumstances, Now that I only recently got the play it, even though I have been playing other online games for over a year now that friends and family has recommended to play.. I always wanted to buy this game but never did.. maybe I liked the Mystery of not knowing what If.. but now that I have started.. It was definitely worth the wait."
Positive,Get called a furry for playing the game 10/10
Positive,This takes me back to the hundreds of hours spent on Oblivion. I love the exploration and the world design. The excellent voice acting from all the NPC's really brings the world to life. Looking forward to investing many hours into this one.
Positive,"love this game, in my opinion they have made an awesome Online game for the Elder Scrolls series. It has a lot of content and the quests are interesting, also the crafting system is incredible- I am a collector and I definetly have a lot of fun with collecting materials in the huge and beautiful world of ESO and then craft (:"
Positive,ep have small pp
Positive,It is good game.
Positive,well what i have to say i feel like i played beta game
Positive,"This game is a mixed bag for me. It's awesome to go around visiting the world of Tamriel, while being able to play online with friends and get loot and cool gear. After all, it is called Elder Scrolls Online. On the other hand, I feel like the writing could be improved. Many quests just feel bland to the point where I just skip through dialogue to save time. Not to mention, the voice acting talent isn't all that great, with the exception of a few characters (Sai Sahan and Sheogorath are both voiced great IMO). Overall, it is a fun MMORPG to play with friends, but the quality in the quests is sort of lacking.EDIT: After a couple hundred more hours of playing, I can more fully flesh out this review. I thoroughly enjoy the combat in this game. While some people may feel it's very telegraphed and easy to predict, I find it's among the best combat systems in any MMO out there. It's not as simple as spamming abilities; you have to manage your resources and sustain, you have to weave abilities into your light and heavy attacks, learn to cancel animations, optimise your front bar and rear bar for your optimal ability rotation, use self heals, etc. It's a very involved form of combat that is very rewarding. It's not mindless like some MMORPGs, like WoW for example. The big downside to ESO however, is the fact that nearly every interaction with the game world is ping-dependent. If your ping tanks, then abilities won't register in combat, and your DPS will very quickly plummet. It's very annoying at times, and even things like opening doors or chests won't register either. Long story short, if you want to stand a chance in PvP, then at least get decent internet. Other than that, I have enjoyed this game immensely so far, and hope to put many more hours into this great game.EDIT 2: After another few hundred hours, I can add yet more to this review. The crafting in this game is interesting to say the least. I found myself constantly running out of bank space, because I'd use it to store all my crafting materials, which is a big part of why ESO Plus exists. With ESO Plus, all of your materials are moved to a bottomless Crafting Bag, which is nice for those who are trying to become a Master Crafter. So far, I bought 3 months of ESO plus, and despite what most people say about the price, I'd say it's worth it. You get a regular income of Crowns equivalent to the price of your ESO subscription, on top of which you get access to all DLCs, the Craft Bag, 10% XP and Gold boosts, double bank space, double transmute crystal space, and a few more decent bonuses. Overall I'd say ESO Plus isn't a bad investment if you're regularly playing this game like me."
Positive,"The base game alone has over a thousand hours worth of content available, usually on sale (or maybe a free-to-play weekend, eh), which might also be a pack with one or a couple of the DLC. And you can play without a subscription. That's like handful of Elder Scrolls Games at your fingertips for the price of nice legacy bundle. You can easily play solo or with a group. (It's still an MMO, there are some areas and activities which you will need to perform in concert with other players.) And when you play solo, it feels like playing the older Elder Scrolls games. I spend most of my MMO game time solo and playing ESO felt like running through Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim... and this takes place during the Second Era; 800 and 1000 years before the games I'd played and fell in love with. Which mean running through, in person, tons of lore that I'd only thought and dreamed about while enjoying the ES Universe. What a freaking game. I truly love it. I can play it whenever I want and there are a million different ways however you want to play the game... I think a lot of people would enjoy it. If you see this on sale, just grab it and check it out, if you like any of the other ES games I mentioned earlier - go to a place you love if it's accessible and see what's there, and a ton of Tamriel is available to you. Not everything. But, just, wow. Want to meet the Tribunal? Blows my mind. It's gorgeous. They've done a lot of little things with this game that I appreciate, and that's always kept me curious to see what else is new. If you love Elder Scrolls and you're curious, I think you'll find something you love in this game."
Positive,"This game is so immersive and has one of the most usable UI's I've experienced in a long while. The house decorating adds a different element to the game which is enjoyable also. Especially since you can craft or buy the items, and you can buy with different currencies. Being able to be in more than one guild is also rather beneficial and the ability to add notes to users in friend and guild lists also helps with managing and recognizing users. The dungeons and quest content also feel more relevant than some other mmos where they just send you out to collect things for every damn quest with no real point to them. The developers are always adding new content and keeping the game fresh, plus the community is full of life and you're missing out if you're not already a part of the world of Tamriel."
Positive,It is a great game but takes too long to level up and can become tedious to just keep killing monsters.
Positive,gets boring and repetitive fast the only good stuff is really from the expansions as per usual for MMO games so yeah. get this game when it's on sale for dirt cheap then buy the expansions when your able honestly.
Positive,thats a cool game id never played good mmo like that since a while
Positive,Only played a few hours but seems good.
Positive,"The game has so much to offer, and you an do pretty much anything you want and never run out of quests."
Positive,Addictive and breathtaking
Positive,"mix of wow, rift and swg. pretty neato"
Positive,"I left mmos after being bored [WoW, others}, went to arma 3  and star citizen, then got bored again, then i found ESO and my initial thought was 'these graphics are whatever, blah blah time to grind or run through quests like every other mmo, but ESO was different. First off the quest are insanely cool because they actually talk to you and no subtitles, i dunno im still new but i recommend"
Positive,"Decent plots/story and great lore; lots of quests; freaking cool races, classes and character creation; nice PvP. I would not recommend this game if you are playing it with your partner to get married and buy a house together (it doesn't work) :DThe DLCs that come with the game are too expensive but you don't REALLY need them to have a good gaming experience. There are a lot of money-walls for collectibles, you can't really grind for them. The main currency (crowns) you have to buy with real money (also freaking expensive) to buy certain collectibles in-game. BUT, if you don't have a problem with spending a lot of money on a game or playing a ""limited version"" of it, then you're good to go!"
Positive,"Coming from playing mainly WoW as my main MMO. Have played ff14 as well. Did not like Black desert. I am enjoying myself so far. There are plenty of other players around so the world feels alive. The combat and skill tree is simple and kinda fun. Doing the first world boss felt like a challenge and wasn't a breeze, if you stand on the crap on the floor you might die. Overall I think it's worth trying, I only purchased the base game.edit: Tried the dungeons and the battleground. The dungeons were good/ok, standard dungeon stuff, tanks get first queue. The BATTLEGROUNDS however HOLY **** its fun at least the first time around. I prefer this battleground over world of warcraft battlegrounds and heres why. My character was not even optimized for pvp but I was getting focused so I used one of my tanking skills and we ended up stomping the other teams. One thing I hate about WoW when you are playing casually is you will run into premades/twinks constantly, these battlegrounds are 4v4v4 and frankly I feel the player skill carries over incredibly. 10/10 battleground experience."
Positive,Better than Fallout 76
Positive,Good game. A bit sad that even after buying you still can pay to advance faster but i guess they have to keep those servers running
Positive,Ich küss dich grade
Positive,Suchtpotential! Hab in meinen ersten 50h spielzeit schon 435 Euro in skins und booster geballert!
Positive,"Great game, has continued to improve since launch and feels like a real MMO now, but one that does its own thing, the story is good if that is your thing, if not just accept quests and click through the dialog to grind them out. Crafting system is different than other games I've played but much more in line with an Elder Scrolls game."
Positive,"Still a very good game, highly recommended. If your a fan of the Elder Scrolls genre then this is a must have for your collection. Don't let the ""in game store"" scare you away, it's fluff items as i call them, cosmetics, non combat pets, mounts etc."
Positive,The best game :)
Positive,great storyline and and good to play with a group of friends ^_^
Positive,"Everyone has their favorite MMO. I love the universe that was built and this proves to be a solid game year after year. Dev is very involved, but no game is perfect. Give it a few hours and let yourself get sucked in :)"
Positive,Pretty fun game. Feels more like an rpg than an mmo
Positive,Razum dar is my best friend
Positive,"I've had this game since release, and it really never hooked my truly until recently. I was so disappointed on release that it took me a long time to come back to this game, trying again and again after each expansions release. But now in it's current state, it's some of the most fun I've had with a game. Great community, performance issues can be annoying but it's never taken away from the experience for me. A nice fun game to sink time into, and a very nice introduction to MMOs I feel without slacking on content for more veteran players. Would highly recommend!"
Positive,The best game.
Positive,Awesome game for 8$ bucks cannot go wrong easy mechanics. Good for play with friends
Positive,really good time killer especially with friends
Positive,"Cute game, I'm not sure why everyone says this is a bad game. This has been a cool game and it looks amazing. Lore is top notch. Really recommend!!!!"
Positive,"Excellent game play, good graphics, easy to learn technicalities within the game"
Positive,This game is so much fun. I like doing the quests and also like the open world concept.
Positive,"Great game! You can make a stealth archer to relive your 99 different stealth archer playthroughs from Oblivion and Skyrim. Steal all the bread and cheese wheels you come across and basically play Elder Scrolls. You could probably play for 6-12 months straight and never run out of pure RPG Elder Scrolls story content. Then realize you still have 6+ months of optional group content after remembering you were playing an MMO the whole time. Anyways, lets cut to the chase. Make your stealth archer."
Positive,"This is a full package game, as you can tell from my hours i have seen and done almost everything in this game.  It is for sure not like the other elderscroll titles but that makes no difference in how good this game is.  I have been a long time mmo player and there seems to be one resounding problem with them all, elitism.  ESO has done something incredible to curb that, you cant look at anyone elses spec or gear, or see how much damage another person does even with addons (there is one that you can opt in for as long as your buddys have the same addon).  Who would have thought that would keep the toxic players from being toxic. (Though some people will always exist who clearly know what YOU'RE doing wrong lol) Most reviews im sure will speak about the graphics, sandbox style, quests, gameplay in general, but im most impressed by this one decision.  The way it is set up, there is no need to play a cookie cutter spec (though it can be more enjoyable in some ways if you CHOOSE that) As a result there has never been a time ive had a single bad experience being singled out in a group for ""playing the wrong way"".  You seriously can play exactly how ever you want.  Want to be a hybrid tank/healer? Or tank/range dps? Or a Magic dps/support? Bam, all can be viable, (though you wont really get the full bang of single specialization)  And the community is absolutely the nicest and most helpful ive ever been a part of.  The second thing that stands out is the multiple guild system.  You can join up to 5 guilds at one time.  WAIT!! Thats too many to keep track of!!!  Then join and stay with one, or none if you choose  =D  The major boon of this system is the ability to join a specific guild with specific goals in mind, as of now im part of a major PVP raid guild, a Traders guild, an illegal thiefs RP guild, and a social guild with wacky and crazy people just enjoying the game and each others company.  That is just a few to name.This game is liberating with the complete freedom of choice to play your way.  Heres a tip if you dont want to play the +Plus membership way, check out a youtube video on how to manage your bank and bags for your crafting materials.  Because if there is one downside its that you need +Plus to stand a chance of keeping all your thousands of mats you can acquire over the course of playing.I love this game, and there is nothing like it out, this game is stand alone in my opinion!So ill leave you with the normal polite way of exiting a pug dungeon, THANKS! GLHF!"
Positive,i think i went afk on dis game cuz i do not member gettin this many hours
Positive,hehe flame lasso goes tss tss
Positive,got like 4 version of skyrim now
Positive,its like skyrim... but theres more
Positive,me like alot
Positive,"My mom bought this for me at the start of quarantine and I honestly thought I'd hate it.Now its tied for my favourite game. Last i checked I had leveled up past my mom who has been playing for about a year.I largely play for quests as I love a good story line, but sometimes its also theraputic to just kill some bad guys. If you think you wont like it just give it a try.Note: Can be slightly frustrating as almost all of the good things are only really obtainable if you spend money. But I've been doing good so far and I've only really spent money on a different steed, Which is just cool rather than faster or stronger.Also you are playing with other instead of against them, so you can help each other--even complete strangers-- out on most things."
Positive,"Originally picked this up on PS4 a few months after launch. It was clunky and nearly impossible to get anything done on a solo run, so I abandoned it after a while. Got in PC again when it was on sale and it's a completely different experience. Combat is fun and challenging, multiple skill lines and abilities to pick from and you can get seriously good loot by just running a few dungeons, without spending a single piece of gold. Would highly recommend this if you're a fan of the previous Elder Scroll games. As any MMO, it is always better playing with friends, but the guild system makes it super easy to find other players to gear up with if you don't have someone to play with. Heck, sometimes you can even get free gear and items jut by being present in the chat. Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun adventure."
Positive,Got lost in Vvardenfell at some point. Somehow I ended up becoming the Scarlet Judge. Nice.
Positive,Great game. Very fun. Very addictive. Massive amount of content.
Positive,"If you are into grinding, this is the game you need!"
Positive,ver good lik
Positive,"Good game, crown purchases are a bit expensive"
Positive,"Its not Skyrim, but there is a lot of content to explore and its fun."
Positive,"What the came lacks in combat it makes up for in atmosphere, storytelling, and size. I would recommend subbing if you like the game so that you have infinite material space, and all the expansions (minus the most current expansion).  The loot boxes tarnish the game a little, but if you never touch them you won't miss it. Also, if you're looking to start wait for the base game to go on sale. It goes on sale often and this game may be divisive to some so maybe even check out some gameplay vids before you buy."
Positive,"While certainly not what I expected, ESO has proven my caution unnecessary. I wish I'd gotten in on this sooner. The stories and quest lines are thrilling, and the world is gorgeous and glorious. I've lost hours exploring the landscape and mindlessly grinding away on mobs and harvesting materials, and it's been a blast. There is definitely a gap between premium and standard players, however, but it seems to be mostly cosmetic. Crafting is a bit of a pain as well, but mostly due to highly limited bag and bank space, but upgrades can be purchased with in game currency, so it's a resolveable problem over time."
Positive,"This is in my opinion, one of the GREATEST MMO's out there. The story is immersive, the classes and abilities are fun and different. you can literally be whatever you want. magic user with a 2 handed weapon? why not? big heavy tank that uses a bow or magic, who cares. you can play it your way, at your pace. and the combat is super fluid and well made. would recommend to anyone, casuals, hard core gamers, whoever. something in this will be for you!"
Positive,"This game is a great edition to The Elder Scrolls franchise, I have been in love with it since release and I implore anyone who loves fantasy worlds to come try this game and its whole universe. ^_^"
Positive,good gameplay and mechanic sadly no server on asia pacific so umm please make one ?
Positive,I have so many hours this game buy it because i said so
Positive,- Fun combat and gameplay- Big and open world- Huge playerbase  - 100s of hours of content + new updates all the time
Positive,i have played eso since it came out on playstation and it has been one of my favorite mmo rpgs since
Positive,fun to vibe
Positive,Great stories fun game play
Positive,"Large World with lots to Explore, Massive-Scale of quests, Great Customization, Easy-to-understand Skill Systems, and Flawless Combat. The graphics are decent, the atmosphere in different regions adds up really well to it's environment but most of all I love the ability to switch from first-person to third in different scenarios. (Especially during combat, using ranged weapons like bow's etc.)Haven't came across an MMO as good as this s*** in my opinion, already immersed and def recommend!"
Positive,You get a big stick and then you poke em' and then you laugh and run away
Positive,Pretty good if you've got friends to play with
Positive,"I come back to this game every chapter. I enjoy it. Game can get repetitive but i just take a break and come back to it next month with the new DLC. I had 500 hours on console, too."
Positive,awesome game great quests
Positive,I love this game! There is so many different things you can do and it always keeps you busy!
Positive,"Considering it's a MMO, and you have to pay to play it and then pay again if you want to have more content, I must say, the base game is really good, nice quests, nice skill trees and cool history and alot to do in base game, the only con till now is the inventory space and bank space, very limited in my opinion but alright.I would recommend it if you have free time and like MMO's ."
Positive,"Starting to enjoy the game quite alot now, haven't played much of the other Elder Scrolls games so don't know alot about the lore etc, however i wanted to find a good fantasy based MMO to play and ESO seems to fit the bill nicely, the combat is ok although i found it frustating at first, i'm not interested in doing PVP, but that won't stop me from enjoying the rest of the content.Loving the quests and the stories involved in them and i'm still only in Vvardenfell the starting area, so cannot wait to see what the rest of the world offers.Starting to get the hang of the crafting and I just now went ESO Plus so i can get a crafting bag to have more inventory space, still need to get Summerset though so i can start using the jewellery crafting station.So far i can recommend ESO to anyone wanting a good fantasy based MMO."
Positive,"Def my favorite MMORPG. I can't rush through these types of games without getting bored, but this one, if you slow down and gather some good details, it's actually pretty good. Still very enjoyable to play alone. It's nice not having to race people to finish a quest. That lame. A lot of the guilds I've run into have been pretty nice and helpful. A lot of guild members (depending how edgy the guild is) are more likely to help you and gear you up for whatever you're trying to do. But I do tend ot turn zone chat off cuz I want to play it alone.If you're a fan of Elder Scrolls and see this boi on sale, get it boiiii. But do keep in mind, this isn't Skyrim Online. But def a lot of lore to pick up on if you're into that."
Positive,"Where do I even start? Again, a huge thank you to STEAM for bringing an amazing game to this platform and allowing us to dive back into the ever expansive world that is the Elder Scrolls. The controls and imagery is just as good as on console. The mechanics while less glitchy than console sometimes still erk me but perfection is unattainable but progressive content totally is. Bravo. I look forward to more."
Positive,The game is good. Get it now !!
Positive,A game like many games but well executed.
Positive,"Best MMO of the Time !Its a little like Skyrim, it remember me of the best open world game.Much Fun, Big World and much options (Y)"
Positive,amazing open world
Positive,it is kind of like skyrim but online
Positive,"With so many beautifully executed graphics, scenarios and gameplay options, it's a shame that ESO has ruined this game with scaling. Your character is constantly reset to decrease abilities as you increase in level and experience. this is the only game I have ever played where your characters actually be come weaker over time and with experience (by quite a lot actually)! Yes ESO I understand that much later characters can again get more powerful  and while I understand that there are other ""perks"" to gaining experience, there will never be a justification for characters of substantially higher level and experience actually being weaker than characters of a much lower level, in multiple categories, and for a pronounced period of time! Making the game more ""fair"" for everyone could have involved many other positive options that didn't punish gamers and their characters for leveling up! Shame on ESO for choosing A lazy decision to fix a problem when there are much better alternatives! This has singularly kept me from buying a membership, very disappointed!"
Positive,It's a really beautiful game that i have much fun playing but can be limting from the painfully short storage to the pay walls that block most of the content. It is understandable to charge people for these expansions and services like ESO Plus but pricing is extremely rough. Things like a seprate bag to hold all your crafting materials in and the abilty to change the color of unique outfits are functions locked behind a montly paywall that cost more then anyone ever pays for a online services on there Systeam. It's taxing on the wallet and even if you don't buy it you will still have handicaps that make the game unnecessarily harder. After all you want to craft things but Gathering crafting materials can take up your inventory quite quickly and you can't complete a quest if your inventory is full. The game is playable by all means and is a wonderful world you don't need to spend money on. But not spending money also means the game will pressure you into buying Eso Plus so you don't have unnecessary bothers.
Positive,"Hello everyone. I've been playing this game since the beta. It's been a long road and the game has changed completely, in a good way. I decided that I should update this review because I've hit 704 hours of gameplay already. I can say that I maintain my position that ESO is one of the best MMOs in the market, definitely (I've played wow since 2007 and some others mmos along the way as Guild Wars, FFXIV and some others JRPG). And I can add that it's the best when it comes to quest writing and development. It can be played as any other The Elder Scroll game, not necessarily as an MMO game. There are those who think this is bad, but I'm the opposite of that.Enough talk, let's make this simple:PROS: - Excellent story and great leveling experience. The only leveling that got me just involved as ESO was WoW Classic leveling (You must be willing to read the quests and pay attention to them, of course);- Nice crafting/professions and housing. They are, probably, the mechanics I most admire in this game;- Exploration is the focus, just take a walk, explore the vast world of Tamriel, as you wish;- The class system is the best for sure in the MMO market so far. Build your character the way you want, play the way you want, there are of course better combinations, but they don't dictate your gameplay. And also, you can have a forniture in your house as an armory to save your presets builds. - Good price. ESO is not expensive compared to other AAA MMOs. Lots of sales in steam aswell; ESO plus is much more valuable than they make it seem to be. The true MMO experience comes with ESO plus, I don't think it's bad cause the other great MMO on the marked (WoW and FFXIV) do the same. If you are looking for a more solo, old TES feeling, you don't need ESO plys, for sure.- It's totally fine if you want to experience the game by yourself. Lots of solo content (Arenas, dgs, quests and stories).- Nice group content. I've been doing Trials (12 man raid) now for the first time ever since I started playing, they are EPIC! It's way easier than WoW`s raid, but it's much more fun! The whole atmosphere is great and the players help and teach each other the mechs, I've never been recused in a group because I hadn't done the content before. DLCs dungeons, as they are called, are way harder than normal dungeons and they feel very unique having their own story and theme. For more hardcore players, they also have Veteran difficulty dgs and optional hardmode and easter eggs that must be triggered inside the dg. I find it's so great that it's not only a button on a menu to trigger hardmode and easter eggs.- It's a beautiful game, nice graphics, landscapes, cities, etc...- It's a good balance between the solo TES experience with a mix MMO feeling. (Some people may find this one a CON).- Sneak, theft, and roleplay systems are excellent.- Great max scale PVP. I've had fun in the past, but not really into it right now.- Fantastic character customization, dyes, and outfits.CONS:- Combat mechanics need improvement (they have been worse).- PVP arenas 3vs3vs3 are boring. WoW 2v2 / 3v3 arenas are much better. They should add this in the game asap.- Too much dlcs scattered around. They should bring up more dlc packs, like the guilds one (really worth it).- Don't really like the bag system. I prefer WoW's one.- Crowns are too expensive.- Lack of mount drop and cosmetics stuff by playing the game, too many things locked up in the store and crates.That is what I can think of... but if you are into MMO's or into The Elder Scrolls you should give it a try. If you are a TES fan and also a MMO fan, this game is FOR YOU!Thanks for reading, see you in Tamriel."
Positive,It's pretty okay I guess.
Positive,Great game. Doesnt force you to do quests if u dont want to. Character Freedom too. Can be a flipping Sorcerer with Heavy armor and a flipping bow doesnt matter. Love this game.
Positive,"i love this game, although i take breaks to play other games i always find myself coming back and enjoying it even more every time i do."
Positive,I killed a chicken right as i loaded into the game. man was that a mistake.
Positive,its a fun game to play with friends  but i don't have friends so I play alone
Positive,I would recommend this game to people who like the grind and are friendly
Positive,"The time I've spent in this game doesn't feel completely wasted, and by current MMO standards that means I find it pretty decent."
Positive,i played this game long time ago but i still like it it was fun to play it anyway
Positive,"Playing this game for over a month now, and just loving it!!!! Probably one of the most engaging MMORPG game out there <3"
Positive,"After playing more than 1000 hours!This is my opinion about The Elder Scrolls OnlineThis is the best MMORPG game for me. Maybe this is the best game I've ever played!I played great games in MMORPG style. Including WOW, BDO, FFXIV, GW2, Tera and ....All of these games were great and very beautiful, but ESO is the only game in this genre that is so interesting and fun for me.ESO doesn't have the best graphics and gameplay among MMORPG games, but the game's beautiful storytelling surprised me at all times, especially when it gave me the power to decide what to do.- Positive points of the game:-- Great storytelling:In the world of MMORPG games, very beautiful stories are told, but without a doubt, the line of beautiful ESO stories is at the top of the comparison table!-- Very beautiful graphics: ESO doesn't have the best graphics among games of this genre, but the game's beautiful graphics, along with near-realistic lighting (especially in new locations), will no doubt surprise you. Beautiful places designed in the game, the feeling conveys a certain glory and greatness to the player.-- Fantastic music: Music? It may be hard to believe, but I became interested in it because of the game's music, and the only reason it drew me to ESO was its beautiful music! Many times it is ready for me to stop playing to listen to a short piece of music being played in the playgrounds!-- Acceptable gameplay: ESO doesn't have the best gameplay in this genre, however it can be a lot of fun and engaging. But if you consider it different, it may make you more attractive! The fact that you do not have a specific attachment to any weapon alone makes a difference! And this difference is very interesting to me!-- Different game modes: In addition to all the PVE modes available in the game, the game also includes 7 PVP modes-- Very varied ARMORs and acceptable character customization-- Skill Lines are very diverse with the ability to customize- Negative points of the game:-- Slow Gameplay-- Bug when Looting-- Very easy dungeon (except DLC dungeons)-- FPS Drop in various game locations, especially older locations"
Positive,"From my point of view, the best MMO-RPG of the decade. Storyline is fantastic and a lot of options are provided to enhance your gaming experience. For the people who are into the Elder Scrolls Saga, I definately recommend this game."
Positive,"Lets start by saying the only Elder Scrolls game i have really gotten into has been ES3 Morrowwind and when i saw this for sale with the Morrowind expansion i thought i'd give it a go. I'm glad that i did because i have really been enjoying just playing along though the game following the story lines and completing the zone quest, there is actually so much content that i have yet to even do a dungeon or a pvp battle ground.I have found the quest items that you pick up just playing along the story lines are more than adequate to continue along it without having to stop and farm for gear or look for gear elsewhere.As a solo player that is not interested in end game content or PVP i have not seen the need to purchase anything other than the base game, though if you are interested i would recommend to get a subscription as you will want to level up your crafting skill and you will need the bag space.I definitely recommend this game for casual players like myself that are just looking to play through a good story line."
Positive,"One of my favorite games to date. I love to dive into the wonderful, fun stories that they have created, all while getting some awesome fighting with so many different skills and classes to choose from. The only thing that sucks is that, of course, they are a little money hungry. There are many awesome DLCs, but you cannot play them without coughing up a pretty penny, which is hard for younger audiences. However, in my opinion, even the base game is still super fun to pour hours into. I'd recommend a good computer to experience the great graphics, but I've played with everything on low and it still works fine. Great game!"
Positive,Loveing every moment of it
Positive,ESO was a tough game to enjoy at first. With friends and a love for elder scrolls style gaming though this game has really become enjoyable.
Positive,good game lol :)
Positive,it was really fun and doesn't require a thousand dollar computer to play it. haven't experienced any lag and overall it is a good game
Positive,I love this game.
Positive,Really gorgeous graphics. Really needs a better tutorial for newbies... but seems really fun so far once you get used to the werid camera angles. Really wish there was a way to lock the camera view behind your avatar so that you don't have to turn with the mouse before you change directions
Positive,BIT LAGGY BUT  WHEN IT DOES WORK IS BEST MMO
Positive,"Honestly, if you love elder scrolls and want an mmo with a fresh style, try this"
Positive,massive world.. a bit overwhelming but really cool
Positive,"Very good game, fun progression and grinding"
Positive,"I just needed to check how many hours I ""played"" waiting for launcher to install it (((:"
Positive,"It's like Skyrim, but not lonely, and you get to do a lot of cool stuff with extras like mounts, housing and costumes. Unlike every other MMO I've ever played, the quests are actually interesting enough to pay attention to and are generally not boring ""kill ten bandits"" and ""fetch ten daggers"" type quests.  Characters and play styles are super customizable, too.  Pretty much kicks the crap out of every other MMO."
Positive,"Great, fun mmorpg. Really enjoy the realism and customization."
Positive,"Easy to play, beautiful art, lots to explore and do.  Lots of people roleplayNot a hard game to play though, I PVP now in Cyrodil, they have made it way better/"
Positive,It's a good game but none of my friends will play with me
Positive,"Got it for a really thrifty price on a flash sale. Bought it just to check it out as I was bored during the quarantine. Now im 400+ hours in, bought 5 expansions and I'm still going strong. THIS GAME IS ADDICTIVE, BE WARY."
Positive,Amazing game. Had issues with frequent disconnects and there tech support just gives out an automated response in how to solve it. Found a post online to start using a VPN and the disconnects stopped.
Positive,beautiful story rich game.
Positive,"This game I recommend to everyone. Players who are expirenced in MMORPG's, and players who have never played one. It is very easy to get into and it is a lot of fun with friends I strongly recommend it to anyone."
Positive,"One of the best MMO I've played so far, yet it has some issue with balance, cap-level game, transactions, avaliability and battle system. If you have enough money to provide yourself a Subscribtion (makes th game A LOT more comfortable), then you have it, your good ol TES with lots of content. In case you forgot, buy Skyrim its a good game, heard they managed to port it to a toilet."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls Online is without a doubt part of the current elite class of MMORPGs, together with Word of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, Black Desert Online and Guild Wars 2.The graphics compartment, while unable to be defined next-gen, still does a pretty good job at portraying Tamriel. I have found myself, in more than one occasion, staring at the environment and immersing myself in the game world, helped by the majestic soundtrack which perfectly falls in line with the Elder Scrolls series.This sense of immersion is mostly driven by the top notch questing experience, the best I have ever seen in the genre. Each NPC is fully voiced, and even the smallest side quest feels like it has been written with the same care that was used for the main plot. Several quest lines are intertwined, and sometimes you will have to make a moral choice. The choices you make will reflect themselves in the world, with NPCs recognizing you depending on your actions. Although I am not usually attracted by lore, I could not skip any of the NPC dialogues, simply because of the way the story telling manages to involve you, the player, who in turns becomes genuinely interested in the background of the world.Another great aspect of TESO is the freedom you are given in creating and customizing your character. Although there are a few classes, which mostly act as a ""general guideline"" rather than being a restriction, anyone could use any kind of armor and any kind of weapon. Sort of like Skyrim used to, the more you use a certain ""skill line"", the more proficient you will become in it. You also have the possibility to become a vampire or a werewolf.Moreover, the game involves a soft-action combat: nothing like Black Desert Online, but simple enough to entertain you during gameplay, with the possibility to block attacks and skills mostly without cooldowns.My only dislike would be the armor and weapon models, which I find too simple and sometimes bland. This was probably the game in which I had the hardest time in making my character look the way I wanted it to be, although there is an extremely simple and efficient system which allows you to unlock skins by collecting gear and apply them on your gear on the fly, very similar to GW2's ""wardrobe"" system.It also must be said that the character creation, while being simplistic, includes full body sliders and a decent selection of skin/eye/hair colors and shapes, so that you will hardly find anyone looking exactly like you. You will also have a collection of cosmetic items, such as earrings, tattoos, piercings or circlets, and even hairstyles and beards, which you will unlock either by questing or purchasing through the in game store, and which you can apply on your character on the fly. Another unique feature of ESO is the possibility to change your character's ""personality"", by unlocking the respective collectible item and customizing your character's animations to match with a dignified noble's behavior, or rather an aggressive Orc warrior.All in all, I would most definitely recommend any MMORPG fan out there to give ESO a go, and take the time to explore the world and enjoy every second of the levelling experience."
Positive,it's alright. would recommend for a thousand hours of gameplay or so. :P
Positive,10/10 would play until the wee hours of the morning again.
Positive,Best Online RPG I've played. Hundreds of hours for a one time payment.Awesome storyline. Incredible music.
Positive,200 hours in a week.
Positive,gives me alot of gachigasm feelings ♥
Positive,"Having grown up playing Morrowind, Oblivion and later Skyrim this game offers a lot in terms of nostalgia. But more importantly this game offers an excellent MMO experience with amazing combat mechanics, and a likeable storyline! Its also a nice bonus that even years later, I can pick it up, and still see lots of traffic on the servers, which makes the game enjoyable. There is lots of content to explore, and I doubt I will ever get to the end of that!"
Positive,Pros: Very fun game. Great graphics and story lines. Very similar yet satisfyingly different compared to WoW. Crafting is more complex.Cons: Loading screen time is a bit much so have a snack ready. You will be very tempted to get the ESO Plus membership for better bag space and organization.
Positive,"great game, so much so that i'm willing to restart on pc after already having 10 characters on console lol lots of grinding. an excellent MMO in my opinion."
Positive,best game in the world
Positive,"bagus juga, tapi server meintenens mulu ajgtp ttp rekomen sih awkoakokwawkak"
Positive,its pretty good
Positive,ITS AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!
Positive,"Pretty fun, I pulled an all nighter to beat the base main mission."
Positive,I find ESO to be engaging with a great story line and nice progression.
Positive,"Arguably one of the best MMO RPG games to ever release and is still going strong. This game has been incredibly developed and seasoned over time and is full of polished content that never gets old. If you're considering buying but worried it's too late, don't be. It's never too late to join and enjoy one of the greatest games out there that you'll play for hours on end over time."
Positive,Pretty good game I like the magic and stuff
Positive,"I love playing with my friends, god they are so hot"
Positive,"not bad, I guess."
Positive,"great for solo, group, crafting, something for every mmo playstyle"
Positive,"Well at this point I got almost five hundred hours on PC alone not to mention PS4 and Xbox which would bring it to somewhere aroun 1,200 so I would definitley recommend getting this game"
Positive,"The early could become a bit boring if u dont find story quests interesting , later on tho the game opens up more and u have many options and u can decide to play the way you like especially when u reach lvl 50 and cp 160 ( which is not that hard if u learn the way to do it ) ... u can later join vet dungeons ( which some are very hard and fun ) , trials ( raids ) , or do some pvp ... also crafting and housing is very enjoyable and useful ... also the community is very alive and np friendly ... and the games gets new updates , patches and dlc's / chapters every now and then ... its not perfect but still one of the best MMO's nowdays"
Positive,"Quests are so fun, with full spoken NPC Dialog it makes the game very immersive.  Occasional humorous elements in the dialog are also very entertaining.  The graphics are great, lots of attention is paid to detail.  Game world, story and history is very well developed."
Positive,Better than WoW
Positive,i like it
Positive,"Sand Box style, do what you want, a lot of choices for character, play type, quests, etc."
Positive,Great Game Lots OF character building
Positive,"So goooooooooodEdited review: Still can't play from South East Asia. Was able to play for a few good hours but now it would keep on saying ""Lost connection to Lobby"". I can only go through character screen and that's it.Not recommended if you are from ASIA/South East AsiaUpdated Review 3 Nov 2023 7:01PM GMT+8: it's 2023 so we're hoping for better servers and optimization right? And yes I was right for trying the game again. Enjoying it so far, no disconnections compared to years ago where I have a potato ISP and PC; and megaservers were still meh. 9/10 - 10/10 if I got my money to get all the DLCs LOL"
Positive,"To give you a frame of reference regarding how much I have played, I bought this in November 2019. I heard it was trash when it first came out, but I always kept an eye on it because I loved the elder scrolls lore. ESO isn't on that level of storytelling as the old republic mmo, but its definitely in the same realm. The quests are well written, the characters are great, and it does a fantastic job of actually getting invested in the story. If you go in thinking that the new chapter is some sort of new skyrim remaster, you're gonna have a bad time, because at its core this is an mmo, and feels/plays like one. Granted, the combat system does a good job of trying to blend with what a TES single player game feels like, but it is still significantly different. There is plenty of solo content to do if you want to treat this as a singleplayer game (which is exactly what I do), but if you want your character to have great gear and be able to go through dungeons on your own as you would in an traditional TES game, you're gonna have to grind. A lot. It is an mmo, after all. My only complaint is that the tutorials do a very poor job of introducing you to all the storylines. when you start a new character, you spawn in elsewyr, morriwind, or summerset depending on what dlc you have. Each region has its own self contained (but loosely linked) storyline, and a lot of new people have trouble finding how to start the original main quest from the base game. It does a really bad job of introducing new players and getting them oriented, etc. I had to go to reddit for help...That being said, once you do get properly oriented and figure out what to do, there is a lot of fun exploring, the books and lore are great, and there is a buttload of free content. I strongly reccommend it if you like mmos in the slightest, or are just looking for a new lockdown activity. Also, here's a link I used to see where to go to start each chunk of contenthttps://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/413807/what-order-should-i-do-esos-story-arcs-a-guide"
Positive,"I played this on Xbox when it first came out and stopped playing cuz the game was graphically bad and didnt really remind me much about the elderscrolls games I've played, and I just recently purchased it on PC and let me tell ya, total upgrade the game looks beautiful and operates way better than I remmeber. Highly recommend for a MMO RPG :)"
Positive,nice one you can do whatever you want with every class
Positive,"The Secret to playing this game at a comfortable pace is to not be obsessed with mastering all the professions and taking on all the quests all at the same time, especially when you are at low level. Focus on your primary goal, be it leveling up, stealing items to make money, becoming an artisan or even roleplaying as a cat. In this game, it is similar to real life. The skills and inventory are limited just like your real life skills and house space. Things would be different if you purchase PLUS but we have already paid enough, haven't we?"
Positive,"i haven't stopped playing this game since i got it there is so much content the go through, i would recommend this game the everyone"
Positive,Its F awesome
Positive,its a pretty good mmo but the crafting system is kinda hard and takes really long time and makes you spend a lot of time in crafting atleast one month for 3 traits to come to max.
Positive,"I played the beta for this game way back when it first came out and was really disappointed with the game at the time. However, now that I gave it another shot this late into the release, I've got to say I was really impressed with how it turned out. The combat is fun, and the narrative, even in sides quests is decent enough and at the very least feels very Elder Scrolls-y. I've only played on a sorcerer but the game play has a nice flow to it and although I wish I could have more skills hotbarred, it still feels pretty fast. The menu system and ui aren't great and the store seems pricey, albeit cosmetic. But mods can make up for the former, and I'm really just nitpicking. The market system is pretty god awful, but I might just be spoiled from FFXIV. Overall solid game, but not gonna pull me all the way from my main MMO."
Positive,I have 333 hours in this game and I haven't even reached end game once. 10/10 would create many characters again
Positive,"Haven't gotten too far into the content, but its pretty good so far, look forward to everything else it has to offer."
Positive,Addicted game. Really funny while playing with friends. Just have a server problems sometimes
Positive,"I'm seriously impressed with this game. I've played MMOs since pre-Kunark Everquest. This game is easily in the top 5 games I've ever played. It's learning curve is just about right. It's easy to get going but deep enough that you're always learning something new. As you progress, new skills open new opportunities. I've played a lot of MMOs and even beta tested ESO (it was not good). This game, right now, is amazing. The graphics are stunning and the gameplay is as good or better than any game I've ever played. If you enjoy fantasy MMOs, this is definitely one worth trying out."
Positive,"NOTE: After playing the game for six months I wanted to revise my review.PLUS POINTS1. Overall, this is a fantastic game & is great valueI've been playing the game regularly for six months and have been enjoying it immensely.If you like WoW or SWTOR, you'll like this (ESO very much reminds me of SWTOR).After buying the current base game, you have literally hundreds of hours of content that you can enjoy without spending any more (real) money on a subscription or any other content. That's a pretty good deal.Some more plus points:2. GraphicsGreat character models (for an MMO) and some fantastic world models too, especially in the areas in the major expansions: Morrowind, Elsweye, Western Skyrim, all of which are really impressive for an MMO.3. Lore & StoryESO inherits decades of TES lore & it uses it very well.The main storylines in the games are great and as they unfold, you really get the sense of inhabiting a world that has thousands of years of history behind it.The vast majority of the writing and voice acting is great too with some very well known actors popping up (from film and from gaming).4. FreedomESO allows you to jump into any of the game's content whenever you like.If you want to create several new characters and jump into the latest expansion, you can. No levelling up for hours and hours of ageing content to experience the latest and best content in ESO.However: there are some flaws with this approach (see below).5. It's on the MacKudos to Zenimax for supporting the Mac!*** MINUS POINTSThere are some REALLY significant flaws with the game. These are made even more frustrating as they're all fixable.1. Poor discoverability for the various games systemsESO is a pretty complex game.I don't mind the complexity as such - this is more a gripe about how HARD  it is to discover these systems i.e. it's a user experience issue.Maybe it's me, but here's some of the systems that I have had trouble discovering:Enchanting, Horse training, Quick keys (i.e. so you can drink potions in-combat) and finally, knowing to access the various storylines that form the game.I won't go into detail and could go on, but the general point here is that:There's so many systems, all presented on information dense screens, that it can be confusing (for a new player) to get to grips with it all.This feels a big problem to me - you don't want a game to feel like it has the steep learning curve of say,  Photoshop.2. Disjointed Stories/NarrativeESO is set up so that new players are flung right into the latest expansion of the version of the game that they've bought.In many ways, this is a good thing - Zenimax of course want people to experience the 'state of the art'  that the game has to offer.However, ESO has a huge epic story (as part of the original game) which explains what's happening and then continues the story with various DLC chapters after this that expand on the narrative of the game.These are nearly all fantastic (I haven't played them all) and Zenimax deserves a huge amount of praise here.However, if you're a new player, good luck with:a) Knowing that this epic original story even existsb) Then managing to find it, in-game.c) With knowing which part of the story chapter DLCS to do in what order (so the narrative makes sense).d) This means that it's very easy to jump off into a story that happens AFTER the story that you're currently playing through.This is all a great shame and it feels that this could easily be solved i.e. in a similar way that WoW is does (i.e. asking if you want a new character to play the latest expansion or start off at the original story).3. Minor quibbles:- Each of the zones are instances (on big super-servers) which is a shame as you get quite a few loading screens i.e. unlike WoW it's not possible to seamlessly run from one zone to another without experiencing a 10-20 load screen. Talking of which:- The load times are long.- And yes, lots of the quality of life things in the game and extra content you have to subscribe or pay with in-game currency to get - but, it's a (largely) FTP MMO - what did you expect?FINALLY...This is a fantastic game. Play it. However you've got to be prepared to spent quite a bit of time researching how to play it on the web."
Positive,"Warning: Do not bother with this game if you have any kind of photo-sensitivity. The older release had some bad but predictable flashes to white. The update has added a ton of very bright flashy yellow visuals you cannot predict or turn off/down.Elder Scrolls Online has had its ups and downs. The server upgrades have finally happened and improved latency a lot. The base game package is incredible value for the amount of content, and if you like it then most of the rest of the game (all but the latest bits) are available on the monthly subscription so you don't actually need to buy the bigger package if you go that way or you can if you want. Be warned the ""full"" packages are not as full as you might expect and most of the DLC end game content is extra in game purchases as are some of the stories even if you get the bigger package.It is possible with the base game alone (which now includes Morrowind and Imperial City) to play through all the content it offers without having to buy anything from the cash shop. There is no level cap and you have access to everything needed to complete all the included content including the 12 man trials and all the base game dungeons it includes as well as the story lines. If you get into group end game play then you'll end up wanting ESO+, but for anything else it's just a nice to have.ESO is not Skyrim, the story style is very similar but elements of the game play are somewhat different. In particular the classic Skyrim sneaking around with a bow play style doesn't work in ESO. It's a lot of good game content and almost all of it can be played without interacting with other people if that is your preference."
Positive,"Love this game, it just gets better and better!"
Positive,ta bueno el elder ta bueno
Positive,"Played back on Xbox One launch, but stopped because base game back at launch got boring quick. After building my PC I marked it as an MMO I wanted to get and play.  Overall experience for me was an 9/10. Love the world and it's lore, but I had a rough time in Cyrodil with the forced PvPvE."
Positive,"Coming into the game with so much content, and so little relevant guides. Most of the guides you come across for this game only tells you to ""JUST PLAY THE GAME"" which is guide to not be guided at all because of this it would be hard to recommend this game to just anyone. But besides on having a hard time with guides the game is great which you can play however you want."
Positive,"The best mmo I have ever played, The combat isnt like any other Elder Scrolls, and if your looking for a great Elder scroll adventure then this game here isnt much of what your looking for, but if you need an amazing mmo to sink your teeth into, then this game is here for you. Unlike other MMOs there is no monthly fees, so once you buy the game you will get the entire base game."
Positive,The combat is probably the best in the Elder Scroll series. although the base game has little connections to the elder scrolls
Positive,"Very good game, despite the bugs."
Positive,"ESO is a very good choice if you love MMORPG. If you are looking for challenged PvE contents, ESO has dungeons and trials with interesting mechanics that you have to learn; if you are looking some fascinating stories, ESO has tons of quests; if you love heists and robbing, thieves and assassinate guilds are waiting for you. ESO also has a great PVP mode in the city of Cyrodiil where you can use siege weapons. Of course you can be a 'bomb' in Cyrodiil to kill 10+ or even more enemy players if you are skillful.The player community is very friendly. The majority of experienced players are willing to help newcomers. Though in Cyrodill you can always find toxic chat (especially if you join AD xD), personally consider it as another kind of fun. However, because of ESO using mega-server, there might be a lot of lags (especially after maintenance)."
Positive,"The Elder Scrolls franchise has a special place in my heart, Since I was a kid, I was immersed in the world and the rich lore of Tamriel. There was nothing quite like it. I have so many great memories from playing especially Skyrim and ESO. I would never give these memories for nothing in return, so many laughters, so many tears of joy and anger, so many memorable quests, glitches and stories with my friends and foes... Also, the soundtrack is one of the most beautiful pieces of audio my ears and senses  had ever came across - it is simply perfect and so emotional in so many ways. Do I recommend Elder Scrolls Online ? The answer is an obvious yes. Even if it's something completely diffrent  from the standard Elder Scrolls formula that we were used to in the past, it's still one of the best MMO-s and games out there. Long live all my friends across the Tamriel !"
Positive,"If they can fix the skill lag and the lag in large scale pvp it would be better then making graymorlag for everyone to go to at the same time and make the lag even worse. But they dont know how to take care of their own game. Example they rely on over 0ne thousand diffrant non paid coders that add the addons that  game needs to be playable,  that break every update for weeks to make the game semi playable.  If u want delayed skill use, setting in ques for tank healer dps dps or want to spend over a year and thousands of rl dollers to be a crafter This game is for you !The best way to make  in game money is daily writs and u need 18 charcters several addons updated and working.However the game offers you the most freedom of any mmo U can solo play any way u like quest all day run delves fish gather-harsest etc and play a bow mage a sword sorcer etc."
Positive,"literally lets me ""Shock The Monkey"" in Elsweyr 10/10"
Positive,"open world cant get any better then that love this game,   ESO is just what  makes covid 19  be on the back burner"
Positive,Solid game for a group of friends to play!
Positive,"I love how the dlc doesn't just add new places, but also enriches the places already there. The people can be a little troll-y, but otherwise this is a really fun game. WAAAAAAY better than fallout 76. You won't regret actually playing this one."
Positive,Absolutely LOVE the whole Skyrim series. Elder scrolls online is really badass!! The effort with skills etc is OP!!
Positive,Superb for farming and grinding. Recommended!
Positive,"The game is fun to play regularly with a friend. An overall observation is that immersion has been largely sacrificed for gameplay, though small steps to add immersion are prevalent where gameplay is not affected. I am currently only level 21 for which I have played about 100 hours.Thematically, it appears consistent with recent single player Elder Scrolls games (Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim) and is the only way, to my knowledge, one can experience Tamriel in one game. Some lore is present in quests you pick up, whether main quests or side-quests. Scrolls and books you pick up scattered around (bookcases are effectively 1 book) will contain 1 to 4 pages of some description, story or song. These provide some of the immersion that is lost from the typical MMORPG functionality, especially the crafting system.Talking about the crafting system, it is relatively detailed and I would say interesting. The restrictions related to levelling are not obvious at first as you will likely feel a bit lost by how much there is to do. The initiation quests help establish the basics, and a daily quest system for crafting using billboards keeps you going on. Despite my gripe with things like diamonds costing 0 gold pieces, I have to admit that the crafting system works and is quite enjoyable. One just has to not ""think too hard about it"".Supporting the crafting system is a variety of resources scattered across the various maps or hidden in barrels and crates across Tamriel, or drops from kills. Lumps of ore, and tiny fallen tree logs are probably on the low end of immersion. Plants and spoiled food (not a resource, but it will make you puke) along with ""baskets of apples"" actually only containing apples on the high end. Fishing is ok.The main quests are relatively well written, though they feel inconsequential, even when you are apparently saving a god from death. Side quests feel often shoe-horned in, but they can be as detailed and expansive as the main quests. Compared to past MMORPGs I have played, the quests are a large step up, but they are lacking compared to most single-player RPGs.Voice acting is prevalent and generally of good quality. A lot of the NPCs have been well crafted with the game's engine and look distinct and interesting. Occasionally you have some emoticon that does not match the body type of the NPC properly (someone rubbing his invisible belly) but generally that works well.The game has micro-transactions through its subscription system, but one can mostly ignore it, as long as you are happy doing - a lot- of inventory management. In fact, the latter is a large part of the gameplay, and, at least in the early stages, you will end up spending most of your gold pieces to buy additional inventory slots (1 per day at the stables... it makes sense, I promise) or bank slots (bought 10 at a time for increasing cost). After a few level ups you also get a coffer with 30 slots for your apartment/house (you can buy and decorate houses; first apartment is free; eventually you can select a bed as a level reward).The skill system is interesting, though it takes a while for your choices to feel important. The magic staff weapons were a bit too prevalent, though that also highlights the flexibility in character creation, as your assassin might just happen to be an expert inferno staff user. Combat can be clunky but you get used to it, and the area attacks used frequently by enemies add some needed interactivity beyond spamming skills.All in all I am happy to spend time on this game, as long as there is a good friend to play with :)"
Positive,Takes a lot of patience and time to learn but pretty fun
Positive,"The contents for PVE is great and flawless. Somehow, PVP is getting worse. It is extremely lag during the prime time and the game crashed occasionally. Fix it, please."
Positive,ALOT to explore and solo as well as plenty of group content
Positive,Darien Gautier literally kills an oblivion portal with a sword. 10/10
Positive,From playing skyrim to playing the elder scrolls online I honestly had high expectations. But when I played the first hours of it I was actually pleasantly surprised. It doesn't seem to graphically intensive and the fact that each character you can interact with is voice acted is very impressive to say the least. Based of of my first impressions I can definitely recommend this game!
Positive,"N'wah 2020. Very good game, very big world, Vivec City. Some activities require teams but story can be completed individual and stories are pretty canny, not completed all yet. Game is getting even bigger!"
Positive,better than fallout 76.
Positive,still a solid MMO. Arguably the best out there for the past few years.
Positive,Only getting better with age. Buy it when its on sale.
Positive,it is epic
Positive,So far i am really enjoying Elder scrolls. I decided to splurge for myself and by a new computer with a brand new monitor. So the picture quality is just amazing. I gotta say this is my favorite games as of right now.
Positive,"I recommend this game as i really like the Elder Scrolls Series of games in general, This game has a great story to it along with a good amount of Dlc content and lots of choices from Race and Class combinations to a ton of items, armour and weapons to find and choose from to use, The Eso Plus membership (Subscription) for me is a must have and is Fairly priced to match other MMO's,  I have found the community to be pretty decent Very helpful and Knowledgeable, And as for PvP side of things, whilst i'm not a big fan of PvP i have had a lot of fun so far with it, A good game to play especially with friends 9/10"
Positive,"I can't really come up with anything I don't like about this game. the graphics are spectacular, the artistry is breathtaking and there are so many facets to the game itself that one could play this game for years without it becoming boring. I highly recommend getting the ESO plus as well. the infinite crafting bag alone is worth the monthly membership fee."
Positive,This is a big game and so many different things to do. I like that the community is not really toxic and that are hundreds of guilds that you can join depending on your interests. I started playing for the pve and now I'm primarily a pvp player and gear designer. The gearing system keeps me intrigued since you have so much freedom to make your own metabuild. If you just want a relaxing get away then you can just quest and enjoy all the incredible lands and scenery or join a housing guild and decorate your residence.
Positive,"I really enjoyed the flexibility of the characters and the fact that most of the quest, even in low level, feel epic and satisfying."
Positive,i like this game...
Positive,"It is fun and engaging.  While it differs from the known lore of the Elder Scrolls Universe, it is engaging in the lore it creates within its self."
Positive,Khajiit has time if you have the content.
Positive,idk i played on xbox or something
Positive,"Yay and Nay! This game is a reliable game to keep in the librabry for when you are bored with the newest stuff that you've played through. This game delivers a polished version of WoW. Ofc, quests are killing and fetching like any MMORPG but there are many game mechanics that keep the game fresh. I routinely return to this game. But it ain't gonna blow your mind."
Positive,"I liked this game already at its launch, when most of the community didn't appreciate it much. I hit max level and then quit for couple years. Now I'm back and it got even better. It's story-driven RPG with plenty of group activities, fun PVP and very interesting and open character development system. If you enjoy games like WOW or the The Elder Scrolls series you should definetly check it out, it's a nice mix of those."
Positive,"While it does water down some aspects of Elder Scrolls in order to be a functioning MMO, like killing NPCs, and it does contain an absurd amount of DLC, it still captures the exploration and roleplaying that makes Elder Scrolls fun, while also being a good MMO, with plenty of content to grind through."
Positive,I'm still waiting to see old people try and use the internet 10/10
Positive,elder scrolls is elder scrolls ♥
Positive,"Great game, you can either play it as a straight foward MMO and blaze though it or try it like a true Scrolls game and read lore and listen to every quest."
Positive,"I'm always a fan of voiced MMOs, and while the game takes liberties with some lore -- elder scrolls is good for that.  My only complaint is that I wish the character had a voice, too."
Positive,Sweaty hotdog eating salt factory. 10/10 will continue QQ4.4k hours later. I want to do that again.5.3k hours. Good as gold.6.6k hours. Eso go brrrrrrrr.
Positive,Good MMO With Great Story Line.
Positive,one of the best mmos on the market
Positive,"Have been a WoW fan for a long time and was overwhelmed with WoW classic at launch, but servers became unbalanced between factions and the game started sucking with just no point in playing so I went looking for another MMORPG. Having played and enjoyed Oblivion and Skyrim at release I was tempted to try this when it went on sale not too long ago and all I can say is WHY HAVEN'T I PLAYED THIS EARLIER?!?!Love the game so far and I'm hooked! Tldr; Amazing! Just buy it, it's worth it and you have no idea how many hours of content this game contains"
Positive,"First MMO I've played. Another great addition to the Elder Scrolls franchise. Art and graphics are great, questlines could be a little more engaging. I wish you could switch alliances midway so you could play Imperial City with friends of other races."
Positive,"I usually much prefer the single player experience over MMOs. Areas that never really change because each player is at a different stage of progression ends up making the game feel like you are just moving between mini games all the time. I didn't feel this from ESO, I never felt there were areas I couldn't go because I wasn't high enough level and playing with friends worked pretty well too. it is still an MMO and there are some features of that you can't get away from, such as clearing out a particular area just to have enemies respawn a short while later. Aside from that I always felt there was good quality story telling with a good pace and flow that worked well as a single or multiplayer campaign. The leveling is something that works really well and the variation in skills is among one of the most enjoyable to use that I have come across. There are so many strong ways to play that feel totally different which allows for a totally new experience on replay. This is all really PVE related as I didn't really get involved with PVP apart from occasional duels in which again I felt the level system allowed for interesting combat strategies to be enough to give an edge. Overall, really impressed with the game. I did find some store options a little exorbitant but the game plays really well without subscription if you can ignore the store items."
Positive,Definitely my favorite mmo. You have plenty of things to do. And there's many classes and races and different play styles. Highly recommend.
Positive,i love this game :D
Positive,Definitely recommend this game. It's as close to perfect as an MMORPG can get.
Positive,love the game have played it on the ps4 before.
Positive,"Eh, i enjoy it."
Positive,say addicted after everything i say.what went in your mouth last night ?
Positive,"Nice easy mmo to play, getting constant updates and dlc."
Positive,fun game tons of things to do to keep you busy highly recommended
Positive,Game that keeps you enjoying for hours without realizing
Positive,"I like MMORPG games but after some time of playing them i get bored, yet to this day i still have no idea to how i got 50 hours on this."
Positive,Love this game. No monthly subscription required. Base game has ton of things to do. It is a nice change of pace from WOW.
Positive,"I have always liked playing the Elder Scrolls.  I also like MMORPGs.  This has a different feel then a normal elder scrolls single player title, but I really like it.  There are a lot of options that you can do in this game that make the gameplay varied and fun"
Positive,"Great story telling. It's just the new Skyrim. I havent done much of the MMO stuff in the game. Most of the story content you can do solo, and thats what I did and loved. To bad I they forced me to rebuy the game in Steam, even though I owned the retail version. You can link your retail account to the steam account. So technically this was not needed. It's just a greedy way to get more money out of you."
Positive,In depth and immersive storyline and quests. Solo playing is viable to get the feels of an sol ES game. A bit confusing at the start if you are a newbie hence the need to join a guild.
Positive,Would play for another 550 hours.Edit: I did.
Positive,"Great game, lots of fun with my friends! Huge and immersive lore! That been said, it could be better refined because it presents some errors of continuity between the stories."
Positive,"NOTE: That I have played this game for far longer than my play time on Steam. That being said this review is being written by a casual/semi casual player so I won't be going into any 1% pros/cons.This is a very good game at it's core that is bogged down by server issues, a fair few bugs, and story inconsistencies.The class system can be hit or miss for a lot of people, as the idea of creating a character that you want to play and completing quests with said character can be very enticing, but know if you want to do any kind of meaningful endgame you will be stuck with meta builds for every class. I know I said that I wouldn't be covering 1% things but for simple endeavours like normal end game trials (raids), this will affect you if you're not following a certain meta in a surprising amount of guilds. They're doable without conforming to the meta with the right group that's willing to let you join, but it's far more inefficient and pain inducing sometimes.The servers can be absolute piles of shit sometimes. Especially in PVP. Noticeable combat delay or skills not registering. It feels worse to begin with and gets a little better once you understand it but I'd be lying if I called it good. When it's not lagging its a mixed bag of good and bad. People seem to generally hate attack weaving but I don't mind it. The animations are horrid for how good the rest of the game looks.Levelling can be an absolute treat if you're into story driven questing or just exploring a vast world that you can do whatever you want it. This is the part that for the most part has stayed true to the Elder Scrolls series. You can level up essentially doing whatever the hell you want and although it'll have varying degrees of efficiency, it's quite enjoyable to do anything you want to do and be rewarded for it. That being said, don't expect the story to be coherent if you don't follow a set piece of your starting zones. Stuff like killing your own factions members because you're off in one of another factions' zones or starting DLC questlines involving certain NPCs before finishing the main story and having them be two places at once talking to you completely differently. Just a warning.The crafting system is deep and decently complex and rewards the player for pursuing it heavily. At end game you have the option to become a full blown crafter for your guild and earn money making pieces of gear for people who want your services. Note that researching certain traits off pieces takes real time hours so this will take a lot of work for you to become a particularly good one.I can wholeheartedly say this game is NOT pay to win, yet there are a few pay for convenience features that might cross a few players lines. That being said, if you sub to ESO Plus which is the monthly pay feature. You'll be able to earn those convenience features in the shop and once you buy them you won't have to keep paying the monthly fee to be able to keep them. The one exception however is the craft bag. If you want to be a crafter you HAVE to pay a monthly fee. You will pick up so much random s*** in this world that one of the features the ""Craft Bag"" will be a necessity as it gives you a bottomless bag to put all of it in.The dungeons and trials in this game are all gorgeous and well designed, and that can go for the worldspace in general. Levelling dungeons will be incredibly easy if you're decently geared but once you hit max level, mechanics will start to become a thing even in normal mode and there certainly is a skill cap to them. Probably one of the tightest PVE experiences I've had in an MMO. If you enjoy the combat, that is.World PVP is a bit of a mess. Mostly due to server lag and if your PC doesn't have a decent rig you might want to avoid that entirely. PVP battlegrounds, which are arena style fighting, are a thing though if you still want to scratch your itch for PVP. Less lag but balance is questionable at times. Overall a fun experience plagued by long existing server problems or balance issues that might destroy your mental at the snap of a finger.Achievements are probably my favourite thing about the game as Zone Guides are going to be a godsend for completionists. Everything you do will bring you closer to a certain achievement with some giving you costumes, mounts, titles, emotes, or armour dyes. Very rewarding if you're looking to sink time into filling up a progress bar.The community is great with obviously a few outliers and exceptions. People that stick with this game and play it on a daily basis generally are just plain lovers of the Elder Scrolls series and are very friendly. Good population very helpful and welcoming to new players. High tier raiding and PVP in general are plagued with the usual elitists, but hey, that's pretty much every game. By now you've noticed that a lot of my points boil down to ""Well it's good, but..."" and I don't think there's a better way to sum up the game then that. If you're an MMO player or Elder Scrolls nerd there's a lot for you here. Yet there are plenty things that I have listed that I can see turning people away from the game. Even I had my struggles getting into it for a decently long time. It's a solid game that I can only hope sees good changes in the future. A very large dedicated group of people want this game to do really well and I'm a part of that collective. I can 100% recommend this game to players looking for a good MMO or Elder Scrolls story. Just be aware that it isn't perfect and it lacks the polish other games of the genre have in my opinion."
Positive,"Super fun MMO, by far one of the best out there"
Positive,the game is made of game whow
Positive,"This is a good game. It's a wholesome MMORPG experience in a great pre-existing world with a lot of lore and you can play the vast majority of the game without spending a penny beyond release. This is really one of the beauties of this game; Many, if not most other MMORPGs I have played practically required you to pay for accessing most of the content. Definitely a good game."
Positive,"Great community! I came from one of the ""other"" massive MMOs that have been out for the last 15 years... and this has been a refreshing change of pace! I love the solo aspects of the game and getting into groups with others is easier than most as you can easily share your quest with your friend and you're both off to adventure together. Plays like every other Elder Scrolls game ive played +the added fun of rolling through content with your buddies. Would absolutely recommend!"
Positive,"What's not to love? This is a game that you can't expect results in a first time playthrough. You will not go far within a few hours, but you will see progress. Leveling in a world the size of a real planet, it's quite difficult to understand some people's expectations of things happening quickly as if they were playing some BR or FPS game.The amount of content in this game is astounding for the price you're paying for. 1000's of hours. While some things could change, I mostly see this game as getting better per each DLC that is released.I have over 4,000 hours logged on PS4 and only above 100 here on PC, so the PC version I am getting used to, but the context is all the same. Kill this guy, defend this town, pvp this, pve that, explore, site see, make friends, conquer and become an emperor. I highly recommend this game for anyone who just wants a game that'll last them years and years. They can quit tomorrow, and come play it again a year or two later and keep going. You won't regret it if you understand what there is to do."
Positive,"This is a pleasant game to mess around in. There's lots to do for people of different play styles. Play as if it's a solo game, do dungeons and world bosses with friends, decorate a home, collect achievements.I really recommend finding a beginner's guild or playing with an experienced friend to help you settle in at first, many of the mechanics are a little hidden or esoteric."
Positive,one of the best MMORPG i have ever played
Positive,"Lots of fun, open world, flexible character gen."
Positive,Very nice MMORPG. Buy if you've played Elder Scroll V : Skyrim.NOTE: There is no servers for Oceania. Average ping in NA and EU is 300-400
Positive,Awesome MMO. It is a never ending game and will consume you.Update - Came back to it after 2 yrs. Still a good game. A lot of repetitive back n forth.  Only part of game that will make me stop playing again.  I really hate how many times I go somewhere to come back to go right back there again several times.  Crown store is crazy expensive as well and hard to get cool things.  Have to really grind for gold to unlock houses and other things.  All in all a good game with lots to do. I still recommend here and there. Still one of the better MMO out there.
Positive,Pretty fun to play with friends with the whole dungeon and online pvp part of the game. Only really thing i noticed is that it seems so much easier to level up than it was before but i dont know due to not reading some of the patch notes
Positive,"Although the queueing is bad sometimes for a solo player like me, i have to inv other players in guild to make it less long.  Anyway, i love playing this game. I commented on the elsweyr page of this by accident so i'll just repeat what i said there, or just try to find it.  Uhh its the only mmorpg i play. Only game i play. Im not really a fan of games(or im jist too lazy to find anything good) but yeah this one i like(my bf introduced it to me). Crafting, pvp, pve , fishing. I do all of it and currently have 8 characters. Do i have a life? That's the question. Will recommend to friends if i have any thats interested. But nope . None."
Positive,"One from 2 games i did try and could never stop to play :P. Iam absolutely obsessed with phantasy , magic , dragons , kings etc, As a player of Morrowind , Oblivion or Skyrim i must say that TESO is totally different but i absolutely love it. From pve , quest lines , pvp and open world fight absolutely love every peace of it. Played TESO all this years on console lately also downloaded for pc. TESO is life :D"
Positive,Nothing but the best.
Positive,kurwa jest w pyte
Positive,Returned to play after briefly playing a few years ago. The game has definitely turned around for the best! I am absolutely hooked. 2 Thumbs up.
Positive,"Already over 1900 hours and still didn't finish all solo missions, barely touched PVP either. If you want a game that lasts, this is it"
Positive,"Great game, it has amazing graphics and great game-play, the best game-play of any MMORPG I've played. Well done to the devs. It also has an amazing story so far."
Positive,"Really fantastic and fair MMO. It's an Elder Scrolls MMO, so if that sounds even a little intriguing to you you'll probably have a blast with this game. It rewards you for playing however you want. Want to just solo quests? Cool. Want to do nothing but dungeons all day? That's cool too. It also has some of the best writing you'll see in any video game, and everything is completely voice acted. This is one of the best games you can currently get into in 2020."
Positive,"Con todas las expansiones hasta Elsewyr inclusive es un juego que recomiendo que compren cuando esté en oferta, el combate en primera persona es medio tosco, pero el juego mantiene la escencia que tiene que tener y es muy entretenido, las quests no son repetitivas y la main quest está muy buena.Claramente recomendado, voy casi 50 horas y pienso que le voy a meter alrededor de 200 horas más.Comprar la membresía plus es algo que cambia totalmente la jugabilidad y la hace mucho más accesible, si pueden hacerlo, haganlo."
Positive,"better than most mmorpgs, there are too many free content to do. i love it!"
Positive,"Really good, would recommend"
Positive,Great MMORPG. Can also be played Solo. Tons of content.............................
Positive,"Honestly, I have a long history with this game. I preordered it back when it was pay to play and immediately regretted it, cancelled the subscription and didn't touch it for a year or two. Fast forward some time and I'm glad I came back. Having become disillusioned with WoW, this game filled the niche of mmorpg that I love. Its exceedingly story rich, and it feels like your decisions actually have a modicum of influence on the world at large. The dlc is all amazing, and while it doesn't require a sub to play, its fairly helpful to have one."
Positive,Great Game. Love the graphics and game play along with the story. They only thing I wish they would work on is the combat mechanics. I dont think they are as smooth as they could be; plus I dont like to sit and melee each time when I run out of Magicka or Stamina. I guess I am just use to WOW's Combat Mechanics lol.
Positive,"I have about 7000 hours of world of warcraft and its fair to say this game is a pretty good mmo rpg, it ain't perfect as alot of people said, they highly incentivize you to pay for the premium membership, as someone who paid for wow it wasn't a big deal to me, but overall pretty fun game, the storytelling part is amazing and the customization of your character is great, skill wise and cosmetic wise. I highly recommend if your looking for a new mmo rpg to play alone or with friends."
Positive,"This is the best MMORPG I have ever played. Just like any game, it's not perfect, but I absolutely love it to death."
Positive,This game is too good
Positive,"I've played this game for a long time and it is still my favorite MMORPG to date. It has good combat, lots of choices for how you want to play, and good for PVE and PVP. I've played other games with better combat such as BDO, but it lacks gameplay that supports playing with other people. In ESO, you have guilds and dungeons and all quests can be done with others by sharing quests and grouping up in a party. Give this game a go, start with the base game or if there is a big sale for the expansions go ahead and snag them. There is a lot to this game and you shouldn't need to rush despite what videos say. Just take it easy."
Positive,fun game to play with friends
Positive,Skyrim + WoW = ESO
Positive,Great game for The Elder Scroll fan
Positive,i ate corn one time ngl it was pretty good
Positive,"Everyone: ""Oh, I wanna play Skyrim together""Bethesda: ""Gotcha"" -> The Elder Scrolls Online(I think it is well made, so it deserves a thumbes up)"
Positive,If you like Elder Scrolls and wanna play with friends go for it! its not exactly easy to solo but it can be done if that's your style. the RP community is huge if you're into that.
Positive,"So many things to do in game without even needing to purchase +. There are tons of mounts, pets, and costumes to get where all you have to do is do an achievement, or maybe finish a quest. Participating in the events is profitable, as you can save up tickets from them and get prizes without having to spend irl money! 11/10P.S. I love my pet chicken. She follows me everywhere."
Positive,awesome farming and grinding with cool quests and biomes and awesome boss with complicated mecanics
Positive,fell in love with this game. even the side quests are well written. If you like the Elder Scrolls setting and MMORPG this one is a blast.for now I like it even more than WOW because the world is vivid.
Positive,so much fun. Such a vast open world platform to play in. So many quests to do and monsters to kill. you can never get bored.
Positive,Best looking mmorpg i played so far.
Positive,if you like wow you will love this game too
Positive,very entertaining and fun to play...except it has a few bugs that are very annoying but overall its a good game
Positive,"Banger: Babies First MMO, Very Fun"
Positive,"In my opinion, the ESO is worth playing in 2020. The ESO has undergone a ton of quality of life changes and has gotten a ton of updates since its inception. With plenty of updates, ZeniMax has dramatically improved the state of the game and ESO is in a much healthier state now than it ever has been previously.- Delia Woolf"
Positive,"The best game by me is the elder scrolls onlineUnfortunately my computer is a little weak, Computer information image ( https://prnt.sc/ryabvr )Fortunately this game works for me, And play it in Medium not Ultra, I will buy a game today or tomorrowIf you would like to contact me, This is my email account ( hichamhaskouri@gmail.com )"
Positive,if you suck play it w friends it's more fun that way
Positive,"Muy entretenido, es un poco confuso al principio pero haciendo los quests y explorando logras entenderlo."
Positive,Bag simulation while wearing various outfits
Positive,brill loving it better then wow
Positive,Best game I've played in quite some time
Positive,you can be a cat
Positive,"New to the Elder Scrolls franchise and playing ESO is an great experience.  There is so much to do and so much to explore.  The crafting system is incredible. Combat is involved.  Really enjoying the game.Update:  After around 400 hours, I took a year long break.  Coming back to the game with a new character and falling in love with the game all over again."
Positive,"Good time waster of a game.Decent graphics,fairly stable server and multiplayer dynamics.Predictable quests and achievements make it a bit dreary at times,but you get what you pay for,and that's the big downside of ESO the only really good content is all pay for DLC and the prices are outrageous."
Positive,"Currently the best MMO on the market. Fully voice-acted quests that are actually fun to do (not get 10 boar anuses and return to me), the ability to play in first person and third, it feels like an actual elder scrolls game and can be played either solo or with friends (and guildmates). You can play without a sub if you like, crown store is strictly not pay to win."
Positive,This is an unhealthy addiction.
Positive,Good Storyline and loads of places to discover. Most fun with a group of friends farming for gear.
Positive,"Amazing game, never boring!"
Positive,As a beginner player to MMORPGs I REALLY enjoy playing ESO. It helped me get into the world and learn more about play styles and group play. Id you are looking to get into gaming this is a good way to start!
Positive,"ESO is a fantastic MMORPG that succeeds where others fail. Dont have much time invested in PC version yet, as predominantly played on the PS4, but making the transition to PC version now :) I look forward to remaking my chars and sinking many hours into ESO!"
Positive,"This game is awesome. I played the offline elder scrolls, and I was thinking that being online would ruin it. It didn't. The only thing i don't like is that you can't earn crowns for difficult quests or something."
Positive,Best MMORPG ❤️❤️❤️
Positive,"Why cant i stop playing this game? someone help, i need my life back!"
Positive,Pretty good would be better if it had less paid content
Positive,good for coronavirus grind lockdown
Positive,greate game if you played skyrim and loved it youll love this game too
Positive,"The world is full of small details, and the game has a lot of enjoyable content for its humble price tag."
Positive,"While I'm not a huge MMO fan, this is the game that does it for me. The active combat with dodging, blocking, rolling, and interrupting is fun and exciting. Every quest, even minor side quests, has a fun tidbit of lore or interesting characters which really helps make the world feel alive. Playing with friends is really easy since you can immediately teleport to them even if they're part of a different faction and there aren't any leveled zones. Finally, there are tons of events and great rewards for staying a dedicated fan."
Positive,"This game sucks, is buggy, and has a ton of problems. However despite my weapons going invisible, my friends being pushed out of the map, and me being killed on sight without a bounty, I wake up everyday and am excited to play. I see people running on their mounts, which makes for a funny conversation, go into pvp and get 1 shot by a healer, and sprint through entire dungeons cause they're not challenging at all. Despite all this I find myself playing every day, leveling something up, running some sort of dailies, or just messing around with my friends. Would i recommend this game as a solo player? Probably not, but if you have a group of friends to play with, this game is prime for some fun. :)"
Positive,A game I have been playing for 6 years on console and only recently downloaded it on Mac. I love it so much and would recommend it to anyone looking for a wonderful high fantasy game!
Positive,No idea what an Elder Scroll is or why they're online but I love this game :)
Positive,TES V but better
Positive,you can make yo lil mama thicc than a mf if you so choose mane
Positive,10/10 would play again in fact I do
Positive,its like skyrim with guns
Positive,The world is extremely fleshed out.  Interesting story lines.  Simplistic game play that seems to get funner as you level.
Positive,If you're looking for a MMO that's sorta like WOW I recommend this game.
Positive,"The game is everything you are looking for in an MMORPG: you can play casually, there is matchmaking for dungeons or you can go hardcore and try vet dungeons and raids. There are world bosses and a lot of stuff to do in the open world (which is crowded with people), the game rewards area exploration too like in previous TES games. Another plus: it is easily one if not the friendliest of the genre to jump in with friends and do stuff together, even if you are an old player and they are just starting out you'll still find stuff to do together, you can share quests with friends too (although some relevant main quests are locked for solo)."
Positive,ngl iat first i was like elderscrolls online .... wat is this some type of money grab? and yes yes it is but its a fun money grab i got it when it was onsale a good while back an only recently pick it back up when i heard there will be a necromancer class and im loving the skills for it sofar not really being bound to just 1 tree is my type of game play so i play a bit all over the place most mmos are like what skill tree u wana use... o u like this one? well were locking the other 2 now intill you pay us... or some other reason you no who u are (insert pay to win mmo here) >.> any way there are issues where i found that sometime the game will just lag out appon loggin in or well get stuck on a loading screen till it also boots u aside from that its a good PVE game PVP? wellllllllll that still up for debate
Positive,"Ahaahaahaha heeeeee! Very funn game xhu! I play many hours, on the time my dunmer overlords give me!"
Positive,Best played with friends! <3
Positive,can be an argonian. god bless. mid af tho gotta say the combat gets old very fast
Positive,"Great game to play with friends or even solo - but better with friends tho. Time goes by fast playing and it has loads of missions and quests and more content than Skyrim itself. Only problem is for curtain stuff i want to do, i need to purchase  DLC's and so on."
Positive,If you love the lore and the universe this is the game for you. if you're looking for an experience like skyrim you wont find it with this game its an MMO and one of the best ones i've ever played. UPDATE:  Yeah still a good game
Positive,"There is something beautiful in Elder Scrolls games that i don't know how to put into words.The very first thing that hook me and made me notice that this game was good were the books.The books in this game are so well written and sometimes so profound that i cannot but know that there is heart putted into this game.It's fun, has quite some depth and things to do and explore. Get it now that is on discount !"
Positive,"Lots of good and bad things about this game, as with any mmo, but the good outweighs the bad for the most part."
Positive,"A very fun, large and unique Elder Scrolls experience with frequent updates, tons of different quests and combat that actually works. Just wish the player numbers were higher."
Positive,Its pretty fun. Just play like an hour and you have basically got the gist of things :)
Positive,Best. Game. Ever.
Positive,horp masp evolved
Positive,enjoyable and enduring MMO in a well known IP
Positive,"played this on steam and even on own launcher more than 4k hours played. Recently returned and still good, I wish I had the same number of free time as before to play this again"
Positive,"This is actually my first review ,and the game is freaking amazing. The Story is easy to follow,its interesting. The classes are amazing,and the thing that i really like is that every class can equip the weapon of their choice. If you are a Sorcerer you can rock the sword if you feel like it. It gives you things that no other MMORPG gives you. Its simply amazing. If you are thinking of buying it. GO BUY IT! And the community ouh boy. Its damn amazing ,everyone is so nice,and everyone wants to help you. The best communty secound to Destiny 2."
Positive,"It's fun, and nice to fill your time waiting for the new elder scrolls to come out."
Positive,"I'm not a big fan of MMO's, the 14 hours that I have into this game already was one session... Get it it's fun."
Positive,boat loads of fun with friends
Positive,One of the best MMO out there!
Positive,have paid may Todd taxes in my day not fan of this one will come back if opinion changesedit I like this game now
Positive,"Really great game, awesome world, gameplay, lore, and content."
Positive,"Pros:- Action MMORPG.- Tons of lore.- Quests and random npcs are voice acted.- A ton of quests, some even have puzzles.- Some quests allow you to make a choice that alter things permanently for you in the game world.- With the Dye and crafting system, you can customize your gear to make it look like whatever you've unlocked account wide.- Tons of fun vanity items and outfits to unlock.- Can be played first or third person.Cons:- Graphics are dated.- Thieves/Assassin guilds not apart of base game."
Positive,"My go-to MMO. Has everything you'd expect in a MMO and set within The Elderscrolls universe. Do not expect it to be like the single player games, as it is a MMO. If you can understand that enemies appear in mobs and more frequent, a lot quests are more MMO-like (kill 3 of this, activate 6 of those) but still extremely story driven and sticks well to the Elderscrolls lore. With the expansions now, you have a decent choice of classes and direction you want to take a character. The scenery is beautiful, captures the lore books from previous games that describe other parts of Tamriel, and the world is just..massive. MASSIVE. Also, get ESO+ even for just the material bag. The extra crowns make a difference especially if you save them up and the character buff bonus is good overall.See you in Tamriel, Adventurer!"
