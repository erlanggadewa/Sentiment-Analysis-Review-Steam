Negative,"So, this game is fun and I like it, but it has a massive issue with input delay, and inputs not registering. I am not talking about trying to dodge while attacking, that is not an issue and makes the game more enjoyable in terms of timing attacks. I am talking about just standing still and doing nothing jamming the button to use a potion and nothing happens. Or dodging while not attacking and nothing happens. It is kind of crazy that no one has been talking about this."
Negative,"It is with genuine regret that I do not recommend this game, but because of specific circumstances. If you have photosensitive seizures like I do, there is almost no level of adjustment to the graphics which will make this benign. There is no warning, people will think it's just about flashing lights but it's also about conflicting texture layers. I am very saddened that I will not be able to play."
Negative,"Unlike most people who reviewed this game after 30 minutes and declared it GOTY, i actually played the game.TLDR: Fun at the start, get repetitive really fast and overstays its welcome, with a bunch of glitches and graphical errors.Graphics and performance: Beautiful, but also really buggy, crashed multiple times, and when moving my character had a constant silhouette of artifacts which were really distracting. At least it had very little frame drops most of the time on a XTX7900 and an AMD 7800X3D.Gameplay: Basically this is a boss rush game. Nothing more, nothing less. Combat is pretty to look at, basically stays the same for the whole game. Maybe that is why people hype it so much because it is fun at the start but gets boring real quick. Around 95% of the bosses are one shot pushovers which you will have forgotten about 5 minutes after killing them. The other 5% are just frustrating to fight because they were so badly designed especially the later game fights where every boss has at least 2 health bars as well as transition phases that make then immune to you but they will still attack you which go on for far too long. Also mechanics wise they have a lot of very similar moves e.g. basically every later game boss has a move that puts them above your head and makes them shoot a multitude of projectiles at you. Just very repetitive all around.Also game would have really benefited from some sort of map.Story: Know Journey to the west or don't bother trying to understand who the characters in the game are or what you are doing besides ""get all the monkey king relics"".EDIT: Forgot to mention the absolutely terrible skill tree. It is almost always the best option to just take base ""increase attack/defense/crit chance/crit dmg"" nodes instead of skills that actually alter your gameplay which is just a straight up failure in designing an interesting progression system."
Negative,"I guess this is a hot take, so bring on the clown awards, but in my opinion, Black Myth Wukong does not live up to the hype. It's absolutely lacking in so many ways I couldn't believe what I was playing based on the reviews I read and I'm sorry if that steps on the toes of your new favorite game, but it's true. I was in no way compelled to continue playing this after the first session and here's why:For starters, the game's performance is unstable at best, even on my 3080ti, i9 CPU, 32GB RAM, liquid cooled machine. It constantly and unexpectedly dipped down to laughably low frame rates to the point that I thought the game was being ran by Microsoft Power Point, even with most of the settings on low and medium, RTX off, DLSS set to performance and frames capped at 120. Unacceptable.Looking past that, the world traversal is some of the most boring gaming I've done in decades. There is nothing to do other than fight a handful of trash mobs, find some meditation spots and then fight bosses. And I mean like every 10ft, there's a new boss. I never even understand why I'm fighting them half the time and they're super forgettable. The title should really be ""Wukong: Boss Rush"" or something more accurate like that. I learn the fights just long enough to beat them and then I never think about them again after they're over.And the game's scenery is so ridiculously bland that everything looks the same to me. There are no useful land marks and no map/minimap, so you're constantly getting lost and back tracking in circles. On top of that, they do absolutely nothing to make you 'feel' like a monkey God while running around. You have a basic sprint and that's it. No cool flips. No world interaction. No wall runs. No climbing. No swinging. No staff tricks. Not even a double jump... It is painfully boring to run around in this game and OMG the amount of invisible walls and dead ends that should be explorable is infuriating.The core gameplay loop is:1. sluggishly traverse through an uninteresting area2. kill trash mobs until you stumble across a boss3. spend an hour learning its gimmicky move set4. finally beat it and repeat, that's itThis game is just way too shallow and bland right now. I got bored in the first sitting and I have no will to even finish it. I will admit though, that the bosses are beautifully crafted and have very imaginative designs that ultimately don't matter because they all seem to have the same basic concept: Rush-down AI, spam attacks, then reset every so often. It felt like I was fighting the same boss reskinned over and over and over, even after 7 hours of play time. Not to mention that some fights are literally just ripped from other games with almost zero changes, like Ornstein and Smough for example.Moving on from that, the game's main draw (the combat) is extremely hollow. There is no block system. No parry system. No backstab system. No stealth system. You literally have a dodge and a stick. The rest comes from a handful of spells, stances and transformations (which are also inconsistent, like, why can't I even JUMP while I'm transformed???) The dodge windows feel awful. Enemies will stun lock you constantly. Tons of CC. Input scanning. Animation locks. Overpowered status effects like poison and fire. Spongy enemies with inflated health pools. Bosses become impervious to your attacks, but they can still hit you. Every cheesy trick in the book to create artificial difficulty and prolonged encounters. It is more frustrating than rewarding and when you finally beat something, you won't feel accomplished, you'll just be happy you got lucky enough to beat the enemy's gimmick one time after hours of failure with nothing to look forward to except doing it all over again in about 10ft.Wukong, to me, is desperately trying to be a mash-up of Dark Souls and God of War, but it fails on both counts. I think the potential is there, but it still needs a while to cook before it gets to the level that these botted reviews would have you believe it's at. Make the areas/maps more interesting and less linear (a true open world would be even better). Bring these beautiful characters to the forefront and really lean into the story. Make the boss mechanics feel more unique in each fight. Improve the traversal. Optimize the performance. Fix these issues and the game's underlying potential will start to shine through.It does some things well, like character designs, musical scores, graphics and beautifully cinematic moments, but it falls flat in so many other ways that I genuinely can't recommend this game in its current state. I really wish I hadn't purchased it yet, as it might be worth playing sometime late next year or in 2026. If not, maybe the inevitable Wukong 2 will hit the mark in ways this one couldn't, but as it stands, this ain't it for me. I would refund if I could.-----Edit: For anyone who might be wondering why my playtime keeps going up after a review like this, it's quite frankly because I paid $60 for the game and I don't want that money to go to waste, so I'm going to finish it. Still VERY disappointed with what Wukong COULD have been though."
Negative,"The Boss AI stopped working for 2 different bosses. I had to restart the fight. One of them refused to die after I got his HP to 0, twice. I had to restart the fight again. I am currently stuck at this boss since their AI just turns off midfight and I refuse to fight a target dummy. It runs pretty well and combat looks pretty good so far but bosses, which seems to be the main focus of the game, doesn't work properly.Edit: After like five tries the boss AI worked and I finished the fight. But later on unsurprisingly out of 6 bosses or so 2 of them also stopped fighting midfight and 1 of them refused to die. I tried that boss again 3 more times to no avail. I literally cannot continue the game. Some people have no problems like I do but I also saw enough to know this isn't just happening to me. If you want to gamble go ahead but be warned. Wait for a patch for sure.UPDATE: Found a solution. So if your Windows language is not EN or CN and if your alphabet contains the letters ""ö,ü,ğ,ş"" (I don't know which one of these letters cause the problem. Can be one can be all of them at once) the boss AI just gives up for some reason. So the solution is to change your windows language to EN. The negative review will stay as negative since this is still a crazy mistake that tarnished my gameplay for days and I want people who are having the same problem to see this review."
Negative,"The other negative reviews have already covered most of it. I can just add that I too find the game very frustrating. I want to love it, but the poor combat design, getting locked into animations far too often, which punishes you constantly, bonks my monke brain far too often.The movement and dodging also feels very poorly implemented. It feels like you have constant input lag. When you land a heavy attack it doesn't feel rewarding because of the randomness (sometimes you get interrupted, sometimes you don't).The level design is very strange, in a bad way. You get tired of trying to reach places and explore because of the inconsistent and invisible walls. The bosses doesn't feel significant or interesting since you stumble upon new ones constantly. No build-up or back story to get the excitement up before the next boss.I'm not even going to get started on ranged enemies.No FOV adjustment. Extreme over-sharpening of the graphics with no ability to turn it off RUINS the beauty. Camera movement is incorrectly implemented and extremely annoying. No HDR-support and there are raised black levels (no true blacks). A lot of graphical artifacts, mostly noticeable around the character. Also plenty of stuttering."
Negative,"Invisible walls everywhere, thinly-veiled corridor level design, traversal stutter constantly, meh enemy AI with mobs falling into gaps in geometry or getting stuck on the side of cliffs, generic storytelling with no narrative stakes or tension — best go read J2tW because a computer game still hasn't made that story interesting or tried to tell it in a way that doesn't rely on already knowing the story...At least its really pretty!"
Negative,"Cannot recommend for AMD users at the moment. Haven't even made it through the tutorial fight without constant crashes. Well above recommended PC specs, drivers are updated,  dropped graphic settings to lighten the load... so on and so forth. Hoping for some updates soon to help the issues.Update. Not entirely sure what the problem was but I did manage to stop the crashing in the intro fight by locking the frames to 60. Changed FRS to TSR. And dropping graphics to low. Could've been the sheer volume of particles. Gradually cranked everything back up to cinematic and have only crashed once since."
Negative,"First of all it's a beautiful game. The visuals are great, It also has some unique combat that when you get used to it, it's enjoyable. But beyond that...this game is a boss simulator. I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy that aspect. I was hoping for more exploration. The game is linear, which isn't bad in itself, but it's boss fight after boss fight after boss fight. For gamers like me, the game becomes a constantly stressful and continuous boss fight. Sometimes, there's very little between one boss fight and the next and I was hoping for more than that. A lot more."
Negative,"I got this game for free as a promotion with a graphics card I bought, I hadn't watched any trailers for it and never really looked into it. I went in with no expectations or hype whatsoever, and frankly I don't get it.The game has terrible level design, you are bound to hit an invisible wall (even if the place you are trying to reach is part of the level, sometimes there's just an invisible wall to prevent you from going there from a specific angle for some reasons) no matter where you go, the paths are also not intuitive, I was actually going around the level trying to find what I had missed only to find out that there was a small gap to crawl in to progress hidden inside a cave, there was nothing to tell me this was there, I found it by pure chance, the combination of the invisible walls, non-intuitive levels and the lack of a map to find those paths on makes exploring very frustrating.The combat feels wrong, sometimes you do an input mid-roll and the character does the move related to that input right after the roll, and sometimes he does not, heavy attacks have ridiculous delay to them which makes them feel terrible to use. In some fights, you could start a heavy attack before the boss starts his attack and get punished anyway. You barely do any damage to bosses and kill regular enemies way too easily, which makes the bosses the only actual challenge, well except for actually finding them, unfortunately the bosses have terrible arena designs and sometimes attack fast enough to get you with a follow-up attack right after your dodge. The story relies way too much on the base material, if you have not read the book, none of it makes sense.The game does look pretty, but if its not fun then why would I play it."
Negative,"Игру пытается тащить китайская мифология и ""Путешествие на запад"". Разработчик нам обещал слэшер с челленджем. Но вот прошло 5 часов игры и первые 5 или 6 обсосов (назвать этих крипов с большой полоской боссом язык не повернется), а почему я не помню сколько? А потому что они не запоминаются ни чем. Абсолютно. Я помню первых боссов в ДМЦ, Байонетте, Соулсах, но в этой игре выйдя из нее я уже забыл. За 5 часов игра не дала вообще никакого челленджа. Боевка - привет нулевые, когда у разработчиков были существенные ограничения в плане технологий, знаний и т.п. Но простите тот же ГоВ3 был в разы интересней и я помню стартовые сражения. А здесь нет ничего. Просто коридор по которому ты бежишь и пинаешь крипов разного размера. А еще игра может поставить стрелка в место куда ты не можешь никак достать. Мммм найс геймдизайн. Выпускать слэшер с настолько бездарным геймдизайном после двух частей Год Оф Вара и Стеллар Блэйда - это реально позор. Китайцы молодцы только в одном - срубили бабки на лохах, которые повелись на Короля Обезьян, китайскую мифологию и ""Путешествие на Запад"". Что ж впредь продукцию этого разработчика будем в начале оценивать по стримам."
Negative,"the first 10 hours will lull you in, but honestly this game just kinda blows. There is next to zero exploration worth. It's a boss rush game through and through, and the combat isn't remotely good enough to carry it. The bosses are just tedious endurance tests, with horrible hit-boxes and win conditions. The game emphasizes dodging, and then rewards you with really bizarre hitboxes because the enemies have invisible walls around their body which means you can't be underneath them, which mean your attacks constantly whiff, and bosses can hop a metre away and completely avoid your heavy attacks, which are your win condition.Banging your head against Consort Radahn was frustrating, but fun still because you could feel your progress and know you failed because you messed up. Everytime I failed against the bosses here it was because I ran out of HP to survive the onslaught of suspect hit detection and tedious gimmicks."
Negative,"I simply do not understand how this game is overwhelmingly positive.  It feels, in many places, extremely amateurish in fact.Level design is objectively terrible.  Huge open maps that feel procedurally generated they're so bland.  The game is positively littered with invisible walls which makes exploring a tedious mess.  Running down a path only to find that THIS one ends in an invisible wall while THAT one allows you to continue walking is shockingly awful.Levels are massive open spaces with a tiny smattering of enemies.  The game feels like a boss rush.  The camera is terrible, the bosses range from fine to terribly designed. The gear progression is completely pointless, the story is non existent, encounter design is comical.The devs might have said the game isn't a souls-like but it very obviously is.  Sadly it's a bad souls-like.  It's not even in the same universe of the best games in the genre.  Obviously it's hilariously bad compared to From games but it's also massively inferior to the Deck 13 games, the Remnant games, the Team Ninja games and most of the good 2D souls-like games.The game swings wildly from so comically easy the game is boring to annoyingly designed difficulty where you spend 60 percent of a fight literally running after a boss or running away as a boss floats in the air.The game looks nice.  I guess that's all it takes these days."
Negative,"I hate to downvote what is clearly a great game, but it has technical issues that prevent me from having a good experience. Random crashes and weird performance issues on AMD. I hope this review serves to amplify the voices of others having similar issues and catalyzes the developers to do the work this game deserves.I'll consider trying again once it receives some patches."
Negative,"I really don't understand the excitement around this game. Yes, it's pretty. Yes, the combat can be fun, and the story is interesting. But the controls are janky (like barely work half the time), there are invisible walls everywhere, and it's just boss after boss after boss. It's just plain annoying more often than fun. EDIT: i just finished the game and yea I realllly don't like it. The credits couldn't even run correctly lmao"
Negative,"Black Myth: Wukong is not the game that you think it is. The opening is strong, with gorgeous visuals, incredible art direction and mystifying enemy and boss design. The problems begin however when the introduction is over and the real game begins. Black Myth Wukong dresses itself as an RPG but this is only superficial. In reality, Black Myth Wukong is a Boss Rush. There's very little downtime between boss fights, often moving directly from one fight into another. When there is something in-between, the game offers only linear levels with nothing in the way of exploration.That's not to say that the game isn't entirely without merit. Visually the game is a feast for the eyes, and the music and sound design are top quality. The combat system is as visually pleasing as it is mechanically deep, there's an array of skills, spells, transformations, items and equipment at the players disposal.However, this variety is hampered by the totally linear progression, armour and weapons are not found in the game world, they are unlocked in the shop after an arbitrary amount of progress has been made. Likewise for spells and skills which are only unlocked after specific points of the story. This leaves the game severely lacking in player agency, there's no decision making in where to go or in what order you progress the story, each ""level"" of the game is a beautifully decorated corridor with a boss waiting for you at the end and even within a scant few hours, the shallow game-play loop becomes immediately apparent. The boss rush nature of the game falls flat without the framing behind it. Bosses that have fantastic visual design have no framing within the story, there's little to no lore or explanation behind the enemies you're facing and it can leave you erratically jumping from one quirky boss fight to another with a feeling of disconnect. Without this framing, the significance of the boss is lost and what could have been a grandiose fight becomes a pedestrian affair, each boss becomes just another box to tick on your road to the end of the game.Black Myth: Wukong is a spectacle, for sure, but it feels like it's using that spectacle as a crutch to distract from how little depth there to the gameplay, it feels like all of the mechanics of a good RPG were created, they just forgot to create the world to go with it."
Negative,"I can appreciate the developers effort on this title and constraining the scope to ensure they focus on their strengths i.e. simplify game world design - keeping it linear - and retaining the focus on combat experience (bosses).However, in truth, this is a ""AA title"" with higher fidelity graphics than is typical of the format.I am truly disappointed in the execution in terms of the combat mechanics however ambitious. There are systemic issues in combat system not being responsive enough i.e. input delays, hit boxes not registering etc.These issues amidst ambitious and aggressive combat become severely frustrating especially in critical moments - which can change the tide of battle - which undermine the players efforts; and especially when you progress further into the game and challenges ramp up in difficulty which then require the needed precision.In terms of the game play experience I would recommend holding off on buying this right now and rather wait until these issues are addressed, if at all.I will conclude this review in saying, I completed the game and the game play experience is truly subpar for this genre.NOTE: As I could not refund I insisted on pushing through and completing the game however the experience plays out as described above. As the game progressively demands more precision the flaws become exceedingly evident and hence excessively hinders the players journey with unrelenting frustration."
Negative,"Is Black Myth: Wukong the best game ever made and ever will be made? YES!...... no.A sudden uproar of positive feedback for this game brings me here.People claiming insane quality with immense praise, and already bursting out with GOTY trophies left and right.""The most beautiful-looking game ever"", ""A technological wonderland"" and other absurd claims alike. Hyping it up as if it's 1993 and DOOM just released.So, I was intrigued -- if not a little enticed. I've read the gameplay described as not too dissimilar of the Dark Souls games and Sekiro, with others mentioning God of War from 2018. I'm really not a large fan of either, to say it politely. But I wouldn't have encountered many of my favourite games if I weren't open-minded.Either way, I was mostly interested in the highly-praised visuals of the game......And I am disappointed.Don't get me wrong, the aesthetic of the game looks fine -- but the vaseline textures, low-poly rocks with extremely stretched details, dittered hair, AO flicker on foliage, and some sort of constant film-grain filter plus intense sharpening effect is just killing it for me. I've seen games from over 6 years ago look vastly better than this.The whole game just looks like a blurry, fuzzy mess. Yes, even after turning off motion-blur and all that default crap, yadda yadda yadda.Performance is okay for a UE5 title, but it looks nowhere near the ""gameplay"" trailers they've shown, and quite frankly the overall picture doesn't look good enough to justify the performance.I'm certain similar fidelity could be achieved in UE3 for a fraction of CPU/GPU resource cost.Playing with a i9-14900KF, RTX 4080 Super, and 64GB RAM; on all the highest settings with full RTX on... and performance is most definitely playable, but what's on screen doesn't really aptly translate to the tankiness of the game. Maybe that's due to the integrated Denuvo bullshit.The 130GB installation is just wild, honestly. Compare that to Elden Ring's 50GB. I mean, the complaint writes itself. No way the contents of the game have in any way been sorted and optimized, especially with its low-res texture fidelity.I don't wanna be a Twitter guy and whine about in-game graphics, but I'm just not seeing the substance of all these crazy claims fans are making.Still, if the game's good then I probably wouldn't complain about its visuals. But it isn't.Gameplay is a monotonous button-masher with little-to-no positively noteworthy aspects.Normal enemies are weak as shit and even a dog with the controller in its mouth could accidentally kill them, no sweat.Bosses are mostly just consistent of spamming dodge, since they have very bad tells and 0-frame attacks from across the arena that stunlock you in an infinite loop. And the intervals between dodges are taken up by slowly waiting for magic to go off cooldown, just like God of War (2018). With spells that make you immortal or another that immobilizes the enemy, it's nothing but hand-holding.Normal attacks are a waste to bother with, as the 3rd consecutive light attack has such a long delay that it's easier to just dash after the 2nd to reset it. And heavy attacks are so tediously wonky to pull-off and take forever to do that there's zero reason to ever do such a thing mid-battle.The healing mechanic has such a large delay that it's hard to immediately know whether the game even registered your input, so I end up accidentally doing multiple heals at once.Areas are extremely linear in progression, and actively discourages any of the basic yet optional side-explorations by filling each room with illogically placed invincible walls. So you're never really sure where you can go and where you can't.The game's camera is somehow even worse than any FromSoftware's titles, which is not a prideful achievement.It will shuffle and twitch around like it's a scene from Cloverfield.And if as much as a twig get in the way, it will zoom in for a thorough colonoscopy.Also, the story is boring as fuck, and the English voice-acting is absolutely horrid and on-par with Atomic Heart.I'm not sure whether I could comfortably classify this game as ""bad"", but I certainly would not recommend it as my short time with it was truly agonizing. I'm no longer interested in playing any more, so... refunded."
Negative,"This may be the first time playing a steam game that I have ever felt an overwhelming need to post a negative review.  It is a shame that the current state of the game includes a major design flaw that ruins an otherwise stellar experience.  It is one that is so bad that I find it hard to press on playing after almost a week of play.In the interest of fairness to the parts of the Wukong development team that actually did a great job, the following aspects of the game are deserving of its currently Overwhelmingly Positive review status:Pros Enemy Design Combat  Sound/Music Stability/Optimization Voice Acting (English)However, the one team that absolutely did not live up to the level of quality that their peers delivered is the Level Design team.   Not because the levels do not look good -- the environments look stunning.   Not because there is no map or map overlay -- I have played other similar games with no map (e.g. Lies of P) where the lack of a map did not bother me. Not because of the cryptic steps required to unlock secret areas -- Elden Ring did the same thing and while I did not like it, it was not a deal breakerThe killing blow to the experience for this game is the Boundary Design.  This game should have never been released with this level of lazy implementation of Player Boundary Design.  It is utterly inexcusable to price your game at the AAA level when it is clear that there was less effort put into player boundary design and QA testing than a Nintendo 64 release.Navigating through levels in this game feels like walking through a 10'x10' glass corridor where you never know if you are going to smash your face on the the glass a few feet where a wall or drop in elevation appears to be or if said change in elevation is actually a path of progression.  Cons Inconsistency between level visuals and level boundaries Boss arenas often contain player boundaries which do not also affect the boss Boss arena boundaries sometimes seem to be a fraction of what the arena appears to beThe ever-present level of inconsistency with visual indicators of game boundaries and the actual enforced game boundaries makes level navigation and exploration tedious at best.  I do not find it fun to brush up against or jump at everything that looks like a boundary in order to determine if it actually is.  This lack of visual consistency is a big letdown as many of the secret paths contain very useful rewards but the sheer tedium of brute-force invisible wall testing is exhausting to the point where I no longer want to play.  The final insult thrust upon me by the Level Design team was in the 3rd chapter where . . .  after you fight a certain boss on a mountain path there is a shiny item on a nearby ledge.  After more than 30 minutes of trying to find a path to that area I discovered that you need to fall off of the edge of a nearby cliff to find a lower path, which I found immensely insulting as the game spent the last 40 hours teaching me that cliff edges = invisible walls.  But now I am supposed to ignore all of that and just try it because . . . you know what, it doesn't matter because I am not playing your game anymore. If this ever gets fixed I will change my review, and if on the infinitely unlikely chance that the Wukong Game Director reads this review -- allow me to pose a hypothetical question for you:  ""If you went to a 5 Star Steakhouse and ordered their most expensive steak.  You receive the meal and it looks and smells wonderful but you find that you can not cut off a piece from the side.  The Chef tells you that the outer 1/3 of the steak is inedible but you can cut from the middle.  You take a cut from the middle and it tastes well above your expectations.  The second cut from the middle also tastes just as good if not better, but on your 3rd bite you taste nothing at all.  The Chef then explains that 1/3 of the inner portion is inadvertently devoid of taste""What kind of review would you leave for that Restaurant?EditAs a few people have noticed, my gametime is increasing even though I stated above that I would no longer play the game.  In reality I am working on a mod which requires having the game executable open in order to inspect and query game assets.  I anticipate I am no more than a few weeks away from having that released and will post to NexusMods when it is ready.However, I am willing to make an implied agreement with this game studio -- whether they ever end up seeing this or not:Both you and I know how poorly the Level Bounds execution is in this game, I have seen it and you are intimately familiar with it.  Your UE Landscape Collision Splines look fine and are only marginally overextended compared to the elevations that define them.  On the other hand . . . the LevelBounds BoxComponents and vector defined BGWBlockingVolumes are atrocious.  It is almost as if there were two separate teams responsible for those.  Your bounds often coverup areas that themselves have appropriate mesh collision which begs the question of why they were added in the first place.Now it is time for the DEAL. . . If you beat me in releasing an update that addresses the substandard boundary implementation elements . . . not only will I change my review to positive, but I will also not release my mod or any videos which may expose the embarrassing level of quality on display in your boundary design.  I say this knowing full well that the audience I would reach would be miniscule.  but you never know, it may end up reaching someone who actually does have an audience and they may run with it.UpdateSo I have finished the initial version of the mod and now I can start playing without being distracted by Invisible Walls.  I will leave this review as is until this is fixed in game without needing to install a mod.  If/When that happens I will change this review to Recommends.Mod is available on Nexus Mods -> https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/398"
Negative,"Don't trust the benchmark, be it the tool or the in-game one if you have a weak pc, the game suffers significant framedrops and stutters starting with the final boss of the first level, which could make you overdue for a refund.------------------Update after nearly another 20 hours:After got kicked back by steam refund policy, I found more means to improve performance and beat the first two levels, I must say I'm deeply impressed with the artworks of this game, true works of art. The stutters, clearly centered upon various effects, are said to be a nasty quirk of early UE5 engine after some discussion. I faced them again with the white dragon on chapter 3, this time even heavier when it starts casting lightnings.However its not unmanageable as long as you use spells to lock it out of using them, and the rolls in this game have a very long range and much more invincible frames even compared to Dark Souls 3, so its okay.Still I'll leave this here as negative as a fare warning. Performance on low-end pc only becomes acceptable with a lot of downgrading to real resolution and frame generation that comes with the algorithm to fake it, pixelating effects and everything in motions, which is everywhere in a fast paced arpg, so much that it often hurts the eyes, evident with the floating sands on chapter 2. Overall getting worse graphics than last-gen with worse frames, and the quirks of UE5 can make thing laughable at times, but I guess that's just how corpos force people to buy new hardware now a days."
Negative,"Overhyped to oblivion, game is very mid so far yet the amount of positive reviews would make you think that this is literally the best game ever made"
Negative,"Great graphics, mediocre game play. There's a lot of artificial difficulty. You will run into invisible walls your entire play through. Many bosses have unavoidable cutscene grabs that do damage. Combat is basic and reminiscent of  the first ninja gaiden. Unfortunately not nearly as fun combat as ninja gaiden. Hit boxes on many bosses are goofy and lazily made. You find yourself chest to chest as close the character box will allow and still attacks won't reach. An entertaining game overshadowed by the frustration of issues games have long since fixed. Looks great plays poor."
Negative,"I really wanted to like this game, but it falls victim to many poor design decisions and I found the game far more tedious and frustrating than it should be.First off, the game is gorgeous, the cutscenes are fun, and I'm sure the story is great, though I struggled to follow along since I'm not familiar with JTTW. The game ran almost flawlessly on my machine as well.But I found the combat too simple, the customization and skill trees are shallow, and overall the whole game was pretty repetitive. 25 hours of doing the same light attack spam, followed by a heavy attack, got tiring quickly. Games centered entirely around the combat need some more variation to keep it interesting.Level design is bland, the fodder/non-boss enemies are often too easy and there's so much running in this game, the levels are huge, exploration felt slow and tedious.The bosses are the best part of the game, I found myself bored in the sections between bosses and just couldn't wait to get to the next one.But then the bosses start getting really rough at the end of chapter 4 and beyond. There is a lot of artificial difficulty that can turn such a cool spectacle of a fight to something you just want to be over because it's really just that unfun. Like a boss will remove 70% of your stamina bar, or make your dodges slower, or put 6 aoe tornadoes that just follow you around half of the fight that nuke your health bar etc. Some fights have some major hitbox issues too. Also boss HP is too high in the late game, fights drag on and on.80 tries to beat an Elden Ring boss was far more fun than 20-30 tries to beat one of the stinkier fights later in this game.Other games of this genre set the bar very high, and this game fell a bit below for my taste."
Negative,"After waiting for this game since it's teaser trailer, and now finally completing the game (and most side quests), I am ready give my opinion on it.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game.BMW is a difficult boss rush game with a fantastic story and minor RPG elements. Many people have already brought up the minor points of the game so I am gong straight to the main point. The combat is pretty much the whole of the game, going from boss to boss with minor fights in-between. The fights are incredibly punishing but feel so because the bosses are artificially difficult. I can only explain it through an example: After encountering a boss and dying multiple times you learn the bosses move sets and are able to dodge their moves and time your attacks. However, even after you do so, you realize that the boss still has 2/3rds of their health left and you have to battle perfectly...5 MORE TIMES. It really becomes a test of endurance rather than skill or reflexes. This becomes even more apparent after you utilize all of your spells and skills and are now left to slog through the battle with two incredibly repetitive moves (light and heavy attack). I found myself fairly bored with many battles, despite still dying repeatedly, because the enemies just last way too long because of their artificially inflated health bars. I have never played dark souls so I cannot compare it to BMW. To compare it to other games it feels like any other action adventure game just played on the highest difficulty. And that's the biggest problem I have with this game: why would it have been so hard to put in a difficulty option and simply reduce or increase the bosses health for each level you choose?The lack of difficulty options bothers me so much because it just makes me think of all of the people who gave up on this game, never even tried it, or just sped through it and missed so much side content and deep lore. Because that is where this game shines: the story is the reason I pushed through to the end. It is a ""sequel"", of sorts, to Journey to the West. The love the devs have of the source material is apparent in the beautifully crafted world, uniquely designed enemies and characters, and, most important, the masterfully told stories in the journal entries. Seriously, if you play this game: read the journal entries! They could be sold as a book on their own. If you really want to understand the story you must read the journal entries.With so much love put into the story you would think they want people to experience it. Instead the artificially difficult bosses and slightly boring combat blocks many people from fully enjoying it or even being able to see it in the first place.I understand this game is meant to be difficult but it still baffles me that the devs put so much into a story that so many people will not see or fully appreciate. It is because of this that I cannot recommend Black Myth: Wukong until a difficulty option is implemented (which will never happen). I'm sure most responses to this review will simply be: ""git gud"""
Negative,"I think normally I might give this game a ""recommend"", but I think, in the face of the overwhelmingly-one-sided positive reviews, I'll mark this ""not recommend"" just so people will actually be able to find some critiques that I haven't seen much.First off, this game reminds me a lot of two Team Ninja games ""Wo Long"" and ""Nioh 2"", leaning more towards the former than the latter in terms of execution. If you've played either of these, you will quickly feel like Wukong is a subpar imitation. The reason is that a lot of special Yaoguai powers literally don't feel like they have any use and they're really clunky to pull off consistently. Additionally, the combat is very repetitive, as the stances available only change your heavy attack and not light attacks. The most obvious outcome is that you end up sticking to just a few skills the entire way through, because other options aren't viable, while also doing the same light attack / heavy attack combo without variation. It gets boring really fast.On top of that, the basic enemies provide no challenge at all, while the bosses provide a varied amount. I think this sets up a weird expectation, as normally you'd have the basic enemies to ramp you into boss fights, but instead your first real boss fight (either the Wandering Wight or fire-blade Yaoguai) will come as a surprise in terms of damage numbers and such, particularly the Wight, which seems designed to be beaten until after you've collected a few different special powers, levels, and armour.I don't think difficulty is bad, but other games that Wukong has taken inspiration from do a much better job at ramping players into their first challenge. I also found that, weirdly, as the game progressed, the bosses got easier to deal with. I had the most difficulties with the Black Flame King, mainly because of his tendency to completely ignore the paralyze spell and do a lot of damage with quick moves that aren't telegraphed well.I also see a lot of people praising the graphics, but I genuinely think there's a fundamental lack of style and attempts to set enemies apart from the environment. The colours in the first two chapters match the basic enemies so well that they often just blend into the background in a lot of areas, and on top of that, I just personally don't think the attempt at realistic visuals works well. It kind of just looks like an unreal engine graphics demo, and the over-reliance heavy particle simulations for the elemental effects really doesn't help in that regard, not to mention hurting performance.I think games like Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and Nioh work well not because they are visually-realistic games, but because the graphical style is readable. The end result of Wukong's style is that, because of the way effects are done, the telegraphed moves are hard to figure out by watching them and instead you have to learn the timings through being punished for getting them wrong. There are also just sometimes really wonky hitboxes, which don't help.Also, some dark areas are crazy dark, with the light simulations of torches in the environment usually doing nothing to illuminate the enemies often encountered in such areas. It honestly feels less like a design-choice and more like an engine limitation. Paritcularly given the fact that turning up gamma all the way changes nothing.The story is another part that I think a lot of people will be frustrated with. I think it's cool that they are using Journey to the West as the fundament for the game, but it's clear that there's a lot of context you won't have if you are playing this as non-native Chinese. There aren't any attempts to try to fill these gaps in context and after my first 5 hours I just started skipping through as much dialogue as I could, because I had no idea what the hell was going on, lol. That being said, the Chinese voice-acting is great, I recommend switching it on with subtitles, since the English dub really has a lot of VAs hamming it in.I think I might be more negative towards this game than normal, since it was so majorly hyped and I'm a big souls-like fan. Having recently beaten my second playthrough of the new Elden Ring DLC probably also didn't help. But yeah, I don't think this game is worth the hype. As a souls-like fan, I'd give it maybe a 6/10 in its current state, due to the many problems stated above. I just think it's kind of boring after only 10 hours into it. The boss designs are cool, but the execution isn't good enough."
Negative,"I wanted to like this game but after finishing it I was left thouroughly bored. Maybe I would have enjoyed the game if it was half as long but even then I have difficulty recommending it.If you want a good action game then sure this will serve this purpose but you could also play one of the many other exceptional action games out there. It's functional and competently made but it never surprised me. Your moveset is rather limited, which prevents a great degree of player expression. But at the same time it is rarely challenging enough for aspects like the limited healing or stamina to matter. Boss designs are mostly forgettable and the ones that aren't forgettable also fail to stand out. If you aren't familiar with Chinese mythology your milage may vary, if you are nothing here will surprise you.I found exploration to be mostly frustrating. It is unclear where you can go and where you will run up against an invisible wall. This would be fine if the game was a linear corridor without sidepaths ...but it is not. There are branching paths and open areas with some hidden locations containing items, bosses and some story relevant spots. This left me spending a decent chunk of this game running up against invisible walls in case there was a secret behind a ledge. The final chapter is also guilty of this issue for a separate reason I will not get into because of spoilers. It also doest help that the game is a lot longer than it probably should have been. Especially chapter 3 drags on for way too long forcing you to fight repetitive enemies in an endless snowy forest. Graphically BMW can look stunning but that comes at the cost of performance. The game is barely playable without resolution scaling and frame generation, but they add some pretty bad artifacts that are very noticable and distracting if you are sensitive to those. I am and those artifacts along with some oversharpening and lighting issues distracted me more than the graphics impressed.I have read about 40% of Journey to the West a while back. If you haven't read the original, this story will just contain a series of seemingly random events. The game assumes that you are familiar with the original. Even while knowing certain story bits it was tough for me understanding what was happening at any moment and why.Finally, and this hurts to say. Even though there is undoubtedly a ton of work and effort in here, this game didn't have any emotional peaks for me. Even the two final bosses that were probably intentioned to make me feel something left me feeling nothing. All else would have been forgiven if BMW delivered in some moment where it all came together but for whatever reason that never happened. Your experience may differ but personally I cannot recommend spending 60-70€ on this game ."
Negative,"Game is still buggy. Interface is not optimized. To use a spell / item you need to pull up a menu to cast. Often times there is a delay when pulling up the ""menu"" to casting the spell / item. Results in a clunky experience. Terrain is also a major hindrance to any fight since it is only an obstacle for you, not for the enemies. The enemies attacks can go right through any terrain as if it wasn't there. For example the White Noble fight, his slashes can clear through any terrain regardless if it is passable or not. There are a few other fights as well where the terrain will straight up block you, yet not the boss during the animation of the attack. Still clunky, would suggest waiting for a more optimized experienceAdding onto this review after a bit more gameplay: The menu mechanic is so buggy. When you try and use the ""legendary item"" the menu will pull up, but if you're in the middle of an animation, it won't cast, just pull up, so then you're sitting there like okay cool? meanwhile a boss is chain stunning you to oblivion. So apparently the only way you can use those items is to pause, stop, don't do anything, pull up the menu, select the item, cast the item, and pray to sweet baby jesus that the boss hasn't hit you buy then. The entire casting process takes roughly 2 second or so, but in a game like this, not moving, not dodging, and being a sitting duck for 2 full full seconds is enough for you to go from 100% health to 0% health, especially with boss chain stuns (example yellow sage with his wind, swipe, kick, spear)."
Negative,"The game has enough recommendations already so I choose to put this review on the not recommended section, click bait aside I do think that the game is over rated.I'm not a souls genre player, and I rarely play action oriented games, but I'm used to play other kind of games that requires a lot of trials and errors or practice to enjoy, therefore I wasn't shocked by the perceived difficulty of the game.The game is only slightly open world with a few side quests scattered around the map, it feels mostly linear with the exception of the last chapter where suddenly the game went even more open with less linearity on how to approach the map.I think it's useless to describe the gameplay and the positives of this game, there arethousands of other reviews you can read and watch, but to me the biggest downside of the game is on the narration side.The narration is disjointed, requires you to have some level of familiarity with the original source material and requires you to have some level of understanding about Chinese socio-cultural contexts as well as Buddhism and Daoism to fully appreciate the story.Another bad thing for me is that most of the game world building lore is locked inside the game pause menu that will only get unlocked after you met or bested enemies, I think this is a staple of souls genre and as an RPG player I think it's a massive fail as it's the opposite from RPG that tries to immerse you in the world of the game, in here it became distraction and is totally unimmerisve.You can get that from YouTube that covers them, but as a stand alone game and story that is a massive fail on part of the developers.Aside from that performance wise the game continues the tradition of UE5 games that at times can offer amazing visuals but other times are not, riddled with stutters and unreasonable performance. And to make it worse somehow the game has no native HDR support, I could enable the UE5 HDR with .ini editing but it result in UI ghosting issue.Ultrawide 21:9 is natively supported with a few minor issues.Overall it's a solid first AAA Chinese game but they need to improve their story telling for their next game."
Negative,Quit and refund after 2 hours of spamming X over and over because the heavy attack was implemented so poorly and does not synchronize with combat AT ALL. Almost every light attack feels completely inconsequential. after pressing X every 3 times the monkey spins the staff pointlessly around his body doing no damage to enemy's and getting the player stuck in animations.
Negative,"As of right now, refunding this game due to a fair amount of bugs in it from the start. Also the levels don't really seem fleshed out at all. Yes, there are plenty of different decorations to the levels, but it seems like props were kind of randomly strewn about the game.I've also now had to force quit the game twice during combat in two separate instances. Seems like the game was just poorly optimized especially on graphics. I was running Medium Quality settings."
Negative,Yellow Wind King Boss is the worst boss design I;ve ever seen. You can;t see nothing and these transparent walls are blocking you from moving while you can't see nothing. Such a bad design for this boss.
Negative,"This is the first title where I actually, genuinely feel deceived by the few reviews I watched. ""It's not inspired by the soulsbornes, it's their own thing"" was uniformly propagated. Well guess what - it's another soulsborne game with some minor twists to the formula I will get into.I deliberately bought this game to finally get some reprieve from the excessive influence Fromsoft has had on the last decade of games and it's just more of the same. The challenge lies entirely in the game obfuscating what to do.  Normal enemies are a minor nuisance, bosses are the focal point. Bosses perform devastating attacks that you need to internalize - and without having seen them performed prior you either get away with a crude, unrewarding feeling victory, or you need to repeat the same thing a few times over. I've stated before I don't like this concept. I don't like games that feel they don't need to communicate their intent. I already played all Souls games there are. I did not buy into this thinking it was just more of the same.The combat model itself is, I suppose, a play on the existing model. Rather than stance breaking a la Sekiro, you generate Focus points by attacking (or charging). Focus points can be leveraged in a multitude of ways that allow you to take some initiative and deal big damage. You don't feel anywhere near as helpless as your average souls game - you intermittently decide the pace of the fight. I won't judge the quality of the twist, nor the admittedly great visuals - for I am wholly put off by being deceived into thinking this wasn't another soulsborne purchasing it. But it just is."
Negative,"Definitely DO NOT recommend this.I've grown up on a large variety of games, and this game suffers from bad pacing and design.You need a 4080 to play because I've found the input lag unbearable. From technical reviews like Digital Foundry, you *must* turn off frame generation and other settings (global illum, shadows, anti-aliasing, etc) because these cause significant input delay. Why buy a game costing $94 only to kill visual settings?? Its optimization is shockingly bad when other visually stunning games run well. Warframe, Doom Eternal, Elden Ring, etc are all examples of fast-paced gorgeous games at over 200fps on older systems. Act 1 unfortunately runs past 2 hours so by the time these issues become apparent, I can't get a refund.Key problems:1) Buggy input queues for spirits, transformation, and medicines. Sometimes I must keep tapping the button to trigger usage. Sometimes a light tap interrupts my attack combo instead of queuing up. Sometimes nothing happens after spamming repeatedly and I'm standing around while the boss is waiting in the background weirdly.2) Dodge mechanic very inconsistent. e.g. I've managed to dodge bosses OHKO attack, but after repeated experiments, it's inconsistent. The perfect dodge mechanic also doesn't trigger consistently. It feels like you inconsistently have a larger hitbox.3) Horrifically bad camera angles. Most games have an ""greasy camera slide"" algorithm to detect obstructions between the player and camera origin. It auto-moves the camera. In this game, I got stuck behind a pillar or tree or bush until I'm dead. Also, they did not notice to zoom out on the camera for mega-boss stages, so you're often looking between Wukong's legs or the earth.4) Inconsistent stage design. In act 1, the game has shrines right before main bosses. Later on, you must run back across entire stages to get back to a boss. If you die many times... Good luck.5) Toxic community. Astroturfing by China fanboys makes it impossible to get help or raise attention to the devs for fixes. No dissent is allowed. Everything else is downvoted or harrassed. You can't even make recommendations on tuning graphic settings. Even asking to tune down the difficulty traps you into needless arguments about how to get good. It's amazing how rude they are to older adults with jobs and kids, but still want to enjoy the story.Devs have not communicated on improving the game. Best to wait for actual substantial updates before making a purchase.-----------------28 Aug 2024Made it into act 4. Act 3 is easily 3 times larger than act 1 and 2, which is extremely tedious. Invisible walls everywhere. Many corners look like they can be explored, but are dead ends with no visual design to prevent us from wasting time. You can't interact with the environment unlike Genshin Impact. There's no flying. No wall climbing. Even warframe, a FREE game, I can bullet jump and wall latch. The movement here makes the monkey king look lame.Boss fights in act 3 were also lame. You dance between the boss legs, so your camera is always twitching between his legs and floor. The company calls itself Game Science, claiming to be a serious science and engineering studio... But learned no lessons by GOTY games over the past decade for such things.After unlocking most skills, the game play is also... boring. A few enemies have long attack chains, yet you must keep dodging because upgraded attacks cannot disrupt them. Thus, Dodge Fest Simulator.So you'll cheese it by charging up thrust stance right? That's even more boring. You can't spam magic as magic does NOT recharge until you get special gourd much later. So you have to save your spells and transformation by cheesing through the entire stageORbe forced tododgedodgedodgedodgebecause enemies cannot be interrupted without charged heavy attacks. So keep dodging until your focal points are enough to heavy attack. Then repeat dodging.Finally, the story?It's as if the devs have never studied their own culture or history. The reasons that I love Journey to the West, even studied asian religions and philosophies in university, was because of the deeply respectful and profound allegorical discourses absent from other civilisations. From a story writing perspective, this is important. 3000+ years of profound and rich source material exists for story writers.There's an abundance to create a beautiful cast of characters, each with deep complex portrayals that could have made the story profoundly moving. But none of that was seen.""Journey to the West"" was written at a time (circa 1592) when Buddhism had thrived in a huge sprawling dynastic empire (circa Tang Dynasty 618-907). Before Buddhism came (circa BCE 206), Shamanism, rich regional folk lore, Taoism (circa BCE 450), Confucius (circa BCE 551, Hundred Schools of Thought era),  and all manner of secular sects were already deeply rooted. ""Journey to the West"" is a rare culmination of allegorical novel writing popular over centuries. Yet, none of this was used in game.Instead, the characters are shallow and lacking depth. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are liars neglecting vows. Celestial court is full of superficial violent immortals. Humans are weak animals at their mercy. Demons are always evil because it is their birth nature. The profound essence of China's culture no longer exists in the game. Like China cities today, all that exists in the game is a beautiful facade. What is China culture?In the original novel, countless profound moments exist. The one I love is about the length of their journey in chapter 24:""你自小时走到老，老了再小，老小千番也还难。只要你见性志诚，念念回首处，即是灵山。""""You can walk from young till old, from old till young again, and even for 1000 cycles, it would still be difficult (to reach the end of your journey). But once you truly achieve the resolute perception (of wisdom), (realising that) Buddha-nature (exists) in all things, then you will have immediately arrived at Spirit Mountain (at the end of your journey).""There are countless lines of beautiful prose and poetry peppered across the original novel.Moments when loyalty and brotherhood stand in contrast to easy victories and unscrupulous tactics. Moments when you realise, for all of Wukong's fiery temper and violence, he is a person that deeply cares about doing the right thing with a deep penetrating wisdom that cuts through the commonly accepted social beliefs. Disappointingly, all of that. Gone. Lost.All we have left is a beautiful spectacle mired by aggressive toxic fanboys and a superficial court (studio)?Maybe this is the ultimate allegory; spiritual successor in the lamentation of modern China. 表面美化，盖掉缺点，心中百烂。Maybe that is the true intent of the game developers."
Negative,"The game runs bad even on high end PCs. I get solid FPS with a 3090 and i12900k but at the cost of visual clarity. It looks unplayable on console. They haven't optimized it, they have covered up the poor performance and quality with adaptive resolutions and extremely intense motion blur. If you are not playing the game yourself this isn't as noticeable, but if you play with motion blur off or on you'll quickly realise how bad the game looks. In the first cutscene, everything is extremely grainy. When you transform and scout the mountain, that is not a developer choice to limit your vision. It's literally the game trying to hide how terrible it looks when there is many assets on screen with motion blur. The adaptive scaling being necessary means that even if you have solid FPS, timings on dodges will still change slightly. It's extremely noticeable when you get input delay if you are going for perfect dodges. I think people are over hyped for this game, especially when it comes to the visuals. They look great on stream watching someone else play, but terrible when you play yourself.If you're not already set on this game, you are better off saving your money until you find out if they'll actually try to optimize it, instead of giving us worse resolutions and farting in our eyes with motion blur in an AAA title."
Negative,"I honestly don't know if i can recommend this game to anyone except die hard fans of the original story. Sadly the only thing positive i can say about the game is that it is BREATHTAKING to look at, good GOD they did such a good job with it. Other than that I have many problems with the game.Let's start with the biggest sin of the game imo the story (or lack there of). As someone who has not read the journey to the west story and only has a very basic knowledge of the story i am so confused as to what is going on. I'm half way through chapter 2 and the only thing i can say about the story is that I am a monkey and i have bonked many things because the game said so. It seems like the developers just expect everyone to have read the story and understand whats going on.Next sin the combat. First i'd like to say that the actual combat feels great, nothing groundbreaking but fun. My biggest issue is the amount of bosses and the miniscual amount of damage you do to them. In the first chapter you fight 5 or 6 bosses, most of them happen one right after another. Even when i upgraded my weapons I tickled most of the bosses i fought while they took out a quarter of my health with one hit. This game obviously takes inspiration from god of war and jedi survivors however the one thing they didn't incorporate from those games is a difficulty option. If they wanted to make it more of a souls like game, they should've allowed for greater weapon customization to compensate for the minuscule amount of damage your base weapon does. Instead they give you a stick and expect you to just keep bonking the bosses until they stop moving. While I do acknowledge this can be fun for some people, I found it infuriating. Another big issue with some of the fights is the camera, at the end of chapter 1 you fight a random bear dude who loves to dash from one end of the arena to the other. While on paper this sounds fun, in execution the camera constantly jumping everywhere makes it hard to read the bosses movements and dodge accordingly. Another aspect of the combat that infuriates me is the skills. While yes the skills your given are really cool, they aren't as big of a help as you would think. Take for instance the freeze skill. Every time i used it, it was a guessing game for how long it would last. Sometimes it would last for 10 seconds and other times it would last for a single second, there were even times it didn't work period. The skills also use your ""mana"" however you are given no way of recovering your mana other than using rest points. So once your mana runs out, these skills which are vital to the gameplay are no longer available to you and you're back to using your stick which does no damage. The last sin I want to talk about is level design. While yes the maps are GORGEOUS and exploration is highly encouraged, the problem lies in the absurd amount of invisible walls throughout some of the maps. Every time i saw what looked like a path i could explore i was stopped by an invisible wall. Exploring parts of the map i was allowed to explore also wasn't that rewarding, I often found myself walking in circles because the path you were supposed to follow wasn't made clear and most of the ""rewards"" you find are either in game currency or another boss which rewards you with a lackluster skill.Overall if you're that desperate for a god of war/jedi survivor type game go ahead and play this. But be warned this game isn't as polished as those games are. If you want to experience the journey to the west story DO NOT play this game, nothing is explained and you'll probably just end up as confused as i am."
Negative,"Your enjoyment of this game heavily relies on your knowledge of the source material or tolerance for soulslike games. I meet neither requirement so for a majority of the 50h I played, I did not have a good time. I was expecting a retelling of the Journey in game format, instead it's an OC sequel to a novel I never read and doesn't even progress the story all that much beyond what is already known.Story wise you meet and fight back to back bosses nearly constantly with no context as to why they want you dead and they don't even say anything besides ""En garde!"" before assaulting you.Gameplay is decent enough to keep you engaged throughout but again the boss rush will sour your playthrough as many of these bosses heavily rely on cheap gimmicks to trip you up during fights like delayed attacks, phase changes where they float in the air for almost a full minute or grabs that instantly shreds half of your HP.The worst offender was Chapter 3, being the longest and a genuine chore to get through as it was the length of both previous chapters combined in total and the final boss had two phase transitions that are cutscenes where you take unavoidable half HP damage and a gold form where he's immune to your basic attacks. While fighting him and searching for tips online I also found out that every boss can input read you charging up for a heavy attack and will back away or dash into you when you start doing so.. Absolutely horrendous and unfair design imo but little irritating tricks like these exist in all of the others to artificially inflate difficulty and force you to die again and again until you ""get good"" like the average soulslike masochist would say.I forced myself to the end waiting to see how long it takes to get good and to my surprise it did, near the end. The secret final boss as well as the final boss himself were beautifully crafted and fairly challenging without relying on the previous gimmicks other bosses would pull. Unfortunately this came at around 40h in my playthrough.In the end I do regret getting roped into the hype train and paying full price for this. I think I'd have been happier with a 30€ price tag a couple months down the line. This is not the end all be all of gaming some people are acting like it is. It just happens to be a decent 7/10 game not plagued by the usual forced agendas we're tired of hearing about.As stated in the beginning, you can disregard this review if you read and enjoy the novel and are a fan of Soulslikes because this absolutely is one despite people trying to trick newcomers into believing it's not."
Negative,"TL;DR: - This game is a very mixed bag, but in it's most important parts it's extremely good, the gameplay.- Still overpriced, I don't recommend playing more than $30, or if you really want it badly $40 for it.COMBAT: - VERY FUCKING GOOD and has a lot of depth, plenty of skill options, abilities and combos. Extremely fun and has a lot of possible playstyles.VISUALS: - STUNNINGBOSS FIGHTS: - At first they were very average and forgettable, but as story progressed they got better and better, especially the last 2 chapters. Some bosses have gimmicks which involve you completing a side quest to remove the gimmick and make the boss easier which is nice, but there's some flaws with certain boss fights which are unacceptable.- There's a certain boss fight where the boss jumps around the arena, he can jump behind A FUCKING INVISIBLE WALL where you cannot reach him to attack and he attacks you from there. There is 0 indication that this area is cut off, it's a flat surface! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!- Top takes bottom, bottom takes top boss fight had a glitch where after you take one out the other becomes completely invulnerable. Luckily it only happened once and it's an easy and optional boss fight. This as well no matter how big the studio is isn't allowed to happen. Could've been potentially game breaking.- I absolutely despise gank boss fights but somehow this game made them work, the auto switch from boss to boss to indicate which attack is coming next and the lack of overlapping attacks actually made them enjoyable. As a souls veteran, grabbing all achievements in all souls and a lot of souls likes, with 550h in Elden Ring alone I have to say that FromSoftware could learn a thing or two when it comes to gank boss fights from this game.-The game has a really good amount of detail, especially when it comes to the final boss, specific animations for when the boss counters you etc. which I will not touch upon because of spoilers.STORY: Starts off really slow, it feels like a simple boss rush game for the first 2 chapters, but after that you meet some characters and the story starts unfolding, there's not too much complexity in it, but it's very enjoyable and certain characters are charming and make you care for them which is how it's supposed to be.INVISIBLE WALLS: - HORRID invisible walls to the point where you can't jump over a slight ledge from a set of stairs to the other playable area. They make all zones smaller by a solid 1-2m.- They're very immersion breaking especially when you consider the fact that the visuals are literally the same for the areas you can jump to and the areas you cannot. Should've put some boulders or stones at least, not just an invisible wall on a flat area.EXPLORATION: - Feels like a sin to have 0 exploration and parkour sections with a main character that has such good mobility and jumping. He's a literal monkey.- So many times I've tried to jump to an interesting section that looks like it leads somewhere to be greeted by an invisible wall. Extremely linear pathways with some loops and very useless shortcuts.- Even though it opens up a lot more after chapter 2 there's still not too much to explore, there's secrets scattered around and really good hidden areas, but the invisible walls are way too immersion breaking and restrictive. It will literally happen where you can jump to an area, but in another section the same jumpable area is cut off by a hidden wall.- The teleportation system is badly designed, there's no clear order to it i.e. it doesn't list the points of unlock nor geographical order and the visual markers that are supposed to show you the area you're teleporting to are poorly chosen, just bland rocks mostly.CAMERA: Pretty bad camera tracking, it's a bossfight in itself, in some cases it tracks an ""ultimate attack"" of a boss where he spawns something instead of keeping the lock on the boss, this moves the camera directly into the bosses body and prevents you from seeing the attack. Can't give it too much flak for this because most games with the similar style struggle with the same problem.CONCLUSION: Definitely a really good game, but I think it's overpriced. If you really want it pay $40 for it, if not wait for a discount and get it for $30 or less. I cannot recommend it as of right now because of the invisible wall in the middle of a boss fight."
Negative,"For all the hype around this game...It isn't all that great...It's actually kinda crazy how much bias there seems to be in the reviews and the invisible walls are cancerous. This is a problem that's been solved for decades now. I know it's their first game, but I'm sure it's not the first game they've played. How they could test this and just think it was okay as is, is absurd to me. When I see a 96% review score on Steam, this is NOT what I'm expecting to play. Goes to show just how much bias reviews can have especially when it's it's a huge region of people who've really been wanting a break out success game. And the game still is pretty decent, but I personally wouldn't put it anywhere near the 96% score it's got on Steam. It's a solid 6-7.And if you have a lower end GPU the score drops even further. First 2 chapters won't be much of an issue but upon hitting the 3rd, the already shakey FPS drops further. The problem isn't even the FPS because at times it can be great, it's the timing. Whenever it's having issues it stutters along and makes the overall movement feel terrible. I won't be refunding it YET, until I see what the first patch will look like. Hoping for some decent performance improvements and for something to be done about the horrid invisible wall situation. I love exploring, but I DO NOT like exploring when it means just dry humping everything hoping it's an actual path. For now I'm already at my 2 hour limit so won't be playing it at all until the patch and only if it has something of value. Otherwise refund pile it goes."
Negative,"I have wrote exactly one review in my 14 or so years of using steam, and it's this review right now.I will organize this into things I liked and things I didn't like, and at the end my overall score (x/10).DISCLAIMER: This is my personal experience with the game and my thoughts. I also made it to the end of chapter 4 before feeling like I wanted to write this review. I do not care if 70 billion people think this is GOTY material. If you love the game, that's honestly great. There are a sincere lack of new, well made, and fun ""AAA"" games, and if you can find one that you like, I'm genuinely happy for you.Also, since I did not make it all the way through the game, I won't be making a judgement on the boss mechanics, hitboxs, etc. I know quite a few people had problems with that, but I did not encounter a similar problem.-----------------------------------------WHAT I LIKED:SETTING: There aren't that many games that cover Chinese mythology in detail, or at least not many that get as much media coverage as this game did. It's highly refreshing to see something other than high European fantasy (even though I'm a sucker for em). I haven't read Journey to the West or watched/listened to any media about it, but this game has made me more curious of the actual story and of Chinese mythology in general.GRAPHICS: Holy moly, this game is pretty. Even before the boss designs, the levels look amazing. There is a slight hiccup with each level looking a bit monochromatic (sand, sand, and more sand), but the vistas and key areas all follow their own theme, which matches the bosses and make them feel lived in by the actual creatures that you encounter. Additionally, the boss designs are all top tier. No real problems with the bosses on my end from a graphical standpoint. Animations, art design, and effects all look epic and make you feel pretty small at times, which is what I'm assuming they were going for. And of course all the later game armor sets and staves were sick as heck. (Too bad you can't get some staves until NG+)INTERFACE: Sleek and non-intrusive. All the things you can ask for. There was a learning curve to using the RT on the controller to access your other abilities, but once I got used to it, I was comboing my spirits and transformation with ease and was a highlight to the combat.-----------------------------------------WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:INVISIBLE WALLS: Yeah yeah, I know. I'm not going to wax poetic about the insurmountably liberal use of invisible walls and their intrusive and odd placements. However, there is one other huge gripe that I want to point out, and that is their use in boss arenas. If the boss can jump through the invisible wall and attack me through it. Sorry, that is just bad design. The last boss of chapter 2 was honestly one of my least favorite solely because of this. Thankfully, I didn't encounter it again on any other boss, and I don't know if it even happens again to my knowledge. But yeah, invisible wall bad.STORYTELLING: The translations for this game were challenging to understand, and I really had no idea of what was going on in the story. I understand that that might be due to the nature of how the original story is told. I also know that Game Science made a lot of changes to the story. So I'm not sure how true it is to the original or how that could affect the game's storytelling. Making adjustments to the translations to make it more understandable for players who haven't experienced this story before or this type of mythology and would have gone a long way .PERFORMANCE: The game is pretty, but man, they really turned the dial up too much some times. The frame drops in this game make certain bosses unplayable at times due to the gobsmacking amount of particle effects. Fighting any of the Loongs with their lightning might as well be actual lightning striking my computer, which is a shame since they are some of the cooler fights in the game. This also wasn't isolated to just one chapter, almost all the chapters I played through had some sort of performance issue at various points. I have no problem fighting Consort Radahn with his five million light particles or the Divine Beast with their various storm effects in Elden Ring, but god forbid I get lightning dragons or sand in this game.ENEMIES: This is an issue I had with Sekiro on my second and third playthrough. The regular joe-blow enemies and their frequency just prove to be an annoyance. They aren't particularly challenging or interesting and just serve to lengthen the play time. In a boss rush game with no other gameplay mechanics (i.e platforming, puzzle solving, exploration, etc) I do not care about anything else other than the bosses/story/combat. It would be a bit different if there was some diversity to the combat or gameplay, but that is a topic for later.COMBAT: And by later, I mean now. This one is going to be pretty lengthy since this is the driving point of the game, and I will split this up among a few key pain points of the combat.Animations: Speaking of animations, what in tarnation is going on with the animation locking? I don't know if this is actually what people mean by ""animation locking"", but it is supremely annoying not being able to perform combat actions until full animations have been performed. Performing magic roots you in place and you must perform the entire character animation, even if the spell has already finished casting e.g freeze spell. Dodge rolls do not cancel animations like other action RPGS, which makes the combat feel very clunky. It also forces you into one or two specific ways to play the game.Combat Diversity: Or lack thereof. The combat boils down to pretty much ""save focus for big hit"". There isn't a consistent way to CC the bosses, since some can't actually be knocked down or stunned. This makes the combat loop devolve into one-two light attacks until you have focus for a fully charged heavy. There is a skill that doesn't interrupt your light combo by dodge rolling. However, most of the bosses have 3-7 attack combos that time out that particular parameter. And yes, there are the ""varied combos"". I'll talk about those in detail later, but those have their own quirks that interrupt the flow combat substantially. Stagger: I've mentioned stagger previously, and it is honestly one of the main reasons I stopped playing for now. Bosses staggering me or knocking me down is no big deal. I expect these much more powerful enemies to knock me on my ass. However, when every regular enemy can stagger me out of my combos while I'm flying around with my staff, but I can only stagger them once or twice during a light combo, that just removes the fun. There a stat called tenacity in the game, but you don't get armor for it until way later. Just let me do cool stuff man.Varied Combos: I'm not going to sugar coat this. These are not good. I had such high hopes for the combat in general because of these, but I got majorly disappointed. These are just worse versions of the charged heavy attacks of their respective stances. They have a long recovery time after performing them that you end up getting hit 99% of the time after using them. The healing is cool, but worse than just using the bo staff that heals on 3 focus heavy attacks. And the so called ""counters"" can't be performed on the fly and have the narrowest window I've seen for a ""counter/parry"". If you want to parry, just use rock solid.There's more I'd like to write down, but I'm running out of room. These are the major points, good and bad, from my experience. TLDR: The game looks amazing, and is set in a woefully underappreciated mythology. However, the combat sucks a lot of fun from the game along with major performance issues. Maybe I was expecting too much or this wasn't really what I was looking for in an action RPG. Either way 6/10 for me and a no to recommend since it costs $60."
Negative,"I literally found myself saying out loud ""I don't think this is a fun game"". Immediately it doesn't feel rewarding in either fighting or game progression. It's just mini-bosses with hardly any mobs between them, leaving most of the game play being boss fights that you die over and over to until you figure out their moves. To make it worse, the fighting itself just doesn't feel good. For a game that is supposed to reward technical game play, you are locked out of dodging often with attack animations and jumps don't avoid AOE boss attacks, leading to boring run away and wait game play."
Negative,"Because of Denuvo and the rather poor optimisation, I cannot recommend this game. It is fun though and if you have a really recent rig I guess it's a pass"
Negative,Don't you love one-shoting grab arracks with tracking?
Negative,"this might be a game. Cant tell tho, wont start"
Negative,Game runs like shit. Stutters all over the place. Stay away from unreal engine games they always stutter. PC spec: RTX 4070ti INTEL 13600KF CPU32GB RAM 2TB SSD 7200MB/s READ
Negative,"Gameplay is very basic. It's like a bad version of god of war, then made even worse by adding a pointless stamina mechanic.If you don't play a lot of action games you will probably think it's fun. It IS one of the most beautiful games I've played, with a very cool art style. But if I have to do that same light attack combo one more time I'm going to throw up, so I can't recommend this game to action game fans."
Negative,"Update: I am standing by my 7/10 ratingA good game, but-1 for incompleteness - this game is objectively not finished.-1 for invisible wall/no map - gameplay issue-1 for story and MC - again, the story arc is incomplete - not the open ending but the story itself, and the complain about MC below still stands7/10Two major flaws:1. Gameplay: Air wall everywhere and no map, which makes exploration quite painful2. Character: the main character is too dull to be WuKong/the Monkey King. Whatever the backstory is, he is still a monkey, right? It's disappointing to have a Wukong with no jokes, no trash talks, no scratching head or butt every once in a while, basically no emotion and no sound. There are not even simple battle cries.两个主要缺陷：1. 游戏玩法：到处都是空气墙，没有地图，这使得探索变得相当痛苦2. 角色：主角作为孙悟空/齐天大圣来说太乏味了。不管背景故事如何，他毕竟还是只猴子，对吧？没有俏皮话，不说垃圾话，不抓耳挠腮...总而言之:没有灵性与其说是天命人不如说是打工工具人的猴子太无趣了。甚至连简单的看招 定 变 吃俺一棍 都没有, 呆若木鸡.哦对了主角还会没事儿打坐玩 真的太出戏了你这天命人是金蝉子转世吧..."
Negative,"Its a God of War-SW Jedi hybrid but the story is not that good as far as i played it almost fell asleep twice. Nearly 4 hours in and i have no idea who Wukong is and what's his deal and who we are actually fighting and why we are fighting them. Combat is a bit Meh for me.No tutorials so u have to figure out everything on your own. The only good thing about it, is that its not woke and the graphics are pretty good.My opinion is that the game doesnt deserve so many good review and its all about the hype in the gaming community."
Negative,"First of all, I meet the required stats for this game, but it silll has some serious lag issues especially in the cutscenes. The start of the game and the first couple of bosses are quite easy and the game is kinda boring, then it gets better with challenging bosses, and then they remove all the fun by having easy bosses with cheap tricks like unavoidable damage or restricting your movements to make it harder just for the sake of it. Some bosses even hide behind invisible walls, you cant attack them while they are attacking you, its ridicolous. The hitboxes also are far from perfect with some bosses, sometimes you are right in front of them but you are hitting air with 90percent of attacks, like wtf.. The leveldesign is just awful in most cases because of the invisible walls everywhere, its basically a corridor to the next boss. I thought I am a monkey, why can I not climb? But seriously, I get that they wanted to make the game more linear, so exploration is not the biggest part of this game, but besides the mainpath there are no indications on where you can and cannot go. You have to manually walk up to areas that look like you can go there only to find an invisible wall, and if your movements are haevily restricted like that it just discourages you from even trying to explore. I found some hidden areas only by accident. Another thing that I didnt understand is why they included the jump button when Wukong also jumps just by walking at a jumpable object, and then the jump is not really usable in combat, you can dodge like 3 attacks in the whole game by jumping as far as I know, I got tired trying to use jump because its just not really a tool to dodge I guess. The combat is fun for an hour at a time, but since the levels are so uninteresting and repetitive with all the temples and buddha statues and the game also has some serious lag issues during the cutscenes so you are better off skipping them all, its just not a game I would recommend to anyone for that price tag."
Negative,"I got this game for free with the purchase of a graphics card, and honestly, I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it. It's an ok game and a negative review feels a little harsh, but there's no option for a mixed review which is what I would have given.Chapters 1 and 2 are pretty good, I was really enjoying my time with the game in the early stages. I'm now on chapter 6 and would say since chapter 3, the game has started to feel like a slog at times and the lack of polish really starts to show. I'm finding I'm ready to stop playing not long after I've started, whereas at the beginning I struggled to stop playing.Boss fights are really all there is to the game, but a lot of mid-late game bosses are just straight up not fun to fight, with long drawn out combos, hard to avoid grab attacks that take off at least 30% of your HP but usually more, and very few openings. Some require special items to fight (with no indication that you should seek these items out and use them), otherwise the fight is much more difficult and punishing against you to the point where the fight just feels cheap and gimmicky. Some have awful hitboxes and sometimes don't take damage from special attacks, charged attacks or even light attacks when they definitely should have. Getting your focus to a level 4 charge then having the charged attack miss even though it visibly connected is so frustrating.The rock solid spell feels pretty useless late game, which is a shame as earlier on it was very fun to use. I don't think I've seen a single boss since the start of chapter 4 even react to me blocking their attack with it. Either I get thrown back and take no damage, or I block the attack and take damage anyway. The final boss of chapter 4 actually punishes you with a grab attack if you use it. The alternative seems to be using cloud step to go invisible and go stand in a corner until the boss has finished their 10 hit combo, which isn't fun at all for me.Overall, an ok game, but overhyped and not as good as many of the games it's compared to."
Negative,"I was switching between proton profiles and Denuvo DRM displays a message that states: ""Currently your game purchase cannot be re-validated successfully, please wait 24 hours and try again.""  What do you mean I can't play the game I just purchase?"
Negative,Not Game of the Year. Meow.
Negative,"Over-hyped and over-praised.The best part about the game wasn't in the gameplay or graphics, but the beautiful animated sequences and art murals at the end of each chapter."
Negative,"I dont know why people hype the combat. Ghost of Tshushima did the stance thing much better because there was a purpose to switch stances, in this game there is no reason to switch a single time. Weapons are all the same, one is switching the light attacks of thrust stance thats it. Therefor combat is allways the same, no itemisation  at all. Bosses are good and fun which is the only good thing in the game! Story is ok at best. The graphic is very oversharpened and other games did it much better like Horizon Forbbiden West. For me the gameplay is most important and its objectivly not good"
Negative,"First game I ever pre-purchased. Do not regret it, but this is not a game, it's a chore.Graphics is amazing, performance and tuning is outstanding. I love the story, especially how the studio did not try to modify or add any modern crap.Maybe it's only me, maybe I suck, but after 60 h in game, with every new boss my feeling is 'not this again'.I love all NIOH games. Spend over 1000 h playing NIOH on the highest levels. Every new spell, every new skill felt powerful. Every combo was exact and I felt always in control of all my moves. Not in this game.The negative part is related to game play and design decisions- After 55 hours into play, i learned, that certain combos are not possible with my X-box controller setup. Hat to switch to another setup and relearn everything. Try to hold Y, at the same time press X to execute perfect dodge, good luck with that. Miss the full controller configuration capability of Dragon Dogma 2.- Overall bad progress balancing. After playing for many hours you should get a feeling of being rewarded for all the struggle. A feeling of becoming more powerful and stay ahead of most potent enemies. Not in this game. You are always struggling and the rewards feel useless. Even after fighting for 1 - 2 hours and killing a difficult boss, I don't get satisfaction out of it.- In the combat, your combos only work if your exactly match your actions with those of your enemy. If you miss, your combo break and  you are f*cked. - Missing map, not linear game play. You miss a place on the map, you my miss an essential trader of item. Even if you find all the upgrade items, every boss fight is a chore and with out it becomes a nightmare.- Many bosses have one particular hard attack, that is very hard to dodge. Every new try takes you minutes of hard fighting and than you get instantly finished in one strike. It sucks.- Many skills you pick from the three have no noticeable effect. Insufficient balancing.Overall this game feels like trying to drill a hole in wall using a tooth brush."
Negative,"its terrrible. At least if you like gameplay over visuals. Here are some of the things that makes it a low tier DS clone:Game is mostly a boss rush but fighting the bosses arent fun. very little downtime between bosses. Mostly just spam dodge since they have very bad tells and 0-frame attacks.the combat is floaty where dodges arent the same. 1. is good, second is okay i think and then the 3rd have a delay between getting to dodge again.It has both immortal weapons from nioh and an immobalize spell you can use on bosses, so most of the time you are just waiting for that to come back online. You have light and heavy attacks but some light attacks take muuuch longer to finish so you have to try and just use light attack 2 time and then dodge to reset combo. Also at a boss that has an ability that hits a bigger area than the visual indicate and can go invulvuable and if in a bad part of the arena attacks faster than intended so you cant even dodge spam to avoid dmg.furthermore took an ability that should let me negate incomming dmg if i heavy strike combo but that dosent seem to work.Many of the bosses also have that elden ring boss design where they stop mid swing and then hit with all the momentum as if they dident stop.Camera tracking is shit, a lot of the time the boss is only half visible on the side of the screen after dodging attack past thenso with all these tings i would consider bad. there isent anything good except its mytholigy and boss visuals that are new."
Negative,"I ended up refunding. There's clearly a lot of care put into the game, but neither the setting nor the gameplay ended up appealing to me.The controls feel just slightly off. As if its not quite as responsive as I would like. It feels like a hybridization of God of War and Elden Ring, but isn't as tight as either. I feel like it would have better if it had chosen one, rather than trying to merge them. Visually, however, it is incredibly appealing. But I want a bit more than that, and what I experienced in the time before the Refund window would have expired, just didn't sell me on the gameplay."
Negative,"It almost pains me to not recommend Black Myth, because I grew up idolizing Sun Wukong and watching multiple TV adaptations of Journey to the West. I've always wanted more video games to feature the Xi You Ji mythos, and I'm super happy that the larger gaming community has apparently taken a liking to this game. That being said, I could barely stomach playing it.Mechanically, Black Myth is a looser, floatier version of God of War or Dark Souls. Movement is nice and fluid, combat lacks feedback, and the skill tree.... well, it exists. There's some surface-level incorporation of the lore, like parrying being Wukong's ""stone skin"" ability, but the mechanics otherwise feel derivative. I would have liked to see more thoughtfully-considered mechanics that tie into the mythos. I'm also not a fan of spending so much time in the menus for necessary upgrades—parsing tons of info just to make non-decisions is exhausting.Bosses are pretty challenging. Everything comes together in the boss fights, where you have to learn how they move and respond to their attacks. Your first attempt at most bosses will surprise you and likely kill you. You can make your responses easier to execute and your reward for the correct response (i.e. damage you deal) higher through using various upgrades in the menus. This isn’t anything groundbreaking, and there are tons of similar games that better communicate when attacks will land, how various decisions will affect future encounters, and what you need to improve on as a player.Black Myth excels aesthetically, full stop. This is where the game really shines because it isn't outright beaten by its genre peers. It’s stunning, capturing the vibes of Journey to the West with remarkable authenticity. The intro voice acting in Mandarin is genuine as fuck, and the game’s cloudy fog effects, distinctly Chinese landscapes, and animations (for the most part) are impressive. However, it often feels like the game was designed to be seen more than played. For example, despite the game's linearity and extremely limited exploration options, I frequently found myself lost and/or halted by invisible walls blocking seemingly walkable paths.  The frame pacing is also inconsistent—even after reducing the settings to maintain a steady 60 fps at 1080p, the game still suffers from random stuttering. So while the visuals are praiseworthy, only players with beefy rigs can fully appreciate them.As someone who thinks Wukong is the coolest dude around and who desperately wishes more video games featured Journey to the West, I’m happy that Black Myth exists. But I wish it did more to stand out. I wish it wasn’t just a game I’d already played dozens of times in better forms."
Negative,"This game was bit of a let down after seeing a lot of hype. The combat feels like a sloppy version of a 'souls like' with weird hit boxes and extremely limited options on how you wish to fight. The game is very linear pushing you from one boss to another, you fight each one with a loadout the game wants you to have, there is no variety, there is no choice beyond the talents. You pickup the minimal items between bosses and that's it. It becomes a stale boss grind extremely quickly with very little else to it. Boss -> few npcs, 2/3 items on ground - > Boss -> few npcs, 2/3 items on ground - > Boss etc, repeat for entire game. What I enjoy in souls games is that you can go to X location for this weapon and Y location for this armour to make a build fun, you can grind stats to do specific things, wield specific items, whereas wukong has none of this.The game looks nice, the graphics are very good but performance is not brilliant with quite a few areas causing stuttering or lag however this type of issue will likely be patched out in the future so i don't give that much weight in my overall opinion. I would give this game maybe a 6/10, it was fun for a few hours but got stale very quickly even when progressing rapidly through bosses. I haven't felt compelled to go back and play more at any point, the game hasn't drawn me in at all, in fact thinking about the cost it feels very meh for what i paid. If you enjoy an endless boss spam action game this will be your cup of tea, if you want something with a bit more depth and variety i think you will be disappointed"
Negative,"It's visually stunning, but the novelty wore off quickly for me and became incredibly boring and unfun around half way in (made it to chapter 4).It's basically just an endless corridor of boss fights, many are so difficult that it takes 10 to 30 tries to beat them, there's no difficulty setting in the game, eventually I just loathed the next boss fight, and there is very little else to do other than boss fights.I don't think it deservers a stark ""no"", I would say buy the game at a heavy discount unless you LOVE boss fights and find the Chinese mythology interesting (with respect, I don't)"
Negative,"Visually incredible but the gameplay is extremely inconsistent. The level design is pretty much a non-factor, the landscapes are beautiful but gameplay wise, they're just settings to whale of lesser yaoguai. Many of said lesser yaoguai are immense damage sponges which means taking them out is more of a chore than I'd prefer. This doesn't make them harder to deal with, mind you, they're almost all trivially easy to stunlock when you get them one on one which is 90%+ of your encounters with them. At its worst the level design devolved into major jank, with thin plans to walk across while trying to deflect arrows, an action which would sometimes just send you falling into the abyss. Many areas looked accessible in the world but upon closer inspection were blocked off by a low rock that the monkey king should be able to jump over with ease. In general the levels' visual layout constantly remind you that you're in a game world. Since you aren't really here for the levels, you'd hope that either the narrative or the bosses would be the real show stoppers. The narrative didn't really do it for me. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special, even by game standards, and it was marred by what I can only imagine was a mediocre translation. The bosses were more of a mixed bag. All were visually captivating, some were mechanically interesting, and some were horrible. In general the combat is a little too floaty, giving too little visual and auditory feedback on dealing or receiving damage to be truly satisfying. I've seen this game sold as somewhere between a Dark Souls and a God of War on the gameplay style and I can see that, but it lacks the visceral feel of the combat in either series and thus finds itself inferior to both. The worst boss fight I completed before giving up was the dragon in the third area, which constantly floats just high enough that your attacks have maybe a 60% chance of landing. It's not a difficult fight and I cleared it on my second try but it feels more like a fight against janky design than the challenging foe the dragons design should represent. Ultimately the only thing that really impressed me here was the visuals."
Negative,"You constatly die, you constantly dash. There is no map. It's not fun. At least looks good."
Negative,No key rebinding? come on.
Negative,"My review page.  Follow me on twitch![www.twitch.tv]Do be aware that the majority of the reviews for Wukong are from China, even those in English, and as such this review will probably trigger some. We live in a time where singleplayer games without any kind of bs such as pandering to the far left, microtransactions, and similar trash are rare, so rare that whenever a pure singleplayer game with a pretty hefty budget focuses on the right things releases, gamers will instantly love it and ignore all its faults. Black Myth Wukong is one of those games. I am not one of those gamers. Black Myth Wukong is an extremely average action-adventure game that heavily takes inspiration from games of its genre while not excelling at anything in particular. 👍 The good parts:+Certain boss fights are pretty well-designed👎The bad parts:-One of the worst level designs I've ever encountered-Outside of boss fights, there is nothing good-Incredibly boring atmosphereThe story is based on Journey to the West which is a very famous fictional novel in China. It's sadly not a very direct story, similar to God of War, but instead, they decided to go the obtuse route which makes it even worse as the novel itself was already incredibly difficult to follow. Black Myth Wukong's story is more of a giant proverb that heavily focuses on the metaphorical morality of life which felt at odds with itself because, at certain times, it feels like it wanted to be a normal story, similar to God of War or any western media, but then decides to forget it and it starts going into nonstop proverbial dialogues irrelevant to the main story, if we can even call it a story. This is more evident as each chapter has unique cinematics, which were very cool designed, that have a moral at the end, for example, there was this story where a guy finds a wounded fox in the mountains, takes it home to take care of it, it transforms into a beautiful woman and their life begins, however at the end, the woman was actually a demon and she devours his family, but then he wakes up back at the cabin. Realizing the dream was a sign, he kills the fox. These small cinematics were great and the game would've benefited more if they relied on them throughout the chapters, for example being part of the guy's story and the final boss would be the fox demon. Sadly as it is, the story was just average, you have to collect artifacts to become the chosen one, the end. Perhaps for people living in China, it might be more nostalgic than anything else. Story rating: 6.5/10Wukong's gameplay isn't exactly fresh or new and sadly it didn't do anything good or fun up until the end. It copies core mechanics from God of War, Jedi Survivor, and From Software games and mixes them, a jack of all trades master of none. You spam attacks at bosses with tons of health, dodge a few times and that is it. Out of the ""hundreds"" of bosses it has, I can count on one hand the ones that may have required some thinking or learning their attack patterns. A lot of people were dismissive of calling the game a boss rush, however, they are factually wrong because for starters, outside of boss fights, there is absolutely nothing good about the gameplay. The smaller enemies are some of the most boring and uninteresting-designed enemies you've ever faced and are just there to pad the game for no reason. The looting and finding things aspect is average, as most of the good stuff drops from bosses. Sadly since each boss has more and more HP, you're forced to explore and look for mats to increase your damage output else you'll be spending an hour taking down their health. I've never felt a sense of awe or ""wow look at this epic thing I found"" once in the entire game, though I have to give them credit for turning a simple game into a weak RPG as an afterthought. Yes, the game has skill points as you'd expect, and yes most of them are useless.Moving on from the mid aspects of the game, the boss fights is what most people are in for. I say boss fights, but I consider them the average enemy in this game and only a few are actual boss fights. These boss fights are average towards ok. You'll never face anything as terrifying as the likes of Souls games or as amazingly cinematic as the likes of God of War games. To make matters worse, they're all HP sponges, and outside of using a few skills and dodging you're just hitting a wall with your stick. Gameplay rating: 7/10Overall the audio design is decent, I played it with Chinese voice acting and I had no problems with it at all, they all performed quite well. The soundtrack is pretty good, nothing really memorable, but it does a decent job of making the boss fights less boring. As for the rest of the sound effects, nothing really good or bad to say about them. I never felt the environments being alive which would be a minus, but then again, I have a lot of negative things to say about the atmosphere of the game below. Audio rating: 7.5/10The game uses Unreal Engine 5 and as such expect horrible performance if you don't use DLSS or frame generation, expect heavy stutters when the game loads new assets such as boss skills. The worst offenders are the atmosphere and level design. For starters, the game as I mentioned is based on a fantastic fictional novel Journey to the West. If you've seen movies based on it, you might remember some very nice locations and architectural designs. The game has none of that. Instead, you'll be exploring forests and caves that you've seen a million times or outside of your house with a few Buddhist statues and temples copy-pasted for lore reasons. I'm not even joking, watch a walkthrough, that's all you'll ever be in, forests, whether it's dead ones, lush ones, or snowy ones. The second worst offender is the level design. It makes absolutely no sense. If you've played any Dark Souls game you'll know each road you take is masterfully inter-connected to one another, the whole map is a giant playground. Wukong has its main zones split by loadings so they're not connected to one or the other. Furthermore, each zone has multiple paths that lead to nowhere or minibosses making exploration incredibly tedious. The last offender is the input, specifically the reading of it. It's incredibly delayed, certain skills take forever for Wukong to use, for example, you'll have to spam drinks in order for him to actually start drinking them and the same goes for the skills. To make matters worse, certain skills take forever to cast and enemies just attack non-stop which will cancel your skills and put them on cooldown. Sometimes they bugged. It's a mess. Most people will look at the game and say ""Wow look at those graphics, look at those tree leaves flying around you"" and that's all just generic UE5 assets. Everything about the environments felt soulless, like someone generated using ""AI"". Compared to Dark Souls, a game that came out decades ago which on a technical level wasn't that great, Wukong looks incredibly uninspired and would've benefited more if they focused on art rather than pretty trees. Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 5/10I don't think anyones going to even notice this review, since 90% of the reviews are just blindly praising the game and ignoring its faults, but I advise against purchasing it at full price."
Negative,Keeps ignoring button inputs
Negative,My both arms are amputated and i play with feets. I cant change controls for gamepad which are only for healthly humans. Using Steam input is barely possible with feets. Realy disappointing. Refunded.
Negative,"Very annoying take on the soulslike genre. The main technique bosses have against you is random bullet time, which gets very old in the first 30 minutes in to the game. The invisible walls break the freedom of movement and makes the game feel very narrow.Weapons and armor have next to zero variation. Graphics are beautiful with no regard on optimization."
Negative,"13 hour played, this game only shocked you with the first animation story telling,after that you will face a lot of problem,a lot a Air wall(Collision) blocking the route,even the route seem like you can go through,also there is no MAP for you ,the whole Map design is shit ,the Perfect dodging does't really help u to getting the advantage for the battle.  Anyway Art and music is pretty good, overall is 6/10, 7/10 if u love Journey to the west"
Negative,First 2 chapters are super fun and the fights are amazing. After that every boss just spends the entire fight flying around while you dodge and jump around waiting for them to land so you can get half a combo in before they fly again and spam AOE attacks
Negative,"So I'm writing down points as I'm playing the game. Here will be my thoughts:These RPG games are my favourite. These are the only games that keep me interested and that I love.This game has cool bosses and a high amount of them. The gameplay when fighting is good, but similar no matter what skills you have. Cool ideas, cool transformations, cool feeling when you hit one of those big hits.Final boss is amazing. That is how most of the big bosses SHOULD have been.Now here is what I very much dislike about the game (Not worth 60 Euros for me):0. Story: What story? There is no depth, no passion, nothing really interesting and it does not even go anywhere. You spend the entire game not continuing the story that is presented in the beginning. I guess this is a setup for a second game? Or did we just forget about the entire story?0.1 Why do I feel like skipping most cut-scenes? They are not really interesting or good, besides a couple of them0.2 I don't care about any character in the game....even the main character you play, has no soul....no value, you're just a vessel for the actual protagonist that you for no reason look exactly like1. INVISIBLE WALLS? The map is sooo hard to navigate because of these random invisible walls and prebuilt assets generated randomly . There are invisible walls when fighting bosses in an EMPTY FIELD! There's nothing there but you get stuck in an invisible wall.....2. Can't climb anything...3. Graphics on CINEMATIC are not good enough, not as expected for a 5 years in development game...for 45 hours of mediocre gameplay?4. There are other souls like, OR Action RPG games better than this or on par, some of them on Games Pass. I advise those.5. People inevitably compare it to elden ring, dark souls or Sekiro, because of the genre the devs put it in and some similar mechanics. However, this does not deserve to be in the same sentence. You can get over 1000 hours in elden ring, but here a max of 45 and you're quite done. And Sekiro? Well even if that's a short game as well, it's quite a masterpiece, there is no comparison.6. Bosses are cool... but quite easy so you don't get to enjoy them much, there are too many methods you can dodge and became invulnerable or untargetable. Last boss is the only one I'll remember and the only one that deserves it. All other enemies than bosses are weak6.1 OH MY GOD! - There are quite a few bosses in the game that just keep moving and flying everywhere, out of bounds and of my screen, I just keep running and trying to get to them and they keep doing random moves, unthinkable making no sense whatsoever moves and it's just sooo cumbersome... this is a chore. I actually recorded a boss fight and out of 20 minutes of the fight, 15 of them the boss was flying, being untargetable.. and 5 minutes was doing weird random moves that make no sense.7. All zones feel like stock regions pre-programmed and just used here with a little bit of Chinese flavour.8. Character customizability is weak: Barely customize the weapon... not much difference in weapons just very similar moveset you will play with for the entire game. Armour customizability just mediocre as well9. All zones feel empty and just a path with random mobs, no soul, no other characters in the game feel good...none are interesting, all are basic stock characters.10. Rewards from chests: Incredibly boring pieces of gold that you sell right away.11. No danger whatsoever: You don't lose anything when you die, it's just annoying that you have to walk the road back....12. ""RPG""? Where? You can get pretty much all skill points as you play, there is barely any ""build"", or ""customizability"", and it is all very similar. This would have been a great game in 201013. No stealth or alternate way to play the game. No alternate paths, nothing interesting you can really do but march forward and kill stuff. Everything connects at the end anyways...for no reason14. No reason to replay the game at all. No replayability15. The game sounds like I'm playing a stuffed animal all day long with the monkey sounds.....16. No exploration whatsoever: Found something interesting?? An invisible wall... At best you find 3 bells that take you to a secret boss...welp..17. Abilities and skills are average at best. Transformations are somewhat cool18. So many attacks and skills do not connect and do not hit their target... from regular attacks that go straight through the boss without hitting to even homing spells just don't work, to jump attacks where you bug above the boss and don't hit a homing attack....19. Game edge boundaries? 80% of the game you cannot jump off of cliffs or fall. 20% however, randomly, you can jump off of that cliff, or fall. So you have to hit every place around you to see if you can actually walk over there or an invis wall stops you. There are even doors built into the game that are open but you cannot go through....20. The multiple staff stances are useless...you just pick one and stick with it. At the end even they said fck it and gave you all stances that would randomly happen when you attack....21. So many weapons and armour effects throw words at you about ""spirit skills"", and different other abilities or passives but don't show you what those actually are. You have to go back reading through each skill to see if you can even find the object of discussion and most of the times you cannot and need to search it. Pls take a page from Baldur's gate 3, when you inspect anything, the underlined words actually tell you what they do. Why even underline those words in this game if you don't have an explanation to them?22. Every upgrade or medicine material have such random names and they are so many for no reason that you never know what they are for. You have to go through all the vendors, all the menus and inventory and choices every 30 minutes to find out what you can upgrade at a given moment...23. Most of the armours are irelevant and their bonuses are next to useless, fights feel similar with no matter what armour set you have. Last boss might require a decent build only...24. The open world Mount Huaguo... Later on you get to this open space for the first time in the game and thank God the developers didn't develop an actually open world RPG game because this is a mess... Big open space almost empty with some arenas where you'll get to fight some bosses. The catch? You have to spend a lot of time flying around and hopefully find these bosses AND the biggest mistake is that even if this is an open world area, you still have to do things in an EXACT order, otherwise the story won't move forward. So I explored...silly me, because I quickly found later places where nothing happened, and I spent so much time trying to figure out why... Turns out, that I had to do other things in an exact order before, for an action to trigger in the places I initially found.... lots of time wasted flying around a stock map that was already pre-built in the game engine....lovely, I can feel the... ""passion""? the devs put into this? Still you kill all the bosses in max 2 tries and they are all quite forgettable....25. How is it that I remember all the bosses of the Dark Souls games, Sekiro, Elden Ring....but I remember maybe 1 boss of this game?... There are a lot of them, some quite interesting, but somehow they managed to make everything forgettable... I don't remember almost any region of the game either.... I think there was a lava region...and this weird open space"
Negative,Wait for it in Humble Monthly.
Negative,waste of $70
Negative,"This game has so many things done well like amazing enemy variety, amazing graphics and cool set pieces. Unfortunately, it seems like balancing enemies health and attacks were not a big priority for the devs. Some of the bosses are blatantly unfair (the yellow wind sage for sure) and have WAY too much health. The lock-on in the game is also a joke.I will play again once the devs balance the game"
Negative,"I'm just going to type about the game because I am not a game reviewer, nor do I have expertise on Game Development. However, I've played video games consistently since the early 2000's. This game is good looking. The cinematic elements of the game are a nice touch but it doesn't make up for the fact that the fighting mechanics are not done well. The common enemies are eliminated by button mashing. While the elite enemies tend to have heavy attacks that you dodge once and then spam mash light attack until their HP is gone. This is early game that I'm talking about so it might be possible to have other abilities later on. This review has come to be after I fought the second boss (The water snake noble guy) and can't beat him. Is it because I don't want to be patient? Absolutely I don't want to be patient! But his attacks (I felt the same way about the first boss) are too difficult to read, and I spend my time spam dodging until he's done. I've played and beaten both Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring (DLC Included) and this game is just mechanically clunky. The fights just feel like you take turns attacking. There is not a defensive strategy early on. I can't block (except archers' arrows but I've only run into 2 of them), I can't parry, and I can't counter.The game looks good, feels ok, but overall the fighting aspect (at least early on) is mechanically impossible to actually feel like a Martial Arts Monkey. I think my only issues is how narrow and closed in the beginning feels. I get that there isn't an open world aspect and that it is very linear. Which in games like Sekiro are fine because it felt like there was some level of exploration. This game locks you into a path that says ""Get good"" but cares more about creating a challenging Fromsoft experience without the vast equipment or abilities that Fromsoft gifts to their players with their choices of character creation. Again, not a game reviewer, just a frustrated gamer that spent $60 on another game that doesn't feel fine tuned. (just feels like with all the open world games nowadays, companies don't know how to create efficient linear maps).I am not returning this and do plan on trying to beat it, but not because I love the video game, but because I love video games.  I could recommend this game for certain types of players, just not ones like me."
Negative,"Yes... if there weren't other games like this I would've probably given a better rating, but due to the nature of the game and not being the only one of the genre (much less the best), it's impossible not to take reference points, and being that the case as much as it pains me, I just can't recommend it as is.I have to start by saying that it seems the game is not greatly optimized and in some PCs (even High End) the graphics seem oversharpened and just not good in general. I have a high-end PC and suffer both problems, the performance is not great and even on the highest settings the game just looks awful, the best way to describe it being that it just looks way too sharpened, almost pixel looking up close, and that's again, with an expensive PC, I don't want to imagine how this runs on lower systems. This is the one that pains me the most, as that was the selling point for me. The combat initially seemed extremely fun, having so much variety and interesting mechanics/new ideas, however, despite all it's ambition to try different things, it just never came together for me. It lacked that spark of satisfaction that other games like Sekiro or Lies of P did, and as much as I didn't want to compare, it's immediately noticeable that it did take inspirations from lots of games, and doing so one would think: ""Great!, it's going to be the best since it took everything that made those games shine and bring it all on a single game!"" well... it was good but not great, by taking so much from other games and mixing it all it seems like they forgot what made those games great, and it was that every single one of those games excelled and mastered something, and by doing so much, they forgot to master anything.The end result being an okay combat that for some reason just leaves you thinking something's gotta be missing and that even when it seems new, it feels a lot like other games you've played before.The boss design was what you could've expected from literally any other company, meaning: generic. Some were interesting but nothing that made me say ""wow"". As for the difficulty, some bosses felt really easy while others felt like a complete chore, I adore difficult games, be it Sekiro, Dark Souls, Sifu, etc. you name it, I've played it, and generally found them enjoyable in their own way, not with this game unfortunately. When I found a boss that felt difficult I was like: ""Finally!"", but for some reason it always ended the same way, with me sighing and just wanting to be over with it as soon as possible, something that almost never happened with other games, but for some reason some bosses felt straight up tedious even when none of them took me a quarter of the time some of the most difficult bosses from other games took me.Some of the factors that made me think this way were: Odd hitboxes, big health pools, odd hitboxes, repetitive moves and oh did I forget?  Odd hitboxes... Out of the dozens of bosses I've fought, only one of them stood out: Tiger Vanguard. One would've thought that after going through so much grinding the rewards would be amazing, well, think twice my guy cause not here. A lot of the rewards given were just straight up useless and the Spark points given to improve abilities felt more often than not that they changed nothing at all. Not a single time do you feel ""powerful"" on the game and neither do you get in like a ""Zen"" mode where you just feel like the game clicked and you can fight your way through without trouble (if you've finished Sekiro you know perfectly what I mean by Zen Mode), because bosses are always changing and finding a way to screw you different than before.Even when trying to play it as it's own thing and not compare it to other games, it felt like an ambitious game that promised much but excelled at nothing, making it impossible not to look back at the games it took inspiration from.Poor performance, half cooked combat, mediocre boss design, tedious difficulty and a not story telling that I didn't care for.Oddly enough, it's not completely unenjoyable, just seemed like it tried to do more than it could, I guess it depends on the kind of games you like to play, but if we compare it to others of similar genres it's really easy to see where this lacks. I would wait for a discount.6.5/10."
Negative,"Was looking forward to getting into this because of the chatter around its success. I got in game and the first area that caught my eye was blocked by an invisible wall. I realised ""oh, it's one of those games."" Go through invisible corridors, kill boring trash mobs, fight spiky bosses.Speaking of combat. It's tried to combine god of war and dark souls but the result is that you are playing god of war and the bosses are playing dark souls.In the short time I played I didn't see anything innovative. It felt like a mashup of several games I have already played."

Negative,Great game BUT Steam Deck players beware! Denuvo WILL block your access to the game for 24 hours if you experiment with different Proton versions for more than 5 times a day.I got block 1(one) day after I bought it because I tried to test different Proton versions on the deck. And on a Friday evening no less.I'll change this to a huge Yes when they remove the protection (if ever). I feel that Denuvo punishes legitimate buyers at this point.Thanks I guess...
Negative,"Fun game for the hour I played. But it lags like hell. I'm around 70-100fps on the highest graphics but there is something wrong. Stuttering. Doesn't matter if I change the settings on the graphics, except that I get higher FPS. But still have stuttering. Everything is updated as it should too. Will be to ask for the money back and wait to buy it until/if it gets fixed."
Negative,"I have over an hour played in this game and I have not even made it to the main menu once. Crashes my entire PC anytime that I try to launch the game. My PC is well above the recommended requirements to play. I have tried every remedy that is  posted online at this time and nothing has worked. I would love to play  this game, it really does look like a lot of fun. But unfortunately I have to refund before I am not able to anymore due to ""Play time"" exceeding 2 hours.Edit: Finally got into the game after multiple hours of troubleshooting."
Negative,"I absolutely cannot understand why there are so many rave reviews for this game. In my opinion, to get straight to the point: Blackmyth Wukong is a solid game but by no means outstanding or a Game of the Year contender.First, the positive aspects:- Graphics & Atmosphere: This cannot be taken away from the game. The graphics are by far the best I have ever seen in a game. The texture details, the light-shadow balance, and the general look of the game are simply breathtaking.The animations are incredibly well done; for example, the animation changes when you swing into an attack from a dodge move compared to a normal attack. This creates a high level of realism and atmosphere.- Soundtrack: The soundtrack is wonderfully composed and greatly enhances the boss fights and overall atmosphere.- Cinematic Presentation and Cutscenes: The animations at the end of a chapter are absolute masterpieces. (Though I didn’t understand how 4 out of 6 of them relate to the story, but fine), and the cutscenes during a fight (like in the intro or the final boss) are top-notch. This was actually the main reason why I found the game so cool.- AAA Title without Extra Costs: Few to no bugs, no cost traps, no additional content locked behind a paywall.The negative aspects:- Story: I have no knowledge of Chinese mythology and therefore perceived the story accordingly. The intro is absolutely fantastic, it really hooked me, and I was highly motivated to learn who these “gods” are, the “court,” and how to fight them. Unfortunately, this becomes completely irrelevant. You go through chapter after chapter searching for relics, and each chapter basically contains its “own” storyline. The storylines are neither interesting nor exciting. Even when you develop a connection or interest in a certain aspect of the story, the chapter ends and a different, new storyline with new characters begins. There are very few characters that span across multiple chapters. As a result, at least for me, I had no motivation to continue playing. The end of the game is, in my eyes, completely nonsensical in terms of the story and only underscores how cryptic, disjointed, and boring the story is. I feel like the game is trying hard to be like Elden Ring but fails to deliver the story like FromSoftware does.- Map and Level Design: The level design is complete garbage. You wander around for hours, there is no map, and you constantly get lost. Most of the time, the places also look so similar to each other that you almost can’t find your way around anymore. Since the game relies on very few HUD indicators (which I generally think is cool), you don’t know where to go and get lost even more. This wouldn’t be a problem if the world at least gave you a reason to explore: It doesn’t. Everything you loot consists of crafting materials. These give no motivation for exploration. Armor and weapons are only unlocked as part of the story and cannot be found in any chests.The fact that invisible walls border the map doesn’t make it any better, as you often think, ""Oh, it must continue over there,"" and then you run into an invisible wall. In my opinion, that doesn’t belong in an AAA title.- Bosses & Gameplay: The bosses are a topic of their own. Firstly, apart from the intro, the final boss, and a few exceptions, I find all bosses to be completely forgettable. They are boring, there are waaaay too maaaany of them, and they look boring too. In 90% of cases, it's a human with some animal head. Don’t get me wrong; their attacks and all the visuals are more than fantastic. But if you think you’re getting bosses like FromSoftware delivers, you’re in the wrong place.The gameplay is one of the biggest criticisms for me. Extremely monotonous and boring, especially for a game with at least 20 hours of playtime. The combos are very limited (feels like there are about three of them), and you do the same thing all the time. This not only looks boring in the long run but almost killed my desire to play. The dodging feels very satisfying but also partially very random. Often, it happened that a boss clearly hit me with an ability, and I dodged a second later, but the game registered it as a perfect dodge. Also, the hitboxes are so random; I don't know if these are bugs or just poor hitbox design. And when you've been hammering away at a boss with the same three moves for 15 minutes and then die from a hit that clearly misses, you lose your mind. Or you fight a boss who spends 90% of the time flying and is unhittable, and you're basically playing a dodge simulator.- Difficulty: As a big Soulslike fan, I love that the game is not easy. But it's a different kind of difficulty compared to the Souls series, for example. Elden Ring feels very fair in its difficulty. You learn the bosses’ patterns, their moves, and abilities, and you make it on your 50th try. In Wukong, I did not get that feeling. The game is certainly not easy, but it’s not really ""fun difficult"" either. It feels artificially hard when every boss rushes at you with endless combos, or every second boss turns invisible, or creates six copies of itself, or ten tornadoes that sweep across the map, and just touching one catapults you into the air while you still have to dodge the boss itself. Most of the time, the bosses have AoE attacks and love to dash across the entire map at you. This feels artificially and unfairly difficult. It’s like saying, ""Minecraft is the hardest game because you spawn with a wooden sword in a 10x10 room against 100 Endermen."" That’s not fun hard; that’s boring and lazy. That’s how the bosses in Wukong feel.I am very, very disappointed after having looked forward to this game so much. You can really see—and I never want to deny this—how much love went into making this game. But sometimes passion and love alone are not enough."
Negative,"Black Myth: Wukong is a decent game, but it has a number of frustrating flaws that really hampers the experience. In light of this and because it has so many positive reviews, I decided to make this one negative, so that others may find some critique as well.In short the game feels like it has been stretched too thin over too much content. Upgrades feel meaningless, most armor sets are useless and there are very little room for choices when it comes down to it.There are a ton of skill upgrades and a ton spirits and transformations, and nearly almost all of them is pointless. Everything is described in the terms of slightly, moderately, massively and you have to check the stat changes to figure out what actually happens. Most upgrades are neigh meaningless. +1 % crit hit chance, amazing.Armor sets give you special powers, but new ones are almost always better, so you must change. You can upgrade an old set and that would make it stronger, but you only get access to materials after you got a new armor set. Staffs are similar, each increases the damage and crit chance and you just take the bigger one.There are more than 50 spirits, and you won't use 45 of them because they are simply so bad.There are 3 stance trees for fighting with your staff all with their own skills, but none of them matter that much as all three trees are essentially the same. They just have a few moves that look different but give you the same result. Specking into a tree is only necessary so you get a skill you want, not because it would give you any other benefits.The magic system is similarly lackluster. You can't replenish your mana and the skills have limited utility.You can stop some enemies with one for a few seconds to hit them freely. This is by far the most useful one, so some bosses are simply immune to it. There is another one where dash, leaves a deacoy behind so you can have a breather. This is good, but only for healing and pill munching. Pluck of many is the most damaging one, but only if it has been fully upgraded, but it is extremely costly.All other spells are either extremely situational (and will become useful only if you speck into them), or just complete garbage. Ring of Fire for example will buff you, but only if you stay in a small circle. Excellent idea in a game where you have to constantly move around and dodge.On the note of dodging. Either you do it or you are done. Some bosses hit like a truck, easily killing you in 3-4 hits, and the only way to survive is to dodge. Many will have long combos where you just can't get close in fear of getting hit and getting to Death's door.That is it, you have no other options. Bosses usually have a lot of HP too and in general your light attacks are atrociously weak. So with some bosses it's not even worth getting in for a light attack (Scorpion King, Duskveil for example). Thankfully you have heavy attacks, which do work well, but you have to charge focus, by dodging or light attacks. Eventually you fill your focus meter and want to do a heavy attack, aaand you got hit, because your heavy attack for some reason has an animation for consuming the focus points and one for executing it. You may realize that the Thrust stance has the fastest heavy attack and start using that, just so you can more reliably hit.Fodder enemies pose no threat, but since your light attacks are so weak they will hold you up, unless you run past them. Unless you have to fight more than one at the same time. Then you are screwed. Even dodging won't save you, because there is no indicator showing you where a hit might be coming from. You simply have to see it.On top of all of this you have no map! You have absolutely humongous areas, many of which are full of secrets and you won't know where have you been. What did you miss? I don't know. I sorta remember there was a fork somewhere, but where was that? Ahh, who cares. I have read somewhere that the developers wanted to promote exploration. Well, unfortunately almost everything looks the same in a given region. A snowy mountain, a forest, a burnt landscape. There are so few landmarks that could help you orient, that often when a cut-scene would moves me a bit I would get completely disoriented. Horrendous. All in all this is a game that could have been great, but the combat system demands too high of a skill sealing to be fun in most cases. The small damage output makes it so tedious that every build you see online is all about maxing out your damage and crit chance. There is the illusion of option, but in practice there is very little choice. Navigation is very bad and most upgrades are completely meaningless.Finally, as someone who is not familiar with Journey to the West, I have absolutely no clue what is happening. The only thing I could understand there was a big boss monkey, who got smacked down, reincarnated and then that is it. There are a lot of zany characters that just pop in and out of the story, can't tell why."
Negative,"Yeah, nah.Souls mechanics of this game can fuck off which is practically 90% of it.The only thing that is not a souls is that you do not lose any points/exp/money for dying, nor do you need to go back and pick up your stuff.Everything else about this game is a souls.People who are comparing this game to God of War are delusional.The game in general is great but I wouldn't recommend it for the casual gamer due to it being an actual ""souls"" game and not a ""souls like"".I have finished the game twice, second was on a new game plus and that is much easier than the initial play through but it is still a thumbs down from me due to how bullshit the souls combat is with the enemies tracking/aimbot and what not."
Negative,"Fun at first, gets boring quite fast. My main issues so far:* Only one weapon (you can craft ""other weapons"" which are just other skins with different damage stats), which doesn't add to variability* Bosses after bosses. While they do differ in the way you need to approach them, it gets boring really fast. You spend a minute or two running around and then you get another ""boss"". A few of them are fun. Some of them are very poorly designed. Especially the one you fight in an arena with invisible walls, and boss can attack you while behind those walls and you can do nothing. Or some other bosses that have a very large amount of HP and beating them feels boring as hell. * Very clunky controls, especially when using HP gourd or items - you might press a button a couple of times and it simply won't work. Died a hell lot of times because I tried using gourd and it just didn't work.Technically the game is just bad as well. Performance is quite awful. While some effects look good and even without RT lighting looks gorgeous, you can also see a lot of limitations that devs added into the game to optimize it, which can be seen in low resolution textures, a lot of invisible walls and VERY boring locations that use the same assets OVER AND OVER again. Overall, first 10 hours were fun. Later it felt like a burden. Still on Chapter 4 and don't have any will to beat the game."
Negative,"Pro- Good Graphics, Animation, Music,  sound effects and visual effects- Story is Good- Nice Presentation-variety of enemies and attack move set- variety of locationsCons:- Many fights in the game are way too fast.  You need to have a high speed reaction to many things in few seconds. Applying Medicine, heal, dodge, and dodge,and dodge and dodge...boss still in his compo...OK dodge...now a  chance to hit. makes the fight a tedious task.- almost all bosses has AOE spells with high damage and a very large area- some times for some reason I cant hit or reach the boss! a hidden wall of something? don't know!-all bosses jump way to high in the air, and camera can't keep up a good viewNeutral  - Very helpful skill tree, too long to unlock because of slow XP progression- Mana regeneration is cumbersome, specially with many helpful attacks require mana.- getting helpful items, after the boss fight! whats the use now?If I was the developers I would re-balance XP, game speed and camera immediately. That's just me, that's my opinion. I suggest you try before you buy.Best of Luck to Game Science"
Negative,"Was interested in Black myth when it 1st got shown years back at TGA/E3. After all those years it finally came out my 1st impression of the game was pretty positive. Got the intro Bug were wukong is just stuck there standing with nothing moving but the wind and trees. Closed the game opened it back up everything was fine studdering like crazy  got to the titan part everything loaded fine but the clouds you are suppose to be standing on arent there so you literally see straight through everything from the floor down. Closed the game re opened it up same issue continued on got to the forest section everything ran fine start the game up the next day after looking for a fix for the prologue the whole forest section is completly bugged and textures and everything dont load in at all.This game needs many many many patches in the 1st 2 hours I had way to many bugs for a AAA game thats been in development for years, There is no reason why I should be getting texture streaming issues I have this game downloaded on a NVME drive using direct storage, other issues this game has no ""pre"" shader compiler you either have to use -dx11 in the launch options or just keep opening and closing the game but this game has denovo so if you do it too many times you get locked out, other issues Menu for me was bugged as well couldnt turn on RTX even though im on a RTX 3090 with updated drivers my nividia experience said it was on but it wasnt, if your on a AMD gpu your screwed since this game doesnt play nice with them at all so you will either get the intro crash bug or your game wont start at allMissing textures like I said beforeTextures not loading which is the same issue on ps5 as well.Input lag is atrocious during certain sections.FPS will go from 120+ to 10 fps in various boss fightschapter 3 is bugged.Huge memory leak issues the more you play the game worst than BG3 at launch by farcant compile sharers manually.constant stuttering and lag that made it nearly unplayable at times.Very disappointing I would give this game a 5/10 at best in its current state terrible ps5 version is even worst, And there are no fixes for any of this issues people said just verify files did it 5 times did nothing still had all these issues this game needs to FORCE a shader compile run before you even start the game Street fighter, Tekken, and many other Japanese and US made games do this there is no reason this game shouldnt have the bare minimum applied."
Negative,"i'm sure this game would be great if i could get past the shader screen. It get to about 6% then tells me i'm out of memory. Complete joke. All drivers are up to date, running 64 bit system, RTX4090, intel i9 gen13, 32gb ram. If this isn't enough to run the game who is the target audience?! Complete waste of time. Save your money until they fix this heap of steaming sh1t.Oh and side note, i even tried windowed and lowered all the settings. No dice!"
Negative,Graphics are insane. Game play is smooth and combat is nice. But its just boss fight after boss fight. Great game I just don't find it enjoyable. If you like soul games you might like this. But even souls games gives you some space between boss fights.
Negative,"I played this for 2 hours and refunded it. I love Dark Souls and Elden Ring, but I didn’t enjoy Sekiro as much because it’s all about perfect blocking, although I still finished it. This game is beautiful, but the whole gameplay revolves around dodging boss attacks at the perfect time to boost your focus and deal damage. Invisible walls make the world feel small, and the enemies besides the bosses are super easy to defeat because you don’t have to perfect dodge their attacks. If you like games where the whole point is to learn boss patterns and dodge at the right time, you will probably love this like everyone else."
Negative,"Game Science way overshot performance and did not align it computers of even the highest specs.  But it IS playable and a blast for the most part.  Some questionable hitboxes/enemy i-frames but fun nonetheless.Edit: it was fun until you realize bosses like Yin Tiger are a case study in cheap boss design (excessive damage, nigh-unavoidable grab, and teleporting constantly) and Yellow Loong is classic ""Durr high damage and health = challenge.""  Some bosses were NOT tested and deserve adjustments to make them a fun challenge and no just stupidly high stat numbers.  Not to mention Erlang regenerating his entire shield if you don't DPS his phases fast enough AND regenerating both over time and with hits nevermind his ability to ONE SHOT THE PLAYER AT ANY TIME regardless of health, defense, and damage reduction.  Many bosses are fun but there are several that are flat out unfair."
Negative,Combat feels horrible and the game don't even got sex in it.
Negative,"PLEASE FIX THE MF INPUT DELAY, WHY WHEN I SPAM L1 TO HEAL NOTHING HAPPENS AND I HAVE TO RAPE MY L1 BUTTON?!?!??!ß"
Negative,Game seems great and beautiful but I am completely overwhelmed by the stupid difficulty of the game. Add difficulty settings I am end of act 1 even trash mod can just sit on your face every attack interrupt you while they don’t care you punching them a dozen time to take them down !
Negative,"Why are there so many invisible walls?? it is so annoying and feels limiting. Don't block me from jumping to my death. Also there is no risk in dying in this game, you can just bash your head against a boss with nothing at stake."
Negative,Been playing Ot for 2 hours and am not able to kill 2 bosses. I skipped the big head because it's just to hard for me te defeat and now I'm stuck at the wolf. I read people saying it's easy but this game is really far too hard for me. I would have loved to see an easy mode for people like me not want to spend 10 hours to kill 1 boss. I must admit it's a very beautiful game but I think I will never touch this game again after tonight it's just too hard for me. And with I guess around 300 times deaths at the moment no fun anymore tbh.I don't understand why so early in in the game the bosses are made so freaking hard. I hardly know the controls yet and the bosses almost insta kill you. Don't buy this if you don't have experience with this kind of fighting.
Negative,thumbs down for having to spend about 4 hours of trouble shooting with a 13 series cpu and 4090 to be able to even play it. then it preforming sub-par. Some of the combat is new but the same thing has been done over and over and over (souls like).... hoping it stays interesting because ive already gotten bored.
Negative,"I want to like this game. and I do like this game but I cant ignore the game play choices. multiple times the devs have made the choice to make bosses more difficult just to be difficult. I see this more so in later game bosses than early game. early game you are shown that spells and attacks are ok and not ok to be used which is to be expected... but in later game you will find your spells and attacks being cancelled out just so a boss can do their big flashy moves. this is all well and good, but I hate to say it; it goes against everything this game teaches you early on. later on in the game it goes against everything you learn and I cant help but feel its all for difficulty sake. this isnt good game or boss design, its just lazy. instead of making a challenging boss the devs have chosen to create bosses that cancel out core game play options for the player, create ""let me show you"" moves for the boss, or hit boxes that dont match where the staffis hitting. the story, combat, and game play as a whole all equal a good game, but as I have gotten further into the game this is just yet another dev that has fallen into the pit of difficult game = good game whole. I want to say now that I injoy al of the souls games and souls like that have come out as of late, I dont mind a difficult game, but the ones that shine are the ones that are difficult, but fair. there are enough moments in this game that I cant say its fair at this point, you are fighting enough rng and boss sided mechanics that you are builing skill and boss knowledge to overcome the hill. you are more so just waiting until you get that perfect run where hit boxes, rng boss moves, and rng on spells actually hitting to beat a boss.I want to like this game and I have injoyed the time ive spent on this game, and I fully plan on finishing this game. but souls like, or GOW like what ever title you wnat to put on this game I can not say it is well done. It is so close but has missed the mark in such a way that its just a non rewarding slog. at the end of the day its a game the is praying on the itch that the souls games create but falls short in scratching or creating that itch in its self.TLDR: game falls short of the mark for souls likes and GOW likes, gameplay feels short handed or to demanding depending on area and boss fight. over all I as a player am let down from all the hype this game has gotten,"
Negative,"Visually the game is beautiful. It's UE 5 so no surprise. Gameplay is rather bland, combos are very limited and get boring, story isn't really engaging at all either, into chapter 3 i didn't care anymore. The chapter videos are original, short little stories, each with their own art style but none of them really add to the main story. Chapters also don't seem to be connected, it's like starting out a new story line each time.Game is just massively hyped because it doesn''t care about woke agenda. If that wouldn't be a current topic in gaming, this game would at best get 6/10. Not worth 60 bucks."
Negative,"Visualmente es un 10/10, es un deleite para los ojos. La historia parece interesante, pero... opinión impopular: no es divertido."
Negative,"Wait for it to be on gamepass and play it there.the game clunkyness, really bad hitboxes, terrible level design, unimaginative combat, shallow crafting system, lack of reward for exploration, inconsistency in the skills and tracking, and some other things makes it really hard for me to recommend people spend 60$ on this game"
Negative,"I got this game for free with my new 4080 super.  It's a beautiful game and runs well (I should add that my new build is a monster, if it doesn't run well on my machine, it is be unplayable on ""most"" PC's).  It's an ok game, and while it's apparently not a souls like I have to conclude I am not good at these type of games (never saw the appeal of souls like as I play for story and fun).  the game is frustratingly ""hard""....not impossible but losing to a boss and having to go through all the trash again isn't appealing.I would have zero issues lowering the difficulty if it was possible, just so I can go through the story (which I hear is limited...but still).I'd imagine that if you're into souls like you'll probably really enjoy this and find it ""easy""If I had paid for this, I would have refunded it, it's just not for me, but I can see why people think it's a good game"
Negative,Keys are unable to be rebind to the arrows keys making it impossible to properly control my character during combat as i never use WASD. Tried the other control schemes such as s z x c which said they were rebind but when i went back into the game it was back to the WASD keybind scheme. Also key input does not always respond during combat or when doing things like going into the inventory or checking out a new portrait where i have to click on the tab key the exact moment i get the new portrait otherwise the game does not respond to the tab key.Gorgeous graphics with or without ray tracing on and great writing along with magical reality transcending music/audio work but game controls are horrible. Would have been nice to just run past boss areas to explore the world and come back to beat them when at a higher level but like all souls like games your blocked by an invisible wall making it impossible to go any further unless defeating the boss which as i mentioned with this horrible control scheme which does not always respond to keyboard input is nothing but frustrating and impossible.
Negative,"To start I don’t think this game deserves a thumbs up or down rather I believe it's mixed. I won't talk about the story because it seems fine from what I've seen nor will I talk about the graphics because they are obviously good. Rather it's the gameplay and level design that I have a problem with. To start the levels are flat with very few ways to interact with besides walking, running and the occasional jump. It's odd because for a game that has you play as a monkey, you don't do any climbing or swinging. Simply there is very little verticality making it all feel flat and lifeless. The gameplay starts good but quickly loses steam after the first chapter and around 10 bosses later. Simply you pretty much have one combo and that's it and a bit of magic that goes on cooldown. This wouldn't be that big of a problem if it was a Souls game but it isn't, at least according to the developer. Rather it is apparently supposed to be similar to DMC and Bayonetta but it isn't. In fact it is nothing like these two games at all, It is not even close to the hybrid that was Steller Blade. Simply put the game is just becomes a grind.It's odd, for a game to be based on Wukong a character that embodies freedom the game simply lacks it. From the restrictive and simple combat system that doesn't allow expression to the restrictive level design that will have you running into an invisible wall every few minutes as if the game is insecure and thinks the player is stupid. It overwhelmingly feels restrictive.Edit: played for a few more hours and my opinion has become more positive but would still be hesitent to buy at full price at the moment"
Negative,"Cons: 1) Gameplay (fighting):This game is definitely a real ""souslike"" game. The difficulty is very punishing at times. You have to run past the same 10 normal enemies every time to get back to the boss that just totally wrecked you. Just to get wrecked again.Definitely not a game for casual gamers. This is for hardcore gamers that enjoy getting punished by Dark Souls and other soulslike games. This is why I can not recommend this game because it might be too hard for most normal people that want to enjoy a video game. For most people there is no enjoyment in getting constantly punished by a game.2) Level design:The level design is ultra linear. You can't even go exploring the levels because they are all surrounded by invisible barriers that block you. I would have hoped to have just a little bit more freedom to explore those beautiful sceneries.Pros:1) Graphics:The graphics and levels are incredibly beautiful. I think I have never seen a game with such epic looking levels. The attention to detail is also absolutely crazy. I have never seen that in any other game.2) Story and lore: The story and lore are pretty nice and I enjoy them a lot.3) Free resetting of skills, attributes and spells: The game lets you reset ALL ""sparks"" (experience points for leveling up) at any save point during the game. So you can freely respec your character and change it up for different enemies and bosses. I like that."
Negative,"Game has massive potential but is marred by severe technical issues, boring repetitive game play, and bland level design. The combat, which is the best selling point of the game, is fantastic and very satisfying with diverse skill trees and talents. The levels, although gorgeous in some areas, are pretty bland and lifeless. Game can be summed up as a 3D Cuphead where you pretty much run in a straight line from one boss to another. This is not a negative in my opinion, but can be off putting for those that want more of an adventure type game."
Negative,Black Myth gets a lot right. Starts off really tightly designed in the first act then slowly devolves starting in act 2 with the King of the Yellow Sands fight. Then gets worse once in the prison. The devs seem to have the mind set of ambush enemies and ranged guys out of reach equals challenge. They really just start throwing massive amounts of frustrating shit at you. Hit boxes and perfect dodge timing seems to change with the wind the more you play. It's still a solid first outing for the dev but I can't recommend it at full price. Get it on sale after some patches and balance fixes. You'll save yourself some frustration. I still plan on powering through but sweet lord some of the BS I've had to deal with is next level.
Negative,"The combat system in this game is a mess. The enemy attack patterns lack clarity and have a frustrating ""teleport NPC in front of player during windup"" property that makes spacing a non-factor. The input buffering is terrible, and dodges, which were meant to be the crux of the combat system, are extremely unreliable when interacting with enemies' hitboxes; very often your well-timed dodge will whiff and leave no reward except avoiding damage.  On top of that, I don't think that the Focus mechanic is rewarding enough because the hitstun system makes it unreliable to spend.And finally, I don't like how the fact that leveling exists is used as a crux for difficulty design by the developers. You often run into enemies that inexplicably oneshot you, right night to oceans of trivial X-button fodder. So the difficulty progression does not feel designed or rewarding.Black Myth: Wukong is just one of those overrated games on Steam IMHO. Not going to go through the tedium of finishing it."
Negative,This game is unfortunately unoptimized for AMD. My 7900XTX is stable. The drivers are not crashing but the game itself will crash to desktop. Bummer. I this the game is a Nvidia showcase.
Negative,Actual shit game
Negative,"not great, runs horribly on PC"
Negative,can't f*ck malenia neither
Negative,"If you like boss rushes (like, literally, no story and almost inexistent level design and just boss - boss- boss - boss), then this might indeed be enjoyable for you. For me, it isn't. I need a little more than that. A boss fight should stay something special, I don't want to fight a new epic creature and respecc every 10 minutes just for that fight. Games like Lies of P and Nioh have balanced this so perfectly. I will only launch this game when I really feel like fighting a boss."
Negative,"I know this game has become some kind of touchstone in the woke vs non-woke culture war.  No matter what side of that particular battle you fall on, don't buy into the hype for this game.  Honestly, it is a typical, marginal souls-like game.  The graphics are beautiful, and the story largely incoherent, unless you are familiar with the source material.  Unfortunately, the performance, gameplay, and difficulty are wildly inconsistent.No matter the computer or graphical setting, I experienced periodic stuttering, even on the lowest settings.  Even when that doesn't happen, the button inputs seem to be strangely laggy and not nearly responsive enough.  Gameplay itself is schizophrenic and inconsistent.  The fighting seems to be based on a system of light attacks doing chip damage but which eventually stagger the enemy, followed up by a heavy attack that does the real damage.  All fairly standard stuff, except it doesnt work most of the time.  Each variety of heavy attack has a ridiculous wind up animation that often allows an enemy to escape or hit you and break the chain.  Theoretically, you can charge a  heavy attack to do more damage, but again, the charging time is so slow you can rarely get it off before being hit.  The combat system is mostly ok against trash mob enemies, but against bosses, especially faster moving ones, it is horrible.  A certain boss, about 4 hours in, shows the flaws in the combat system.  He's a two stage boss, with two full health bars.  At this point, you have an incredibly weak healing flask and very few armor or weapon options.  This boss is incredibly fast moving and hits like a truck.  He basically cant be staggered and good luck winding up a heavy attack, much less actually hitting him with it.  Spells and special abilites help, but they all have a horribly long cool down and a limited mana pool (seriously, a two minute spell cool down and a limited mana pool on a two stage boss, gimme a f@#&ing break).  The fight comes down to dodging his attacks (good luck with the laggy controls and random stuttering) then hitting for some chip damage, rinse/repeat 400 times and maybe you win.  I've tried grinding for xp, and respecced about ten times.  It doesn't help when none of the powers in the skill tree seem to be meant for the type of combat required against this boss.  Unless you are one of those people who love to die to the same boss 40 times before finally winning, I just can recommend this game based on the inconsistent performance and a marginal combat system."
Negative,"I was hoping for more of a story driven game. So far, it's boss battle after boss battle. Grind after grind. Very Souls-like which, I'm not too fond of. But it's definitely a beautiful game. The graphics are amazing. But if you're like me, and like story or more immersive games, this isn't for you."
Negative,"Do not buy on pc!!! well at least if you are running a gpu with a 4060 or below. My experience has been really bad, i have had crashes, fps drops after playing a while and sudden pc power turning off. By the way i am not running on high settings neither and just wanted a good experience for the money i paid."
Negative,"I don't know, am I crazy? I really didn't find this to be too fun. The attack combos are lacking a weighty feel to them and the combat just felt stale after a while. I really look for variety in games such as is, so if you're anything like me who gets bored of a particular gameplay style quickly maybe skip this one I don't know. Incredible visuals though, just not for me I guess."
Negative,"The game has excellent presentation and visual style.As someone who casually enjoys souls-like games and rogue-like/lites, honestly, it wasn't for me. I'll go do another couple playthroughs of Elden+DLC Ring, another playthrough of Armoured Core 6, or a second run of Stellar Blade, or even another play of Stranger of Paradise over this game. It wasn't as well tuned as any other action RPG I've played in the last couple of years, and when people are complaining about one of the early minibosses and making video guides to beat it, you know something is wrong with the enemy combat design.But hey, at least it wasn't as bad as FF16."
Negative,"I was promised a return to Monke experience with interesting Mythology/LoreWhat I got :- Compelling Environments (Would of been cool if I was allowed to actually explore them)- Invisible walls -- Interesting parkour because you're a monkey? go fuck yourself- Linear Design, why can't I explore and come back to a particular boss if I'm having trouble? That shit is so important for Souls-likes...- 10 minute load screens- Every 'main' boss feels the same, dodge 4-5 attack combo, deal 3-5% of their health and repeat and try not to get hit by a random special attack that deals decent damage before the animation even hits you (you learn to adapt and just dodge earlier but it's cringe)- Performance issues (Chapter One worked fine on my system and Chapter Two is straight up ass - Probably all they had time to test)- Upgrades feel meaningless but I guess the item skins look neatGOTY?! 6/10 on a good day but cannot recommend in it's current state -- 7 if they fix performance issues"
Negative,"Monke fails to kill. Dark Souls simulator. Was hoping for a nice story, got greeted with unplayable game."
Negative,Very fun game but so poorly optimized. I keep dropping from 100fps (on low graphics settings) to ~5fps.The audio also keeps cutting out about every 30 seconds
Negative,"**edited after most recent august 29th patchbefore the game stuttered a lot but now it crashes constantly too. unfortunately the technical issues i faced before have only gotten worse with the most recent update. game seems great too, what a shameRTX 3070Ryzen 7 5700x32gb RAM"
Negative,"Fantastic art, character/boss designs and setting with some end of chapter animations that should win awards. However the endless invisible walls, god awful level designs, non existent gear builds and hitbox and input lag issues sucked all the fun for me. Can only recommend this if you super super love bossing and nothing else."
Negative,"After clearing a stage 4.5 hours in I feel like there is a big ""something"" missing from the combat.It's quite disappointing as the rest of the game looks and feels excellent, from the story telling choices and the UI's.But combat being the main aspect of the game I can't really bring myself to play any further than the Electric Frog Boss very early in the second Chapter.I feel like there is no impact when striking my opponents, the peons are very weak and die too quickly to get that satisfying final hit during the combo but it feels like a waste to use a fully charged heavy to quickly dispatch them with that satisfying smack.When fighting a boss I feel like I'm a flea using CQC on an Ox. I'm relying on my cool-downs to rinse and repeat every single time and after a few too many encounters I can feel the repetitive nature scratching away at my brain.I really wanted to like this game as it IS beautiful the illustrations, the effort in the descriptions of the Yaoguai is insane.I don't know if this is me being picky... but the very obvious invisible walls seems a tad lazy for the quality we see in many areas. I feel like this is an example of ""Being a mile wide but an inch deep"" when it comes to their level design. UE5 is beautiful but it isn't a crutch.I know it's not an open world game but I'd like some creativity when it comes to blocking my path.Pros:- Storytelling- Stunning illustrations- Unintrusive UI (for how many mechanics are at play)Cons:- Flat feeling combat- Early repetitive nature"
Negative,"Ok... Read all of it, cuz whatever you think that you're gonna see from this review, you can save it, because it's NOT what you think that this review will be.The game is gourgeous, history is unpecable, graphs I can't even say shit to it, because its PERFECT.But the game suffers from a problem that's intrisict IN ME, things that I see in some games and I get it, they're souls-like games. They're MADE to be like that, but, still I'm gonna lay this out, because I know that other people like me are gonna have the same problem and probably do the same thing that I did, uninstall the game.Black Myth Wukong have some ""lock in animations"". What do I mean by that?You attack, you jump, you do shit, but when you are at it, you can't perform another action, meaning that IF THE GAME have a hidden mechanic that you can pull off, you good, lets say a combo, or maybe the ""deceive strike"" that I never could pull off because my awarness is a piece of shit enveloped in garbage... So, you see, there's a ""finger barrier"" here, me, while suck at the game, cannot compute certain actions that the game have as ""mechanics"". Don't get me wrong here, I recognize that they're mechanics, I recognize that I'm the one that can't make them because I'm not good at the game, and no, I don't this game to become an Ubisoft game, I just want to be able to make stuff in it. I just can't :), I'm this bad, no I don't want huge nerfs on the game, I don't want easy difficulty, the game is designed to be like that, I'm just going to accept, but still I could have the option to decrease difficulty a bit, I paid the game, I feel like I must enjoy it somehow(and it's not happening, I'm gonna address that later)The bosses feel nice, the animations, combat, again, all of it, awsome stuff. I don't give a fuck if the game is boss oriented fights, it's cool like that. I understand the feeling of ""reward"" into killing a hard boss into a game, I totally get it and I think that if trying to kill a boss for hours and hours, decorating his every move is something that you enjoy, then good for you tho, glad that you like it and that this game can provide you with that. But, I don't like it, again, it's me, not the game, not anything else, I just don't like to get such a barrier and not be able to play something that I paid for, just because I feel that I can't go any further because of ONE boss(its the endgame boss, Wukong). It's frustrating, mind you, I'm not asking for y'all to nerf him, I think that IF the boss is suposed to be hard, so be it, but now, I'm hard stuck(20+ hours) into a boss that isn't going to allow me to enjoy new game plus and all the other bosses and fights from game.Letting you know, yes, I killed Scorpionlord, yes, I know that he may be the hardest fight in the game(after they fixed the voice-whisper boss dude(don't recall his name). And again, I'm not asking to ANYTHING to be nerfed here, but again, I would actually love a way to decrease the difficulty, at least for me, it's a single play game, isn't nothing online, so what's the problem with it?Well, to wrap this up, yes, I know that some of you can run the urge to say ""get good"", really tho, I don't give a fuck, I'm ok with not be good at games, but I'm not ok with not being able to play something that I paid.In the end, Black Myth Wukong is an AWSOME GAME, I can't express this enough, but it's a game that I can no longer enjoy, because again, I'm bad and I cant kill the last boss."
Negative,"I was on the fence about whether to recommend this game or not before I realized that if I need to think about it, then I can’t recommend it. Still, Black Myth: Wukong is about as close to getting a recommendation as a game that I don’t recommend can be, if that’s worth anything. If you can snag this on sale for $30 or $40, it’s worth that price. It’s also important to support games like this and Stellar Blade that show that countries not known for producing solid single-player games can do just that. But there is a limit to what that leeway will allow. Wukong is so close to being such a solid game. Sadly, as I continued playing, I was having less and less fun with it. Maybe my expectations were too high for a developer’s first “real” video game. Maybe I should have expected some of the jank and some of the issues in the game. Then again, for a $60 game that presents itself as being on the same level as other AAA titles, maybe it isn’t completely unfair that my expectations were as high as they were for Wukong. The game starts strong with Wukong talking insane amounts of trash to a literally massive Celestial Court. I was all for that. I was ready to be on board with this character. I was ready for a story where he could grow from this brash character across a long journey. Wukong in the intro was so enjoyable that it was a punch in the mouth when we got stuck with a mute monkey that has no personality, character, or charm. Looking back on it, I think the Destined One was probably meant to be a character you project yourself onto. That’s all fine and good, but sadly, I wasn’t a monkey swinging around a staff the last time I checked, so that fell a little flat. That start put me in a disappointed mindset. I can’t help but feel like it would have been better to include that glorified cutscene toward the end of the game instead of leaving the player with a jarring character shift right at the start of the story. In fact, a lot of the other characters are fun to watch, which makes the Destined One’s complete lack of character even more annoying to deal with as the story progresses. I get that writing a character to be the focal point of a long story can be hard, but come on, this was based on one of the most iconic pieces of Chinese literature in the world. Something more than a mute monkey could have been done here. In fact, despite being based on one of the most iconic pieces of Chinese literature ever, the story isn’t up to much at all. I will concede that this might be because I’m entirely unfamiliar with Journey to the West, but I think I can be forgiven for expecting a standalone game to tell a story. The second, third, or fourth game in a series? Sure, it’s on me for not knowing what’s going on. I’m not putting not having a firm grip on the narrative on me in this instance, not when the story dumps come in the form of “music videos” before dropping me in the middle of a brand-new area and biome. Mighty nice-looking biomes, mind you. Granted, they’re the kind of nice-looking that’s better for pretty screenshots instead of practical and intuitive level design. After Chapter 1, the areas are just too big. I felt like I was spending most of my time running around, trying to hunt for secrets since I wanted to get as much out of the game as possible, and that became annoying. Granted, I appreciate a developer who puts huge areas and missable secrets in games that are both cool and help with the future critical path stuff. It makes it worth the player’s time and effort to engage with side content, and in the world of bloated games like Assassin’s Creed and Star Wars Outlaws, having side content that’s worth engaging with is a huge plus.  Still, the level design became almost unbearable in Chapter 6 when I was trying to spot small, interesting-looking areas while flying around on a cloud that looked so bad it belonged in an N64 game. I know you made very pretty environments. They are very pretty indeed. Please, when you make the inevitable sequel to this game, trim the fat down, make the areas smaller, add better indicators for what’s a pile of rubble that’s worth climbing on and what isn’t, and let people focus on the best part of your game: the combat. The combat, while the best part of the game—particularly against the visually impressive bosses—still has its own set of baggage. There’s a robust set of skill trees, and while there aren’t really “builds” in Wukong, there are plenty of options to shake up your play style. There are probably too many skill tree options, but unlike Path of Exile, looking at Wukong’s skill trees doesn’t make me want to puke. Low bar to clear but clear it Wukong did. The biggest issue with the combat is that it just doesn’t work half the time. I have no idea how they worked on this game for so long, hanging their hat on the combat, and somehow aerial heavy attacks just don’t connect. It was insane how many times I would walk up to a stationary enemy, jump in the air, and use my heavy attack, just for my hit to not connect. This game spent 6 years in development. I should not have issues hitting an aerial heavy attack because the game decided to take a nap on the job. Enemy hitboxes and hurtboxes in general aren’t very good. Too many attacks would miss because an enemy bigger than my apartment wiggled an inch to the left. Of course, that rule doesn’t apply to you. In the interest of fairness, the Destined One decided to expand his hurtbox to twice his normal size on either side of him. The only exception to this is when you’re in your Rock Solid—the game’s parry—form. Then enemy attacks will often conveniently miss you until you’re out of your Rock Solid form. Rock Solid is one of the first spells that just won't work half the time. There’s a bug where you can use your Immobilize spell on a boss, but it won’t work, and the boss will hit you anyway and out your spell on cooldown. I’m giving the developers the benefit of the doubt by saying this is a bug, because if it’s intentional game design to have the immobilize spell not immobilize when used, then it’s inexcusable. Even when the spells do work, there’s a chunk of bosses that just don’t let you use them. You’ll use Immobilize, and what is essentially plot armor kicks in, and they say you don’t get to use that spell. Nope, it doesn’t matter how many points you invested into that spell. You don’t get to use it on the boss because the game says you can’t. On top of that, some of the boss fights are horrendously designed and were the tipping points into making me realize the game just wasn’t as fun as it had been. Despite the game itself getting easier as it went on thanks to the upgrades, the devs made sure to study up on Manus, Father of the Abyss, to make sure they got their spastic flailing down just right. At least the worst single attack most bosses have in their arsenals is the lost mystical art of a random 20 FPS drop.Yellow Loong and Erlang are two boss fights that are exceptionally bad, making sure they stocked up on their Elden Ring 18-hit, flailing combos along with plenty of poise (a trait shared with normal enemies, for some reason) to ensure they got to be as annoying as possible. When they decide you’ve had too much fun and got to play the game too much, they make sure to take to the air for a few years, letting you contemplate your sins of winning too hard. You know what? Perhaps that’s in line with the game’s themes. Disappointingly, Wukong is a game of numerous small irritations that surround the core of something that could be so much better. In a game that can take around 40 hours to complete when doing as much content as possible, numerous small irritations start to mount and pile on to the point that the game is best purchased on sale, or at the very least, when some of those issues get ironed out."
Negative,"imagine getting end-game gear and the game doesnt let you use it, except you dont have to imagine because that is what happened"
Negative,"fun at the beginning, until you realized, its too late!!!"
Negative,I haven't seen shader optimization this poor since Starfield
Negative,"Style over substance. Very pretty. Very boring. Not a whole lot of depth to pressing X a dozen times, with the occasional Y."
Negative,"7900xtx, 7800x3d cant get out of opening sequence without crashing to desktop. No RT used...bad optimization."
Negative,"Beautiful game. However, it’s not an action game. It is definitely a Souls-like. Anyone who says it isn’t a Souls-like has probably never played one in their life. I’m not sure why the developers said otherwise. Also combat feels like I'm hitting my enemies with a wet noodle."
Negative,"7ish hours, not for me.I'm assuming much of these will feel better later on in the game but I don'f feel the drive to want to get there.Every positive aspect has an equal negative aspect.Its very pretty, but very busy.Navigating the world is fine when you're on flat ground but there are a lot of collision issues and hang ups, no climbing mechanic. I want to explore because its so pretty, but its on rails with a lot of underwhelming rewards, dead ends and invisible walls for doing so.No map.The moment to moment combat is what kills it for me.I feel like it wants to be God of War and Souls, but doesn't know which one, and is missing the best of both.The combat is floaty and restrictive, unresponsive, clunky and tedious.Some attacks feel nice and weighty, but this is rare.No other weapon types than the staff. Spirits and transformations are cool but they are flavor, not foundation.Main light attack is essentially required. The initiating attack is fast, but then you sit through a big flashy animation waiting for the next hit/s to show up in the middle of some spinny nonsense.Heavy attack has some nice unlocks, but they all require a set up and a waiting period to get it out, unless you pepper them in with your combos, but the chances of you getting interrupted are high.Crowd clearing is rough, there may be some AOE heavy hitters later but being limited to mostly single target to clear trash mobs gets tiring quickly.You get interrupted very often. You have to hit this basic wolf guy 30 times, and you get stunned for a whole day if you get poked in the middle of your baton expose.Props for being pretty, but eh for the rest. 7/10"
Negative,"Take this with a grain of salt. I ultimately refunded it because of various small issues.1. Performance while stable felt bad on my 3080. DLSS turned on by default with no way to turn it off... not a good look and many other games have had drama just for this, games shouldn't need DLSS to function. (Examples: Remnant 2, Cyberpunk2077). I can't play this game with DLSS forced on, with optimized settings (a combo of mid-very high settings) and RT off at mid to high settings. This gets me around 70-75 fps at 1080p around 65-70 at 1440p. I spent $3000+ on a gaming computer last year to play games at max settings, and high frame rates. Watching 2023-24 games come out and turn a $3000 pc into something thats comparible to a console is just sad.2. Difficulty had weird spike you either beat everything down pretty easy or you get pooped on. In the two hours I made it to the area with the first official fire boss with a side boss (big headed blue guy) couldn't beat either in the time I had with the game. The combat is action based but I HATE that I can't dodge out of an attack. I can't tell you how many times I would attack the game ques the attack but even if I see something coming I can't dodge out of the way instead stuck in an attack animation, speaking of heavy attacks feel weird as I try to implement them into my light attacks but without a ""focus bead"" you can't string a heavy into your combo and instead have to come to a stand still before you can ques up a heavy attack. Combat feels both clunky and fluid at the same time with difficulty spikes in both directions as well.3. This was the deciding factor: Time... unfortunately because games have a 2 hour limit before they can't be refunded I take that time seriously as $60+ investment isn't so small in 2024 with costs rising. From the time I hit ""play"" Steam's timer keeps track of shaders compiling (about 5-10 minutes), and then me looking at options (mostly graphics) and bench marking for optimized settings took another 20-30 minutes before I even hit ""new game"". There I am already 45-ish minutes into a game I have yet to truly try. I fortunately watched a couple people start it up and was able to skip the opening cinematic and a couple cut scenes saving me valuable time and still left me in the starting area as my 2 hour limit came along.Unfortunately because of the time constants and the few little issues I had I can't say for certain whether this game is good or not but it's issues were enough to make me refund it. I wasn't going to lose out on money for a game I wasn't crazy about. I think we need to talk about opening up the refund window on games that boast dozens of hours of content and only having 2 hours to demo that content. I truly believe if I had another 2-3 hours I might have found something to love but as is I couldn't bring myself to spend $60 for a game I was meh about with the 1 hour 15-ish minutes I  had with it."
Negative,"The game is good, wouldn't say it is great though. It does go with the fun aspect, but I don't feel like there is anything new or amazingly done with this game. I would not recommend the game base on the optimization and even though I turn off the screen shaking, it still manages to give me headaches. I can play other games for days but not this one. It isn't my fps since I do play other games with more graphic heavy requirements. If you are not effected like how I was then enjoy the game, its a good game.*Update*Forced myself to beat the game. The end game has a lot of frame drops and I had to take plenty of rest to struggle through the headaches. The frame drops gets worse late game. The game play at the end does force you to learn mechanics and there is no way to progress through that with levels and gears. I felt that there is a lot less customization then I originally thought. I am still sticking my initial impression that it is a good game. 6/11 for me even without considering the bad optimizations and frame rate drops. I would not restart this journey just considering the story aspect felt, very underwhelming."
Negative,"Runs like hot ass on a 7900 XT wtf.I guess the gameplay might be good, and what I could play in the tutorial with the blatant ""you're gonna lose"" boss was fun, but it was also stuttering and barely getting over 50fps. Then crashing 100% guaranteed every time you get out of the tutorial into chapter 1.Nah, this ain't it, the hype was unwarranted as usual. Maybe later on once it's had a few patches but I'm refunding it for now."
Negative,Game crashes during opening cut-scene on AMD.
Negative,Only prison stage have many area can drop dead. Other stage have many invisible wall can't drop dead.Weird design !!!
Negative,Games should be fun.
Negative,The game needs an easy mode.
Negative,"I didn't feel like the game was fun. It looks good but the gameplay just isn't it. Story isn't made interesting.Combat is mid.Can't really explore, very narrow.Many blocked roads and invisible walls.Sounds are ass.Music is good.Performance seems to suffer in some areas.Boring characters."
Negative,Really good gameplay and good visuals. But performance is terrible and its not being talked about enough here. 4080 here with i9 13900k and Im getting 50-60 fps with FRAME GENERATION and DLSS and not even maxing out the settings. Lots of weird flickering on the vegetation. Turning down the settings ALOT gives me around 70 fps but drops below 40 in certain fights. Amongst the worst performing games I have ever played.
Negative,"game started out fun but this game is filled with bad gimmicks and way longer then it should. the base combat is fun and there are some interesting abilities but the depth is terrible because of how most of  the abilities are balanced as most of the spells u get are practically useless in most cases because the alternative is just way better and because of how bad many of the gimmicks in the game are. it probably would not stand out as much if there were not as many as there are. some truly historically bad bosses, could have focused on making fewer better bosses but they chose to litter the game with so many terribly designed bosses, many are actually offensively bad.the level design is actually unbelievably bad, dear god, someone help them. i normally don't care if a game has a map or not but with how bad the level design is, this game could use one."
Negative,"The gameplay is great, the graphics are great, the  fighting is great. But the story is so not Lore accurate it hurts my soul. I know i shouldnt be taking this too serious but the story is literally switching things up so much that it ruins the whole story of Journey to the west. They modernified everything making it look like the gods are the evil ones even tho that wasnt the point of the story. But if you just ignore the story or if you never even grew up with journey to the west then i would recommend this game since it wont bother any of you guys as much as it did for me. Also side note, for some reason this game has KERNEL LEVEL anti cheat for a SINGLE PLAYER game. People should look more into this because this is concerning especially for a game released from china."
Negative,"TLDR: It is not worth the price.This game has some pros, but it is far from being 9/10 and I'm going to focus on things that made me leave a negative review after almost 10 hours of playtime.Combat is good overall but gets boring quickly as there is 1 light attack combo (press X...) which you use 99% of a time.Low attacks variety - Besides basic attack there are 3 special attacks with some variants in skill tree from which I was using only 1 variant, counter attack/parry. I've simply found after some time special attacks are not worth the risk. Basic attack damage is low, some bossfights feel like being too long just because of this - while being easy. (Minor cons) Transformation into boss has lacking moveset, it had potential, it is definetly refreshing but once you learn what it has to offer, you notice it just feels slightly worse at every aspect compared to Wukong (which isn't perfect itself). + Spells are I would say the best quality here, those are not weak like in many games, every spell feels strong, usefull and is balanced by cooldowns and mana costs.There is only 1 weapon - it has variants, with different skins, stats and passives, but that is it. It is not a downside by itself but I was expecting more from different weapons, especially because of how repetetive combat gets quickly. When you see more weapons to be crafted you hope this game gets better later, but it does not.Bosses are good for the most part. There are many unique bosses, there is more bossfights than anything else, you basically go from one boss to next one.However there are few huge problems with boss fights (some bosses are still great but it is not what most of this game looks like):Bigger bosses make your character miss a lot making those fights annoying.Second problem also is more common with big enemies, camera work is not perfect, sometimes you just don't see what you should.Some bosses have unclear hitboxes with some of their attacks.Some boss arenas have invisible walls. Not like you have go far off arena to bump into them, you will notice them and potentially die/get hit because of those.Invisible wall everywhere.You might say it is not that big of a problem, but this game has secrets, gathering, hidden buffs, even secret bosses. This is why I can't ignore the fact that everywhere you go there are invisible walls, if you are looking for all secrets this is going to be a hige problem. You can't tell if something is a hidden path or invisible wall from distance, so you end up bumping into them constantly, unless you stick to main path and ignore everything else.I have RTX 3070Ti and was aiming for 90 FPS on 3440x1440px resolution.High or Low settings, it does not matter much, without DLSS best I could get was just below 60 FPS. It is clear this game was not optimised to be played without DLSS, it doesn't even have clear option to turn it off.This game looks great, but there is one big problem, it only looks great if you can run it without DLSS/AI res scaling. Any kind of DLSS makes this game ugly. It just does not work well with forest, foliage, grass, water and hairs and this game has a lot of those things. Besides just looking bad, mentioned things start flickering a lot and it is often noticable, the worst DLSS artifacts I've ever seen."
Negative,"At its very best, the game is pretty and beautiful, and the fights are spectacles to behold, without sacrificing difficulty and challenge. HOWEVER,the game is poorly optimised, and has really bad performance issues. Stutters and freezes occur when you're crossing invisible walls that split different areas of a chapter up, and initial loading of the game makes the game unenjoyable at times.The chapters and the maps are a slog to explore, and are actually poorly designed, player direction-wise. Everything looks the same, and more often than not, I've looped the same place multiple times purely because I have no idea what I'm supposed to be looking for or even looking at. What makes this worse is that the game is not a pure/true open-world game, and most of the traversal in this game occurs in carefully camouflaged hallways and corridors. It tries to mimic the beauty of open-world games, but falls flat due to this issue. While the environs are VERY beautiful to look at, it ends up becoming too same-y and an eyesore before long, especially if you're backtracking to find secrets. The game's strongest points are its setpieces and its fights, the former of which is ruined by the eventually waning of the player's sanity. The stuttering and loading issues also detract from the experience a lot. As of this review's writing, I don't recommend getting the game on PC. If you have a PS5, get this game on that instead."
Negative,"It's a good game, but if you have a amd graphics card, check your driver version, as it's possible that it will time-out and crash the game."
Negative,Wasnt my cup of tea.
Negative,"I recommend this game only if you are the kind of person that chooses ""Very Hard"" when starting a game and are comfortable throwing 10-20 attempts at every boss.I am an avid soulslike fan and hot DAMN are some of these bosses a huge pain in my ass.The game is gorgeous. 10/10 graphics.The levels are very linear, don't expect anything open world. Just gorgeous hallways.The ""secrets"" in this game everyone talks about just boil down to a fork in the road. Right goes to intended boss, left goes to ""secret"" area with boss.The gameplay is just 100 bosses with about 3-4 enemies between them (Sometimes less. Had to do three bosses back to back near the end of act 1.)There are a ton of invisible walls all over the place, it is honestly hard to tell what is an intended path and what is an invisible wall. The ""secrets"" i've missed were because a fence happened to be breakable and didn't have an invisible wall behind it, unlike all the other fenced off areas.The controls aren't super responsive, using your gourd (read: Estus Flask/Healing pot) has this weird delay to it of about two seconds before the animation begins and if you press it twice thinking the input got eaten you will use two flask charges which will most likely cause you to fail that boss attempt. If you take any damage during that two second windup window, kiss that flask charge goodbye and you just failed that boss attempt.Most bosses are right next to a shrine (Read: Bonfire, Respawn Checkpoint) but some aren't. Some are quite far away from your last respawn point and if you have to try 20 times to beat that boss, enjoy walking all the way back 20 times.Some of the skills are very poorly translated and vague. ""Each talent level considerably increases Damage Reduction upon a charged Heavy Attack.""How much more is considerably more? Who knows! is it during the heavy attack or for a short duration after? No clue!Just from testing, maxing out the talent that gives base HP increase did basically nothing, maybe 10% more HP and most bosses kill you in 2-3 hits so no change at all in breakpoints.The story is incredibly hard to follow, almost every character speaks in vague rhymes and riddles which was neat at first but 12 hours in and almost finishing act 2 I still have no idea what my motivation is besides collect sacred doodads.If you like frustratingly difficult games, you might love Wukong. If you don't, I implore you to be ready to refund because I would put this at a 10/10 difficulty (And I have 100%ed every Dark Souls multiple times over, I just got done beating the Elden Ring DLC and it took me less attempts to beat the final boss than the first real boss in this game.)"
Negative,"NOT SURE YET, seems very Linear ATM... will give it a bit longer"
Negative,bad lag and fps drops would not get untill they fix that
Negative,"An absolutely visually stunning game, marred by the fact it’s a soulslike. There has been so much effort placed into the environment design and texturing – nothing I’ve seen that even comes close in visual fidelity. Even down to the smallest details like leaf design is amazing. Then there’s the gameplay. I won’t sugarcoat it, its as boring as it gets. I do not understand the allure of soulslike gameplay, like, congrats, you pressed roll and left click for 10 minutes. When you are fighting the bosses, it’s not frustrating, enjoyable or thrilling. It’s just... boring. It’s not relieving when you beat it. Why would I feel a sense of accomplishment for rolling? I reallllly want to like and play this game more, but the bosses are so frequent and boring that I legitimately cannot be bothered. I want to explore the rest of the world they’ve created. I don’t want to explore it so much I’m willing to just yawn it out in the boss fights every 3 minutes. If you have high end PC, I recommend it getting it simply because it’s a refreshingly beautiful game. Otherwise, not really worth your time unless you enjoy soulslike spam."
Negative,"It is a game industry gem. Hard to describe how much love and passion developers put in this game. Enjoyment battle system, gorgeous visual which use all features that UE5 can provide, great story, a countless quantity of bosses, great art design, etc, etc, etc.But a big spoon of shit are traversal UE5 stutters and FPS drops. In this case if you honor yourself you can't give this game positive feedback...or maybe you like cars with three wheels. And one one thing - that other great games (especially single player games) have attention from gamers. Because sometimes gamers kill the game industry by their own hands."
Negative,"The main reason I am leaving a negative review is to help balance the positive review bombing. This game is fun for the most part but has quite a few flaws that doesn't really earn it 95% positive reviews. For all the good the game does, the games that it took inspiration from do all the ideas Wukong does but better. Plus in a couple of chapters it suffers from the modern idea that big open areas that are relatively empty equals fun. While the combat shines in a few fights for the most part it gets repetitive and eventually boring. It gives the player a lot of tools to work with but eventually you come to the realization that your basic attacks are pretty much the best way to approach 90% of fights in the game.I have only a surface level knowledge of Journey to the West so there were a lot of things story wise I didn't really understand. However, the between chapter cut scenes are pretty much works of art in their own right. Would love to see this studio make a movie or series.All in all pick this up if your itching for a slightly above average action game. But if you haven't played God of War (2018), Nioh, or Dark Souls go play them first they're just better games overall that Wukong draws heavy influence from. 7.5/10."
Negative,"So I'm 20hrs into Black Myth: Wukong and what started as fun has degraded into throwing yourself at the same boss for hours on end or spending said hours farming the same area over and over to try to level up. In both scenarios its frustrating and dull. People keep comparing it to Elden Ring, but at least in Elden Ring you could screw off and do something else if you were stuck. The linear nature of the game forces you to ram your head against a wall until you or the wall break, not a fun grind."
Negative,有显著的优点，但也有极其恶劣的缺点。2~4章的战斗部分做的非常好。尤其是几位虎形态boss，做的都极好。虎先锋可以说牌面boss了，吊打黄金树幽影。1. 地型0分。连最简单的关卡设计都没有。看着哪里都能去，哪里都是空气墙。在这样的情况下，制作组甚至不愿意给个小地图来弥补自己在场景设计方面的缺失。2. 地图尺寸与玩家移动速度不匹配。往哪走都是365里路，走到了又屁都没有。3. 美术也是跟地型一起的，0分。几乎所有的场景都是实拍，没有任何地方有美术设计的痕迹。4. 性能表现非常烂。这点跟上面3点是一起的。过于空旷的场景，毫无意义的地型和装饰物，严重拖累的玩家的机器性能。5. 隐藏要素过于阴间。不看攻略，根本无法找到。探索乐趣0分。6. 后期数据崩坏。后期一些boss长时间飞天放激光。7. 阴间掉落与个别阴间地型。8. 最终让我选择差评的原因是，垃圾剧情。也不知道从哪个二游挖过来的垃圾编剧，一坨大便。
Negative,"Graphics-wise it is very impressive, landscapes are beautiful and all the models look very high-def and the texture-work is immaculate.Gameplay-wise it has a lot to like, such as transforming into bosses you've defeated and using their movesets, but aside from that it's nothing special and most everything else has been done better in other games.It's a good first game from a new developer and you might have fun with this, but I recommend you play Sekiro or Nioh instead.EDIT: I gave it another go. I'm having fun with it, but I still can't ignore some of the weirder design choices such as all the invisible walls, weak opening chapter, and occasionally-wonky hitboxes.If you're after another experience like Sekiro or Nioh, you should just play those. But if you want something *kinda* familiar to those but also entirely different (in many bad and good ways), give it a try."
Negative,"Combat system feels like an afterthought to me. Its very generic and it doesn't understand what makes Souls combat work.Precision is key and this game has anything but that. Attacks buffer and all have varying speeds and recovery windows. Its very bad to me. This gets especially annoying when you have to time a heavy attack from those light attacks to get a damage reduction, poise-like semi parry. (obviously the intended way to play) but hey. If i can't get the attack off the second i press the button. I blame the game for it.Also doesn't help that sometimes i press the stun spell and not get it off while losing my meter. Its awful.The game also has invisible walls. That makes me feel like i'm playing a game from 2007. We have grown beyond invisible walls. Yet here they are again. There are 0 reasons for this game to have them and i think its unacceptable.People are praising this game for its beautiful graphics and i shall never deny. This is probably graphically one of the most impressive games i have ever seen. But gameplay.... The gameplay is bad. Awful even.L-game i Refund."
Negative,"The game is indeed beautiful, and the controls are pretty easy to pick up.  But man is this monkey weak!  It takes a dozen hits from his rather heavy looking staff to take out trash mobs, who can kill you pretty easily with just a few hits.  I've not made it out of the first mountain, but so far this is not open world; you are confined to a narrow corridor.  And for the bosses, the game is basically grind trash in this hallway until you level up to beat one boss, and repeat this cycle forever.  ""Temples, towns, and shops"" have been replaced with a one stop do everything shrine system, and there's zero exploration.  I guess this is China's answer to Elden Ring, except not open world.  For the kind of people who like that sort of thing, that's the sort of thing that kind of people like.  But if you're looking for an actual adventure game, instead of an Elden Ring/Souls trainer, this isn't the one, hype be damned."
Negative,erlong is a fucking dogshit boss and no one can change my mind
Negative,Bosses are too much tough for me not everone is a profecient gamer there must be a adaptive dificulty in this game.
Negative,Much of this game is filler
Negative,The camera and hitboxes are frustrating
Negative,"Intro.A lot of people are mesmerized by this game, so you'll find many positive reviews and reasons to buy it. I'm about 70% through the game[update: I've never finised it. Too boring, weak characters, nonexistent plot], and it feels like a chore. I rarely write reviews, but in this case, I feel obliged to provide a perspective on why this game is not as great as some claim.First of all, I’m playing it only because I play a lot, and currently, there are no alternatives. I'll probably finish the game, but I wouldn't if I had other options.ImpressionsNegative:- Grindy. Transitions between bosses are meaningless. Non-boss encounters are easy and solvable by simply charging at them with your strong attack. It's boring and just wastes your time, providing nothing in return. Be prepared for a lot of meaningless searching for bosses.- Weak plot, poorly crafted narrative. It's unclear why the whole story happens. Before the game, you're given an interactive prequel that just happens without clearly explaining what led to it. Throughout the game, you encounter blank characters without any explanation about them. Every time I meet someone new, I’m like, ""WTF, who is that, why is that?"" The game does nothing to properly introduce your allies or even your enemies. Role-play and story in this game are non-existent.It would have been nice to have a storyline because it acts like a thread on which you can string the pearls of boss battles and events to create a connected masterpiece, but alas.- Weapon variety: Doesn’t exist apart from ONE, not-so-strong weapon.- Skills variety: Kind of exists, but very weak and not expressive.Positive:- Visually beautiful.- Amazing variety of bosses. Each is unique. They've done a good job here.- Interesting to see a bit of Chinese lore.- Summary: Realistically, this game excels at boss fights. There are a lot of them, and some are challenging and interesting. The majority, however, are easy and take only 1-2 tries to beat. This game is very poor at storytelling and plot. If you enjoy RPGs, I recommend skipping it.To me, after 70% of the game, it feels like a meaningless chore where you grind from boss to boss through hordes of repetitive enemies."
Negative,"I will try this game again in the future, but I have submitted a refund request for the time being. The game stutters frequently, and is especially bad with audio, mostly in cut scenes. Audio lag is extremely delayed in cut scenes. When playing, it runs pretty smooth 80% of the time, but still suffers from occasional stuttering. I look forward to getting it again in the future once it has been more optimized, as the game play itself is very fun and satisfying, and the story and concept are very appealing. PC stats:MSI 4070 SuperRyzen 7 5800x64GB DDR4 ramb550 mobo"
Negative,The hit-box is quite strange and the invisible wall problem make my crazy. The map lacks of easy identified object for path finding.
Negative,Chapter 3 makes me want to kms
Negative,"My god the combat in this game is just left clicking and, occasionally pressing right click. Booooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrringgggg"
Negative,"Whoever comments ""you just suck at the game"" is gay"
Negative,CRASHES On multiple settings with FSR enabled. Low FPS on 7900XTX. Unplayable at the moment. Doesnt work on low settings either
Negative,"There ain't much exploration. This is basically boss rush game for what i'm experiencing. I love to explore the maps and find all the places, but this is just boss rush for my 4 hour experience."
Negative,"This game is a boss rush thats not fun dont waste 60$ like i did, go buy space marine 2 or God of war Ragnorak."
Negative,"I don't want to yuck anyones yum, but this is just another Dark souls type of game and as much as I'd like to keep and play it. I refunded it once I figured it out. Good luck to those that really enjoy this game!"
Negative,"The gameplay seemed great but I had to refund since it was crashing constantly, despite my decent PC. I have a 4060 and Ryzen 5 5600, and I was using only Medium settings, DLSS, RTX Off - and it was frequently crashing. I think I will buy the game again if I hear that they fixed these issues."
Negative,"Its Ok, but really just boss fight after boss fight and kinda loses substance pretty quickly. Decent world and concept, unique skills, and interesting character designs, but it feels like its lacking something to me. Kinda surfaces deep. Pretty surface, but thats all you get. Get it on sale, or save your time and money."
Negative,"Game crashes everytime, discriminates against AMD graphics cards. taiwan is better than china"
Negative,"great visuals. nice fighting.where's the plot/story?RPG, Action RPG? Nope, souls-like."
Negative,"Alright, there's some problems here.This game relies almost entirely on dodging, using lock-down abilities, or temporary invulnerable states. If you don't like the Elden Ring mystery delay on all attacks, this probably isn't for you. The Monkey King hits like a wet noodle, leaving most high health enemy fights a boring HP sponge-fest. The lock-down abilities, largely the 'stun', is nice, but is one of the few reliable ways to ensure you do damage. The temporary invulnerable state you unlock early is incredibly underwhelming. Guides indicate the damage is significant, but even once the status effects are triggered, it does little to add to the fight except giving you an extra health bar.Many boss fights devolve into slapping at them to build your meter, stunning, then releasing a one button damage attack.Spirits, in case those interest you, are largely useless and forgettable save for their passive buffs. Well, less than useless, as using double trigger input to execute them is hit or miss. The issues with controls are something else altogether (i'm looking at you type b controls that sometimes just spin your weapon instead of sprinting).The enemies in the levels do nothing to prepare you for the upcoming boss. They are completely unrelated. You will not have an advantage learning how to deal with enemy attacks in the level, as each boss has nothing to do with any of the enemies encountered. In fact, except farming them for experience, you can just run right by them. Additionally there is an enormous gap between enemy difficulty and boss difficulty. You can just spam a simple attack to get through the enemies in the level, but you are punished for the same thing on bosses.Most consumables are very easy to miss. Granted, most do not matter at all until later in the game, but even post-boss loot is a small, slightly twinkling container that contains very useful items. Being that there is no map at all, it can be hard to remember where anything is, or backtrack to search for missed items.Also, don't expect much in the way of explanation. Though things do unlock as you progress, there are mechanics whose importance is understated, which often lead to boring attack patterns. Your main mechanic for damage is to wet noodle spam until you build up 'two dots' on your 'stance icon' (which is poorly explained), then charge the attack and release, or just hit it once if they are stunned. Except for spending an exorbitant amount of time memorizing boss patterns, the only time you reliably hit these charged attacks is with your stun, which has a long cool down and limited uses.The graphics are incredible, the item descriptions include fun stories somewhat related to abilities, and I really want to like this game.The truth is that I keep quitting, then reloading, which for me is a bad sign. If your mechanics are poorly implemented enough for me to leave the game in frustration, what exactly, aside for money invested, is encouraging me to play the game? It's like any other game that is close to greatness, but stumbles with execution. I throw myself against bosses multiple times and do not find any noticeable reason why I won this time, and lost several times previously. It feels like rolling dice. You only need to play against the wandering wight a few times, encounter his three-part slam attack to understand why this is troubling.Wait for this one to go on sale. If you don't like Elden-Ring-esque dodge or die mechanics, you will probably end up just as frustrated as me."
Negative,"Hey everyone. This is DunamisOphis. This is my first review of a game on steam. I'm an animator who has worked at game companies and large animation studios. I also do gameplay videos on DunamisOphisGameplay/YT. I've only played for 9 hours, but these are thoughts so far.1. The aesthetics of the game are amazing. The modeling, texture, surfacing, lighting, animation, effects, and sound are brilliant and unique.2. The sound has problems. When I first started the beginning of the game with the cool cutscene animations with the main antagonist villain, the audio was cutting out repeatedly and it was delayed. It may be a lack of hardware on my side, even though my computer is capable of rending in Autodesk Maya, Adobe Premiere, and After Effects. I've also played Star Wars Battlefront II and Unreal Tournament Pre-Alpha, which are heavy games. I had no serious issues with them.3. The environment looks good. For those who are curious, this is not an open world game. I haven't seen too many trailers because I try to avoid most trailers. However, based on what I have seen in the game before it was released, the trailers could delude many into thinking this is an open world game. This is more of a Devil May Cry environment that seems more limited than DMC. What do I mean? Well, you go from stage zone to stage zone. You can travel to the different zones using checkpoints. You can see lots of cool environment, but there are lots of invisible walls blocking areas. That is what I mean when I say it's not open world. It's very focused on a specific path.4. Dodges. The dodging in this game is absolutely terrible. I haven't played Dark Souls games, Elden Ring, or Bloodborn. I think the dodges are similar to those games. Someone correct me if I'm wrong. Basically, you have to dodge at the precise moment a 50 foot beast swings a claw at you. It has to be a ""Perfect Dodge."" Otherwise, even if you dodge, you will still get hit. That is because there is no invincibility or intangibility while using the dodge. The best thing you can do is dodge forward to get behind the enemy, or dodge to the side and hope a huge arc attack doesn't hit you anyway. If you dodge backwards, the bosses launch towards you in all sorts of crazy ways.5. The difficulty is ridiculously high. I'm level 30 on my latest stream recording. I have spent multiple hours on multiple bosses. There are not enough small enemies in the game to practice to adjust to all of the techniques. After I defeat one mini boss, another big boss is around the corner near a pond or temple. 90% of the main enemies in this game are bosses. There are also no good explanations on many of the properties and mechanics in the game. I was very confused on the “Focus” and “Mana” in the game for a long time. I didn’t understand focus until I started fighting the small skeleton enemies in the bamboo area repeatedly to level up. I still don’t know how to get more mana outside of resting. It seems very limited in battle, and the giant bosses have high defense and stamina. They can always knock me down with every attack, but I can only knock them down after multiple light attacks and a heavy blow. I’m currently stuck on the giant Black Bear Guai. There are only 8 or 9 days until Star Wars Outlaws releases. I will try to finish the game before then. If not, I’m moving on. 6. There is a lack of growth in the game. I gained ten or more levels (18 to 30) to return to the giant Black Bear and fight him. I don't feel more powerful. No matter how many skill points I use or change around, none of it feels like an improvement in overall strength and abilities. There are items necessary to create or unlock special abilities in the game, or upgrade weapons and armor. Many of the items have not been introduced in the game yet. That doesn't make sense. I would like to upgrade my useless health gourd, but I can't do much because I lack the items.7. The abilities are cool in the game. So far, my favorite is the Cloud Step. It reminds me of Aizen Sosuke's Kyoka Suigetsu from Bleach anime. However, it's still weak. My other favorite ability is the duplicate (clone) ability I saw in the main introduction scene in the game. That reminded me of the Forbidden Kingdom movie with Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It's unfortunate that the cool abilities are overshadowed by the difficulty and lack of growth in overall power.In addition to this, the combos in the game are lacking and limited. It's not a Devil May Cry combat game, which it shouldn't be. It's mostly just tapping the light attack button and the heavy button. The animations look cool though.8. In conclusion, it's a very cool looking game, aesthetically. However, it has lots of major flaws. It will take a long time to beat the bosses in the game. There are other major games coming such as Star Wars Outlaws and Dragon Ball: SPARKING ZERO, so hopefully I can finish this game before the other games release. This game is getting frustrating and repetitive."
Negative,"Boss rush, the game.Bosses have dumb mechanics and are health sponges with very low character power progression."
Negative,"After really taking my time with this game, I can't ignore that while it starts super strong, it all kinda falls apart in the second half. By the time you hit chapter 4, the narrative starts to lose coherency unless you're a diehard journey to the west scholar, any sense of creative fight design is out the window and replaced by scammy gimmicks designed to nerf your progression and force you into basic play where your only tools are dodges and light attacks, and it's so riddled with minor bugs that while you can play mostly unperturbed, any extra exploration or effort towards 100% will inevitably slam you with a bugged quest line or boss fight. It's just straight up sloppy for a game presenting itself as a AAA experience, Ubisoft finishes their games better than this, and that's saying something. It's hard to say don't buy this game since the first half is so strong, but if you're on the fence, my best advice is wait for some patches."
Negative,"I am at the start of chapter 4 now so far none of the characters be they allies or enemies have been properly introduced which means I have no clue who anyone I meet in the game actually is or what their deal is. The dialogue often feels straight up nonsensical which I assume is a symptom of the script translating horribly from chinese into english. Once you start actually reading what the characters are saying it usually boils down to a whole lot of nothing.The story structure as a whole is confusing, just take the jarring transition between act 1 and act 2 as an example. Act 2 just starts with you in a completely unknown location seemingly completely disconnected from where you just were, with a completely unknown character introduced and you laying there riddled with arrows with no context given to the situation.For some extra confusion add a bunch of missable and hidden content and the complete lack of a map or any sort of navigation tool and you will end up getting lost, missing stuff and being forced to look up guides.The gameplay really is fun but at this point its not enough to carry the entire experience when the narrative and writing fails this miserably"
Negative,"Honestly, I really enjoyed the combat and game mechanics, but the technical issues just ruined it for me. In my short playtime, I experienced three crashes, a graphical preset message in the bottom left corner of the screen that obscured the HUD and wouldn't go away, an issue with the main menu wherein the camera moved to directly behind the protagonist and none of my inputs would register, and extremely delayed button inputs.I'll re-purchase when things are more ironed-out. I'll now take all the joker awards from Chinese gamers."
Negative,"Will change this to a yes once they do a ton of QOL fixes in chapter 3.Being knocked off the side when unexpected, running across bridges with arrows and having dodge mechanics jump off etc..Further the whole alarm/red mechanic that is unavoidable is not fun in the slightest, especially as you simply need to wait it out."
Negative,"TLDR: The story makes zero sense, the combat is more of a grind than difficult, and the level design / QoL mechanics are bare bones at best. It's a pretty boss rush with a ton of similar bosses if you're into that. Story: The story is my biggest issue with the game. I can handle meh combat and lack of QoL features, but this story is so hard to follow and so badly strung together that even people who are intimately familiar with the original story have complained about it. The story is HEAVILY dated with zero modern or relatable themes mixed in. For those looking for more progressive themes, all women are only portrayed as obsessed with one thing with zero substance. However, if you prefer more focus on classic manly competition, the men aren't much better. They are all obsessed with power and make common stupid mistakes, like leaving enemies alive and giving into their feelings so the main character can do their work for them. The story also expects you to know Wukong's life and simply forget previous chapters and stakes. The worst part is that all the interesting characters you see in the beginning never exist in the game again and it is never explained why they simply disappeared for hundreds of years. That level of inconsistency happens at every single new chapter. Killed a demi-god? Zero impact. Killed someone being controlled by someone else? Zero impact. As an achievement hunter, I was extremely disappointed to power through almost 50 hours just to get to one of the worst endings I've ever seen. It explained next to nothing and expected me to replay the entire game again for a for just another meh ending with zero things actually tied up. It felt like a major slap in the face for all of my efforts to be for literally nothing.Combat: You can change your build before EVERY boss fight. So combat becomes repetitive after you learn to counter the 3 based enemy builds: Speed, Power, Tank. Magic variety doesn't really exist in the game and maximizing the FIRST spell you ever get with the FIRST armor set you get makes it easy to cheese the game. Also, the game hands you consumables that reset all cool downs, fully restore you, AND literally make you invincible with no limit to farming the resources for these. So if you're really stuck just stock up on those. If you don't die on the first few bosses, you likely won't die most of the game.Level Design & QoL: There is no map and no quest tracking so you're intentionally left wondering ever forward. When you find a cool location it's usually useless until you somehow happen upon the original quest's start. I've never had to google where to go and what to do so much for a supposedly linear game. There are also MANY quests that you get locked out of at the end of each chapter with zero warnings and no way to backtrack. Want that secret ending? Good freaking luck finding it naturally. The levels are filled to the brim with invisible walls, with the last chapter being the worst because it gives you a great sense of freedom only to unleash you into a mostly empty, confusing, and very open-looking map with road blocks like stat checks that are never explained. I died more times to stupid OHKO mechanics OUTSIDE OF COMBAT than actual challenging gameplay. I understand it's a small studio, but when the community can make a hand-drawn map and multiple guides with much better warnings in under 12 hours, that's just crappy and poor game design by the devs. I'd strongly suggest waiting for this until the hype goes down, then watching a before you buy type video, and THEN to go on sale for $20ish. My 50ish hours were mostly dedicated to trying the black dog in the first section of the game and a crap ton of needless backtracking until I gave up and looked for guides online."
Negative,It crashed my current high end gaming pc before I could even get through the first cutscene.
Negative,Combat and action queuing require more polishing.

Negative,very slow reaction commands
Negative,"good game brought down by awful optimisation give it a month before buying and playing as even the lowest graphic has constant errors, cutscenes look like slideshows, voicelines and animations are out of sync, the cutscenes dont even load properly half of the time being able to count the pixels. the game is great from a gameplay standpoint but until it's patched its barely playable"
Negative,"Boss simulatorRefund and watched the whole game on youtube instead, its beautiful but no free exploration, just linear into boss fights, Dark souls and Elden Ring are better.This game is very much similar to a lot better game i strongly recommend, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, with more story, lots of fighting class of choices and also more contents."
Negative,"This is a very good game, but I'm going to be a butt-head and nitpick. This is a thumbs down to PC vs PS5, if you have a Playstation. There's an important missing piece on the PC end- one which I hope will be remedied. The fixable thing is the native PS5/PSX controller support. It's a PS5 game, and it's a real bummer that Steam Input is required to be Enabled in order to use a PS4 or 5 controller. No haptics, and for me, no vibration at all. It's a let-down, to be sure- action games like this should be played on controllers (in my view), and haptic feedback really elevates the experience. Having NO vibration at all is kinda unacceptable.But here's the big complaint about Black Myth, and the reason that this game is an 8/10 instead of a 9.5:Wukong is the best-looking game I've played or seen; even with RTX on medium, the scenery is truly stunning. Also stunning are the invisible walls that you run into... everywhere. It's a real immersion-breaker, especially in a game that features a substantial amount of exploration. It's appallingly bad.It's surprising to me that they would invest so much towards graphical fidelity, and then squander the effect by regularly reminding you that you're navigating a box of code. You frequently can't access areas that are totally open from a visual perspective. I assure you this complaint is not cherry-picking a few bad moments- there are sections of any given courtyard or vista that are just not accessible. It's remarkable, and unfortunately, it really undercuts what could have been an incredible gaming adventure. As it stands, this is a great action game with incredible graphics and atmosphere, but it's unlikely to be remembered as an all-time great. I may sound like I'm making a mountain of a molehill, but this invisible-walls shortcoming has a pronounced effect on the overall experience. When you can't figure out where to go, and there are 2 immediate areas which by all rights SHOULD be accessible, it really takes you out of the moment.The mechanics are quite interesting, but they are not well explained. You'll have to do a little experimenting to figure out for yourself what 'seeing through' an enemy attack means, and how to know if you've done it- but it's worth the struggle. The controls themselves are mostly good, but there are some input registry issues. For example, sometimes I'll come out of an evade and try to heal, only to find out, a few precious moments later, that I have not whipped out my gourd. These issues are not random, though, so you can learn to work around them.I play 1440p on a widescreen, and this is the first game that made me wish I had splurged for the 4090. The 4070ti does run it very well, and it's gorgeous, but you can't quite get away with maxed RTX/Cinematic settings unless you want to make some compromises on framerate- which I would not in an action game like this.If you have the option, you might want to pick it up on PS5. I'd rather have haptic feedback than the extra graphical boost. I did a lot of complaining here, but I do want to emphasize- the good is VERY good, and if you care to explore and dig deeply, I think you've easily got over 40 hours of game in one run."
Negative,"Is a fun game but with a lot of problems. First of all performance is not great and not consistent at all through the chapters. There's a beautiful world to look at but full of invisible walls that takes me out of the immersion. The world is overall pretty empty, you basically go from boss to boss and there not so much other to do. Wait till it goes on sale, i regret paying full price for this."
Negative,"No, I do not recommend this game. I actually dont know, where all the positive reviews  came from. This game has a lot of things, souls community wouldnt forgive other Souls-like games. Yes this game is not as much souls-like as others are. But still. Invisible walls, blocking constantly your movement.Large empty areas (Frozen Lake, path after spider boss running sequence,...) - developers do not reward you for exploring.A lot of useless stuff, such as 75% of souls of the enemies you can use to do ""single"" attack. High not responsive game, where no matter what time you ""dodge"" some attack will still hit you, no matter how quickly you hit, the enemy wont get damage.Some areas are with very large distances between shrines (bonfires) and some are having shrines literally 50 meters from one to the other.Game itself is NOT BAD, but it is not anything that should have ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" review. I think 90% of reviews are from China speaking players, I understand they're proud, but for others who do not buy games for NATIONAL purpose. Buy in sale. Try to have your own opinion. Dont be a monkey...."
Negative,"Movement is clunky. This Wukong clone has no idea how to turn in place. Instead he'll walk forward. I suspect he can only walk in 8 directions. Also, I can never tell if I'm actually running unless I'm wearing two pieces of armor dedicated for running. Jump attacks target the unit closest to you and not the unit you are currently locked on. Why even bother adding a jump button?  Few enemies have attacks that are low enough to jump over. Most attacks will hit you in the air. Invisible walls everywhere, even on ledges and cliffs except on certain areas. I get that it is a boss rush game but why the invisible walls? Let me jump and stand on the environment.Every enemy and boss have very delayed attacks (it wasn't fun in ER and it isn't fun here). Combat is sluggish and slow because of that. There is very little incentive to fight the mobs and to not just rush past. Your early spells are too strong and trivialize boss fights when used.On the bright side, most bosses are unique. The game looks pretty and isn't very difficult so far. Maybe if I was more familiar with the story of Journey to the West I'd be more invested in the game. I honestly believe that if you were to remove the name Wukong from the game, it'd be an obsolete game."
Negative,"Pretty fun for what it is. Run here mash a button run there mash a button. Rinse and repeat. Going to keep playing.I give it a negative since some flaws.-Camera is bad at times.-Target lock is shite.-And For some (this is the biggest one) reason when I start game it re sets my resolution to 2560x1600 when I had it at    1440. Wont let me change in game menu's. I have to hit the windows key to go into settings and then to find that it is    setting up a second display for the game. I am on a laptop, and I only use a second display when home. Wouldn't be an    issue, buuuuutttt, it makes the picture look weird and has a RGB effect that will go around the screen. Oh yeah it still    displays on my screen that it is in 1440 resolution (black bars on top and bottom) even know in g ame setting is at 1600. I will update review if things get resolved."
Negative,Тупі китайці зробили босів легшими ніж простих мобів.Ахуй ігра.Міні-босів важче вбити ніж босів.Баланс дуже гарний.
Negative,"Invisible Wall Simulator' keeps crashing after the Deer boss fight in Act 6. I've beaten the boss four times, and every time the game crashes right after the cutscene. Honestly, dogshit!"
Negative,1/10 game for the rng trophies
Negative,"Bro genuinely this game is GOTY contender for me, if it wasn't for that dumbass final boss in chapter 2, not even difficult in a fun way, this is just awful."
Negative,"In today's gaming world, a game that doesn't allow you to customise controls is not a good thing.  I've had to request a refund due to this issue as I simply cannot play using a controller, nor can I re-define most of the key bindings.  It's a shame as I was really looking forward to playing this."
Negative,Good graphics (although the animation is far from realistic) but the gameplay gets old soon after Chapter 2. Starting at Chapter 3 the storyline is so thin that there is pretty much no logical reason for most of the boss encounters. The attention to detail is also lacking in programming the maps and basic actions. E.g. there are invisible walls everywhere yet there are places the character can fall or get stuck so easily.
Negative,"frustratingly hard too early in the game, will put off too many average gamers"
Negative,tiger too hard and theres no woman monkey
Negative,"Runs somewhat poorly, has some visual bugs i can't stand"
Negative,Looking for my day 1 patch??
Negative,the game crashes every 5 minutes after chapter 5 sometimes even makes the PC tu shut down I tried everything to fix it but nothing seems to work I have a 5800X3D  and a 4070 Ti
Negative,"Just like Sun Wukong itself, this game is a master of illusions - looking like big open world while it's a linear convoluted game with numerous invisible walls, pretending to be a soulslike RPG while there's just 1 moveset and perhaps 10 sets of armors to choose from without major differences, impersonating an AAA game while it's AA at best. Not that all of the above is terrible per se but compared to what it tries to be it's nothing of the sort."
Negative,"I really wanted to love this game but it simply has too many problems. 1. First of all it forces you to use DLSS, FSR, XeSS or TSR. I have 7900XTX and game looks like CS 1.6.2. Second thing is its a boss simulator. there is little story in between and its just jamming challenge after challenge into your face. Game feels like running out of hell not monkey on the jurney.3. Shops, potions and crafting is super bad in my opinion. 4. Combat is not rewarding at all. You do a perfect dodge on enemy and hit them from behind, and guess what nothing happens, they continue their 15 move combo killing you instantly.5. Reigniting sparks is bad in my opinion as you don't get challenged for what you picked. Its like ""here take whatever is best for you any time you face difficulties""6. Getting constant error message ""10007 auto save failed."" which doesn't just pop up, it blocks your whole game while it is still working in the background.I understand there is a skill issue as I don't really play this kind of games but I really wanted to give it a try. Bad experience for me, hope rest of people enjoyed it."
Negative,"If you liked Elden Ring, then you'd love this game and you should buy it.  It is very beautiful with a very unique art style, that being said, for me it lacks a unique gameplay loop. It is fight the grunts, die to the boss, fight the same grunts, die to the same boss. There is around 40 hours of main story to be played but I wonder how much of that is fighting the same 6 grunts over and over in the same monotonous cycle. And the main thing for games like these is the challenge, but I just do not find it fun. Why would you play a game for just challenge alone, the combat (in my opinion) is lacking, and the only thing keeping you going is the same loop from 10 minutes in the game. I do think that the aesthetic of the game is great and I love that there is a Chinese company breaking into the AAA gaming industry, yet an elden ring clone with the difference being combos and spells is just not enough for me personally. I also think that combos are very lacking, maybe God of War spoiled me but combos are not diverse and half of the time you cant get them off because the enemy will just destroy you while you're doing it. So it goes back to the elden ring style of 'roll, roll, roll, attack once, roll roll'. I don't think this game is really a story game, and I think its supposed to be this way. There is a story but its as about in depth as a Call of Duty campaign. But I do not fault the game for this, they just didn't want to go in that direction. I was mislead into believing there would be a full story comparable to games like God of War 2018.I will be finishing the game and if my mind changes by the end of it I'll change this review, but 13 hours in and I find it more of a chore than any fun. I feel I am alone on this opinion so don't listen to me if you want to try it, its just not for me so far."
Negative,Not my type of game and poor execution. Looks awesome but runs meh. Marketed as NOT a souls game yet is one. I don't like souls games so if you do ignore me.
Negative,"Crashes and performance drop :/ Gameplay, lore and visuals are great.Chapter 1 ran smoothly for me but in chapter 2 I've already crashed more than 5 times"
Negative,"The game is extremely boring, and the combat feels uninspired. I don't get the positive reviews at all. It’s just unnecessarily hard without offering much to justify it. I can’t understand why anyone would enjoy these Souls-like games, which seem to substitute a compelling story (lacking, especially when you know anything about Chinese Mythology) and engaging world exploration with difficult bosses, I'm guessing to distract from the lack of polish and depth in those areas.Somehow Outlaws is better than this, lmao."
Negative,"The lock-on camera, hit boxes, and input registration (or lack thereof) are inexcusably bad. You don't notice it all the time, but for many of the mid-game bosses it means you aren't fighting the boss, you are fighting the controls. This is especially true for bosses that are physically large."
Negative,idk why i keep torturing myself with these retarded games all of them make me feel like a rat fighting versus gods and killing them after so many tries  doesn't even feel like i accomplished anything it feels like i just got lucky phonk this sh3t honestly
Negative,"My god I cannot stand this game. Combat is horribly unsatisfying and game has an incredibly fake scope of scale, invisible walls everywhere. Bosses take too long to kill and the game is clearly not made for fighting more than one enemy at a time"
Negative,"I REALLY wanted to play this game, but I cant get past the first cut-scene, it CTDs, I have a monster of a PC to play games of this scope and i shouldn't have to roll back drivers to get this to work. i may come back to it later when its 20 bucks but paying 60 bucks for something unplayable doesn't make sense to me."
Negative,"The prison section should be removed. Everything about it is terrible.The hitboxes are quite often much smaller than collision boxes and are at the rear end of the boss, always inducing extreme frustration when hits don't connect but the collision still happens."
Negative,"The game is great and i enjoy it, but i can't recommend it. Aside from the fact my computer is starting to get random issues ever since i played the game (yesterday my wi-fi completely shut down while playing the game, forcing me to reset the network card for the first time in years), the game encounters some difficulty spikes that would be frustrating for player not as determined that i am. The game felt fairly easy until the tiger boss, as a souls veteran, but this boss was like going from fighting mouses to fighting a rock giant, compared to any of the other bosses. And the next one, that follows right next, is the same kind of difficulty without anything to really fight in between to upgrade your character.Until now, the game pace was flowing, offering you to craft a new armor before a major boss, get new points to spend in the ability trees. What you would expect from an action RPG as the devs claim the game to be. But now, all of the sudden, the game became a souls like out of nowhere. And if i enjoy soulslike, this game is not advertised as one so i can't recommand this game as an action-RPG to any people who do not enjoy difficulty, as you will encounter a wall mid playthrough.Edit : So after spending a few more hours in it, a few bosses later, i'd say the biggest issue of the game is the basics of the fighting gameplay. The parts that are added, like the spells, are really enjoyable. But the core of the gameplay, the combos, the dodging, all of it will start getting repetitive once you've spent some hours getting used to it. To start with, not being able to dodge while stuck in some combos animation is a real bother, in a game like that where bosses will punish you a lot. The animations of mixed combos are way to slow to be able to use it when you really need it, because it will either miss the opponents or cost some chunk of life by the time the animation processes. And though you can get some new finishers by spending points in your ability tree, none really feels interesting, they're all kinda slugish.So overall, i definitely can't recommand getting this game for such a high price, because being beautiful and being inovative is not enough nowaday to make a good game. No point in having all of these if the game fails to keep the player in for a whole playthrough. And this come from a guy who usually play the hell out of these kinda of games."
Negative,"Play it if you fancy what you see. The two hour refund window is there for a reason. I'm enjoying it. You may, too.Edit - I would like to make a correction: play it if you fancy taking your chances with Denuvo. I played through a good chunk of the game and now I'm refunding it because it simply refuses to validate. At this point i cannot recommend any game that uses Denuvo simply because i don't enjoy playing russian roulette with whether the antitamper will let me play the game i spent money on or not."
Negative,Can't get passed the shader compilation. I've done everything I've been told to do to fix it and still nothing.
Negative,"I would like to point out that I've been following more or less closely the development of this game since 2020, but wanted to keep an honest an unbiased view of it and not hype for it. The main point I want to get trough is that the game has a beautiful presentation with a lot of great ideas, most of them are fairly well executed but some of them are not finished to my taste. What a view here is some type of combination of different genres of games that more or less work together. In my opinion, the game picks up on chapter 3/4 and 5 but the first two and the last one are not specially to my liking. I like the little secrets here and there but overall the experience of the game is being positive. Now comes the things I honestly don't like. The game presents a lot of different options that, at least to me, are extremely swallow. The melee combat wants to be a power fantasy where you are the Monkey King but the boss fights have an odd Souls-like taste that doesn't work with the moveset your character has. You have extremely long animations for each move which don't represent a real sense of damage if you cut combos short. Using Heavy Hits during combos works but it doesn't flesh really long cool combos like the ones you can find in a Devil May Cry per example. The transformations are mostly cool and bring something new to the table, but the spirit uses (with the QI gauge) are mainly meh and nothing special, they just add an (unnecesary in my opinion) extra layer. The ""mantles""  or special items you can find in each chapter for that specific chapter boss are mainly... useless? I honestly didn't bother with them because they are a small defensive power up. The spells can be divided in two categories; Must Have and Useless. While the clones, the freeze and the dodge are really damn good, the rest of them are quite meh, nothing special and I mostly ignored them. Finally, I'm not a bif fan of the resource managment in this game, specifically the mana bar which depletes really fast and there is no realy way to repelnish it. The methods found in the game are quite terrible in my opinion. Other things I really found unfun is the exploration limited by plain invisible walls that are not hidden by any means and a weird sensation of ""lack of mobility"" when I am playing the Monkey King. Overall for me, the game is a 6.5/10. Doesn't live to the hype, and for me some spectacular visuals don't compensate for a weirdly put together product in other areas. Even when it's a 6.5, I can't give a recommend for this game. I enjoyed what I played and will probably try to do all bosses and stuff, but for me it's nowhere what the steam reviews are showing."
Negative,"graphics are really nice but the combat feels horrible, there seems to be a delay in my inputs and i dont like that"
Negative,"Cool cutscenes, but no real substance other that constant boss fights that are overly difficult for no measurable reward. Extremely linear progression, no open world exploration, and no coherent quest progression. There isn't even an in-game map to show where you are, you're just walking down a 1-way path and dealing with boss after boss - much like an arcade game. You also can't change bindings on PC when using keyboard/mouse, you'll have to use other software to do so. Additionally, game performs poorly on an i9-13900K w/RTX 4080 - lots of frame drops and stuttering on max settings. Made it 2/3 of the way through chapter 1 before requesting a refund, simply not engaging/rewarding enough. Way over-hyped by streamers..."
Negative,"It is not a bad game but it is also not a great game. Essentially the game does nothing, other games dont do better. Also it doesnt like to call itself a soulslike but it is absolutely one. Chapter 1 is pretty easy. Every chapter after that it becomes more and more a soulslike, just without all the armor and weapon options, that we are used to. Combat itself doesnt have input buffering and a lot of animation lock. Which leads to the player sometimes having to spam a button until the character finally does what he is supposed to. Also the map design is very bad at giving a sense of direction. Combine that with a lot of invisible walls and you got the exploration expierence.I advice to get it on a sale and only if you have played the better soulslike and action rpgs out there."
Negative,"Game keeps lagging, musik laggs, and combat is underwhelming i dont get the extrem hype around it there is no way the player count is that high for such a game. This Game feels like a cheaper version of GOW or Sekiro"
Negative,"Has ultrawide settings and two big black bars, no HDR, Optimization is meh."
Negative,"I cannot recommend this game. IT STUTTERS WAY TOO MUCH. The audio is out of sync and it freezes and stutters. From what I could play, the game is very bland other than the combat. The ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews are really confusing me. Wish i could get my money back until they optimize it better. Maybe I'll be able to play it and write a better review if they optimize it better, because i cant handle that mess."
Negative,"honestly, this game is chinese sekiro but less funwatch headless ape fight in sekiro and then watch lingxuzi in wukong, same boss practically"
Negative,"Got denovu ban hammer for a single player game, on steam... didn't even get too launch it."
Negative,You can't rebind anything to side mouse. I want to rebind the V and immobilize spell to side mouse but I can't do it. Not gonna pay for this.
Negative,keeps crashing. cant even finish cinematic intro. 7900xtx
Negative,"Developers lied and the game is literally a souls-like and every end chapter boss is complete BS unless you do a hidden optional sidequest, chapter 4 and onward this becomes the worst game I have played this year with complete BS bosses far beyond the worst of the beginning of the game.All the bosses have super delayed attacks with instant hits and roll catches that would give Elden Ring a run for it's money.TLDR: DON'T BUY THIS"
Negative,"Looks good, runs well on Linux. Too frustratingly difficult, and devs decided not to add a difficulty setting. Refunded until that changes then maybe I'll pick it up on a sale."
Negative,its so bad with lag and you need a beast of a PC to play it. i hate when games make art that only rich people can play due to god tear graphics. at least make it compatible. i have a 3080 my laptop was $2000 this is just sad on my part
Negative,"Game's combat is very fluid but the hitboxes are absolutely terrible. Attacks will not register sometimes (sometimes you teleport through the bosses, or your attacks register but you don't do any damage or the attack animation doesn't even complete)  and enemy attacks are bigger than what they seem (an AOE you are clearly outside of but it hits you anyways)Game is beautiful, the combat looks great, the fundamentals are not there."
Negative,"Can't understand Denuvo thinking different monitor resolutions are new devices, if you switch monitor or TV or streaming by SteamLink 5 times you won't be able to play the game again for 24 hours, I'll edit after fixing or removing Denuvo."
Negative,"looks smooth but plays like ass. the devs must've been smoking some fall of china type kush if they think adding random slowdowns to 50% of enemy attacks was a good idea. it constantly screws up your dodge timing and ruins the flow of combat, along with bosses constantly leaping away from the player. it's more like a 30e game and I regret buying it at full price"
Negative,amd needs fixin
Negative,"target locking is suck as fkfix your trash mission game bitch, you creating a fucking game that quests are easily missable and don't have a fucking feature to manually save, bitch you should die"
Negative,game no work
Negative,Graphics are great.Gameplay is smooth but repetitive and gets boring fast.Bossfights are cool.Levels are empty.7/10.
Negative,"So I wanna preface by saying that I am no stranger to Soulslikes, I have played and beaten about 50% of the major releases. That being said I'm sick to death of them. This game was billed as ""not a Soulslike"" but outside of not dropping your XP when you die, I can't spot the difference. I just wanna go back to a time when all 3rd person action games weren't frustration generators.That being said, its a fine game if you're still into that kinda thing. Graphics and combat are on point. The thumbs down isn't a reflection of the quality of the game, it's because I think their pre-release media tour saying it wasn't a Soulslike was a crock of sh*t."
Negative,"Sacrilege, I know.I have a 6800 XT and a 5900 X. Yes, it's just a touch older, but it is still a powerful PC, but I can barely squeak out 90 FPS on High, having to use the awful implemented frame generation, which makes it look worse than ""low"", all while my computer sounds like it's trying to work as a heater. What did they test this on? A 4090? There is no point in making the game absolutely beautiful if above average PCs that run it will become a space heater, or have a 1,600 workhorse graphics card. I've tried optimizing the game, but random settings are CPU/Graphics extensive for no reason. Why does lowering cloud textures outside of the first intro cannibalize almost 15 FPS? That means that the developers have it rendering in the background constantly. Horrible optimization ruins an otherwise beautiful game, and I have no interest in upgrading my PC to play just one game. First Descendant is just as pretty and works at a buttery 120 FPS and looks as incredible if not more."
Negative,"This game is close to being a good game but unfortunately it is made with a distinct lack of testing. For what could be satisfying and fluid fights, the scaling of the difficulty does not match the linear flow of progression. With other games that would have difficulty scaling boss battles, many give the opportunity to come back later for a specific fight in order to go level up in a different area or find a round a bout way of passing the high level required fight. However, this game has a very linear and closed off path of progression with many boss battles back to back without minor fights in between to allow for leveling up to make the boss battles feel natural with its own progression. If there was the opportunity to be able to pass a certain fight and come back to it later then maybe it would make sense, but no this game does not allow for that either. The linear progression forces the user to go back to grind the same few smaller enemies over and over in order to scale to the level that would be appropriate for every back to back boss battle. Maybe if there were more small enemies between boss battles it would help progress the player naturally to the level scaling of the much to frequent boss battles. It is unfortunate that a game that could have had satisfying, fluid battles is ruined with the poor progression scaling in its linear world. The frustration of having to battle a single boss and sometimes not even bosses over and over and over makes this game a grueling and painful experience for which it is difficult to squeeze any enjoyment out of the game play once the player loses the initial awe of its creativity. So close to a good game, but instead a horrible game play experience."
Negative,"I wish Steam had a Mixed or ""It's Complicated"" option. I lean towards not recommended if only to counteract the blind recommendations from people who hail from a country where I'm sure it's illegal to criticize the game lmaoTL;DR: Get it on sale, it's not awful but definitely carried by its presentation.I play a lot of third-person action games (100% all Souls games, Nioh 1&2, Monster Hunter World & Rise, Lies of P, The Surge 1&2, and more) so I have many reference points when it comes to things that I think work or don't. Overall, the game feels quite jank and I didn't really like the options our character had to tackle the challenges presented. The graphics are beautiful and I'm sure there's tons of fan-service here for fans of Journey to the West but I know nothing about it so the story honestly got in the way for me.To close this off, I'm just going to list some of the things that really annoyed me about Black Myth: Wukong, and in doing so I think you'll understand why I wouldn't recommend the game. I got the secret ending, so I experienced almost the entire game. The only thing left to do would be to get the collection related achievements in NG+, which I think I will pass on.In no particular order:* Destined One uses the gourd with his off-hand, leading you to at times not be able to tell if he's actually healing and double heal on accident.* No change in the way Destined One holds the staff in each stance, you have to check the HUD to verify your current stance.* Three stances yet they basically only change the heavy attack, which really just changes the way you can negate damage with it. Functionally they are almost identical.* Wukong stance obtained temporarily at the end of the game combines all three stances into one, changing the heavy attack that is performed based on how far into the combo you execute it, demonstrating just how half-baked the stance system is.* Nearly all heavy attacks, once fully charged, are incredibly slow and prone to miss even when locked on to a stationary enemy. And yet they are your most damaging attacks.* To add insult to injury: bosses will frequently input read heavy attack and teleport away or otherwise interrupt your attack. Even when you initiate the attack from Cloud Step.* To do so further: many of the bosses are immune to the Immobilize spell unless they are already staggered, which defeats the point of it being able to give you breathing room.* To go even further beyond: at least two bosses' collision boxes pushed me so far away that light attacks and heavy attack missed often, with no other lock-on points to switch to.* To ascend to godhood: bosses like to break the rules of the game.Like how they can still grab you during what should have been a ""perfect dodge"" of the animation. And do so on attacks that come out near instantly.Or like how the chapter four boss decides to disable your spells and halve your stamina once he's to about 1/3 HP.Or how if you attempt to heal against the final boss while he's not already committed to an animation, he will Immobilize you and literally steal a heal from your gourd, upping his HP.It's like they had no idea how to actually make a fight hard within the bounds of the established mechanics and instead just break the fourth wall instead when they have to.* Light attack combo upgrade that retains combo after dodge leads to situations where you want to execute a quick hit after a roll in order to follow with a heavy and ""see-through"" the enemy attack and instead get a slow attack that not only misses but gets you hit instead. Said combo upgrade locks you out of important skills after it in the tree if you choose to not get it.* Staves with interesting effects quickly become useless due to some of them not being upgrade-able.* There's only enough final upgrade materials to upgrade one set of armor to mythic per-play-through. Which is strange considering you can freely swap out skill points.* No armor set to boost thrusting stance despite smash and pillar having one.* Level design is full of invisible walls and uninspired yet graphically impressive areas with few landmarks. Chapter three is especially bad on this front once you escape the pagoda jail.* Normal enemy encounters throughout each area are mostly one vs. one, with large stretches of nothing in-between. The bosses are just about the only thing that's exciting.* Chapter six forgoes level design entirely and lets you fly around on nimbus but it's a huge letdown as the area you get to use it in is devoid of anything interesting outside of advancing through the main quest.* The secret ending's final two spectacle fights go on for far too long to be enjoyable.Don't believe the hype."
Negative,"Another day, another game with horrifically bad performance.3080 + i7-13k, 32GB RAM, running at native resolution is barely 50FPS on high (raytracing off) with constant drops into the 40s and 30s. This game has some of the worst framerate fluctuations I've ever seen.DLSS on gives some extra frames but it still remains inconsistent as all hell.Here I am, yet again, begging for optimised games without DLSS as a requirement for acceptable performance."
Negative,This game is good. but bosses is to hard for me. i cant beat tiger boss. this game overral is to hard. dislikes from me
Negative,"I honestly can't believe the reviews for this game are 96% positive because for me it was one of the most over hyped games that came out this year. When I started it was actually pretty cool, the cut scenes were sick and the story was intriguing. However after only two hours of playing the game I instantly got bored of repeatedly just pressing x and going to boss fight after boss fight. The skill tree was terrible and the game wouldn't even give you upgraded gear to fight new bosses or a weapon as the stick is the only weapon you get in the game. For me personally I think fighting a boss should be more of a special occurrence and not something to be fighting every ten minutes like it is in this game. The combat system was also very rigid and the hit boxes were terrible, I would be there just spamming the button to dodge and it would only work 50% of the time. Also the heavy attacks are so poorly optimized with the combat system which led me to use light attacks on bosses who were barely affected. I understand people like games where you just hop from boss to boss for who knows how long but for me this game just wasn't enjoyable."
Negative,"This is a really hard one for me to review, because when I am able to play the game it's great. While I feel it should've leaned more to the Devil May Cry side of action games then the dark souls, it is still good for what it does. Sadly despite me having a AMD Ryzen 5600G for my CPU and an AMD Raedon 6600XT, the games frames seem to be failing to get to 30, this became really bad when I got to the second zone of the game. After fighting the Bear boss. When I used the recommended settings it always put it on high. And when I did put the settings on low it wouldn't really help. I've had no issues with other games. Elden ring still runs perfectly fine for me, Hi Fi Rush perfectly fine, God of War, perfectly fine. I hope someone can see this and help me if it is on my side but, until then I can't recommend it."
Negative,"crafting system is useless beyond consumables, no weapon upgrading while you can upgrade armor, after chapter 4 there's no new enemy type's beyond bosses and there's 6 chapters they could of added more with Chinese mythology being the grab. But graphics and the Chinese mythology with wu-kongs story is cool as hell and the fighting is mid sekiro did better find it crazy that with Chinese martial arts a parry is a spell in this game seems extra or maybe not enough. Oh and yes 95% of the chest are useless with upgrade materials you more than likely won't use since most of the spirits you get are useless as well as the armor upgrading is near useless since you don't get the materials you need till your back to being weak for the area anyways."
Negative,Game just crashes all the time. I own a good gaming laptop that I bought this year. Unplayable.
Negative,way too hard. linear af. no story. just boss fight after boss fight. let down. dont waste your money.
Negative,until amd or the devs fix the global illumination issue that's a peoblem with amd cards where you cannot see anything covered in shadows when global illumination is turned on in this game i'll update this review
Negative,Can't be bothered to spend 2hrs for every single boss trying to memorize every single pattern and still end up losing.Most likely a skill issue but still.Graphics are beautiful and I like the combat moves but I'd rather play an rpg game for its story than its difficulty.
Negative,"8/10 for action RPG veteran1/10 for casual playerHere are the reason why I rated it like this:1)This game is on the harder end of the general gaming spectrum. It is not meant for casual player. There is only 1 difficulty. There is no “play for the story” mode.2)The game design is extremely lacking in information. There is no map, no quest tracking, no info on combination. Translation of skills and information is bad or outright wrong. All the information I learn are from 3rd party website. Things like, what does resolution strike actually do, what is the counter input, how much dmg does focus attack worth, where to get what items, what skills scale, what doesn’t, etc. Is like the developer purposely refuse to give even general information to the player. Like how long does a immobilize skill last? They wont say. You have to find out from 3rd party, who then experiment and put it on a spread sheet. Purposely withholding information, is not a skill. I find all the information online anyway, whats the point of having bad description, no numbers on spell time , no map, no quest tracking????3)The boss fights are hard. Yes I know, players who are used to dark soul, will probably gate keep and say its easy, everyone can do it. But the game is hard for the casual player base who have never play dark soul before. I will use Witcher 3 death march as a comparison. This game is probably 50 times harder. Why? Because the attack timing vs doge timing is extremely tight. We are talking about a fraction of a second. And the boss will have 3-6 attacks per attack pattern. And about 4-8 attack patterns per boss. Boss are usually big, dash, aoe, and a mix of instant teleport or delay attacks.  Which mean, if you are casual player, you will use the first 5-10 deaths just learning the attacks and when is safe to doge. Than you have to die another 5-10 times, to learn when its safe to attack. Because your attacks will not stun anyone, unless it has focus points. And boss regular light attack will stun you, and at times chain stun you. So if you eat the first attack, you might eat the whole thing. 3-6 attacks can probably kill you, unless you are over level. And yea, you know those official review that said this game is a button mashing?? You cant do that. If you just mash input like doge, you will get hit, because the boss will track where you land if you don’t time it right. In fact, any player who haven’t learn those doge mechanics will have a hard time getting out of charpter 2. Don’t believe me, just google youtube fights with charpter 1 boss like the wandering weight, or the white clan noble. And of course, tiger vanguard, that cat that has probably break many controllers.4)The story is amazing, but there is not enough cut scene to show it. If you read the massive paragraph for each character, you will find most boss have a sad and worth tell story. If you don’t read it, (I cant bother reading all of them) they are just another boss to kill. (Most of them are annoying and required 5-50 deaths to memorise their attack pattern)I hope those reading understand why I give 2 different rating. I do regret buying this game to a certain extend. But I don’t want politics to win, so I gladly keep this and slowly finishing this game. But I wont be buying its next instalment. I don’t have the time to play such a high skill cap game. If I didn’t know there is not difficulty setting, I probably wont spend time on this. Ps: I want to add one more point, this game doesn’t feel like I am building a RPG. Because a lot of the items are locked behind a certain boss clear. You can increase your level, but you cant “craft” an advance item until you clear a certain area. Weapons and amor are hard locked by area. If only this game have a lower difficulty setting...=======================================================================Update 27/oct/2024I rarely review games, nor do I update review. But I have since complete ng+, a little bit of NG2+,and a new start on chap 1 to give some perspective. I have also used the tanking building for NG+ as well. So here goes:1.Invisible walls make this game very sad as it confused players where to go2.There are inconsistent in game rule in terms where a player can fall and die. Like 1% of the whole game.3.Boss fights, are mixed of easy to frustratingly hard. Its due to my review’s reasons. The hard bosses all have a certain characteristics; Large, bad hit boxes, aggressive and attack 80% of a time, you missed one doge and you might die taking 3-5 hits in a row with no recovery, Jumping or flying all over the place, which reduce time to hit the boss, stupid delay and fast attack mixed up, very large hp, + commend grab that does a lot of damage. Everyone have different opinions who are the top bosses to fight. But I think for the top 30%, the bosses all have the above characteristic.4.Story telling isn’t that amazing. Its there, but they could easily triple the cut sene to tell the story. Like charpter 2, they could have show what happen to the city and why the people become who they are. Instead, all you get is words.5.Music is very good 10/106.So is graphic, 10/107.RPG in terms of building a character that you want? 3/10. Especially for first play through, my god … Items are hard locked behind boss clear. The starting staff you will use for the whole 1st ch. You cant even upgrade damage till the game lets you build the next staff.8.In game description still absolutely suck 3 month after release. No numbers, everything you need, you will find on website. Not in game. Things like rock solid timing, damage with 4 focus point, defence rating calculation. Like its 2024, which is developer expecting gamers to work out these number on 3rd party website??? Are we in 1994, where the developer is selling a separate guild???Conclusion. Look guys. This game is so damn polarizing. Like.. on your first play thru on chapter one, you will die a lot. When I play it againt from the 2nd time, I still die like 10-20 times. That’s with all the knowledge I know. I cant switch stances, cause not enough level. I cant use cloud steps till after kill black bear once. I definitely have no access to damage reduction gear or the full bull king set. So I have to doge everything . I don’t have rock solid, and no thrust stance till level 20. So, charpter 1 fresh start, at least for the bosses is actually harder than NG6+ with good gear. Like I can do 80% reduction+ 700 defense, + full bull king set, and I wont be stagger and can kill bosses in Ng +++++. I might not be perfect but I have luxury to make mistakes. First play thru, I don’t have any of that Luxury.So…how should I sum up this game? Should I say its soul like? Maybe its easy after NG+? Goty? Well, given how inperfect this game is, and that there are no difficulty setting, no I don’t think this is GOTY. Developer wants players to master doging, and than mixed in heavy attacks and special attacks, and spirits, and spells. Which is why on youtube, you can see those pros with no hit runs. Which is cool from their perspective. But what about the entire gaming community and the gaming consumers??? Are we all expected to have those perfect run to beat bosses? For the 1st chapter of your first play thru…pretty close that’s what you need. And the word I have heard that IMO best describes this game is that it is a “Dodging simulator”. So…is this game worth buying? I don’t think I can answer that. Because if you are good with these type of games. Sure. If you are 50 years old, and you want to come home after work and just chill for like an hour. Then I would say no. I think…thats a fair comment to make. If only there are lower difficulty, I would rate this a good 7/10 for everyone. But if time is important, then really why should someone spend their good time to memorize a boss attack pattern???? I am glad I beat this game. I hope this summery help for those reading this."
Negative,"Given all the hype and positive reviews, I really wanted to like this game. Unfortunately, I didn't.The game looks great, and the combat LOOKS fun. However, it doesn’t actually FEEL fun to engage with the combat mechanics.It feels like the game is caught between two identities: a cinematic action-adventure and a combat-focused Souls-like. As an action-adventure, the story is too disjointed, and it lacks difficulty settings and more flexible combat mechanics (animation cancelling, etc). As a Souls-like, the combat isn’t precise or refined enough.It seems like the developers aimed to blend elements from games like God of War and Sekiro. While they achieved some level of success, they missed out on the key aspects that make those games truly enjoyable to play.This is NOT a bad game. This is just not what I expected or enjoyed. I might give it another chance some time in the future when it gets a discount. For now, however, I will be requesting a refund."
Negative,"Changing my review from positive to negative after 10 hours of play time.Originally rated this game as positive after a few hours. With only an hour in, the game looks very promising.   The graphics are great (RTX 4080), the fighting seemed decent, with various stances, upgrades to armour and weapons, consumables, etc.After 10 hours in game, I've changed my mind.The game lacks depth.  Each level is basically running from boss to boss with a few random trash mobs in between.  For example, after starting the second chapter, I ran into 3 different bosses within 10 minutes.  Granted these weren't so hard to dispatch, but there isn't much else to do other than kill bosses. On of the most annoying things,  in several areas,  there are mobs up high on a cliff o whatever that can shoot fire arrows, or some other random thing.  And you can't do anything to kill them.  You can't jump up, you can't shot anything at them, so how the f**k are you supposed to kill them??  Are you just expected to run around and avoid the arrows.. WTF.Unless you enjoy a shallow game with lots of boss fights, avoid this game and saver your money.   Wasted $100 for me."
Negative,"if you were expecting a chinese god of war, this is not thatif you were expecting well telegraphed attack animations, this is not thatif you were expecting the cutscene camera to hang on absolutely nothing every few seconds and to constantly move as much as possible, this is not thatif you were expecting responsive attacks and dodges, this is not thathowever if you WEREN'T expecting a warframe like ability system, souls like campfires, respawn mechanics and map design, with bosses that force you to run them again and again and again just to figure out it's attacks, this IS that!it's a chinese souls like, not what I was expecting from the trailers, not what I wanted and not what I spent 2 days installing it for. why do people actually like this game?"
Negative,"Ok, now let's talk about this game trough that 'hype' around it.Yeah i didn't beat the game but think I've played enough to let them pull me into.Advantages: • Graphics \ The game is beautiful. Nature, water reflections etc. I think i may say that sys reqs for this game are exonerated. • Combat system \ Dynamic gameplay combined with huge variety of skills and other things which will help u in the fight. • Plot \ Ok. I'm not a huge fan of Chinese mythology so let's believe that Chinese developers represented their culture all out and correctly.Disadvantages: • Input lag \ The problem which i wasn't only one dealing with. Many people were talking about <=1s delay. Idk is it caused by in game animations or other game features, but playing with it feels terrible to play. • Exploring \ In games being able to sniff every corner of available map area was motivating me to explore and find some hidden paths, npcs etc. But here we have off-scale invisible walls quantity. In huge open area you are not able to pass through gap between two rocks, jump above leafs, or simply jump from cliff. Also some one boss fight in my experience had those walls ( we will talk about it later ). • Boss value \ In other boss oriented games after beating a boss you feel great, you feel like you overcame urself to achieve that win. In Black Myth we have some kind of boss rush, the boss quantity here is huge, and i can even say they made most of the bosses interesting, but usually it takes 1-3 attempts to beat and after 5-10 min of gameplay u will face another boss. It fail down any interest in killing bosses, you don't feel exited to meet and defeat new enemy anymore.• Yellow Wind Sage ( Boss ) \ He is epic, the fight itself looks incredible by side but..... yeah. He was the first one who took more than 5 tries from me, and on him i start to realize how broken the game. Charged attacks goes through boss and deal 0 damage to him. Boss attacks ground 100 yard from you... you will anyway receive damage without any animation and sound. Boss can simply jump through impassable for you wall and spam range attacks fro 2 min straight. For sage he has an attack where he throws big kind of rock on you which sometimes was invisible for me.And many other minor bags which smash your experience from this game.I had tried and i failed.I'm not a Black Myth hater but i'm one among few of those people who didn't enjoyed the game."
Negative,"Play Sekiro, Lies of P, Sifu, Ghost of Tsushima. The combat is tenfold more satisfying in those games with half the nifty little features required to make it even bearable in this game."
Negative,"This game is ass, If you want to play a souls game but 20times harder you might like it"
Negative,"As much as I enjoy how the game looks the combat is simply not fun for me, at all."
Negative,"Massively over hyped, must have had a real successful tik tok marketing campaign..."
Negative,"I know I'm going against the grain on this one, but it's just WAY too hard to pick up and play this game. It is beautiful, and has a great soundtrack, that much I'll give it, but overall it's just too much to try and enjoy. If you like the Souls or Soulslike games, you'll love this one. If you're like me and you don't, avoid it."
Negative,"I do not understand the appeal of this game at all. This combat is incredibly slow and stilted. The heavy attack has a 4 second long animation, despite the fact that every other combat animation in the game takes less than a second, meaning the attack is pointless to time. The game play is pretty standard hack and slash three kingdoms stuff, except there's no hoards of week enemies, only the bosses. This leaves game play designed for frenetic button pressing be repurposed to incredibly slow boss fights with non responsive controls. When I say non responsive, I mean it. I'll hit the Y button to start charging the attack. Hal of the time it will start charge, and half the time, nothing will happen. There is a visual flourish that happens when you start charging, but sometimes that doesn't go off and the charge happens anyway, meaning I can't trust the visual feedback on screen. The game is based entirely around it's dodge mechanic. So if you don't like it in the first hour, refund the game, that part never changes. Every boss battle is just memorizing when you can do the perfect dodges, and the exact moments when it's safe to heal or use a spell. This game also has awful magic. There's no way to restore mana, so I hope you made it to the boss full (actually pretty easy despite the atrocious walk back). Even basic world design is broken. The first area is this giant open jungle area with no signposts. You just wander through, occasionally find an abandoned temple, and that's it. There are signposts that stand out from the environment. i got turned around constantly, because I can't tell the generic temple I'm coming out of, from the generic temple I'm walking to. This game is exploding, and I am honestly baffled. My entire time with the game has felt like a dull exercise in misery. Oh, and for those looking to take in a little culture, it isn't based on Journey to the West, it's a fan sequel."
Negative,"The game in itself doesn't seem to be bad at all, and after all millions of players are playing it and loving it. The graphics are totally amazing, it is pretty well optimized and all.I just have 2 big griefs that made me stop playing after 2 hours.First, I am quite astonished that the game consistently crashed every time I attempted to start it and I ended up having to troubleshoot, then tweak the startup options. I forced the game to use DX-12 in the command line parameters and configured Window-8 compatibility in the shortcut. After that the game started fine. Ok you will say, what's the big deal ? Well, I don't think that I should have to do that, there is a programming issue and a quality testing issue. I happen to have pretty much the biggest computer you can have. An Intel Core i9 with 24 Cores, 64 gigs of memory, a NVidia RTX 4090, Windows 11, and absolutely nothing else that a few video games installed on the computer. All the drivers are the latest, the machine is dedicated to gaming and there is nothing on that machine that could cause problems. With such a config, I think that one can expect to see the game start normally. One would expect that they tested the game on such a config. But apparently not. In my opinion, this is really embarrassing for their studio. I might want to add that I experienced that with no other game. Actually no, sorry, Remnant 2 gave me the same problem. But generally speaking, it never happens.The real blocking factor for me is the controls. In this age, I am expecting to be able to customize my controls. Yeah, I mean, call me old fashioned if you like but I like to customize my controls. Sorry but I don't like playing with an X-Box controller, I like playing with a keyboard and a mouse and I don't like being forced to move with W-A-S-D or whatever the stupid ""industry standard"" is. I don't like having my actions on T, R, F, and what not. I like to set things up where I want them, like in... well, all other games ?I tried playing it a little bit with a controller, but I gave up pretty quickly. I just don't like it. The game places you in difficult fights from the start, with absolutely no opportunity to learn the controls or train. I was dying all the time, it just annoyed me supremely.So yeah, if you like playing with a controller you will probably be happy. But otherwise, you have been warned."
Negative,"game is pretty fun, except for when it kicks me out every 15 minutes even after underclocking to prevent it from doing so and following all the steps from their FAQ"
Negative,Pretty mid tbh
Negative,"Overall, the game is really good. Fantastic world with great attention to details, plenty of depth in terms of lore, satisfying combat with good mix melee and spells, good longevity especially if you are a completionist.The game is also pretty lenient: you don't lose anything when you die. To me, this takes away from the feeling of challenge as there is no real risk. Bosses are also very trivial, with some just being either gimmicky or with cheap moves and atrocious hitboxes (to the point that you cant hit them) to up the difficulty. In the end, you get used to it and find the beauty of this games somewhere else."
Negative,"Heavily overrated. 60€ with 95% rating... It may be game of the year, but not with 95% at 60€ and 500 000+ people worth. Got involved only because ppl lied and said it is a masterpiece. Would wait for sale otherwise. FOV is terrrible, poor performance, evidently intended as console exlusive. Took hours only to set the game up. 9/10, but since everyone is review bombing...."
Negative,"7/10 at bestA very scuffed God of War clone.Lighting is horrible and needs to be fixed. Pitch black shadows and bliding lights.most of it is fun, a bunch of bosses and levels ruin the whole thing. NOT worth $90"
Negative,"If you avoid the hype around the game and actually look at whether its good or not it falls pretty flat in my opinion. I'm not sure who would actually enjoy this game. I'm so bored of it I stopped playing after beating chapter 4.  - Visuals- Enemy visual design- Environment visual designHonestly the game is really pretty. The performance is ok but its just stunning graphically.- Environmental exploration is hot dogshit. Invisible walls everywhere and samey looking locations make for a really difficult time getting around. - Bosses are in general just meh. Really bad hitboxes along with jerky attacks that dont have good tells. 80% are a complete pushover and 20% are regular souls difficult but mostly just because they have shit mechanics. - Bad souls mechanics are here (many secrets are literally impossible to find without a guide, there is more or less no story and you are expected to know Journey to the west to follow anything)- Enemies are mediocre. About 95% of regular enemies are a complete pushover and just serve to extend game time. - Wukong's abilities are mostly lame. (Transformations are cool but thats about it)This game is like a boss rush souls game with piss poor exploration. Regular mobs are boring and most bosses look really good but dont play too well. I found myself beating most bosses within 1 attempt and the ones that I couldn't almost always had some nonsense hitboxes and poorly telegraphed attacks. That would be ok if wukong himself had interesting mechanics but thats not really the case. Once you unlock a couple basic skills each fight is basically identical. freeze -> mash square -> dodge -> mash square -> heavy attack -> repeat. You can throw in a transform/rock counter here or there but since you only have a few weapon types and they all play identically nothing changes. The 3 stances also basically do nothing beyond adding a tiny bit of variety. They don't change nearly as much as Nioh stances do for example, given that they only really affect your heavy attack. As such the game gets really stale pretty quickly. I was bored after Chapter 2 and literally nothing changed gameplay wise since chapter 1. Overall its a really pretty game with very cool references to Chinese folklore. Gameplay wise its broad and shallow. Lots of bosses and enemies but lack of any sort of player individuality makes it repetitive and boring."
Negative,"I'm sure I'm living in a separate reality than everyone else.  I keep picking up these games with overwhelming positive reviews and great critic reviews and they're just abysmal.  This pile of crap is no different.This game isn't fun, it's just an exercise in frustration.  There's no map, no compass, no indication of the direction you're heading, nothing.  No block, no parry. An apparent world that you can't explore due to invisible walls everywhere.  It looks to be a straight linear path between bosses with a few paths just looping off to give the appearance of being able to explore a bit.  But even then there is nothing really to find, just the odd mob dotted about.Skill points that seem to do absolutely nothing.  Trash mobs are laughably easy, bosses are stupid difficult. You could say its a skill issue, but in the last couple of months I have played and finished Shadow of the Erdtree on NG+, finished up the NG+ on the base game.  Bought and completed Dark Souls 3 then played Elden Ring again on NG++ up to the Fire Giant.  All fantastic games. I've over 500 hours in Elden Ring, also played and completed Demon Souls and DS1 in the past too - BMW disgusted me inside the first hour.I must have had about 50 attempts on that second boss, the one with the fire staff.  In the end it just boiled down to Immobilize, whack him a few times then kite him round until the spell came back off cooldown, rinse and repeat. Very unenjoyable fight.  When I finally beat him there was no sense of satisfaction.  More like that feeling you get when climbing back in the car after changing the flat tyre at 11:30pm in the lashing down rain.  Then getting another puncture 30 seconds later - only now you have no spare.I was all set to refund this but had gone over the 2 hours by 15 mins (again!!) so I'm stuck with this abomination.  I had another crack at the game this morning to see if it would start to grow on me - it didn't. The only thing that grew was my hatred of this title.This game has been a complete waste of money.Edit - installed WeMod and cranked up the damage I was dealing and decreased the incoming damage a bit.   This made things a bit more manageable but I felt scummy doing it.  Killed a couple more bosses but this made things just feel pointless.  The difficulty is the only thing there is to this game, there is nothing else.   It's just a boring run between bosses with absolutely nothing else.I'd score this game at 2/10 and that's just for the graphical presentation.  The game play is total arse and it is a complete insult to my hard drive keeping this trash installed.I wouldn't even pick this game up on sale at 90% off."
Negative,"This game is OK, it is not great.Visually it is amazing. but, that luster fades frequently with invisible walls and other game design sins.. Worst camera in modern games {the camera is the ultimate boss in this game}Gameplay wise, it is generic and tedious. I am not into boss rush games. And bosses with massive health bars that are battles of attrition are lame...I may play some more, but too many gimmicky bosses and not enough actual enjoyment for me.6/10 get it if you are a masochist..."
Negative,"Only time I've written a review for a game.The core gameplay is outstanding, one of the best out there.HOWEVER, the exploration is so badly done, for the hours you spend exploring every nook and cranny of the massive maps you recieve predominantly currency for progression; which you'll have an abundance of making it worthless. The best reward is secrets leading to extra bosses, which is great. Problem is you're constantly faced with the issue of progressing the story before fully exploring the area, because of the amount of one way paths; I had to teleport back so many times out of fear of missing something. Which while annoying I'd put up with because the core gameplay was so good. The straw that broke the camels back was chapter 4. Once again had the choice of going left to more area, or right to fight a boss. Chose fight the boss, little did I know, that was the final boss of the chapter, and once you beat the boss, the secret area that was left is now locked off. Can't do it gg's, have to do it in newgame+. So now can't 100% the game... Complete awful design, and it should be called out. Maps are to big for the content available, secrets getting locked off, and never knowing the boundaries of the maps; always looks like you can go beyond them with obvious ramps or caverns, but no just get invisible walled. Incredibly frustrating, and the main downside to an otherwise tremendous game."
Negative,its ok gameplay is like watered down nioh graphics are good lore is cool. gameplay is kinda boring after 5 hours no different weapons not really satisfying to play you kinda just press square till you can press triangle. overall would rate 6/10 game is for sure over hyped getting a lot of praise that is not really deserved game is definitely not a masterpiece  critics are focusing on shit that don't matter at all defenders will cock ride and scream lalalalalala when ever you bring up a criticism or say its a souls like and not a completely original masterpiece. would i recommend yes on a sale after you played the best souls like games
Negative,"If I had to give a budget breakdown of it: 85% graphics, 10% marketing, 3% background research, and 2% things that are in the game that aren't graphics. There was a hack 'n' slash LOTR game back when I was in highschool. you could play as gandalf, legolas, aragorn, or gimili. They all were basically the same. You walked around pressing x-x-y and dominated things. That was more complex than this game. Linear levels, horrible sound design, and mechanically its darksouls for sinophiles. you spend most of the time beating the crap out of furries with a stick, which while they are not called that, its what my mind defaults to when I see a human body with an animal head. Also your guide is...disturbing to look at because his head is about 70% of his total body mass. You know what happens when you have a potato sit in the dark too long? how it starts to grow roots/eyes? Its that, but with hair. I definitely would say play it, but don't do it at full price."
Negative,"Am I playing a different game? The combats ok, I guess. There's only one weapon type (a staff), so there's only one real valid combat style, which is light attack to gain up focus, then heavy attack. There's also no blocking, so you're going to just be constantly trying to time dodges. There's no story to speak of. I'm still not sure why I'm a monkey or why I'm killing all these bosses. I'm just following branching linear paths and killing things for no real reason. It's not a bad game, necessarily, but it seems like a somewhat above average Dark Souls clone. I keep expecting the game to open up into some sort of more interesting map and a message that I've now completed the tutorial, but I  think this is the game."
Negative,"This game is perfect for some people but not for me, cause I just dont like how every 10 minutes you are fighting a boss that takes you 20 minutes to beat to just face another one as soon as you are done with that one boss"
Negative,"This is a souls game I do not know why it has no tag, the entire game is going from one area to another to fight bosses."
Negative,Stop making delayed attacks as strong as the ones with momentum. It is stupid.
Negative,so the benchmark test is useless as i used it to make sure this was worth buying and now i am having nothing but issues  it said my pc could do ultra settings and its barely doing medium there are so many graphic tears and tons of lag and i just got started just another refund i guess
Negative,"Crashes in the intro sequence. Doesn't save either so I have to start over.Another certified 2024 PC release 👍At least it renders 20% of the pixels and the rest are approximated, interpolated and checkerboarded to get to a butter smooth 60 fps with upscaling and frame generation on a 7900 XTX at 4K with RT off. Games that look better run at least twice as fast."
Negative,"Don't waste your money. this was $60 of disappointing. the only thing it has going for it is the ambient environmental sounds and the graphics. everything else is awful. The game completely fails to point you in any direction, the re-spawn mechanic feels like a glitch and doesn't re-spawn you with all your stuff and as a result everything you fight gets harder each time you die because your going into the fight with fewer resources. The maps are INFESTED with invisible walls that dont even match up to the terrain AT ALL and even caused me to die in some places or completely stopped my progress because i didnt walk perfectly along the inch thick invisible line I'm supposed to take to go anywhere. The combat is even worse, half the time i cant even move because EVERY attack from ANY enemy will stun you for at least 3 seconds allowing them to rip out half your health bar, and no matter how many FULL combo attacks you make on an enemy you WILL NOT be able to slow them down. The item descriptions and bestiary entries don't actually tell you anything about what your fighting and instead only include a small tid-bit from their folklore story.the settings menu is chaotic and hard to navigate,the animations are a buggy mess to the point of attacks landing on you when the animation itself never got anywhere near you and your attacks don't land unless your standing inside the enemy, the plot itself barely describes who you are or why your there or why your even supposed to care. Overall its just a complete mess that doesn't work made by some crappy AAA studio that put all their budget into graphics and NOTHING ELSE. 0/10 would get a refund if I could."
Negative,"The graphics look nice, and the storytelling is good, but I can't be the only person who is sick of this dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, light attack, dodge, dodge, dodge, heavy attack, dodge ass gameplay in every boss fight. This gameplay is boring to me after just 5 hours. The bosses are either easy as hell and therefore completely uninteresting, or they are only difficult because they spam their attacks so much that eventually, you can’t dodge anymore and are forced to take damage. So far, there hasn’t been a single interesting boss mechanic—everything is boring. And if a slightly harder boss fight does come up, it's only difficult because the boss attacks in quick succession."
Negative,"This is my honest review after beating the entirety of it, including secrets. TLDR the game is very good butwith some decent problems. Reason its negative is so people will actually read this for information.I like most of you bought the game with the insane amount of hype it came. Monke game amazing is what everyone, including me, said on day 1. Unfortunately, past chapter 2 this game's combat design devolves drastically. Don't get me wrong the theme, graphics, and style of the game are an 11/10 but those bossfights take away alot of that enjoyment. Examples without spoilers. Multiple bosses let you hit the boss for only 1 second before it flies out of your reach by levitating 20 feet above you. A boss that forces you to take 80% of your healthbar in a cutscene that happens twice in the fight. A boss that takes away your max life and makes your screen gray. A boss that makes your dodges 3x as slow while introducing roll catches and follow up explosions after every hit. CURSE YOU YELLOW LOONG.(Edit) The game is a poop sandwich, the middle of it being horrid and the rest is great. Having finished chapters 5 & 6 I had almost no gripes. The bosses were very fun and fair, you get lots of meaningful gear upgrades and build choices. 5 | 6 is peak, 1 | 2 is great, 3 | 4 is awful.IMO GoW Ragnarok is less than a month away and it truly is an 11/10 game in all regards the entire way through. If you are pressed for cash watch someone else play monke game and spend your $60 on something else:)."
Negative,bad controls lag latency issues at times in the middle of fightsi would pass till they fix the issues
Negative,game worked then just randomly wouldnt start
Negative,can't believe i waited 3 months for this...
Negative,- only one main weapon - stutter fest engine (thanks to UE5)
Negative,"Dont get me wrong i like the game its stunning,good gameplay,decent optimization for pc but....The reason why i can't recommend it yet is because of the poor keyboard and mouse bindings u can use,from the moment that changes i will give it a like"
Negative,Idk man. I don’t get the hype. It’s a linear boss rush experience guided by lazy invisible walls. Same repetitive move sets against each boss.It’s just not fun imo. There’s no real strategy required or depth to the gameplay. Can’t recommend for the price.
Negative,"worse game of the year. i could make a better game with my ass hairs ripped out. 90% of the boss fight i can't see the boss. no setting to zoom out so that i can see boss when fighting. fuck kang-jin loong, he my opp frfr worse boss fight in gaming. a monkey could make a better boss fight. can't hit this neek for shit. got this mutt 1hp 3 times and died to thjat bullshit ass lounge move that kills fps."
Negative,I cant get pass all these invisible walls that makes you feel like you are in the tunnel. Looks like to much effort was put in eyecandy graphics leaving behind lacking game design.
Negative,No recommend until a map is implemented
Negative,The only good thing I like about this annoyingly infuriating game is the boss fights.
Negative,"Hello... The game is great.. But, I have a huge problem. I'm using my STEAM DECK OLED to play this.. And Now, i can't even play it well because there is always mouse cursor And the camera always bothering me..."
Negative,Denuvo locked me out after I tried a few versions of Proton to test compatibility on the Steam Deck.
Negative,Des longs couloirs et une difficulté trop grande.
Negative,last area ahould have stayed linear
Negative,"fun game with lots of oversights, janky hitbox and annoying bugs.. not recommend it in its current state. Wait for patches"
Negative,"The game has nice combat and looks nice, but holy shit the difficulty spikes in this game ruin it for me. So far from what I've played the game is a stupid mix of grinding for a few hours so you can finally kill a boss, then you walk through the next door and there's another boss, i'm not playing a game just to do some shitty gameplay loop, idk why this game's so highly rated."
Negative,"A Visually Stunning but Ultimately Frustrating ExperienceAs someone who was initially excited about Black Myth: Wukong, I am now thoroughly disappointed and done with this game. If you're new to action games or uncertain about complex combat mechanics, consider this a strong warning.While the game is undeniably beautiful, the gameplay quickly becomes frustrating. The combat is punishingly difficult, and despite my efforts to adapt, I can't seem to grasp what I'm doing wrong. I’ve spoken with friends who are having a great time with this game, but for me, it's been nothing but an uphill battle. What’s more frustrating is that I haven’t found any resources that address why I’m struggling so much or how I can improve my approach.The input lag only adds to the difficulty, making precise actions nearly impossible at crucial moments. Many technical issues are discussed in forums, but I lack the resources and expertise to fix them, especially given the current economic challenges. At this point, I don’t think I’ll ever pick up this game again. What could have been an enjoyable experience has turned into a chore, and that’s not what gaming should be about. Despite the positive reviews and excitement around the game, it seems there’s a gap in support for players like me—those who are new to these types of games or are struggling to adapt.In conclusion, Black Myth: Wukong might be a solid game for those who thrive on its challenges, but it lacks the necessary tools to help players who are new or less experienced in action games. If you’re not prepared to spend a lot of time outside the game learning how to play it, you might want to think twice before diving in. I hate that I have to leave this game behind, but I simply don’t know how to get better, and the game doesn’t offer the support I need to improve."
Negative,I heard that the Chinese forced to play this game. It's not democratic！
Negative,For PC it should be slightly optimized. And also graphics not up to the mark. Waste of money in my opinion for pc. Recomended was 16 GB Ram but its taking more than 16GB.
Negative,repetive and not fun.
Negative,Repetitive game-play. I tried to like to but it didn't do it for me. I know i'm in the minority with this review.
Negative,"Devs completely run out of ideas in the last two chapters, giving every boss multiple phases and just making them damage sponges"
Negative,"This game is terrible, only rated positive because a million chinese players said its amazing simply because its a chinese game. Every boss has the same moveset and seeing as all you do is fight bosses it gets noticeable very quick, there's also huge input lag on the controls to the point where you're literally spamming the heal button like 8 times before it actually works. Combat is boring too, spam X and occasionally throw a heavy attack into the mix. Graphics are bad too game looks grainy and really over sharpened and the dynamic lighting constantly changing is annoying"
Negative,"This is the first game I ever completely removed from my steam library. I had enough of the incompetent and very poor combat design. The placement of animation locks don't fit with what the game is requiring of you. For some reason they decided to add intentional lag on top of the animation during the fights, around 7 frames on average. Against 2-3 frame attacks this is obviously useless. Basically, you learn what the enemy is likely to do based on animation startup and press whatever button you want to react with before they actually do the move. This is not skill based in any way except memory. If you enjoy working out set patterns and paint-by-numbers fighting then this may be for you, but not for me unfortunately. This is basically the same method as Art of Fighting 2 on the Neo Geo, but with multiple frames of lag. Aside from bad collision detection and the cpu ignoring your hits, this is the biggest reason the game is hard. Also, as a side note, I'm running at a solid 60fps with no frame gen, etc.An absolute waste of £50. I'll be avoiding anything from this company in the future."
Negative,"Visually stunning game, with bad performance in about 15% of the areas - not too bad.The gameplay is absolutely horrendous though.Nothing feels responsive, the combo systems are boring and uninteresting.The player to enemy dynamic feels empty, like there's nothing dynamically going on between player and enemy / boss.The upgrades? Most of them are meaningless - almost all the stance trees are identical. There's like 6 different categories of stats to choose from which increase said stat by like 1-10 points.Rewards don't feel rewarding.Probably one of the worst games gameplay-wise I've played in this genre in my life whilst simultaneously being one of the most visually stunning games i've ever played."
Negative,"A Souls like game were bosses are health sponges.Soooooo tedious fighting them. Artificially making it more difficulty than needed.Even upgrading, still doing little damage. Annoying. Then get killed by off screen one hit move."
Negative,Play Elden Ring instead. great at first but gets dull quickly.
Negative,"Invisible walls galore, Bad bosses. Game feels like a boss rush. Constantly hitting walls of difficulty and frustration with no clear way to even the playing field. I don't know where to travel to at all in the desert area everything looks the same. There's a boss with a checkpoint but no shrine so i had to leave via loading screen to respec at a distant shrine to come back and hope i'm built right. If there's a checkpoint in the boss area make it so i can interact or fast travel out. There's no reason for this as there's like no enemies on the way back its just bad design also you can't use the item to go back to a previous shine as the boss one counts as a shrine even though its not interactable.  Gimmick bosses where they go invincible and i just have to watch them or have a 20 second attack where i have to stand on a rock that can be broken by the boss. Not a lot of build variety. Every armour piece is better than the last and with unique modifiers meaning if you find something that complements a skill you like prepare to ditch it when you get an upgrade for a skill you dislike.Stop removing my lock on from bosses in most fights in the game. I don't want to fight the camera as well.Performance wise its okay looks good and not experienced any glitches. I have had few stutters and fps drops as well as my fans constantly running super loud at all times. Chapters 4 onwards was worse.This game has way to many bosses and way too many that fly away and don't come down to get hit. Very scripted boss battles to the point it feels less immersive. There's 113 bosses in this game from the wiki and i've done almost all of them i believe. My strategy hasn't changed since i started and armour barely either after getting the hub at chapter 3. Immobilise is so good they had to make bosses immune to it and scripts that break out of it.Why half way through the game do i get the hub area. It's like 20 hours in to the game if you explore before you get the hub.There's an upgrade drink and gourd at some monkey and the only options after 40 hours i had was 1 gourd and 2-3 drinks total over 113 bosses but you couldn't add more upgradable drinks. There's plenty of gourds and drinks they just don't upgrade for some reason. The final boss removes the new weapon animation you get from the final weapon of the game. Why? I only get the weapon for this boss unless i do ng+ or the chapter 6 side bosses after i get the weapon. 4 hippos and 4 stone golems from breath of the wild."
Negative,"I like the game. I like it a lot. But the most recent patch has broke the games performance and lighting, making it unplayable.Until they fix this I can't give it a thumbs up."
Negative,"This game is severely over-hyped. The graphics, music, and cut scenes are awesome. The fundamental aspects of this game revolving around combat have a lot QoL issues that make this impossible for me to want to keep playing. See below for examples:Healing potion doesn't always work, spamming often uses more than intended. I have tested this outside of combat as well. I have NO idea how more people have not brought this up. It's infuriating. Immobilize (Freeze ability) just bugs out randomly, cool down is started as if you used it. Often times during a boss you need to cast this spell quickly to give some relief in the pace of combat. Several times this spell has cast, done nothing, and the cool down starts to countdown as if I have used it.Issues with ""Composure skill"" - this ability allows you to dodge attacks in the middle of light combo attacks. It doesn't always work. Other issues: - The spawn location when you die and reattempt Zhu Baije boss is such a baffling bad design, I can't believe the devs thought it was a good idea to make you walk for 3 minutes every time you respawn and reattempt that boss, JFC. - chapter 3 straight up sucks, you're stuck going in a circular prison for 2 hours.  - Scorpion mini boss Chapter 4 - severely bugged. Multiple times wasn't able to attack because boss was glitched in strange position. - One of the coolest looking areas in the game, Purple Cloud Mountain, has awful screen tearing. Had no issues in the other areas of the game. Really takes away from the enjoyment of this awesome looking area."
Negative,"At this point in time, I cannot recommend it. It's one of those games you buy because everyone else around you likes it, so you try it and then ultimately hate it. This is the case for me. I might come back to it later at some point, but I currently can't stand it anymore.Runs like a** even with my 4080/13700K setup without upscaling and FrameGen. I play in 4k. You can literally see the frame drops with the naked eye.What annoyed me the most, however, are the following:* Dialog is absolute cringe and I can't listen to the annoying af main character anymore. He makes my ears bleed and gives me brain hemorrhage. The constant shrieking, yelling and boasting is just so cringey.* Story telling is your average overblown exaggerated mythical adventure nonsense with ridiculous character designs and extremely exaggerated power dynamics. Like, I get it, it's a mythical story, but this isn't Dragon Ball Z, where this would feel appropriate.* Combat is... weird. I understand that I'd need more practice to get into the flow, but I just couldn't get into it. I absolutely dreaded the moments when I had an opening after dodging the bosses' spam, only for my character having to switch stances first before he would actually attack. Wasted windows of opportunity, and his attack range always felt too short. The limited Mana was also annoying because some of the special abilities, while cool to use, often felt wasted because of the aforementioned problems. It's not that I find the fights too difficult, but that I'd often find myself fighting the combat animations/design more than the actual enemies. It's just frustrating.* Speaking of bosses, I really, really dislike the level design. Constantly, and I do mean constantly, I'd roam around and suddenly find myself in a boss arena for a boss I wasn't even ready for yet. And you'd just get sucked into a cutscene before you could do anything about it. Maybe fresh out of heals, too. Then get clapped straight into respawn. Great stuff. This is why fog walls in the Souls games were really good. Lots of invisible walls and the whole area is basically capped off into a big box for you to explore before you move on to the next chapter. Many times you'd come across areas where you'd think ""that looks climbable"" and then realize, nope, just another invisible wall. This has the direct effect that every level you enter feels much, much smaller than it looks.* One last thing. I really did not feel connected to the story/the game as a whole. Like, I was playing through the levels, but yet it felt more like playing through a tech demo rather than an actual game. Everything just feels so disconnected. You get a few cutscenes, do some random sh*t, then explore for a bit, get more cutscenes, maybe kill a boss, then you get more cutscenes, drop into the next level, get an introduction to a new mechanic, then the whole thing starts over. To me, it just has zero flow.For the record, I stopped playing after the lightning spamming boss that came a bit later after that white beast thing.I don't know, man. I really wasn't enjoying my time."
Negative,"I really wanted to get into this game and enjoy it, it's amazing to look at and the story is amazing - actually buying a game on release and paying full price is rare for me and yet; everyone says ""it's not a souls-like"" which is why I bought it. But! It plays exactly like every other souls-like game I've ever tried to play - and failed to finish. If you don't have endless hours to sweat over learning boss movesets while you play dodge simulator then i guess this just isn't for me. The first boss I cheesed by staying far enough away he didn't actually attack, I used immobilize, chunked some health, moved back until he doesn't attack again, rinse and repeat - this is not fun and yes, I guess not for me."
Negative,"Legitimately one of the roughest souls-likes I've ever played. Most times the devs seem to have valued style over substance. Everything in the game looks ~amazing~.  But that's essentially it. The amount of invisible walls in the game feels like the environments were made for a pump and dump shooter from the mid 10s, the option to skip cutscenes is placed consistently enough to let whoever implemented it immediately fail an alzheimers-test and I've seen medless shizoid patients with more control over their character than the monkey king. The worst of all: Even if you suffer through all the incredibly randomly designed levels with enemies copy-pasted everywhere you roll up to one of the worst designed last bosses in the history of main bosses, maybe ever. Without spoilers; it beats pre-nerf Consort Radahn by a long shot. This is the most disappointed I've ever been to be unable to refund a game."
Negative,"some bosses hitboxes are so bad that you can be as close to them as humanly possible and still miss half your attacks, invisible walls and a split path terrain means you cant tell where you can and cannot go without walking into all the invisible walls you find.... really dumb design. the gameplay feels sluggish, some inputs are quite delayed. i cant help but compare this game to darksouls, sekiro, or even god of war, and in every way this game falls short of those alternatives. narrative/world design are weak vs god of war, types of combat variety fall short of all those games. i like this game and wish i could recommend it, but i cant ignore how much of a letdown this game is in terms of getting worst the more you play, not harder just scuffed. all these small shortcomings start feeling really tedious and outdated the more you keep dealing with them. without all these issues the game is 10/10 but with these issues that remind me of a game from 2005 id say the game is worth half the price it is. id say 6/10 game that easily could have been a 10/10 with more love from the developers. if you love souls games and extra money and time on your hands you can have some fun with this game, but otherwise its a skip. the last thing i wanna say is this games chinese mythology and art are amazing, 10/10 on that front, that is this games saving grace. watch a streamer play this game or something, its probably the best way to experience it."
Negative,Boring Enemys....mostly boring Bossfights....i really  dont know  how this is rated so high.The graphics are awesome but thats about it.
Negative,Refunded due to constant crashing. Wish I could've enjoyed the same game with no issues everyone else seems to have.
Negative,"BEFORE YOU BUY THE GAME, let me first say this. People  say this is close to God of War. I HARD disagree and say it's a lot closer to a souls-like. I would argue and say it is a souls-like with action rpg elements. I have never played the nioh series, only watched gameplay, but I think that it is way closer to that than God of War. There is no difficulty slider so if you are a casual playing this game, unless you're fine with a challenge and getting better at games like this. I don't think this game is as casual as God of War at all. Also, I think when it comes to boss fights and how you progress this game is harder than Elden Ring. The systems are more forgiving (you die and respawn at a shrine without losing anything), but i think the bosses are harder in my opinion. And you can't just farm up unless you have a lot of time on your hands. And I don't think its like elden where you can become too strong for bosses, but i could be wrong. So before you buy and see everyone say that it is like God of War, know that it is 100% false.Now for my review (minor spoilers): This game has a lot of ups and a lot of downs. I will start with ups. The game looks really good. I'd say I have a mid tier PC and I was able to run it Medium settings, but it still looked good to me. I think all the environments were very nice to look at. The cutscenes were amazing. I think that the characters and story was good as well. I do have a small thing that didn't really effect my thought on the game. The intro scene was a crazy introduction, but it made me wish I was playing as Sun Wukong instead of a descendant. I just liked the voice actor and I feel like the silent protag thing just doesn't feel the same. The character and boss visual design were nice. they all looked good. I really liked how chapter 4 looked. I also liked how there were sets and how you could play around certain builds. There are skill trees also, and I like how you can respec basically whenever you want. I think that it is a huge game to put out by the studio and it was really good in some parts, but I will say it was not perfect. Here's why I think so.1. Level design. It was good the first two levels, but after that. I didn't like the level design at all. Especially a certain chapter, but I won't say here yet. the first chapter I think was the best designed for a game like wukong. The game feels like it's supposed to be a linear experience, but a lot of the environment looks very similar  so it's very easy to get lost. There are no POIs that help you figure out where you are or any memorable things in the environment to help you figure out where you are.. Although the game looks good itself, the environment isn't designed well enough for you to know where you are in the level. It is also hard to tell where the ""wrong way"" is (to find loot and treasure) and where the right way is a lot of the time. Paths will split into 3 ways and you wont know which way to go. The paths diverge a lot so it is hard to remember it all especially since the paths looks so similar.1. a. I think the game would benefit having a map and I know not every game doesn't have a map, but the game is not linear enough to not have a map.1. b. It is so hard to tell whats explorable and what's not. You will run, somewhere, thinking that you can walk over there, but there's an invisible wall there blocking you. It is very annoying and feels like such a waste of time when you just walk into an invisible wall and have to walk back to where you were.1. c. . The mini hop when walking to ledges can get you killed. I'm not sure why you can fall off cliffs in this game when 80 percent of the time, there's an invisible wall there. I feel like the places where you fall off too make no sense as well.2. I feel like upgrading all the way down a skill tree isn't satisfying. The last skill you can get in a branch usually isn't worth it, and the other ones earlier in the branch are a lot more useful than the one in the last slot.3. Chapter 3 is straight cheeks I cannot lie. The beginning is just a pain to traverse. The gimmick is super annoying and exploring it is just bad. There is no real indication on where to go, so you will walk down a long path, hoping there's a shrine, maybe die a few times along the way because of the gimmick in it (and its unavoidable until you beat a boss). You reach the end of the path there's nothing there and you were heading the wrong way. Once ur out of the area, there are just super open spaces where everything looks the same. It is very very easy to get lost. And in the last area, it is HUGE, but there are two shrines in the whole area. I had to quit a few times because I had to traverse it again. And the last boss in the chapter is very gimmicky and annoying.4. For a game with a lot of freedom for how you play, there are some bosses that just punish you for using your tools. It is a bit annoying, but I feel like you shouldn't need to change the way you want to play for a specific boss. One boss legit puts you into a cutscene for using a basic move on them lol. And also there will be tools that will say ""It will be useful against certain enemies"", but it is only useful against one boss and that's it.5. The fighting is fun at first, but then gets very repetitive. It's just XXXXY, pretty much. You can do XY,XXY,XXXY too but it is legit the same combo, but the heavy comes out earlier.  The final boss had crazy cool combos that could have been put in the skill tree or incorporated into the combo system somehow so the combos weren't so bland. . I also wish there was more incorporation of using a stance over others. Like bosses that kind of made you have to switch your stance for certain purposes would have been cool. And I know i said ppl should go whatever they want, but I just mean for a certain move, you swap stances and then do something. I don't wanna spoil the stances, but I'm sure ppl know what I mean.6. As the game progressed, the levels got emptier and emptier I feel. and the last chapter was so empty, and so hard to traverse or know where to go. The last chapter and 3rd were my least favorite. I had to use a walkthrough to get through it. It was just water and trees and it was super easy to get lost. The beginning of Chapter 4 didn't feel like that I will say, but chapter 6 was just the worst designed area and so empty (next to 3).That's all I have really to say. I think if this game was polished, then I think this game would be amazing to me, but it just was not for me. I can see why other people liked it, but the game was just too annoying to me. I would give it a solid 6.8/10 because I still enjoyed it, but the things I said were the reason why I couldn't love it. I would recommend it if you arent picky and up for a challenge. I honestly think this game isn't game of the year, but I can see why it would win it. Just make sure you know this game is not God of War at all. I was gonna do the true ending, but the last boss was very very annoying to me and I didn't want to walk through it again, despite the fact I was close to unlocking the true ending. It also didnt help that i was expecting something a bit more chill after playing the elden dlc recently, only for it to be similar in difficulty"
Negative,"I cannot in good faith recommend anyone spending $60 on this....Which breaks my heart because I wanted to love this game.  I even tried to rationalize with myself that maybe I was the problem and the game is actually awesome.  But, there is so much that just doesn't work, and even though the graphics at times can be a moment you appreciate its lost in all the things that are just meh at best.  What do i mean?  There is one attack button for one combo used at the very least 60%-75% of the time.  Its painfully repetitive. During which you can use a heavy attack if you have focus thats built up and from that you can derive a couple mixes of a combo but its so repetitive before you make it out of the first chapter you will be sick of it.  The game is a souls like in that you learn the attack patterns of enemies to capitalize off perfect dodges and heavy attacks, then get punished hard by bosses for making mistakes.  A main difference is the bosses aren't near as impossible as other soul like titles.  You never get the pure crack like dopamine hit from besting a god like boss, it just feels like a means to an end each time you beat one. As the game continues you pick up a couple ""spells"" and spirit attacks but thats the extent of how much room you have to change anything resembling play style.  Next is the loot and armor and gear.  The armor upgrades last about one boss fight at a time, you rotate out of items so fast it feels uneventful to even waste the mats each time you craft.  The items never feel good, they feel necessary and if you miss one you just play hindered so there's never a moment when the power fantasy comes to life.  The level design in this is so unbelievably linear and being stopped by an invisible wall is PS2 level junk.  All this mountain and forest and bamboo and rocks and structures and you, a monkey king, cant jump or swing or climb a single thing, just run around.  Jump off a ledge or bridge to fight an enemy?  Dont even think of jumping back up the rocks behind you even though you can see where you jumped from, you have to run all the way around to get back.  The flow of the game is this : Place incense at shrine to save where you respawn, kill just a handful of single shot enemies, enter boss room, kill boss, get item.  Place incense at shrine to save where you respawn, kill just a handful of single shot enemies, enter boss room, kill boss, get item.  The boss fights are ok but its just one really long elevator of boss battles with no real body to the exploration or design at all. I dont know that id even get this on sale and im mad I kept playing as long as I have just because I was convinced it would get better.  It won't.  Its not innovative, its not interesting, its not fun past the first 2 hours unless thats your thing.  Its not that its plain awful despite my gripes.  Its just that its mid at its very best.  They should have taken notes from other soul likes and mixed in some combat like DMC with free-running style move sets like the Ninja Gaiden games."
Negative,it look nice but the boss poopy shit
Negative,"It's an amazing looking game no doubt about, it also has some great fight mechanics and an interesting story. However it does have some really major flaws, for instance it took me a good 30 min to get the game to work and start playing also during gameplay the game is very laggy and this isnt because i have a potato pc. You can imagine in a souls like game that lag is a major flaw."
Negative,"There's definitely a lot of good in this game, but it gets bogged down by a lot of really bad as well. The first 2 chapters are a masterpiece, good exploration and fights, some challenge but doesn't feel outright cheap. Chapter 3 is probably one of the worst pieces of gaming I've played in a long while, lots of annoying mechanics and deviations, that while individually would probably be alright, when all combined just feel terrible.Chapter 4 is a bit better, but from this point out boss fights start to swing all over the place from ok, to challenging but fun, or just outright cancer, theres no consistency and it starts to feel like the devs just went for the hard for the sake of being hard design vs challenging but engaging.I'm on chapter 6 at the time of writing this and am half leaning towards dropping it, the fun parts are feeling less rewarding compared to the not fun parts."
Negative,"Couldn't launch the game.Memory error while compiling shaders. Tried skipping compiling, still wouldn't workTroubleshooted various ways:- Verified integrity of game cache- Launched in comparability mode- comparability mode with ""-dx12"" instructions- Only option left was to underlock my cpu as the developers recommended. My PC is a pre-built unit purchased from a local computer store and alterations to CPU clockspeed/variables voids warranty so i decided not to try this option.I was running the Black Myth benchmark tool earlier today and was running it just fine.System specs:NVIDIA 4070 ti super (560.94 driver)Intel i7-14700kf32GB RAMSSD"
Negative,"Combat is clunky and way too easy.  Performance could be better as well, however it is serviceable. If you enjoy a game with little to no challenge or memorable characters, play this game. It might get better later on, but my initial impressions at 4 hours remain meh. I will try to finish this if i can muster the will to do so."
Negative,"The game is fine, good even, but the combat system is really boring after a while. On the surface there are a lot of different spells and skills, but the basic combat boils down to smashing the light-attack button and dodging after a couple of hits. This is super frustrating with enemies that wont stagger nearly ever, and have 2 minute long combos where you just need to keep dodgerolling and cant afford to land a hit meanwhile. After the combo is over, get it a couple of hits and rinse and repeat. Yeah, most enemies are not like that, but oh boy, most bosses really like to play like this. Sure, you could use your spells and stuff, but that costs mana, and you dont have mana potions in this game. Its stupid. There is a very convoluted way to parry, but it still sucks. The later bosses and mobs are just frustrating to battle and not fun at all. Its not even about the difficulty in it self, most boss designs are just bad.I beat Erlang and got the ""secret ending"". I beat the shit out of this game, even tho I didnt collect every little shit there is. Erlang being the hardest boss is also the most frustrating one. This boss is the epitome of shit boss-design. Combos that take forever half the time him being in the air out of reach. After beating him I was just glad it was over. Didnt feel good to overcome a challenge, like most Souls games bosses. No real sense of accomplishment, just a sigh. Yes its good that this game exists. There is no ""live service"" bs or anything else. Just a complete game. This is the direction games need to go back. However, solely for the shit boss-designs Im giving it a negative review. Beating this game was not fun, it was a chore."
Negative,"This is a complete and utter disappointment that is way overhyped.Paths or areas that you can explore look the same as those blocked by invisible walls. This results in you jumping against invisible walls about half the time, just so you don't miss any secrets. In each chapter, all the areas look very similar and there is no map, resulting in unnecessary loops through the levels.Combat is very flat and uninspiring. The developers seemed to think that a good combat system should have as many different aspects as possible, prioritizing quantity over quality. After an enjoyable, challenging boss fight in the early game, it got stale very quickly. Cooldown spam and light attacks combined with “seeing through the enemy” made all the bosses very easy and the boss fights quite similar.Then there’s a big dragon boss with the worst camera and hitboxes ever, this is an extremely atrocious fight. Finished it nonetheless but the next boss with lasers is almost as bad. Because of the lackluster exploration and boring combat, I have no intention of going through this horrible experience to keep getting disappointed.A lot of thought and passion went into the story, which shows. Unfortunately, the storytelling does not salvage the horrid gameplay experience. I really do not think this would receive half the praise it did if it wasn't based on a classic Chinese novel."
Negative,"I am actually really enjoying this game and want to give it a recommend, but not until the developers do their job properly.  Are you serious that I cannot remap all of the controls, such as switching potions, and I have to have this on my mouse scroll?  Are you serious that I cannot remap the controls fully to standard buttons that have been on mice for over 20 years - that's right they won't let you use your thumb buttons - I used to use these in WoW when it first came out, and you are saying that it is not possible - yet you force me to stretch my finger to g when those fingers are needed in movement when fighting enemies, while my thumb is sitting utterly idle.  Thumb button on my mouse is where doge is meant to be - and instead I have to remap my brain from every other similar game that I play because the developers were too lazy to do their job competently!  Not giving you a recommended until this is fixed.  Otherwise would highly recommend this game, it is nice to see that overwhelmingly the developers have done a released complete mostly polished product - western developers could learn a lot from this.  Looks stunning too, and is a lot of fun.  But you can fuck right off with this utter BS about not letting K+M players play the game the way they want (fucking pathetic!)!"
Negative,"Laughable performance on a rig that surpasses the recommended hardware with ease; when will devs learn how to optimize UE5?Good for people who can play it with quadruple 4090 setups, I guess."
Negative,No trans monkeys... what where these developers thinking!?
Negative,Totally fucking piece of shit stupid asshole
Negative,"game randomly reboots my pc, known issue and still no patch to fix it."
Negative,"The combat is complex but not as fluid as expected. The combos are not as smooth as I expected, and the rolling action has a noticeable delay that I need to adapt to. I'm not sure if it's because I'm just not good at this type of game.The map design is confusing and the item pickup is slow.  There are air walls everywhere, it's like living in a restricted area where this game come from! XDD The game lacks a strong soundtrack and the dialogues are too long. While it’s playable, I recommend waiting for a sale."
Negative,"1. Graphics. (7/10)     Not sure if its even that good or special compared to what has been offered in the gaming market since 2015 and there's tons of that ""unreal engine"" look of games that came out of the woodwork lately which gives it a bitter taste.     The lighting is most of the time does take time for you to transition from a bright lighting to a darker one and you tend to go blinded in darkness for a good 2-3 seconds and when you're fighting an enemy it tends to get in the way. Just happens on thrash mobs and a few of the boss fights. (rtx 4090, 13900k on max settings).      There are seldom stuttering. (Maybe hardware related storage is WDBLACK SN850X SSD)2. Gameplay. (6/10)     Do not expect it to be like Elden Ring. It plays differently and is more akin to God of War.      Not open world.      Combat gets boring after 10 hours of the same combo's with light attacks, heavy attacks, spells, transformation and spirit attacks.     Most of the time you're running and some walk backs to bosses are too far and becomes painful after 10+ attempts     This is more of a reflex type of game which lately became a trend on ""How good you dodge attacks and parry"".     Limited gameplay right off the bat. You just hit everything that moves. Wished there are more stuff to do (puzzles, environment interaction during boss fight). Opportunity already presented itself with the beautiful environment and could have implemented with some mini games. (e.g. God of War puzzle solving)     Will be most likely not to play the game again with another spec after beating it.3. Story. (6/10)     Back story could have been more conveyed with the unfamiliar audience of the west without having to research and have that research relevant to the game story. Again if you're not familiar with the characters.     Stories feel segmented, they tried to bridge the gap with animations but idiomatic in nature.      Not sure if there's a miss translation to English localisation. But conversations leave with a little meaning.     Cinematics just leaves you with ?     They provide you with a journal to read on a few things. But if you're not into reading...Take the hype with a grain of salt."
Negative,"I've been playing for like 17 hours, I got past chapter two, then today I log on only to see that ALL my progress has been removed. I cant even restore my previous game files. everythings just gone. The game is fire, but this really fucking sucks. I have to start from the beginning all over again."
Negative,"I must just not be the target for most popular games these days. Im absolutely blown away this is 96% positive reviews. It runs pretty mediocre at best, has wildly cringe dialogue, its choppy and feels like an invisible wall,  linear ps2 game"
Negative,Graphics is great but I'm not a fan of souls like games. Why anyone want to die again and again and move through the same level 100 times.
Negative,Bad narrativeTerrible control No difficulty modification
Negative,This game is overrated.
Negative,Boss rush with quick corridor runs inbetween. Looks nice but not worth the full price
Negative,"There is a lot of hype for this game and its very understandable.However, i honestly dont believe this game is worth AAA prices.The visuals are magnificent, which is definitely a plus. However, the most important aspect in action games is movement/animation. There are too many animation locks that makes this game pretty clunky. Sure, it isnt as bad as some indie games, but its definitely not the best either. Right now its not worth 79.99 cad. It's more around 50 -60 cad. So i will be waiting for it to be on sale to buy it again."
Negative,"Tl;DRThis game sucks, but is good looking.- The map is terrible. There a lot of ""open"" space which seem to be either a shortcut or a pathway to something. At least it seems like it until you get stopped by an invisible wall. Hey devs, this is called ""bad level design"".The mechanics are clunky: - No real combo, just feels like mashing buttons or preparing a heavy attack. - The poise and damage ratio are unbalanced. - Autosave sure, but you get back to the shrine and have to start it over.- Some boss have auto-tracking and slightly teleporting moves- Camera is shit- Some moves are way too fast and unpredictable. Which is fine by itself, but once you get hit you can't escape the following hits, you keep getting staggered.  - Somehow, blocking ranged attacks while moving make you go side way (combine that with narrow path while under attack. Obviously, you fall down)The story telling is meh:- No transition between environments. There are nice and short animation videos, but come on. Going from a mountain to a desert to a snowy mountain... It needs some transition."
Negative,"Once in jungle, fps tanks in certain areas. Unplayable, fix please.~13900KS, RTX 4090, 64 gb ddr5 ram @5.6ghz, Asus Rog Max Z690Edit: Adding more info-Updated the latest BIOS, i had undervolted my cpu, set everything back to default- Updated to latest Nvidia Driver- Tried Max settings (with and without dlss), tried the lowest possible settings as wellOutcome: getting around 200-220 fps on low, around 60-70 fps (maxed with no dlss), and around 80-90 fps (maxed out with dlss 50%). There are certain parts of the jungle where the GPU usage tanks to like 40-50% and that is where the drop happens (for all video settings). Sometimes the drop does not happen and sometimes it does, weird."
Negative,"This game is far from worth 65$. this game is as bad as the trailer to the new minecraft movie. The game play was really fun and the combat is good, but the camera angle sucks and multiple times its been suck in the floor making it unable to see the boss thus killing you. The dodging is a great idea it could be fun, if the monkey was able to dodge more than once. Once you dodge you are stunned which is fine but after prefect dodging it would stun you making it hard and unable to dodge the next attack. The game looks great and the world looks really good but there is no map. you will spend most of your time wondering around the same place for hours when it could have been solved by a map. The boss fights are amazing all the boss look cool but some of the boss jump and go invisible moving the camera angle into the ground or just making it unable to see. Its bad like the trailer to the minecraft movie because i wanted it to be good and gave it my time but it was not even close worth the hype or the peoples time and money. thank you and please give me your opinion to help me understand what im missing."
Negative,"One of the most overrated games I played, the combat for the most part is good but also very basic but the games has to many problems with invisible walls and bad level design especially Chapter 3 and 6, chapter 4 is pretty good though and some bosses are very and others have just bad design, get the game in a sale."
Negative,"The intro for the game says it all; huge set piece that looks great and then one of the worst tutorial “boss battles” in gaming. Then you get into the actual boss battles and they just consist of spamming dodge and quick attacking until dead. This is without mentioning the weird shit the marketing company sent out saying content creators were not to talk about “feminist propaganda” and “china’s policies”.I dunno, doesn’t feel like a great game and I will probably refund when I get home"
Negative,"though game, not for me"
Negative,"too hard to play, should have difficulty settings for those who just want to play story mode"
Negative,full price... curse my chungus life.....
Negative,"Games like this are meant to test your tenacity, your reflex and your ingenuity. Not your patience."
Negative,"Yo, devs! Last 10h in the game is under heavy copyright strikes!!!Some chinese letters are claiming music left and right.If you placed 60$ price, then remove copyright!"
Negative,"Beautiful, yes, but..Gameplay gets boring, real quick.The difficulty balance makes no sense - at all.Some end bosses feel just too easy. Some small time bosses feel completely imbalanced.Not to mention numerous bugs, rendering your experience quite frustrating.In the end, you're supposed to be a God, but you feel like shit most of the time.The story is rather uninteresting.So what's left?Another failed triple AAA, beautiful on the outside, boring on the inside."
Negative,"- invincibility phases in some boss fights, bosses become untargetable and do some dances & animations and you just spam dodge button. what a waste.-maybe missable bosses?- bad map design- there is nothing useful to invest in skill tree at mid-game-bad weapon upgrades.- un-interesting loot/drops from bosses & chests.- repetitive mobs- a billion boring bosses which most are clearable 1st try"
Negative,"The game runs like crap. WTF are these reviewers smoking?11700K/4090 @ 3840x1600 blah blah blah and it runs like crap!I'm astonished. All the reviews are so good! wtf is going on? It's like the performance issues are being covered up because if you search for ""Wukong performance issues"" you will see exactly all the issues you are experiencing and they still have the nerve to give it an 8/10?!?! Am I in some dystopian existence where this kind of crap is now acceptable for a $70 game?"
Negative,"games fun and all, but even with a PC that outperforms the recommended it crashes A LOT, especially in particle heavy boss fights, which sucks because it means despite being able to beat the boss, i cant beat the damn crash that happens at the halfway mark, but also when things light on fire, using cloud step, activating shrines, etc.i thought it was a joke when people complained about Unreal Engine 5 having stability issues, but nope, it legit has stuttering problems and crashing problems for no reason, and it doesn't matter what your setup is, its a problem with the engine itselfits literally the only fault i can find in the game, and its a big enough problem to be a deal breaker, if it gets fixed down the road ill update my review"
Negative,"The game is, from a side, what I expected it would be, a nice action rpg, full with chinese folklore and lore, with a fluid and fast paced combat and sometimes gorgeous scenarios and designs.On the other side, DAMN, this game has issues. I got an i9 11900, 32GB ram and a GTX 3080, and this game freezes, framedrops and CRASHES on both cinematic mode and low details mode. The enemy damage escalates a lot by the end of the third chapter, so much to be unbearable, 2-3 hits could end your life easily.Don't get me started on maps and esploration, we go from a very linear map to a several km wide maps, with so many paths to follow that leads you to others intersections, and then to others intersections, making lose yourself a certainty. The fact that we miss a spot to overlook some areas from above, a map or even a reference point in some maps (yes, I'm looking to you New Thunderclap Shrine) makes exploration frustrating, overcomplicated and annoying. The builds are fun to try, customisation and reset of the skilltree for free is a huge thing in this kind of games, some bosses force you to try new spells and a new approach, making the combat worth experimenting, even when some bugs or totally wrong hitboxes try your nerves.Do I recommend the game overall? Maybe. If you are not really bothered by losing yourself every 3 minutes, don't have OCD and have a lot of patience for the recurring crashes and freezes, this game is one of the best action rpg on the market right now. If, by any chance, you lack the time, patience and mental fortitude this game greedly asks, there are many other action rpg and hack and slash worth playing more than this. Definetly wanting in more than a way, a lot of things could be fixed by patches."
Negative,Can't even play. Always crashes on shaders
Negative,Its like Nioh.. but in simple and boring.No weapons besides the starting one3 movesetsbossrush only (boss every 10m you walk)just a monkey
Negative,"invisible walls were annoying in 2000. To see them in a AAA game today is abhorrent. I can't count the number of times in the first hour of playing I saw somewhere that looked like it was for me to explore only to jump up against an invisible wall. I imagine it's the same thinking the Chinese Government uses at their facilities. ""DONT LOOK OVER THERE EVEN THOUGH IT'S INTERESTING!""The fact that so many people like this game is indicative of the state of games as whole, not a mark of honor for this no-name developer. Original review - definitely malware from china.controls are trash. L2 and R2 are super inconsistant to proc"
Negative,"For me, can I just get a decent game with a decent story where I don't have to grind for hours on every damn boss? Not everyone wants to be a damn dark soul edge lord🙄. I get about an hour to game after work, I don't have time to dedicate to NOT PROGRESSING because I can't spend 4 hours straight ""learning"" a boss 🤨 it looks like it could be fun. ive watched ziiostorm talk about the game,and i like what he has had to say, but i simply cannot enjoy the game as is. i went through one hell wiith elden ring, im not doing it again. if you want to gate keepp a game, whatever. ive got respponsibilites to attend to, iill sppend my money elsewhere."
Negative,"I really wanted to like this game, but I just don't. It looks great, but the non-boss combat is feels like Dynasty Warriors without the scores of enemies. The world is linear and the bad guys are more like decorations. The boss fights are cool admittedly, but most of them are versions of bosses you've fought in other games. The gathering is mid, the crafting is mid, the item use is clunky and slow, and the character progression feels more like a formality than a way to actually build your character. I am left wondering if this is more a cinematic game where you run in between boss fights. There are charming and entertaining parts to this game, but I may have had my expectation too high. If you're looking for a GOTY experience, I don't think you'll find it with this game."
Negative,"Way too hard, this game gives me headaches from trying bosses 1000x"
Negative,"the game itself is good but the crashes man, ive replayed the first part of the game 4 times now and i managed to get past it, but then when i got into the actual game it crashes AGAIN its not my system it just crashes like mad all the time. if it keeps doing it im going to request a refund"
Negative,"okay so Im just gonna say this is not a bad game, I just wouldn't recommend it why? because well the first two chapters I could feel myself really getting stuck in, the bosses, the environmental exploration and secrets where so well done and fun and I could feel it scratching the dark souls itch however chapter 3 began and I have no idea what happened but this game takes a drastic nose dive in quality after this point. The environments became more linear and but somehow harder to navigate because of how everything blends together to well and I found it harder to backtrack because everything looks the same with no distinct landmarks. The bosses jesus chapter 3 sucks for bosses and even the mini bosses just became lazy. Like I hated that multiple bosses hinder you in some way so you cant use the tools the game gives you. One arena has mud so you can hardly move, one boss is flying so much you have to dodge and wait a long time just to get like 4 hits in, and another boss completely disables your abilities or turns them against you, if you use the spells you have he goes gold and immune to damage until you break it. By the end I just was happy it was over because I just didn't care anymore."
Negative,"Im going against the grain here and saying this is a cheap souls rip off with UE5 store assets.of course the graphics are 10/10 but everything else is like a 3 at best.Do not play with English voice acting or you'll never be able to take anything seriouslyI cant even put into words how ""off"" this game feels.You cant convince sh*t eaters they are eating sh*t""omg STRIMER SAID GAEM GOOD, ME GOOD DRONE ME LISTEN"""
Negative,"I am pretty disappointed as this was a game I had been anticipating for quite some time but I just couldn't get it to run properly. Even after half an hour of attempted fixes the cut-scenes would stutter pretty badly and along with that the sound was both cutting in and out and having a delay where the sound would come long after the visuals.If they can fix this and other performance issues, I might buy this again but for now I'm going to get a refund.I enabled comments if anyone has solutions for others, hope y'all have better luck then I did. Have a good day."
Negative,"I tried to like it, I really did.The fighting got really tiring real quick, and aside one or two weapons, the light attack combo is always the same. Smack smack, twist sping jumpslam, rinse and repeat into infinity.Upgrading skills past aquiring them is basically just watching numbers go up. ""Now instead of 10 seconds, it lasts 15"", yaaay..The story started off interesting, but kept shoving so much characters with no depth to htem that in the end I found myself rushing through the story to just have it done.  I can't even remember the name of the wildboar man that hanged around half the game,   and I played this for over 50 hours!  Maybe I should have known something about Journey to the West to enjoy the story, but in the end, it just lost my interest.Some of the collectibles were downright so hidden, that I had no choise but to check out guides that where some of them were. In the end, I got 80% achievements on one go, but just had to use guides for the rest of them.Also, the ""Hahaa, you gotta play NG+ to get everything bit is just absolute worst to me personally.In the end, the game itself isn't bad for those who enjoy simple hack'n'slashed, but to me, it was overhyped.Beautiful game, no doubt about it, but content wise, it left me hoping for something different."
Negative,"There's plenty of positive reviews, but the worst part of this game is so rampant it kind of ruins it for me. Invisible walls. Invisible walls everywhere. See an interesting looking path in the trees over there? Nope, invisible wall. Rocks you can definitely jump on to go up on that ledge? Nah invisible wall. Boss fights with AoE on the ground to dodge? Easy, unless somebody for some reason put an invisible wall offset from the actual wall by 6 feet so you can't actually dodge the direction you very clearly should be able to.The game is still fun for combat, but if you want to explore and find ""secrets"" or ""side paths"" you're going to be spending hours running up against invisible walls trying to find the paths that are actual paths instead of real ones. It's been a long time since I've seen map design this lazy. Graphics designers carried the team hard."
Negative,"⭐️ (1/5)I was really excited to dive into Black Myth: Wukong, especially given the stunning visuals and intriguing story. The graphics are impressive, and the narrative seems promising, which made my initial experience enjoyable. However, my excitement quickly turned to frustration when I encountered a major issue: the game fails to save progress, displaying the error code 10007. Despite having ample disk space and the necessary permissions, I was unable to save my game after playing for just 0.7 hours. This is unacceptable for a AAA title priced at $59.99. Additionally, I experienced some frame drops even with my RTX 4070 Ti, which was unexpected. While I understand that optimization can be a work in progress, the inability to save my progress is a dealbreaker.As much as I wanted to love this game, I have no choice but to request a refund. I hope the developers address these issues soon, as the game has great potential. Until then, I cannot recommend it in its current state."
Negative,"It is a very good and well-made game; however, I cannot recommend it because of its poor optimization. The game becomes unplayable in chapter 2, and no matter how much the settings change, it still stutters and lags horribly. Hopefully, it will be fixed in a future patch, however, at this time it is in a horrid optimization state, especially for lower-end machines."
Negative,"Average looking UE5 game with UE5 graphical problems (pop-ins, flickering, abyssal dynamic range between shadows and highlights). Braindead between-bosses gameplay, unfair / unfun boss gameplay. Level design is generic to the point of feeling like an asset flip."
Negative,"Just like Elden Ring, the gamedevs decided that the best way to make a game ""difficult"" is by giving their boss encounters hour long combo strings, paired with minimal windows for counter-attacks turning what could be fun and interesting bossfights into utter slogs.An honestly great game, that had a great story and fun boss encounters ruined by abysmal late game boss designs."
Negative,"One of the most overhyped games of all time. The combat is very repetitive, the map design is atrocious, the visuals are incredibly artifacty and are just overall very muddled. Its really sad because I've been waiting 4 years for this game, but unfortunately it was not great. For a first outing its ok, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're completely obsessed with souls likes. Go try lies of P and Lords of the fallen instead."

Negative,Overrated boss rush terrible game all around bad world designs enemy are annoying to fight and the bosses are terrible
Negative,"Looks nice. Boring.You'd be better off playing Elden Ring, or God of War."
Negative,"It's a good game and really engaging, but I don't know if it's $60 good, tbh, and it seems very shallow as you go boss fight to boss fight with no depth in between.If you wanna know if its worth it, well, it's quite literally Nioh 2 with a wukong skin and fewer mechanics. It kind of seems like they just made a cinematic movie with some boss fights. It's challenging, but it's not hard. If that makes sense, I would say it's a ""souls like"" (if you wanna call it that) for casual players, and it seems very empty. The exploration is really low as there's not much exploration, and the character development is that of a children's storybook, which is not that good. I would say they put all the budget and resources into the graphics and about $20 into everything else. Overall, I would give this game a 4.5/10."
Negative,"This game is really hard, and there are no difficulty settings, so it's not one thats really suitable for casual gamers, and not what I had expected. Unenjoyable. Such a shame because the mythology and concept is excellent."
Negative,Upside: Sun WukongDownside: Soulslike genre taint
Negative,If you have an AMD system. WAIT to buy until they fix the drivers. cannot even get through the first cinematic. I am refunding until this is fixed.
Negative,"This thing is way too hard.I've been struggling with the bosses in those first chapters and imo there should be an option to select the difficulties for the game to be enjoyable to everyone. One more thing, it doesn't make any sense when you have enough money but can't buy anything because everything is out of stock."
Negative,"Lots of Misleading reviews on here. The game is beyond difficult, not suitable for anyone less than a hardcore gamer. It is not open map and not explorable. Instead, you go through a linear style path way encountering boss after boss which are incredibly difficult to beat with no sense of where you're going. Or how far you are and what you're trying to achieve in the game. I'm on chapter 3 having defeated handful of bosses and it's just the same thing over and over. Do not waste your money on this rubbish game"
Negative,"Extremely constant driver bugs, heavy fps drops and stuttering, and huge performance issues in general. Please release a game when its actually ready. Ive literally spent more than 80% of my time benchmarking and fixing bugs than actually playing."
Negative,Glitchy as hell
Negative,"Another ""Style over substance"" game, where developers put to much focus on the looks of the game instead gameplay. Don't let the developers fool you into believing that this is ""Action"" game, its ""Souls-like"". And because of the ""Souls-like"" genre of the game its greatly harms the fast paced gameplay that they are aiming to give"
Negative,"edit: had to downgrade the GPU drivers, on AMD 24.7.1 it would perma crash, but it runs smooth on 25.5.1, prob 7/10 game, its pretty good besides awful invisible walls.7800 x3d and a 7900xtx is not capable of running this game? i love every dumb person who has 0.2 hours in the game and says its GOTY or ""best game ever"" this is horrible and mid. refunded."
Negative,"I can't recommend this game as is in good conscience.Pros - Beautiful graphics, amazing music, based on a great mythological tale.Cons - Not a typical souls-like experience, invisible walls EVERYWHERE, repetitive fighting, what feels like extremely unresponsive controls at times, very limiting movesets where you mainly use 1 attack."
Negative,"Indeed, the game is quite impressive with high-quality visual art, but it's not up to par to merit a overwhelming positive review. It requires more refinement to surpass the level of a real AAA game such as Elden Ring and Sekiro.The main drawback of this game is that it doesn't have a map and there are invisible air-wall everywhere. It can be quite frustrating when exploring. Majority of small enemies are dumb. Though most bosses fights aren't bad, but lack immediate and intense interaction.Personally, I would give a score of 7 to 7.5 out of 10 (Sekiro and Darksoul3 are 9 and 8.5 for me)."
Negative,"So far Pros: - Great theme, china mythology is not very used in westrern/Europe mainstream (yes I'am aware the game is made by Chinese) and is fun and refreshing- Pretty impressive graphics although compensated with very visible visual noise and extremely low-detail assets on various places.- Pretty good optimization- Nice soundtrack good looking and decent combat system.- Interesting combat variaty- Very good voice acting in my opinionCons:- Hitboxes are bad especially on bigger enemies - Terrible camera system even Michalzaki would be embarrassed- But the worst thing is extremely lazy boss design, bosses are on every step, but they lack ""soul"" they're not memorable or epic and some are even reused across the game and unfortunately they usally just spam 2-3 attacksOverall I just can't recommend it just because the bosses. I can't strech how much they're disappointing so far and not really challenging most bosses can be easily beaten on first try I believe I'am still in an early game so we'll  how it will pan out, but so far Im little disappointed"
Negative,"Although a lot of fun, wait for when it is on sale. Giving a rate on a scale of 1-10 does not say enough, as such I have rated the game by chapter. . .Act 1: [9/10]Act 2: [9/10]Act 3: [7/10]Act 4: [8/10]Act 5: [6/10]Act 6: [3/10]Simply put, the ending was rushed AF, and is overall unsatisfying. Where early bosses and areas are fun to explore, well designed visually, have decent plots, and have fun bosses with interesting mechanics, this is lost with later chapters. Many later bosses are too easy or are difficult in a boring way like having very few moves but with long attack chains.And then there is the basic mechanics of the game. The combat is clunky it wants to be quick like Sekiro, but is slow and unresponsive, and worst of all inconsistent. I have a good, PC and experience no frame drops whilst playing, yet the time it takes to recover from being hit or making certain attacks is not always the same. About half of my deaths to certain bosses is because of the inconsistent/slow responsiveness, which otherwise where rather easy bosses.Despite all of this I still recommend the game just wait till it is like 33% or more off, it is not worth it at its full price, which is why I am giving it a thumbs down on steam. So while you are waiting, go play Sekiro it is simply a better version of this game."
Negative,"The fighting is typical [you're going to swing through whether you hit the target or not] it looks great, no performance issues for my old 1290T, you use the same weapon but have different fighting styles. I just turned it back in because PERSONALLY I'm more of a RPG guy instead of a Souls Like guy.Also A LOTTA of other games have come out and more a'com'n, my plate is full right now. I could very well rebuy it in the future or I may never look at it again, take this explanation for a downvote for what it is."
Negative,LINEARAFBAD BOSS BATTLESSTUPID COMBATPLAY GOT
Negative,Not my style of game play.
Negative,"too hard, game crashes too :("
Negative,elden ring has more soul per pixel than is in this entire game
Negative,i downloaded and ran the benchmark tool before i bought the game. i had no issues average of 94fps on very high settings. i also had no stutters freezes or frame drops of any kind. purchased the game and i cant even get through the opening cutscene without the game badly stuttering or freezing. tried multiple times restarting both the game and my computer with no luck. ive put in a refund request. i would suggest waiting to buy for a few weeks until the issues are ironed out.
Negative,"As a fan of Sun Wukong stories, I was looking forward to play this game. Alas I'm disappointed. Story is weak compared to original story. Main character has nothing of the charm, cheekiness and wits of Sun Wukong. How could he, he's a mute. So basically no character development. All you need to do is follow the path, kill everything in your way, collect 6 relics, kill the boss and that's it. For me this is a boring game that I will not replay. I wish I got it on discount. Plus side, songs in second chapter - very catchy.However this is my subjective feeling. If you are fan of Souls games, this may be of interest to you."
Negative,"This is an extremely overrated game. Good graphics but not better than Ragnarok, stellar blade or Gears 5. No difficulty levels, no maps, no navigation, no quick saves. It might take an hour to reach from a checkpoint to a strong level boss and should you die, you will have to wander off, re-kill all the enemies you already killed and lose yet another time from the boss. Exploring could be fun the first or second time, but after 10-20-30 time it's just frustrating. This multiplies the hours need to finish the game by forcing you to repeat the same levels over and over again. By the look of it, it will also have level requirements to beat certain bosses, just like Nioh, so you will have to play even more of the same to grind levels.So it is only destined to young children who havent anything else better to do with their time, but to spend several hundreds hours with this game in order to memorize paths and grind levels.Becoming better is less relevant that having a bigger level. so the necessary time wasted is mandatory...I expected more and got disappointed, use this just like a fair warning."
Negative,"This might upset a few people and it's not a BAD game... But I'm about halfway through chapter 2 anddd, idk man I'm just not feeling it. My main and possibly only gripe is that the combat just doesn't feel good to me, it feels clunky and you basically only have one attack button and the heavy attack really is just that. It doesn't chain or really flow into the light attack at all... It feels delayed and just not right, so I find myself just sitting and mashing the light attack button over and over with some dodges thrown in as needed. Yeah they give you a lot of other tools and cool things for combat, but I find at it's core there's just not much too it and I find it quite underwhelming and; for lack of a better word. Boring.... Like I said, the game story wise, graphics (after some tweaks to the settings) are all brilliant. But the combat just isn't it for me and that's what I feel should make the game. So I mean it's not bad I guess it just isn't for me, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't dissapointed :( GOTY for some, sadly. Not for me."
Negative,"I really don't get why people say this game has great art, to me it looks like the most generic unreal engine 5 nature pack, the motion blur is very annoying, I come from playing Elden Ring and I've heard people comparing and to me it makes no sense. As soon as you go outside of the path you hit invisible walls everywhere with the least amount of care for game design, just random invisible walls everywhere. The enemies are cool, and the animations are great, but to me the controls are very random coming from souls games. I like feeling in control of my character and for things to be precise, and random smoke, fog and particles flying around with tons of effect make the character not very fun to control for me. If you like the kind of games where you move forward along invisible walls, kill random enemies, fight a boss and then have random cut-scenes but overall feel like you got no agency outside of fighting bosses maybe you'll like it due to the awesome animations and cool boss designs."
Negative,"What an unfortunate game. Unlike what the creators of the game said, it IS a soulslike, with all the tedium it implies. If I'd known that beforehand, I wouldn't have spent 60€. Clearly disingenuous from Game Science. Everything about the game is excellent, except the difficulty spikes. I am currently stuck on a boss very early and I simply cannot beat it. I don't want to spend hours on the same boss, it's just a chore. If there are similar encounters later on, I doubt I'll finish the game.I spent 400 hours in Elden Ring, but in Elden Ring, if you find an ennemy that's too strong, you can simply explore the world and level up. Here, the game is linear, so if you can't beat the boss, then tough luck.Also, Fromsoft have always been honest about their game difficulty. The difficulty also kills the replayability, because there's no way I'd want to repeat the experience. Sadly it's the only flaw I find in this game, but since it's gameplay related, it's enough to make it a dealbreaker."
Negative,meh... its ok but not anything i would buy again. Fun for a bit but its not really that fun tbh. just a bunch of boss fights and no true skill required just keep leveling up
Negative,"Requesting a refund. It's pretty, but that's about it. Combat feels like a button masher action game... I was hoping for something closer to Sekiro"
Negative,"The game is not as great as I hoped. The best thing about this game is it's graphic fidelity.The world is beautiful but poorly designed. There are a lot of places which look like you could go there only to be met by an invisible for like 95% of the time.The fighting could be good, if it weren't as unresponsive as it is. The character often refuses to do basic things in combat like drinking from his gourd or performing abilities."
Negative,"To preface, this is coming from someone who 100% Elden Ring in ~2 weeks and loves Soulslikes... For all of the hype, this game ain't it. This is the definition of an overhyped game and it has nearly nothing to show for it. This game is essentially Chinese Dark Souls with all of the quirks of Chinese products, we all know and hate:1) Bland2) Unreliable3) BoringThis game has some positives but it's far outshined by the huge negatives. To begin, the combat in this game is extremely simple and I wouldn't consider this a bad thing usually... However, with this basic combat comes with glitchy lock-on mechanics, frame-rate drops and the worst camera angles I've ever seen in a game before. In nearly every fight you get into, if you dodge into a wall, or a rock, or anything of that nature, your camera just picks a random direction to move to and spazzes tf out - meaning, you can't see anything and you get hit by whatever you were trying to dodge in the first place. The dragon boss in Chapter 3 is one of the best examples of this because your camera locks onto the dragon's head but refuses to zoom out far enough for you to see the dragon actually attacking you. So you just endlessly dodge until you can move far enough away to see the attacks you're dodging... But then you can't attack it because you're too far away... 10/10 best boss fight ever.As alluded to, the bosses in this game are extremely annoying... Many of them just feel like checks in the box because they're so pointlessly easy while others have horrendous attack sequences with environmental effects or ranged enemies around them that make the fights go from challenging yet fun to ""how the hell am I even supposed to hit you right now?"" They had such potential for how amazing the art is in this game and they ruined it by failing to balance even the most basic things. And not fixing camera angles... I will not stop reiterating this. It really is that bad. And the frame-rate drops in some fights are so bad that you can't even see whats hitting you. The fight becomes a literal slideshow as the boss is swinging at you, skipping frames and making you fight the past with your button combos. When the game catches up, you're picking yourself up off the ground wondering what the hell just happened.Next, invisible walls... This game has some amazing scenery and environments to explore. But its so god damn linear. Everywhere you go, you're hitting an invisible wall. After a while, it feels like the devs had no intention of allowing their players to explore their world in the first place. You start to feel corralled into set paths, which wouldn't necessarily be a problem if the maps in each of the chapters weren't so huge with seamless open-worlds (and no map btw). So while you're getting lost on a 30 minute walk across a chapter, you might miss some side areas or entire side quests that you'll have to walk back through and find at a later time. Plus, as someone who loves collecting things, the loot in this game is just awful. So not only are you actively punished with wasted time for trying to explore (Ex: There's a huge desert where you fight a beetle and I shit you not, it takes you ~3 minutes to run across the entire arena. There's 0 loot in that entire desert arena. Completely pointless...) but when you do get loot, 9 times out of 10, you don't even want it. The loot from bosses suck most of the time too.Lastly, the story... If you bought this game hoping for a great retelling of the Journey to the West, refund it if you have the chance or go get a better understanding of it before starting. To preface, the game is originally written and dubbed in Chinese. So, the mouth movements don't match the vocals you hear. So if that bothers you, you'll be dealing with that for the entire game. That being said, unless you have extensive knowledge of the Journey to the West, none of the story elements will make any sense to you. You'll be completely lost and when you stop caring about the story because you don't know whats going on, the horrendous, boring and annoying-at-times gameplay loop won't be there to keep you engaged either.In conclusion, is this game worth playing? Sure. Its fun here and there. Is it worth $60? Absolutely not. This mobile game feel, Chinese Dark Souls knock off isn't worth buying unless its less than $30. Get it on sale and try it then. The juice ain't worth the squeeze right now."
Negative,"I512400 + RTX3060 (1080 High got 60-44fps), its not enjoyable experience because everytime you coldboot the game, its suffer with microstutter so you need to wait about 10-15 or even 1 hours ingame to get minimal stuttering. not worth for now, wait for many patch and get it on discount instead."
Negative,"Black Myth: Wukong is a visual masterpiece and a gameplay triumph, blending myth and action in a way that feels like wielding the Monkey King's staff itself—fluid, fierce, and full of surprises. The story? Epic, with stunning visuals and imaginative enemy designs that keep you on your toes.But... Denuvo. The 3rd-party DRM is like an uninvited guest that overstays their welcome, dragging performance down in what should be a high-flying adventure. It’s like strapping a stone to Wukong’s back. Without it, the game would truly shine!"
Negative,"This game is unforgiving, no difficulty adjustment, and not a lot of fun when dying dozens of times.A game should be challenging to the point where you can get your teeth into it, a determination to beat the enemy, and marvel in your victory!This game is non of that.Instead I found myself dying within 2 hits, 3 or 4 if i put sparks in to Robust Constitution. For those who are used to playing these types of games this is obviously easier but for the standard player this is simply not a fun game as the constant dying with no progression is demoralising.For those with more time to waste good luck and give it some stick,  for me this game is relegated to the ""Not Played group""For those wondering if they should get this game, it's a great game, fantastic visuals, but if you are limited by time or not used to this type of game-play I would seriously keep in mind the 2hr refund period when you first start playing, st least you can refund if you dont like it."
Negative,"Ok, so i've played about 6 hrs so far of this game. The graphics are beautiful. Fighting is fluid. My huge issue with this game is bosses. I've legit fought just boss after boss after boss. This game is legit a Boss rush game. There's like 4 people to take down before another boss fight. Then kill 2 more people. Boss fight. It's not enjoyable unless you like boss rush type games. That's all this game has been since I started. Start the game. Kill 7 guys. boss fight. Run right for 4 mins. Boss fight. Go down some stairs. 1 new enemy. boss fight. go up some stairs. ring a bell. oh what do you know. boss fight. kill 5 new guys. boss fight. It really isnt that fun in the grand scheme of being a 70$ game."
Negative,"Revised the review from before, still giving this heap of garbage a huge thumbs down.Game is a blast until chapter three, then it takes a massive nosedive into bargain bin garbage.  You'll see what I mean.  Uninstalling.  Do better.It isn't hard or difficult.  Its unfair and CRINGE mechanics and awful level design.  I would have given this a solid 7 but the Padoga area in chapter three brings this game down to a 4 at best.  Trash.  Wish i could refund its so bad."
Negative,"1. Read the TOS,  Carefully, 2. B1.exe has already tried to send data over the network that windows stopped. 3 .  I did nnot agree to their TOS because i knowing the Chinese communist party is their judicial and regulatory part and I know they have minions inside each company located that require data to be shared with them on a constant basis.  I did not agree to the TOS set with this game ."
Negative,The yellow wind sage is the worst boss ever created in gaming history
Negative,Taiwan is a country
Negative,game doesn't work with AMD cards
Negative,Very clunky combat. Nice graphics.
Negative,crash crash crashes even on performance mode
Negative,"This ain't it chief.There are invisible walls everywhere, and the gameplay doesn't offer anything new. It's just another Souls-like game, and I've already seen dozens like it."
Negative,great game extremely unfair insane hit boxes bosses half of the time are running away from u and u cant attack them so u have to play a far distance game every corner u turn to there is a boss waiting for u if u like playing that are unfair go ahead and buy this
Negative,"if you're a casual player like me and just like story driven games then this isn't for you. i picked this up after steam recommending it as id played god of war and i took a quick look and it looked similar. Graphically its amazing and runs well...,. but the combat isnt casual friendly in the slightest. you face bosses in every area of which seem impossible to actually kill regardless of sparks used to upgrade yourself. Bosses throw you around like a rag doll while your stick tickles their testicles to make them laugh while they do so... no difficulty settings and ive got bored of dying to the same mechanics over and over with no clues as to how to avoid them bosses 100% OP and damage output is too much 90% of the time vs the 10% they are imobilised."
Negative,The clunky combat is way below the standards of the games of which this was clearly inspired by. The English translation is a a distracting burden.
Negative,"This game is for hardcore gamer only, If you just want to chill and enjoy the story and game play, DO NOT BUY IT. IT IS F.......CKING HARD to complete I spend 4 hour to fight just 1 one boss die a 100 times."
Negative,Dunno where to go
Negative,"Once you get past the breathtaking graphics (truly the best looking game I've ever played) and the flashy designs and animations, this game has too many hollow features to recommend. The combat is very repetitive, the world areas are built for grinding, and none of the non-boss enemies pose any serious threat. Though a handful of the bosses were outstanding challenges, most can be beaten in the first 2-3 attempts. The map design, like everything in this game, is built to show off just how incredible the game looks, but when you try and explore it you will find it littered with invisible walls with zero consistency on where they're placed. The game marketed itself on being full of secrets, but if you try and search for them you will be fighting to find which obvious path isn't blocked by an intrusive invisible barrier. I would say roughly 1 in 25 times I have found that the path was a genuine path that lead me to an interesting secret which to me is unacceptable as a game mechanic.  There are two sides to this coin however, because for 99% of the game you will not be able to fall off any cliffs thanks to these invisible walls, until the game decides to remove those barriers with no warning. Three examples are a fight on a bridge in chapter 2, a beam you had to balance on in chapter 3 (though only one of the several beams actually let you run off), and then I came across a window that my character inexplicably and automatically jumped through in that automatic assassins creed kind of way and then fell off the cliff. 99% of cliffs will not let you fall, but some do for no reason. Then later, you will come across enemies that are able to knock you off despite you being unable to walk off, but also you can accidentally fall off if your animation leads you over the edge while the enemy is nearby, though most of these enemies cannot fall off themselves. I wrote these inconsistencies off initially as being a product of making a map specifically for looks and not for gameplay, but it got so bad by chapter 3 that I can no longer overlook it as I've never seen a high quality game with this level of inconsistencies in its core gameplay. I other had complaints about the story and some of the more videogame-y aspects too (e.g. all villains feel like disney villains, people in the world only exist to give you upgrades), but the inconsistencies in map design are so egregious that I don't want to divert the focus of this review.Ultimately this game is the best looking game i've ever played, but plays with the depth and feel of a mobile game. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a souls like, nor would I recommend it to anyone who enjoys exploration games. The enemies are too easy, the boss fights are pushovers, and the beauty of the map design is completely ruined by invisible walls."
Negative,"Cant even play the past 1 min, keep crashing.And i got 7800X3D, 7900XTX, DDR5 24 GB ram.Since i ran any other game perfectly, i gonna blame this game optimization for now."
Negative,Black myth: endless game crashessuper fun when it works.
Negative,"Black Myth: Wukong is a game chocked with gorgeous but indistinguishable environmental assets mostly, with imaginative enemy types, many of whom come with overly re-hashed move-sets.  Not nearly as bad has Lords of the Fallen but I found myself rushing to get to the boss fights for some much needed excitement.  The Developers thought their game's impressive looking graphics would negate the need of a map, in that the breathtaking nature locales would inspire exploration, and thus exploration would eventually lead you to your next objective or hidden items; very frustrating at times because no matter how inviting the graphics are, a game-world needs a sense of landmarking to keep your sense of direction intuitive and rewarded.  Its true that the game is basically linear, so that helps.  But that's in the beginning.  Eventually it will open up a bit with more traversal options, all the while remaining NOT an open world.  A bit confusing to say the least.  A narrative-driven game with the world-lore viscerally low, because the fact that enemy placement and environmental variations do indeed matter in establishing lore; and this game doesn't even have that as an afterthought.  Having a plentiful of Ancient Chinese mythical-cultural motifs doesn't automatically mean lore is fulfilled, you've had to had read the Novel Journey To The West in preparation; but that would need to be a requirement to playing the game and please do that if you are looking for an extra credit assignment.  Most players are not and should not do so because the game should have the abundant lore for you to explore.  Philosophical poetics within characters' colloquies seems appropriate to story yet all the while feeling inconsequential.  Of course the controls are good and responsive with engaging combat - boss fights mainly.  The Difficulty 'Get-Good' approach Game Science has borrowed from FromSoftware is here in all its superficial glory, and I say that because 1. Fromsoftware is the developer to copy from these days, and 2. 'superficial' due to all of whom copy from FromSoftware do not get the whole 'Difficulty' mechanic.  FromSoftware balances difficulty with tactical/strategic variations, even to the point of player invention (breaking the game).  In BMY, you can cycle through your entire arsenal of offensive/defensive options in fighting a boss and, along with the cool downs, the combat feels needlessly stifling.  On rinse and repeat, throughout the game, downright boring.  And you damn right I'm comparing BMY's combat-mechanics to the SoulsBourne Formula because, at least in its unmemorable Boss Fights, Game Science has heavily implemented it.  Don't let those YT content creators with their '10 Things I Wish I Knew Before Playing', '10 Items To Get Early On', 'This Is How The Game Is Meant To Played' hyped-up videos fool you, they are just trying to draw eyes to their channels with a relatively new game that is nothing special in experiencing pass the initial hour of game time.  A stunning looking game mind you, though lacking ground-breaking substance.  Another copy-paste attempt of the alluring difficulty Boss Fight-mechanics from FS with a beautiful and imaginative interpretive overlay of that 16th century novel of which most of us don't know anything about.  A bore and a chore of an adventure you should wait to purchase until it goes on sale for $35.Developers (especially Publishers) are not our friends, nor are they working with us towards enriching our video gaming evolutionary experience.  Yeah they may love what they do but its making money first and foremost for them.  We have the money they want and need, and we give it to them when they deliver on what we're supposed to get for our dollar.  Nothing short of Substantive Excellence.  We work hard for our dollars and they should work even harder for it if they so wish us to part with it."
Negative,"Not a bad game, but the controls are super sloppy. You get combo locked A LOT, and there are practically no storyline at all, just a crap ton of bosses for you to fight, so good for you, those combat lovers out there. I hope the developers put mechanics like cancelling animation, or immediate dodging mid-combo. That would be really sick"
Negative,"Came for story, with some combat, got almost nothing but combat, don't really see the point tbh. It nothing but a boss rush which isn't fun for me"
Negative,"Somehow it was a frustrating trip into a lukewarm story filled in with the half-alive mobs, sometimes diluted (all of a sudden) with some impossibly to beat (especially considering the actual levels achieved to the moment). How for in this World the most agile and acrobatically top proficient the 'Emperor Monkey"" was found unable to climb rocks? Ridiculousness after the same. Overpriced apparently, brazenly. Specifically when we have a near perfect brilliant Wo Long: Fallen Dinasty  from Koei Tecmo USA, featuring a whole lot more lavish content, sprinkled with multiplayer and capped with an vast world with the diverse levels of freedom achievable. No, I do not play this one. it's shoddy chinese makeshift"
Negative,"Needs work, not worth $60.  I'll be back when it's half price and the hype has died down."
Negative,Its a good game but not getting consistent frame rates regardless of any adjustments I do.  wait for patches. wait on sale.
Negative,"Bad balance, especially Tiger Boss:("
Negative,"Game is fun, story is good, mechanics are better then some. But that assumes you can get it to run. For $60 I shouldn't have to do anything to play the game. Instead, I spent 2 days configuring and digging thru game files just to get a random 45 minutes game time here and there. It's not an Intel problem, it's not a Nvidia problem, it's not an AMD problem. This is a Game Science problem.If Game Science ever gets the game fixed, I'll be more than happy to come back and change my review. But no one should spend that kinda money for this aggravation."
Negative,"13 Hours on record, game has completely frozen probably 6 times and has crashed to desktop just short of 20 times. AMD 7900 XT at high settings. Cannot recommend this for AMD users because allegedly its an AMD issue. VERY frustrating because i really like the game."
Negative,"Gorgeous game, when its not freezing. The combat does not have a lot of weight and attacks don't feel satisfying. Enemy telegraphs are generally unpredictable and it's difficult to know when you are taking damage without keeping a constant eye on your health. 6/10 - I returned it because it did not feel fun to play."
Negative,"Many will not read this, since most believe that Wukong is a flawless and perfect masterpiece.However, i have now put 6+ hours into this, and i want to voice my gripes.-UE5This game runs on Unreal Engine 5, it uses Nanite and Lumen, high-end RT features and generally high fidelity assets.Since i'm on a PC that is the very high-end, and there are no better graphics cards or gaming processors currently available, i will be using this as the measurement (RTX 4090, 7800X3D, 32GB DDR5 RAM).My resolution is set to 3840x2160, my settings are maxed out, including RT, i am using DLSS balanced and frame generation to have a somewhat playable experience (latest drivers, latest windows update that improves Ryzen CPU performance).This already rang alarm bells for me, as no other game is this demanding, while also being this linear and limited in scope.Alot of assets, in spite of all settings being set to 'cinematic', are often lacking severely in quality, there are too many low-res textures used in places where the devs assumed nobody would see.The animation quality albeit being alright, is still requiring polish, as some enemies will glide across the floor if you're out of reach, or turn around in midair with lunges because apparently they are now homing missiles.Other times, attacks that do visibly hit an enemy, will simply not hit, reasons unknown to me as of yet, while some other attacks just feel clunky and jumbled.On top of all this, there are severe stutters involved.The lower the settings, the better they get, but you cannot be rid of them no matter how low you set your settings.All of the above are a huge hindrance to enjoying this title, at least in my own experience, and i won't be going into all the visual clutter and artifacting that also has been happening to me alot in the second area of the game.-StoryIf you are familiar with this story, then you won't really care much about it in this game, or how it's being told.To me, who is not very familiar with the journey to the west, it felt very strange, very broken up, too abrupt and often out of place.Even the animated piece at the end of chapter 1 was kinda strange .. and a bit hard to follow.They seemed to have borrowed these segments from Nioh, without understanding how Nioh made it work.The Story in short, makes absolutely no sense to me, and i don't enjoy it.This game is not story focused though, so it may not bother you at all.-Gameplayin and by itself, the gameplay is not bad at all, the systems involved in it are quite decent.However, dealing with alot of hard to reach ranged mobs is an absolute pain, as you don't have a weapon that can reach that far (perhaps this changes into the future, but this does not change that in the first two chapters, you cannot reach ranged targets, and they keep sniping at you without a care), so you have to find an alternative route or a way to climb to where the ranged units are, or try to use attacks that may reach them somehow.It's not fun, it dampens the enjoyment of the game, and feels like a huge oversight about gameplay mechanics.Due to stutters and performance issues, many battles become a fight against the game's unpolished and unoptimized nature.More often than not, you are fighting the game's systems itself, rather than it's bosses and enemies, which is quite frustrating.The Skilltree is not bad at all, but most of the information presented in it, are too vague (speaking about moderate increases, numbers are required to understand how significant or insignificant an upgrade is).What also bothers me, is the fact that all of the skilltrees and mechanics that you can upgrade, use all of the one and the same upgrading currency.In my opinion, this makes little sense, but that's just a personal gripe.Looking at Nioh 2, that game resolves this much better.-File Sizeyes, i am going to mention that Wukong takes up more than 120 GB of space, as i cannot wrap my head around the reason why.The First Descendant also uses the same Engine, has alot of open maps on which you do missions and explore, it also has high fidelity assets and textures, and more voice acting than Wukong does.So how is it, that First Descendant requires only half if not less space, than Wukong does?There is bloat and unoptimization involved.-final thoughtsAs Wukong is right now, i cannot recommend it.It is a full-price title after all, no matter the history behind the game or the devs who made it, they should've put more work into optimizing and refining their game.I am Sure that Wukong can be a very enjoyable game, but as it stands, especially with high-end systems, and if you are prone to notice stutters, then avoid this game.Your time and money are spent better elsewhere."
Negative,"Game is alright but very overrated. It's a front loaded game for player enjoyment. The one thing this game does well is the visuals, so congratulations for that. Would be a recommend but most reviews are so positive that I gotta downvote it.The map design is terrible, with most maps having tons of invisible walls which are indistinguishable from the main path. The player can never be sure if they're discovering an exciting new area or completely wasting their time. The maps aren't cohesive, with one particular map suddenly allowing you to fall to your death from every platform, seemingly laughing at players who have come to expect the invisible walls by this point. There is a disregard for the players time in general, as many boss arenas are open/accessible to the player but have no boss or event due to not fulfilling some unclear criteria. You will often have to double back to these ""waiting"" arenas. Googling is a must for anyone trying to 100% this game.Levelling system is alright. Most fun part is definitely unlocking new skills, but for some reason players can spend up to 60 sparks on the Survival tree's base stats. 60 is an absurdly high amount to put into stats, which unfortunately is often the best and safest way to get stronger. Nice quality of life allowing players to respec.The combat is clunky. Sometimes your characters takes longer to drink the gourd than it feels like he should. The freeze spell will randomly get cancelled and not refunded, with some bosses just instantly unfreezing because you got unlucky and used it during a cutscene. Every staff is basically the same, so you're gonna be using the same moveset the entire game after chapter 2. The charged heavy animation is long and feels like you have to get lucky to get it off without being interrupted. Some bosses can cancel your heavy and some will back-step and reposition. Parrying with a resolute strike is unreliable because you get locked into swing animations. Transformations are cool though, good job.Boss design is bad. Bosses have extremely fast moves with no windup that you cannot react to. You will have to retry bosses to learn tells and dodge preemptively, so there's no ""fairness"" in a first attempt. Many late game bosses will have a sequence where they turn invincible and force the player to dodge for 15 seconds, essentially wasting your time. Boss difficulty balancing doesn't make much sense, a lot of throwaway ""bosses"" are extreme pushovers while others will be strong. Some boss models will make you miss your attacks while you cannot walk any closer to the boss.Play Elden Ring or Sekiro instead."
Negative,"game play is fun but back tracking and looking for bosses in huge empty maps is killing the fun. The game world feels very empty, non-boss monsters are very insignificant and you cannot fight the bosses you have defeated again until next play through. Combat is simple, I feel like it will get boring after nothing more remains to unlock."
Negative,"I wanted to love this game but I actually think I might hate it. I am not a souls fan but I can still just about play Elden ring because you can power level through it, this game is just too challenging and the fact that they said it isn’t a souls like has left me feeling slightly mis sold. To me a souls like involves doing little damage and receiving a shit ton in return and this is exactly what this game is. On top of that you go from one boss to another and never really feel rewarded for sticking it out and overcoming the challenge.I would like a refund but I can’t despite most of my gameplay being spent dying to the whiteclad snake man thing, which I did eventually kill only to be rewarded with more boss fights."
Negative,"Action game with a lot of potential that focuses on boss fights, that are becoming worse and worse as you progress the game. The game gives you a sense of freedom in the combat, but then randomly renders your skills ineffective against different bosses and thus forces you into some specific combat mechanic, Most annoying are the scripted ""cut scenes"" during late boss fights that are ALWAYS played as a reaction on your combat inputs. It works in a game that focuses on cinematic experience, but not in a game where combat mechanics should play important role.Graphics and the world is nice, but exploration is frustrating when you run into a invisible wall all the time. Less ""open world"" is sometimes more.Overall a good game if it gets a major discount. Until then try Stellar Blade or Wo Long."
Negative,"It's boring, repetitive, extremely linear and the level design is the worst in class.Invisible walls.Everyone's favourite boss mechanic - delayed attacks V2 chained delayed attacks.To avoid having to design good bosses and spend a lot of time tweaking the counterplay, they've made the I-frame hilariously large to trivialize 99% of bosses.I have no idea what the story is or what the point of anything is because I didn't read Journey to the West. I am tempted to blame translation but I think the game just straight up expects you to come to class prepared.The game is going to live entirely on the novelty factor of it not being a Fromsoft game set in Japan or GRRM's krangled mind. It is fun until it isn't and then you have to get over the fact that you spent 60 euro on it.Do I recommend? no. 4/10"
Negative,"Souls-players say ""It's too easy!"" and non-Souls-players say ""it's too hard.""Be careful who you listen to. Don't believe anyone who tells you Black Myth Wukong is not a Souls-like. It is. If you loved JEDI Fallen Order or JEDI Survivor, like me, this Wukong game probably isn't for you until an Easy Mode mod comes out or something.Dodge timing is impossible for me to figure out and execute. My arthritic hands hurt. Even the ""Cheese method"" tutorials get me killed. I haven't felt this handicapped since I didn't know what Elden Ring was and bought that. I have tried grinding levels to build my skill tree to OP status for nearly 5 hours and I STILL can't beat that Big Head guy or the Fire Wolf guy in the first zone.I hope they accept my refund request. I'm still stuck with Elden Ring and I can't get anywhere in that either."
Negative,"First of all, let me be clear that I wanted to LOVE this game - ever since it was announced, I couldn’t wait to get my hands on it, as I’m a huge fan of the original material, and the game trailers were so visually impressive.After more than 10 hours on it, I’m becoming more and more frustrated and disappointed - the game has been advertised as a triple-A action RPG game that could deliver a classic, Ace-level experience in gameplay, story, and presentation, which is what AAA means. However, in reality, I’m feeling that only the visuals are top-notch. The gameplay, story, and various bad design decisions and glitches have really had a negative impact on the experience. It’s almost like the journey to the west is long and arduous, and the things that wear you down are tiny, like sands in your shoes.First of all, the visuals are top-notch - I think it is one of the top 3 best-looking ARPGs I’ve played, up there with God of War Ragnarok and Spider-Man 2. I applaud the head of the studio, who is the art director of the game, for pulling off stunningly beautiful scenes.The problem is, maybe the studio spent too much energy polishing the look yet did not spend enough time polishing the gameplay and story, pushing WUKONG to fall off the list of my all-time favorite action games.Combat System - this is the biggest issue for me; the game lacks a strong action feel (or A.K.A Hit Feel). The staff hitting any enemies feels exactly the same as hitting cotton duvet; there are severe instantaneous response and continuity issues. In God of War, when you use an axe versus blade or spear, the vibration on the controller is entirely different, even with the same weapon, hitting different types of enemies using different types of combos feels different as well. This is the soul of any action game that should be prioritized in the first place. Yet WuKong failed at this most crucial part.Weapon System - I was dubious when it was revealed that you’ll only have one weapon to use, but I thought Game Science would come up with additional systems to combat the resulting repetitiveness of gameplay. But I’m so disappointed that it’s not the case. Every enemy you fight feels exactly the same, you can use exactly the same tactic over and over again, and there is no such thing as surprises or discovery. Just dodge and smash, very pathetic indeed.The Semi-Open World - I can see that WuKong is trying to learn from some soul-like games to build a world that feels massive when it is not. But the invisible walls, poorly designed way-finding system, and lack of map make it so frustrating to explore. They could have compensated for the lack of map with world design that, when you go for a different path, the environment could be slightly different to support navigation, but they did not. Every path looks exactly the same, and I’m telling you, I have never been so frustrated finding my way to a game save point.The Story - I hate to call it, but let’s be honest, this is a boss-rush game; the story does not exist. We don’t have a coherent narrative of why, who, and how. You just beat one boss and try to locate the next one, and you can only find it when you are not lost. This might not be a big deal to others, and I know souls games most of the time don’t have really invested stories. But I wish Game Science had advertised it like that; they showed us epic cut-scenes one after another, misleading us that there is a strong presence of narrative behind the game when it is nothing but.OverallI just simply cannot believe this game is rated 10/10 here. This is at best 7 out of 10, a good game but far from a masterpiece. It's too late for me to return the game so I'll see the later game play would change my mind."
Negative,"fun until snake boss, who is impossible."
Negative,Poor hit registration and terribly slow and buggy cameras is the reason this game is hard.
Negative,Meh.  Play Devil May Cry first.  7.5/10
Negative,Fix the bullshit yellow sage fight
Negative,"In a nutshell bossfights are like this:- dodge bosses attacks for half an hour and wait until your spell is off cooldown- make spell do some damage- watch the boss again for half an hour and dodge his attacks- repeatThere are no builds, the skilltree is the worst I´ve ever seen in a game. There are much more negative aspects to this game, but the most important one is, where this game has to shine (bossfights, combatsystem) it sucks."
Negative,"Audio is buggy.  During cutscenes, I have zero audio and no subtitles. Music is also missing (even the Music Library doesn't work). This kills immersion for me. (I've tried all sorts of settings, different languages, etc. No good)Other stuff also could be implemented for a better experience:- Skipping cutscenes.- Optional saving.- Not having to start the game from the last save point (incense shrine).Asking for refund, so far."
Negative,"Dont get me wrong the game graphics and style area awesome. Some of use do not have the best hand to button coordination .  I tried over 3 hours to take out the Wondering Wight. This is just the beginning. Im all about having fun with story and graphics and slight challenged. I dont want the game to be too challenging to not enjoy the money I spent for it. If your super good and with the controller this game might be ok for you. Im a keyboard mouse guy and its not that bad but you can't bind key strokes.  In the end , unless they patch it to have a slider with just boss fights for difficulty level I'm pretty much done with this game. I will try to get my money back. I'm in my 50's and have bad arthritis so its a little difficulty for me. I have read about hundreds if not thousands having the same problem. I watch these awesome streamers making it look so easy and even watched help videos., with no luck. To those who rock this game my hat is off in respect for you."
Negative,"2002 gameplay with dodge, light attack and heavy attack. A lot of artificial difficulty, I mean a lot. Bad level design and a meh story."
Negative,"Said monkey in the forums, got banned from the steam forum for a week because of ""racism"". But here on the reviews section every second or third review mentions monkey.. wtf"
Negative,Games mid people just glazing cause of social media hype
Negative,"You can no longer authenticate on new devicesCurrently your game purchase cannot be re-validated successfully, please wait 24 hours and try again."
Negative,Its ok but gets pretty boring quickly. Act 1 was good
Negative,"Переоценёонный кусок говна. На мой взгляд, разрабы бы могли сделать эту игру доступной для всех. Но им, походу, пофиг)Overrated piece of shit. In my opinion, developers could make this game available for everyone (in terms of difficulty). Apparently, they don't care."
Negative,The last boss and secret boss in chapter 3?.... Yeah I am done with these type of games.... I enabled comments to hear someone say get git gud even though I beat them... It just becomes unfun after a certain point. By the time you get to chapter 5 it starts to feel like a slog.Beautiful art direction and graphics. There was definitely passion put into this but when is enough enough? Souls bs is getting old.
Negative,"Dont play on pc,,rtx 3060ti its very bad video quality,,also frames drops when fighting with the boss,,overall very bad experience"
Negative,"the game has good boss fights but its completely linear with no room for exploration, good for just 1v1 bosses every 2 seconds otherwise do not buy"
Negative,game just isn't fun imo
Negative,"Is not a bad game but to be honest it gets boring after a few hours, i would recommend it if it was cheaper"
Negative,"The game lags really badly an often crashes, i use a laptop ASUS Strix G16. I was under the impression that it would work despite on the lowest graphic setting."
Negative,"Yellow Brow. He's just an awful boss. In his third encounter, you just have to stand there and listen to him monologue through multiple invulnerability phases and there's scripted damage twice in the encounter. He's not hard from a skill perspective, just patience."
Negative,"I was so excited for this game, but I'm struggling to want to play anymore. I see others praising it as GOTY and claiming the combat is satisfying, and I'm over here thinking I must have bought the wrong game. Don't get me wrong, though, The game looks great. I really like the characters, cutscenes, and scenery. Everything is gorgeous, but the gameplay and level design sort of kill it for me. Invisible walls and ""thinly veiled corridor level design"" (as someone else said) are things I thought we left in the PS2/PS3 era. At first glance you'll think ""Oh there's so much I can go do and explore,"" but, no, you actually can't. You're locked into various hallways that you'll have to run down to proceed. There will be places that seem accessible. You may even jump to attempt to access those places, but you'll be jumping headfirst into an invisible wall. The combat is also being praised, and I guess I get it because of the abilities, but the main light combo with heavy attacks is just not satisfying to me. Idk, It's missing something.The game seems as if it's trying to be a mix of soulslike and the recent GOW games, and it fails to be either. I wouldn't buy this unless it was at least half off."
Negative,"Game isn't great. FPS is terrible regardless of top of the line modern rig. Combat is spam Square/X simulator. Made it about halfway through chapter 2 while trying to 100% all the encounters. Design and vibes are pretty cool and I wanted to like the game because of that. The set pieces are cool and I;m sure they continue to get more bombastic and interesting as the game progresses.I am vaguely aware of the journey to the West storyline but everything felt nonsensical in the story (maybe translation issues?). The core game mechanics of stuns, freeze, and summons very often don't work at all. They just fail to cast completely which is annoying and removes what little depth combat has to offer in most scenarios. Was excited for the game but unfortunately doesn't have much to offer outside of beautiful albeit choppy visuals, vibes and a lot of pressing square. When you hit me with the Jester just know you're a dumb, hive think individual who needs to create your own opinions and not follow whatever group think commands you to hold opinions that aren't your own as truth."
Negative,"Not quite sure what all the hoopla is about this game. there's less than zero story, no map, no hints as to what to do. Just run around aimlessly and attack monsters. I dont get it. maybe it's just not for me. I would have refunded it but the intro was about a 45 mins long and I played it for awhile trying to like it. Oh well, you win some you loose some."
Negative,"Unplayable with AMD. Constant crashes even on the lowest settings with specs that should comfortably run on high. I never got through the intro cutscene, and when I finally gave in and decided to just skip it, the audio started to bug out and it constantly lagged during the first fighting sequence that teaches you to play the game before finally crashing again. What a horrible experience for a game that looks so much fun."
Negative,"heavily watered down nioh 2 gameplay, realistic overstimulating graphics w shitty stuff like dlss and framegen ruining games, overall kinda mid"
Negative,"If you like games like GOW, definitely get this. If you want more of a challenge, this isn't really the game."
Negative,As others have said:If you've an AMD card this likely won't work for you at the moment
Negative,HARD NO for now - I have been Trying to play and stream the game for 1.5 hours now. Tried different settings from FSR to TSR to DX11 and DX12 even Low quality settings BUT the game crashed in the very first cinematic and there is no way to skip it. I would not recommend getting the game right now give it some time to fix the Bugs and Crashes (specially AMD users)
Negative,Probably the most over-hyped game I've ever bought. As linear as a 2D Mario side-scroller and describing it as 'souls-like' is a serious stretch. Honestly there's very little to it
Negative,"Do you like invisible walls and being the only monkey incapable of climbing over a small ledge? Do you like being a pin cushion for low level archers you can almost never kill? Do you like cut scenes that throttle your system and story over game play? If you answered yes, then ignore this review. If any of the above is concerning, be warned that the game is far over hyped. It is a good game, but it seems like it over cooked in the oven. There are clear directions they wanted to take the gameplay but got scraped and band aids put over. I'm overly disappointed and would recommend you look elsewhere for a solid game."
Negative,"i enjoyed this game for the first 5-10 hours, but with a terrible map design of chapter 2 and progressively gets worse as the chapters go on, it made me not want to play anymore. having no actual map to look at is a serious flaw. i constantly get lost finding my way around. gameplay gets repetitive as time goes on and honestly gets frustrating. i really hope this doesnt win game of the year. i am gonna keep on playing for completion but i am dreading it"
Negative,"Overhyped.tldr startI hate myself for following the Wukong hype, the game starts with strong visuals and smooth looking combat. It made me feel this might be game of the year material, but it falls flat so fast, which is a shame for a full price title.If you want to feel like monkeee and smash stick on enemies, or you like chinese culture, this might float your boat.tldr endWukong is what you get when a company tries to mix a casual hack and slash with Soulslike elements and put it in the Unreal Engine. It comes with highly detailed rocks (thanks to the technology called Nanite), the Niagara fluid simulation for water/blood pools. The only unique or mentionable thing in this game from the developers themselves are the many different looking artstyles for cutscenes, which I admit look amazing. The combat feels smooth, but you realize really quick how shallow it is (or at least they don't show it in the first 20 hours of the game). Most of the time you 1 tap enemies with your charged heavy attack or 1 combo them before they can do anything. Even if you miss your attack/attacks on a still standing enemy, you can still throw many of your other abilities at them, before you consider reading their attack patterns. It's underwhelming that this even works for some smaller, but still interesting looking bosses. The devs throw one boss after another at you which can be cheesed like that. In the end, there is not much to care about them. The only memorable fight I had Yin Tiger, was sadly disrupted by heavy perfomance issues. The game so far ran on locked 60 fps on ryzen 3700x and nvidia 3060. However, this fight has micro stutters / freezes even on low settings.Speaking of hardware tanking. The environments are a bunch of randomly photographed chinese architecture models thrown randomly into the engine. The geometry is highly detailed, but most of the time they build corridors with inconsistent invisible walls. There is no fullfilment in exploring the environment. They don't show you what's ahead and you also can't look back to see your progress in the world.Here is an anecdote from my first review after 15 hours:The quality drop in chapter 3 is insane. First, I fought a boss Kang-Jin Loong that makes me miss 90% of my attacks. The story in this part, spoiler free, since it makes no sense anyway. I suddenly turn into a bat, auto-fly around aimlessly for a minute, find this boss, then I'm drowning, then I wake up, then somebody instantly knocks me out again. Then I wake up in a hole and turn into a wild monkey... like who wrote this nonsense? This all feels unfinished.The wild monkey with reduced health is an unexplained gimmick that now just happens after x minutes. I'm now running around minutes in the most boring and repetitive corridors. Then some genius level designer placed rewards in such a way, that I need to either backtrack a lot or even worse, fall down and go back up again. While doing so, I missed a jump or suddenly can go to a small crack in the wall to fall down to my death Dark Souls 1 style, even though many bigger cracks before had invisible walls.Then I fight a boss captain Lotus which can still trigger the wild monkey gimmick, turning many of his abilities to 1 shots. If that doesn't sound fun, the developers also added a laser spam attack that knocks you down multiple times. Fine, I ignore the boss, maybe I need to proceed and turn off the gimmick. Found another boss captain wise, who seems to be the culprit. But god damn it. I'm only allowed to tickle his feet and his health is so huge. So I'm tickling him for 3 minutes straight, but of course he uses the gimmick and now the grab and another attack can 1 shot me again.Before I get any git gud, I fought the Elden Ring DLC endboss, dealt with a crap ton of issues, but still enjoyed fighting the boss for 12h straight. But these last 2 wukong bosses feel cheap. So far, I needed max 3 tries for bosses. Until this point the game was ez af, normal enemies are nonexistent.Besides, on my ryzen 3700x, 3060rtx I still get random frame drops, ie when summoning spirits or simply fighting. Sometimes inputs are dropped entirely, so I miss healing or dodging."
Negative,"TLDR:- CHECK FOR MISSABLE BOSSES (Chapters 2-5)- Chapters 1-2 + Hard Bosses - Streamlined af- Chapters 3-4 + Wider areas to explore - Easy Bosses- Chapter 5 - Streamlined & Easy Bosses- Chapter 6 + Wider areas to explore - Easy BossesPros:- The most epic and badass intro ever- Beautiful (Like really beatiful) graphics. The lighting looks more realistic than in real life.- The sand, water and snow physics are so insane, even the staff touching it is accurate.- Cool outfits- The music of the headless benjo guy is a banger- The adrenaline shortly before killing an enemy- The character voices are insane, as well as the sounds. The undertone of the characters always has the right animalistic tone to it.- Despite the linear gameplay, there are some nice secrets- Chapter 3 opens up a bit and you can explore more. Chapter 4 is a maze where you are free to explore.- Collecting the OG wukong set in chapter 6 was actually fun, even though the bosses were too easy- The fight against Erland after the ""bad"" ending was sooo epic. I wish the whole game would have been like that. Sadly, you have to do the boring last fight again...Cons:- No character customization- Missable quests, combined with unclear language (for example you have to grind village people for 10min until an item drops. However, I thought the item he was talking about dropped from the boss. Turns out, after beating this boss, you can't do the quest anymore)- I play as a monkey but am not allowed to climb- You get introduced into the game with every skill and after the most epic bossfight, everything is taken from you. You can only leftclick + roll in the first 2 chapters.- Hitboxes are weird for some few enemies (I am a monster hunter main and I get Freedom Unite Plesioth vibes. A low kick that you jump over hits, water 2m in front of you hits, etc. etc.)- No exploration in the first 2 chapters, the areas are basically one big line. If there is anything exciting or nice looking, it is blocked by an invisible wall.- The landscapes are too generic- You don't get the story without knowing the Chinese Mythology and every character speaks in riddles- Bad lipsync- Framedrops even with an RTX 4080 Super (Rare but especially in fights it's just annoying)- Unpausable cutscenes (We are talking about 10+ minutes after bosses and 1+ minutes each try for some bosses)- Chapters 3-6 are way too easy (Like you 1st/2nd try every boss)- A Chapter 4 achievement is bugged for me. I got all 3 talismans but the 4th is located on an invisible pillar which I can't interact with- RNG achievements: ""So you have to get that seed, which has a drop rate of 0.01% and you have to wait 30min real time in between to get another chance. Good luck! :):):)""Bossfight Rant:- You have to refocus the enemy every single fight and I did not find the option to autofocus bosses. And there are even some fights where the focus is lost midfight and you have to refocus. Sometimes you press the button and still Wukong does not focus the enemy.- One boss fight has an area the boss can get into and you can't. If he is stuck there, he spams ranged attacks while a tornado chases you. While you can't hit him- After dying to buggy hitboxes, you have to walk to the enemy again (Like 1-2min each time), which is a waste of time- The other time, you have to fight a dragon, which only has a hitbox on its head and tail. You guessed right, it is flying so that you can't hit them most of the time and have to try and catch him. And yes, you also guessed right. There is an invisible wall that he can enter and you can't.- The last boss fight was soo boring and disappointing. He had no elemental attacks whatsoever. He took your cool armor so that you couldn't even go all out in the last fight. And you were only able to really use 1 spell since he was immune to one and the others were ineffective.- Some heavy hits connect but deal no damage. Also how is it possible that a tornado can't hit a flying boss? I mean it should be very effective no?- In the last fight, you can get frozen mid air, and then your hitbox is on the ground. How would I know? I got oneshot by an earthquake. IN THE AIR."
Negative,unreal engine 5 graphics with dark soul ripoff game play again. if you haven't played a soulslike in a while or just really like souls-like games you'll like this one. I'm personally fucking done with every single game copy pasting the dark souls formula with maybe a tiny little change but mostly just completely ripping off the dark souls formula. if you dont mind any of this youre gonna love it personally i love the game because of the myth the setting and the music but gameplay wise its just not that good at all but it has that dark soulls satisfaction factor to it.
Negative,"Invisible walls everywhere, boss AI stops working on the middle of the fight. How can it be overwhelmingly positive by %96 of 160k reviews. And people nominate this game for GOTY."
Negative,Game is to hard
Negative,Boss fight in mud that makes you unable to roll the 36 attacks coming in drops this game to a 1/10 actual cancer fight wont be playing again
Negative,"I cannot recommend this game. I was looking forward to playing this so much, but the graphics of the actual game are a major disappointment, they are grainy and blurry, even with my pc meeting/exceeding recommended specs. The worst part of this game is the crashes though. I experienced at least 5-6 crashes while playing this game and it seems to be very unstable, I say this because other games I own with the same required specs run smoothly and have no issues. This game is broken in its current state and sorely needs some fixes and patches from the developers to fix this issues. I would not buy this until they have fixed these issues."
Negative,very bad boss design throughout the game
Negative,"Amazing game with storeline and combat but the optimisation settings in this game are horrendous, constant stuttering on the scenes audio cut outs and freezes. Game needs to be fixed"
Negative,Game keeps crashing after the initial fight...extremely disappointed and will wait until an AMD fix has been sent out.
Negative,"Difficulty settings are a needed, i would like to be able to enjoy the game i payed money for, it is way too difficult and it is way too boring to want to trek the maps fighting the same enemies to earn enough level up to then be able to finish a boss fight, just tedious. I would like a difficulty the allows me to walk about quick fight and just enjoy the magnificent graphics the game offers. Beautiful graphics. Good amount of great textures. But. Tedious, repetitive gameplay. Tiny maps you run and rerun through. Combat is an inaccurate mess. Not much of a story just some notes related to the classic."
Negative,I do not recommend unless you have hours of life to waste on improving you dodging skills and memorizing boss's moves
Negative,The game is solid. However the micro stutters and input delay is not. These may be UE5 problems but they are quite distracting and can interrupt gameplay at critical moments. Played on Ryzen 7 5800x3d and 4080 Super.
Negative,"Wait for this to go on sale, its not worth 60 in my opinion."
Negative,"Runs amazing for a little while, playing game on high settings smooth as butter and then randomly starts stuttering horribly at random moments but frequent enough to make it really annoying, even on lowest settings so it's unplayable for me at the moment."
Negative,"THE GOOD- Nice graphics.- Fun to find many bosses and design in there moves- Noob friendly start- Don't lose XP on death- Can reset lvl points free of chargeTHE BAD- The game feels very slow. - The deliberate delay on a heavy attack is unforgivable. Because of the delay they have enemies just stand there and do nothing. Because if they did not. You would never be able to get a heavy attack in. They give you a freez spell just incase the delays of the bosses isent enough. You can just freez them and charge up.- There are invisible walls EVERYWHERE. This hinders exploration a LOT. You think you can go look behind that bush near that broken temple next to the road? NOP!- Small map, instantly fight boss after boss after boss. It's fun to have a lot of bosses. But Jezus, let there be some foot soldiers. Not everyone can be a boss.- Laniary, this might be ok for some, but i like to explore. There is no real exploring in this game.I am also ignoring all the infancy problems the game has. Like locking on sometimes being a bit poor for ex. Or the shrine needing to be pretty well aligned with the character to be activated.I had high hopes for this game. But the combat is just, bad."
Negative,"unnecessary difficult, if u dont have a lot of time and wana enjoy the story, good luck to you. I have limited time to play everyday and this game gave me more frustration than any meaning of fun, despite being a child hood fan of Journey to the west series and all.  i been at this game for more than 4hrs and still barely progress much, just kept dying and coming to the check points. Cant recommendi have since completed the game , beating all bosses and started a NG+, having said that some of the opinions remains, some of the boss fights are just very frustrating than actual fun. But the game really pays tribute to the 1986 series which is great. I feel quite op now in NG+, but still cant recommend to any of my friends to go through what i went through. It took me 12 hrs just for chapter 4, and that is watching a 1hr video guide LOL."
Negative,"Overall Score: 7.5/10Pros:Epic Boss Encounters: The game shines in its boss fights, delivering a wide variety and keeping each encounter fresh and challenging. The developers clearly invested significant effort in creating these memorable moments.Audiovisual Delight: The graphics and music are top-notch, immersing you in the game's world and enhancing the overall experience.Cons:Combat Lacks Depth: The combat system feels shallow and repetitive. The absence of essential mechanics like blocking and counter-attacking limits strategic options. The limited move sets and spell variety further contribute to the sense of monotony. Monster skills, while powerful, lack the tactical nuance to truly distinguish themselves from standard heavy attacks.Frustrating Map Design: The map design is a major disappointment. The abundance of invisible walls creates a frustrating and artificial sense of exploration. The constant dead ends and false leads make it difficult to navigate and immerse oneself in the world.Overall:While the game boasts impressive boss battles and stunning presentation, the lackluster combat system and frustrating map design significantly detract from the experience. If you're looking for epic boss encounters and a visually pleasing world, this game might still be worth checking out. However, be prepared for shallow combat and a frustrating map design."
Negative,"Since downloading the game, I have experienced frequent crashes and multiple logouts that disrupt my gameplay. Additionally, I have encountered severe graphical problems, including texture and mesh glitches, twitching visuals, and morphing polygons. These issues are not only ruining the gaming experience but are also causing discomfort and visual strain, making it unhealthy for me to continue playing.Given these problems, I am unable to enjoy the game as intended"
Negative,"Its not very good. Sorry CCP. The areas are mediocre designs. The combat is repetitive, except for bosses who spam attacks for 45 seconds. The upgrade system has few rewards except hitting a few benchmarks. Its a bad souls copy with a tad of story and great graphics."
Negative,"I play games for the actual gameplay, not really for the looks although good graphics do add up to the package. At the start of the game, the game simply felt too easy, plenty of first try bosses up untill Act 4, where it changed significantly. The difficulty of these bosses are more or less a result of poor design, whilst dodging is incredibly easy, some of these fights are way to gimmicky, atleast for my taste. The fight against the Yin Tiger was semi-hard and fair and I did enjoy it but I found myself not enjoying most of the bosses and I did beat Malenia solo many times and never ever felt like the fight was as unfair as some of the bosses in Black Myth. Cutscenes in the middle of the fight that deal you unavoidable damage or put your just used spell on cooldown or reset your charged up  focus down to 0 are stupid, plain and simple. There is no clear difficulty, you either beat them first try or you need to get an item that is supposed to help. I wish the difficulty would be higher overall and by that I mean the NPC's or whatever you may call them you encounter on your way to the next boss, their just dummies you beat for XP that do not require any sort of thinking, you just spam attack, that is all there is to it, run from one to another boss. Some of the bigger bosses just have really, really bad hitboxes, that is the certainly most frustrating issue I encountered in the game. It looks flashy but in my very own opinion it isn't a gameplay that lives up to what I hoped it would be. Certainly not GOTY material."
Negative,just wait for it to go on sale def not worth $60 but its combat is kind of cool and the graphics look beautiful story is extremely lacking
Negative,"Combat is not good compared to other action gamesChinese factory approach to boss design, quantity over quality."
Negative,"I had fun for the 5 minutes I actually got to play but the game crashed 6 times in 30 minutes (this includes just trying to launch the game) and I was unable to get past the intro encounter due to technical issues. When I was knocked out of the sky during the tutorial cinematic the game crashed and I had to replay the intro only to crash again. To be fair, I never got the shader compiler to actually work as intended despite an hour of troubleshooting fixes. I always got the message ""Shader Compilation successful please wait..."" followed by ""Shader compilation failed. quit or continue? continuing may cause stutters or crashes."" I have updated drivers, a 3090 TI, and a 12th gen i7-12700K. I really want to play this game but can not recommend it in its current state given my personal experience."
Negative,"GLORIFIED GRAPHICAL TECH DEMO - GAMEPLAY IS TRASH AND UN-FUN AFTER THE FIRST HOURMeh. Not good, moments of fun, overall meh. It's beautiful. Runs decently on a RTX 3080 and AMD 5950X. Buggy as hell though. Massive input delay and many times input is just ignored all though that seems situational almost like the developers purposefully disable input during parts of battles. For a game about timing a dodge you'd think they'd get input right --- but it they don't, it's horrible. About 10% of the time you'll use one of your skills (which take forever to charge up) and mana will get consumed, the skill will go on cool down and nothing happens. The skill never cast. Also, if you like hit box porn from the Dark Souls / Elden Ring series then this game is not for you. The hit boxes are a joke. You can't identify what is a damaging attack vs a character turning. You'll get hit out of nowhere with a clearly well timed dodge and you'll land countless hits that do zero damage even though your stick is hitting their mesh. Skill upgrades do not do what they say they do. The poise system is a weird mess. A massive tiger with a sword hits you and doesn't knock you down and you can keep swinging. A random skin and bones zombie looking thing hits you with any attack and you're stunned for 5 seconds.The terrain is amazing but your character actually floats on it. His feet never touch the ground and it looks stupid given all the effort that went in to art design. The IK is also off and there are situations where you're floating a good foot off the ground. The massive amounts of invisible walls that make exploration a joke is highly frustrating. Imagine a totally open terrain with 270 degrees of invisible walls. The only way you know which direct you can go is by attempting to jump into the wall. That's poor level design.I'm 10 hours in and about to beat the 2nd world. Not sure I'll bother trying to beat the 3rd world.PS The story is unintelligible crap.  I don't know if it's the translation or if it's just poorly written but I would pay more to never have another cut scene or line of dialogue.EDIT: I have come to the conclusion that beating a boss isn't a matter of skill it's whether or not the RNG determined if a one-shot animation should play. None of the combat is really reactionary other than pressing dodge (if it works). The dodge mechanic is inconsistent and broken. Very disappointed, coulda been great."
Negative,:put_litter_in_its_place: great game ruined by some souls mechanics and terrible level designs
Negative,Garbage. The reason why no one should make soulslike games apart from fromsoft
Negative,"With a 4080 Super, 64 gigs of ram and an i9 149000kf I crashed 3 times in 45 minutes and had terrible screen tearing even after capping the framerate at 60, turning off raytracing, and lowering super resolution quality, all well below what the game recommended for my settings. My frames never dropped below 100 in the benchmark test, so dealing with this in the actual game is very disappointing."
Negative,"It is a very beautiful game, the graphics are on point. But, the big issue for me is the combat, it just seems bland. I really tried for the 5 hours i've been playing, but theres just missing something vital in the combat and grandeur of a boss encounter."
Negative,"looked good, plays bad. if u like souls this aint it. mashy mechanics light attack the entire game with the same string, dodging is absolutley horrid, map design looks like you can tell it was just ported over to ue5, does not feel immersive at all. Go to any location in GoW on a playstation 4 and it looks 10x better lol. lackluster skills, awful looking bosses, 3 stances that all have 1 special skill each lol, such a joke."
Negative,"It's a beautiful game, but there's no map, and it gets repetitive pretty quick."
Negative,"The game is visually appealing but it got me bored. It's clearly nothing else than a fighting game, there is zero surprise, zero emotion."
Negative,erlang stupid poopy ugly poopy stupid poop boss
Negative,Bad devs is sexist would be 10/10 if they didn't have to be THAT guy
Negative,You can't parry
Negative,"I don’t get all the hype! First of all, why is there no map? The positives for me were the graphics and the beauty of environment. Combat seemed decent enough but I couldn’t get past the fact that there was no map. It was like I was walking down a path and I stumbled upon random enemies sitting around watching the trees grow and then all of the sudden they wanted to kill me. Rinse and repeat. Then you run into a boss in the middle of nowhere right before another boss. I just didn’t get it. I didn’t feel like there were enough enemies to actually level up fast enough to fight all of these bosses I was running in to. Nor could I break contact and do some side missions to level up in order to come back. Well how could I? No map and it was linear so I couldn’t progress without beating these guys and the same enemies watching the trees grow. For hardcore gamers this may be a gem but for a casual game like myself it’s a hard pass. I guess I’m spoiled by all the open world games with non-linear paths. Giving me a main campaign and side missions etc."
Negative,"The combat system seems not really well refined. There are multiple issues that just make it not fun to play anymore. Consistently input is ignored, such as trying to heal, heavy attack, combo attacks etc. The i-frames seem to be a little random and i wasn't able to figure them out consistently (after 11 hours playtime). For spell casting R2+A/B/X/Y have to be pressed. If pressed in the right order (R2 then A/B/X/Y) but too close together, the game wont recognise it, fucking up the flow of the fight every time... Some of the Skills seem to consistently bug, or just have so small i-frames that they cannot be used consistently. The bosses all have repetitive movesets and its more about learning the openings for each moveset rather than getting god at the game. Some of the bosses are also made artificially hard with delayed attacks, endless combos, almost no openings etc. Outside of boss fights there are not many enemies and most of them are then quite easy... maybe to make up for the boss fights? On a positive note, the graphics and cut scenes are pretty nice. Would not recommend buying it."
Negative,"If you are already a fan of souls alike games go ahead but if you are not this is not something that I can recommend. This game probably won't change your mind despite how it looks, it feels the same as the other souls games that came from Asia."
Negative,"While it's based on the myth, it does a fantastic job at not making any sense. The story telling started off interesting and very quickly became utter rubbish... Don't waste your money on this. If you're into soul's likes then this might be for you, personally, I just don't get them. I want to spend my money on something that makes me feel good not like I'm being punished both in game play and in terrible story telling."
Negative,"This game is mid. shouldnt be 50 bucks for sure. Issue 1: The game doesnt make any sense, i have no clue what my goal is in the story and why i am a goddamn monkey but here i am fighting a dragon. issue 2, everyone speaks in riddles. like i cant understand shit when old grumpy pants grampar is yapping about somethin random in riddles that make no sense. its like if yoda and a disabled kid had a baby and it spoke like this.issue 3: why am i missing so muhc important stuff. i swear i check everywhere but i also manage to miss everything apperently."
Negative,"Don't listen to anybody who tells you it's more like God of War than a soulslike. If you hate soulslikes, you'll hate this too"
Negative,"Updated after beating the game.first off. i don't understand the hype behind this game. 600k+ positive reviews you would think this was the most well crafted game in recent history. its not.The graphics are amazing. Some of the best I've seen and its well optimized, but my mind was by no means blown by the game play or mechanics. And although there are a few times where I did have a lot of fun, clutching out epic moments in fights, the fighting gets repetitive fast, and the enemies in between bosses serve no other purpose then wasting time, as they provide 0 challenge. This game suffers from being laughably easy 99% of the time, where most combat boils down casting spells to spank bosses.yet the 1% it is challenging. Its challenging because its cheap. cheap cheap cheap. so very cheapThe only challenging bosses (of which so far ive only ran into 2)  comes from the fact that the game just does whatever it wants. Braking its own rules to make sure the player dies. What i mean by that is the enemy attacks through objects suddenly when it feels like it. but cant other times, and sometimes they outright ignore hit boxes, and adds moves to its roster to specifically counter perfectly what you are doing, if you are doing too well. I hate it when game devs do this. They cant figure out a way to challenge the player, so they have to make a certain boss unbelievably cheap in order to provide said challenge.I wont list which bosses for the sake of spoilers. But as a nioh, dark souls, and sekrio player, I can confirm that these bosses are very poorly designed. not because of the challenge they pose in learning patterns, pace, timing, and the challenging the limitations of the skill and timing of the player.  but because they simply are just cheap. When a boss is attacking so often that you simply don't have time to counter attack, even if you are perfect dodging, and the attacks STILL are coming, and coming and coming and coming ENDLESSLY without PAUSE and you outright die because eventually you cant perfectly dodge 1000 attacks in a row, you know you have an issue. then about the 20th time fighting it. The game goes ""ok you have been punished enough."" and they hit the stupid button. and the fight is suddenly easy again... like... what?If you play this game and are a skilled souls like player, expect to one shot most bosses. and the 2 or 3 bosses that are a challenge. expect cheap tactics to create the illusion of challenge.oh, and by the way. if you do things out of order in certain cases. You will be locked out of certain fights. Meaning you have to beat the game. Go into new game+, play another 30 hours to get back to what fight you missed, and do it in the correct order. If that isn't the mark of poor game design, I don't know what is.Now that I have beaten it. My scoring has gone up a bit. But over all. Wait for a sale if you wanna buy this game. And don't expect anything ground braking. This game has way more hype then deserved.  4.5/10"
Negative,trash game cant go anywhere without hitting an invisible wall. just a boss run type game where every boss is as easy as the last. this game presents no real challenges.
Negative,"game is good honestly, but the dodge mechanics and movement is so clunky that it is just BLERGPH!"
Negative,chapter 6 is just pure shit
Negative,Wo Long 2 :)
Negative,Great looking game. Which is all it has going for it really. Terrible boss design all around. Terrible hit boxes. I usually don't leave reviews but after 21 hours at review time the game has just become a chore to play. The game becomes less and less fun the more you play it.
Negative,"Playing this game after the hype was getting real with all the rave reviews, maybe this has increased my expectations towards the game. Honestly it's not a bad game but the lack of map is really frustrating for someone like me who doesn't have all the time in the world to play this game. The camera control of this game is also quite bad, a lot of times I'm taking damage due to bad camera angle. The small mobs in this game is very annoying to the point that it feels like a task to play. There's no proper AoE attacks to deal with the increased numbers of smaller mob enemies towards the latter chapters. The movesets are very limited and boring."
Negative,The game completely crashes for me. I have a newer computer model that has plenty of capacity and processing power. I've tried all of the common troubleshooting methods to remedy the issue but it appears to be happening more quickly once the game gets started. I can not make it to the second checkpoint because it crashes before I can get to it... Appears to be a fun game but the technical issues make it impossible to enjoy.
Negative,"Not Recommended""Black Myth: Wukong"" has stunning graphics, but my experience was disappointing for these reasons:1. Over-Hyped: The game is ambitious but doesn't live up to the hype. The gameplay is underwhelming compared to the visuals.2. Controller Issues: If you use a DualSense controller, be ready for frustration. The game doesn't recognize it unless you use Steam’s input passthrough, which is a hassle.3. Limited Controller Options: There's no customizable key mapping for controllers—just two preset modes. This limits your ability to adjust controls to your liking.4. Cringey Dubbing: The dubbing is terrible and breaks immersion, making the experience less enjoyable.5. Performance Problems: Despite having a gaming desktop, the game runs poorly. Frequent frame drops and stuttering are common.6. No HDR Support: For a game with such a focus on visuals, the lack of HDR support is disappointing, especially in 2024.In short, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a missed opportunity. The graphics are beautiful, but the technical and design issues hold it back. Until these are fixed, I can't recommend it."
Negative,"Not worth the price, in my honest opinion. The combat is intensely repetitive, with the same one combo everytime, and your only line of defense are dodges, spells (which will very quickly consume mana) and an insanely inconsistent parry. It feels like I'm playing old Fromsoft games, and not in a good way. Sometimes, you will parry, and the enemy will carry on like nothing happened and you will be stuck in the parry animation (a lenghty strike) while they pummel you. EDIT: I gave the game several other chances. To be clear, this is not a matter of difficulty, the difficulty is fine, I beat most bosses in one or two tries. I tested EVERY skill tree in the game, every stance... the issue remains the same. Parries are inconsistent and do not work against most attacks, there is an input delay with anything you do, dodges are usually consistent but certain bosses can ignore them but offer limited opportunities to counter, and the one good parry in the game is locked behind mana and only VERY briefly staggers enemies. If you're looking for a really good souls-like not made by Fromsoft games, do yourself a favor and buy Lies of P. This just ain't it."
Negative,F this game atleast put a diffuculty im abt to punch my pc i cant beat the yellow wind king
Negative,Very overrated.Basic game where u walk from one boss to another. Most bosses are unsatisfying to play against and the combat is basic. The graphics are decent but there are many bugs in the pc version.
Negative,No meaningful content beyond boss fights.Annoying automatic lock to boss that has to be turned off each time it comes on that seems to ignore the settings. Constantly seem to get stuck on terrain.
Negative,"Just another Dark Souls. Bad balance between mobs and bosses, just like every other Souls game."
Negative,"Runs fine on RTX 3070, but I didn't care for the game.  Left it minimized and went shopping so unable to return because it went over two hours.  Trying to make the best of it but it's just running through a tunnel getting to the next boss fight.  Game demands a controller but keyboard mouse are fine and far more comfortable for me."
Negative,"Avoid it if you have AMD  anything. Wait for patching to fix the crashing issues. 4 crashes total and the shaders take forever to load, 5-7 minutes each time. I have refunded the game and hopefully will be able to revisit once fixed."
Negative,"Great game, terrible boss design.  Unskippable cutscenes of you getting killed mid game.  A lot of bosses are pumped full of HP to make them more difficult.  It would be enjoyable if the bosses didn't hop of the map into a unhittable position.  Whoever designed yellow wind sage deserves to no longer work in the gaming industry.Edit: great game created by disconnected devs who don't understand basic boss design.  FromSoftware has satisfying bosses, this game has bosses that aren't even enjoyable to beat."
Negative,Just doesn't do it for me - looks great and seems pretty well optimised but got boring fast even after an hour game play wise and seems very linear. Might give another go on a deep sale but if you're not really into these souls style games then this probably wont be for you
Negative,The game auto crashes every time you try to play even though your PC specs exceed the recommended requirements. No developer support to fix this problem. Absolute scam don't buy.
Negative,Couldn't be interested to play more than an hour. The voices are incredibly annoying and the game feels very basic.
Negative,so much bad boss design
Negative,"Feels terrible, runs terrible, plays terrible. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, and anyone who claims this is game of the year needs to try literally any other game that's come out because this is horrendous."
Negative,Visual mess. Unplayable motion artefacts no matter the settings with no fix.
Negative,"Monkey see, monkey don't."
Negative,"Graphic 10/10But if you play it, feels like an empty core wrapped in a golden coat."
Negative,"Trash performance on a 14900k with a RTX 4090, typical denuvo garbage and the usual unreal engine stuttery crap"
Negative,I don't know why nobody mentions this but this game is unfinished. It runs poorly with many freeze frames and audio lags/desyncs. I tried to fix it but it was so bad that i couldnt even get past the intro scene after the first boss. I might give it a try after they made some fixes and would recommend others to do so aswell because we have to stop publishing buggy games for a full price for which you'd expect a working product. Dont buy right now!
Negative,"++: Stunning Graphics: The game’s visuals are undoubtedly its strongest point, offering a true next-gen experience. The graphical fidelity, from the environmental effects in snow and water to the shadows and lighting, is simply breathtaking. Walking through these beautifully crafted landscapes is a highlight.+: Decent Combat: The combat mechanics are passable and can be fun, though they lack depth and challenge. Also not a fan of all the super over the top powers you get that completely trivialize the game.+: The music is quite good, good pacing for boss battles and beautiful otherwise.+: World building & visual character design is great.+-: Not having a real parry/block system (Sekiro-style for example) hurts the combat system. I know you get the spell eventually but this is just a gimmick. +-: The story is quite hard to follow. However I did really enjoy the small anime story's they did at the end of each chapter. So at the end it kind of makes sense but its hard to get in to the first few chapters.-: Linear Level Design: The level design is extremely linear, with invisible walls blocking off open areas, which kills immersion and any sense of exploration. It feels restrictive and detracts from the overall experience. However this does get better in acts 4 and onward.+-: Not a big fan of enemies input reading (drinking & charging heavy attacks). But I understand its kind of needed.-: Boss Fights 1: Boss battles are unsatisfying and rely heavily on gimmicks, such as cooldown management of your abilities. These fights often feel artificial and lack the challenge that would make them rewarding. The inability to skip some boss micro-cinematic cutscenes (last boss when he steals your drink) adds to the frustration. However the boss animations and attacks are cool and look good.-:Boss fights 2: Too often bosses have a phase where bosses become invulnerable for about 20 seconds while attacking you, leaving you to do nothing but dodging their attacks. This kills the entire flow of the combat and is frankly boring. Additionally, some bosses can randomly fly out of reach and bombard you with ranged attacks, adding to the artificial difficulty. This feels more like an unfair design choice than a true challenge.-: Gear: The gear and upgrade systems are uninspired, resembling a lackluster copy of Diablo 4’s item style system, complete with uninspired mechanics (green up arrow better).-: Crafting: The entire crafting system is boring and not satisfying. Every time you unlock the ability to craft a new piece of equipment it feels like a freebie. You never have to work for a cool rare item.-: Handholding Exploration: The game’s overly handholdy approach, with glittering interactable items, removes the joy of discovery, further diminishing the exploration experience.-: Not a big fan of these type of skill tree progression systems. Where they take a mechanic, strip it down and then let you spend points to get it back up to what its supposed to be.-: Not a fan of the final boss reveal, expected someone else...-: Deluxe edition gets some equipment for free that you can also get in game, basically p2w = cringe.-: Usual bad pc optimization at launch, fps drops in certain zones / game crashes. Probably a scuffed pc-port as usual.--: The act 3 prison part where you randomly lose half your hp and then get it back again after x seconds. This design leads to rewarding not playing the game to wait out the debuff.--: The act 6 cricket ''boss''...Conclusion: After beating Black Myth Wukong, I can't recommend it. While the graphics are truly exceptional and a visual treat, the rest of the game falls short. From repetitive combat to poor level design and poor boss design, it feels like a missed opportunity. Later acts show some improvement, but the overall experience remains lackluster. This game is more of a visual showcase than a well-rounded gaming experience."
Negative,"I'm on the final chapter and i can safely say this game got progressively worse as it went on. For chapter 1-2 i'd say the game was a solid 7, but for each chapter after that the score goes down for every additional chapter. The fun but basic combat and the insane detail in the world does some insane heavy lifting in this game. SOME bosses are fun, but an insane amount are so poorly designed and have some of the worst hitboxes I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing. I think i can genuinely count the really good bosses on one hand which is sad considering this game is FILLED with bosses. They're not even that hard either. A lot of the bosses people have been raving online as being incredibly hard i've managed to beat first try or in the first 3 attempts. A lot of them are just so tedious...Sadly Black Myth: Wukong borrows a lot from the FromSoftware and God Of War games, but fails to add anything exciting or new to their respective formulas."
Negative,"Very disappointing with the steam universe here Nobody seems to mention in the reviews That this game runs like a pile of complete dog crap The developer should be ashamed of themselves And so should anybody on Steam that has given this game a thumbs up You literally have to play it the way G-Force experience recommends you have to use their hidden profile through gForce experience to have smooth gameplay The game is riddled with memory leak symptoms Traversal stuttering worse than Star wars Jedi Survivor I own an rtx4090 with an i-9 14900 KS 8,200 MHz Ram Samsung pro 990 hard drive And I have never seen my system run a game this crapily As for the game itself it seems very good but I am not looking past the horrible optimization thanks for reading this hopefully you don't have nightmares"
Negative,Game crashing after Intro. Optimization is VERY poor. Unfortunate.
Negative,"I have a 7800x3D and a 7900xtx and the game won't even make it through the first cutscene without crashing, unacceptable that it hasn't been addressed by now."
Negative,3080 with a 13900k keeps crashing thats with 15 hours of gameplay fix the shit...
Negative,"Poorly made game, although the graphics are beautiful the game peaks at the intro where you play as wukong himself.soon after you realise that this game is a load of bs as unlike the soul games you don't feel any stronger at later bosses thanyou do on the first one. I would not pay full price for this and would only buy it when it's on a huge discount."
Negative,"Sadly, game is a complete scam. Won't even compile shaders, and I have a monster top end PC. Don't spend 60$ on black screen: wukong. Developers literally instruct you to underclock your CPU to play it ? WTF is this man ? Fix your shxt, don't mess with my hardware, so cringe. Chinese cringe game."
Negative,"It looks good. I mean, it looks really good. It just doesn't feel very good to play, combat-wise. There's very little feedback on enemy attacks against the player unless they are huge enemies. It plays more like the new God of War games than a souls-like, which is just disappointing to me. If you like the God of War games and the cinematic narrative-driven style, you'll probably like this. I just don't enjoy the flow of combat so I'm not recommending it. It feels rather outdated, especially compared to something contemporary like Elden Ring."
Negative,how can you not change the keyboard set up on a game which cost £50 it actually says remap keys then doesnt let you do it!!!!!!!!abosulte rushed jobseems like it is button nash repeat festdont believe the hype game is trash
Negative,"Out of review capacity trying to allocate a recommendation. Make sure your brain has the minimum required intelligence to address the issue, try lowering the cost for ads and/or closing other co-branded products like Luckin or Controller. Exiting... Out of video memory trying to allocate a rendering resource.Make sure your video card has the minimum required memory, try lowering the resolution and/or closing other applications that are running,Exiting..."
Negative,I mean.. It's alright but nothing too crazy. Not sure it's worth 90$
Negative,"Na ovladači katastrofa hratelnost. Bez mapy , nevím co mám kde dělat."
Negative,DuskVeil and Hundred-Eye Daoist are impossible.
Negative,Game is fun and looks great.But needs to be updated to fix the crashing issues.Stuck at the beginning of chapter 2 unable to make it any farther due to crashing.This is with a 3080ti at LOW settings.
Negative,The game doesn't work due to constant freezing.  Can't even get past the tutorial fight without it freezing.  Might try again if they get the issue fixed.
Negative,"It's a visually stunning game, with really amazing animations but because of it's linear gameplay it get's boring really fast."
Negative,Sweet game for about the first 20 min. As a casual player this game is no longer fun. No difficulty settings is a shame. Rinse repeat get's old quick.
Negative,"This game is amazing, perfect game, great visuals, combat is fun. BUT THE FUCKING YELLOW SAND SAGE OR WHATEVER THE FUCKIOG NAME IS IS FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE AND I BROKE THREE FUCKING MONITERS ALREADYU TRTYING TO FUCKING GET THAT THING INTO THE LAST FUCKING STAGE.. IF THEY DONT NERF IT I AM DELETING THIS GAME."
Negative,"It's really fun but honestly it just falls apart after the second chapter.Level design takes a nose diveEnemies take a nose diveBosses especially take a nose diveNothing is less fun than having the camera stuck uselessly inside a large boss, all while you try to make any of your attacks connect with the abysmal hit system for larger enemiesThey seem to know that large bosses are fun, but not why or how to make them fun.They seem to know complex levels are fun, but not why or how to design them.Really unfortunate, I was really enjoying the combat and visuals until the third massive boss in a row that you just flat out cant hit reliably"
Negative,i was in good shape having 50-60 fps and then i closed the game after i restart it started giving me 10fps on medium settings wtf all of a sudden
Negative,"RTX 3080 Ti, i7-11700K. Can't get pass first boss as it's crashing mid-fight or during cutscene, no error message, game is just turning off. Once I've got blue screen with ""Kmode Exception Not Handled""."
Negative,Who ever made that fucking wind rat in chapter two should be fired immediately
Negative,"I want to like this game but it runs so badly, best to wait until they patch it"
Negative,4080 super 7800x3d 32gb of ram less than 100fps on high settings with dlss and framegen enabled
Negative,"This game had been on my radar for some time, but never really high on my list. However, I did buy it on launch day, because I was very curious to see the final product. The opening had me hooked. It’s cinematic presentation is on par with the opening of ‘God of War’ (2018), and really got me going. I was on the edge of my seat. At first the game’s graphics blew me away, but that feeling of awe faded to the background rather quickly. The game’s linearity and level design is rather dull / plain. Next to that the RPG-elements are very light, this game is hardly an ‘action RPG’ in my book.Unfortunately I got bored very fast, and I decided to refund it before my 2 hour window closed.Yes, the game has some pretty awesome visuals and the game’s audio design is ‘on par’. However, the rest isn’t as ground breaking or innovating."
Negative,"The graphics in this game are amazing, and the character development is also amazing, but the story-line is okay. The biggest letdown in this game is the game play; it is so hard to take down the bosses and so easy to take down the standard enemies, there is no balance. Actually, the bosses are too hard and not fun at all."
Negative,"Basic combat that gets old quick. Poor level design, way too many things look alike. An insane number of invisible walls. Its a boss rush with a mediocre story so far, don't think I'm gonna finish this one since I'm bored of it already. Also buggy and crashes a lot."
Negative,"This game is way, way too long to be so boring and devoid of anything of interest.I'm halfway through chapter 3 out of 6 chapters and I just want the game to end already. Every level just gets larger and larger without making anything interesting. Once you are in a locale, you will be looking at the same scenery for the next 5-10 hours. Areas blend together.There seriously needed to be considerations taken for the player and what they are actually doing with their time playing this game, because the level designers simply did not take any at all.The actual gameplay is very mindless. You will spend many encounters just spamming the attack button or spamming the dodge button.It's a very one-sided combat system where you have answers to everything so anytime the game throws something at you and pretends it's a big deal you can just brush it off.One horrible design decision they made is that if you cast a spell and get interrupted, you don't cast the spell or lose the mana, but the cooldown remains. This isn't a competitive game, it's a single player action game. Why cooldowns even exist in a game like this is beyond me but it's very silly.Anyways, if you've played other souls clones like Lies of P or whatever else, steer far away from this one because it barely offers anything more of value.If you really, really love the myth of Son Wukong then just watch the cutscenes online."
Negative,"I enjoyed chapters 1 and 2. I could honestly say these pieces of the game warrant 9/10 rating and maybe even GOTY status. However, chapter 3 and onwards soured me on the game. The level design becomes frustrating and the bosses also become frustrating. You will spend a large amount of time running into invisible walls, and you will unknowingly go the wrong way in a ‘linear’ game.Combat:I used smash stance and I relied heavily on Seeing Through the enemy (light combo and then using heavy attack timed with the boss attack). This was very ‘hard’ to pull off at times and that was mainly for a reason that was not my fault. That reason is that you will animation lock yourself in parts of the light combo that make the combat feel very clunky in comparison to the Souls series (Dark Souls 1 , Dark Souls 3 , Elden Ring)Bosses:Now, as for the boss designs . . . Some of these are amazing and fun. However, some of these bosses are very toxic and not fun to play against. Some examples are :Yellow Loong, dragon in chapter 3 , girl mage in chapter 3, voice captain in Chapter 3, Chapter 2 end boss, Chapter 3 end boss, Chapter 4 end boss .These are some of the most annoying bosses I could speak at length to, but they are ‘difficult’ in ways that are not fun. Moving around too much, hitboxes that are hard to hit, animations that are hard to see, etc.Spirits: I did not find any spirits that are better than Wandering Wight that you get in chapter 1 . . . The equip effects are so small they are negligible and the wight has the best stagger I could find.TLDR:The game is hard in ways that are not fun. The combat felt clunkier the further I progressed and I struggled in fighting some of the more difficult bosses mostly due to annoying mechanics and hit boxes. The game was really good for chapters 1 and 2 and I had no issues, but once I saw chapter 3 I started seeing all of these issues and I honestly cannot recommend the game. I may finish Chapter 5 and 6 and come back to this review afterwards, but I am afraid this game was overhyped and the combat does not hold up after 10-20 hours."
Negative,I cannot accept Sun Wukong and the White Bone Spirit falling in love. It's like having feces in the cake.
Negative,i don't understand why this game get so much positive comment .
Negative,"Not really working on a i9, RTX 2080 Ti. The game randomly crash, can't play more 10 minutes. What the fuck is happening with this game ?"
Negative,"This is an amazing game if I could get through 20 seconds of the loading screen without my GPU temps rocketing to 95c and crashing, every other game I play is around 70c but when I set my graphics on here to high and low they both get 90-95c, maybe optimization for this game right now isn't good for certain cards? But untill then I think the game looks great, only bad part is the crashing and making my gpu overheat, please fix :/"
Negative,"I wouldn't recommend it for more than 40 bucks if you're the type who pays games full price, or 30 if you're the type who always looks for a deal.It's not bad, but it's far from the polished experience and GOTY certified game Chinese nationalists and people who feel they got one over the ""woke"" by buying this would have you believe.They kept denying it was a Souls-like, and they clearly lied.Problem being, while games like Dark Souls are harder, Wukong's more frustrating because the game design isn't quite as tight.There's some weird choices in there.I see no reason to  even have a stamina bar in the first place, aside from wanting to be a Souls like. Which is weird, because they kept denying it would be a souls like.I see also no reason to not be able to cancel any attack into dodge, nor not to have attacks do more damage or go straight into a critical or a free heavy hit after a perfect dodge.A lot of the ways enemies can hit you also feel nonsensical, like the Wandering Wight and his weird free Area of Effect damage you can't dodge.Now I will however say that I do have rather high standards, and while I love Dark Souls 1-3 (not 2) and Sekiro, I never cared for any Souls-like not made by FromSoftware and not helmed by Miyazaki.Wukong for all its gaping frustrating flaws is the only one I ever did like."
Negative,"All 1.9 hours I had this game was spent trying to get it to work smoothly, my system is beyond what the needs are to run the game, but I guess having intel means they dont want you to play this game, I even lowered all the settings to the bare minimum and it still wouldnt smoothly run, audio or graphically.I had to give up because at 2 hours im not guaranteed my refund, what a shame, was very much looking forward to this game, I love mythology and this game was right up my alley."
Negative,"I want to give this game a sideways thumb, because it is a good game.  To be quite frank... the souls and souls like genre isn't my top pick for gaming. It feels like a chore after a day of working. This game is beautiful graphically and the combat and boss designs are very neat. The Lore of Sun Wukong is appealing but the constant having to kill boss after boss when i dont understand why they are trying to kill me out of the blue is tiring for me personally.  I respect what the game has to bring for people who specifically like these sorts of game. For me personally i find it a chore... partially because im not the best Souls like player. But ive played Elden ring and rather enjoyed that game but i believe because the world was very rich and explorative. Its not so much with Black Myth Wukong. That's okay,.. just not my cup of tea while it is for others. I dont mind linear games as long as they have a good story and the game play is challenging with some  hard elements. Take for an example. I LOVED the 2019 God of War games. They had a great story as well as some pretty tough challenges along the way but overall i felt like everytime I logged on to play God of War i knew I would progress through the story and slay some Valkries in some way. Black Myth wukong is MUCH MUCH more challenging and thus tends to feel like a chore. Once again I will say that I am not a die hard Souls like player and I know other people find a real satisfaction in beating difficult bosses back to back to back and so on... such as in this game and i am truly happy for that for them. But this game was just not for me... So if you are a souls player then get this game... if you are not or are interested in dipping your toes into those waters... just know that you may find Wukong more of a chore than an enjoyable experience like how i did."
Negative,"I'll be honest. I thought I would love this game, but it fell flat in every single way. And I don't even care about half the problems people are upset with this game for, like invisible walls and no open world. I was happy to chew on a bite-sized linear game. I was even happier to hear it was more of a boss rush, as exploration has started to become overwhelming with the sheer amount of empty open world games on the market. But everything about Black Myth Wukong just seems to be one step to the left and mostly causes me a world of frustration. First there are the levels, they are often large with little interesting happening within them. Every once in a while there will be moments where you witness a beautiful area and think its amazing, but for the most part if you are in the desert, the environment is dull sand and generic rock formations. If you are in the mountains the game is barren snowy fields and- oh would you look at that, generic rock formations. Since the game has no map, it can be really frustrating reaching intersections when everything looks the same. Since I thought this was going to be a more straightforward game it was devastating having to sit at the end of the chapter and look up spots I had missed. I hated aimlessly running around and backtracking over and over again. It is worse when you realize many of these secret or hard to find areas hold important items/hault future progress. I know many souls players will chastise and say this is typical for a souls game but, I don’t think this worked well in Wukong. I thought I was being sold a story rich linear game and that’s simply not the case. Another problem I had was terrible input reading, but I don’t think this is something everyone experiences and I don’t know what causes it. I have talked to many friends who have no problems, and I have talked to many friends who have the same issues- all on similar pc setups. But the bad input is incredibly apparent. I will watch my character stand still and see the buttons I’m pressing LIGHT UP on screen but my character does not react. Sometimes the game feels smooth and great, and other times I feel like I am fighting with the controls. Finally the bosses are an awful combination of no brain pubstomps and frustratingly slow paced epic battles. I was often left confused over my own damage output because within two steps of each other would be a boss that I melted, then a boss I hit for so little I do not even see its health bar move after consecutive attacks. It’s really confusing too because it doesn’t even make sense to backtrack and farm levels in a game like this. It just makes the bosses feel unpolished. Even after you beat one of these more tough enemies it doesn’t even feel satisfying, I’m mostly upset I had to experience such a long, drawn out fight. The move sets of these enemies are never very complex or interesting either, they just hit like trucks or have stages where they can not be damaged at all. It is not fun hitting the same enemy with only 8 moves for 10 minutes. It’s not fun weaving in one hit at a time when you can’t reliably trust in your character to dodge when you want it to, or do a magic attack when you want it to. -but thats back to if you experience bad inputs. All in all, I dropped the game about half-way through because I wasn’t having any fun. I feel really guilty for not finishing such an expensive game, and I feel guilty that I am not enjoying something everyone else seems to love. But this has sadly been my experience. I did really like the first chapter though, it was small and manageable, it had the perfect amount of exploration for me, but it was filled with the “too easy” enemies. The easy enemies were not so much a problem then, I assumed the difficulty of the game would increase over time. And it did, but it also didn’t. Mostly I feel big :c"
Negative,"this games ""gimmick bosses"" are jokes im fighting a fat beetle and im fighting two rats this is such a joke how about the devs make a good boss and stop ruining the cool dragons wait till bring this to my facebook groupchat"
Negative,protest-downvote because re-downloading the game being faster than applying a 1gb patch is just not acceptable
Negative,hard asf maybe harder than elder ring
Negative,A bit boring outside of the great cutscenes
Negative,"The first two chapters are fantastic, then 3-6 pop out and are absolute garbage."
Negative,"I'll likely change my recommendation just based on any updates and I have a fairly complex opinion about this game.  I just finished it.  I don't think Black Myth: Wukong is a bad game, but Steam doesn't give a gray area for reviews.  I can't really recommend it and I wouldn't in its current state, but at the same time I think it has a lot of positive qualities and is a good first effort from Game Science.  It just has some issues, some negligible and some that are kind of annoying.  I'm going to start with the negative first.To get the bad out of the way, I think the performance of the game and the level design are very frustrating.  Performance will vary based on your rig, but there's a lot of optimizing that needs to be done.  I played this on a fairly powerful PC, there are just weird moments where the graphics would freak out.  When fighting certain bosses, the lighting wouldn't work properly and at points I'd have a grayish/blue filter over my screen until the boss fight was over.  To speak to the level design, the game is linear at points and maps typically don't have much in the way of any complex vertical layering, but it also is not a game that is very clear about marking where you can and cannot go and your first playthrough will be, often in failure in my case, trying to figure out where the game will allow you to go.  I would try to accomplish everything possible before moving on with a chapter and even that wouldn't go as planned.  I ended up beating the Chapter 5 boss before I ever ended up finding the secret area because the game just sort of routed me to the boss in a way where I wasn't even sure I was at the final area.Good level design gives players a sense of where they are both spatially as well as narratively.  I am somewhat familiar with Journey to the West enough to know some plot points and because Black Myth: Wukong takes liberties with the plot, I could never be certain if some kind of creative flourish was coming or how.  So my first playthrough of the game had 3 separate files where I tried several build types.  The common thread among all of them is that exploration wasn't fun.  Once you learn where things are this doesn't matter, but you can say that of any game.  The main thing is that it's not even fun knowing where to go in many instances.  It truly leaves much to be desired, especially for a game taking after games by From Software.  Lies of P was a much better sophomore effort in terms of emulating From Soft map design, however crudely.Those two elements are somewhat deal breakers to me in terms of recommending the game, but I don't think they are things that cannot be addressed or fixed.As far as combat goes, this is truly a mixed bag.  I love Black Myth: Wukong when it isn't trying to be a souls game with highly regimented, overly defensive gameplay.  There are times where Black Myth: Wukong becomes terrified at the idea that it has options like parrying, armor points, and other things that would make fights feel much more interactive.  Many enemies in the game will actively suckerpunch you, scurry out of the way or outright float backwards if you try to so much as engage them.  The fundamental concept that gels Black Myth: Wukong's fighting system together is ""dodge out of way in a memorized sequence.""  It does this for its entire duration.  This is a case where it's not whether something doesn't work or is broken, this is a case in my review where I'm going to say that this style of combat is like stretching a single idea across the entire duration of a game and it just feels boring.I think for a lot of players; however, action games are a bit of a novelty.  So I think this isn't necessarily the same level of problem as having crappy map design and game performance.  Black Myth: Wukong is a relatively simple game where I often died trying to find some way to win a fight OTHER than by ""move out of way real good.""  And there are options where the game will spice up the combat, but it will just as often negate your combat options into a sterile paste of ""move out of way then take the turn.""  Call and response.  This is amateur hour fight design, it's not good no matter how much superfluous crap you put in if you're too afraid to allow the player to do something focal other than ""dodge.""The reason I point this out is that, on the same side, there were things Wukong did as a game with combat and action that I loved.  A partner character that isn't completely useless, awesome scripted fights, and one fight in particular that reminded me of an old X-Box 360 Capcom game in the best way possible.  It is a mixed bag, but as much as I think Wukong's combat is boring and one dimensional for no reason, Game Science could often show a lot of restraint.  I found myself really liking the game when it wasn't trying to be a less good version of a Souls game.  I want to see more of that from the team, but I feel like making a Souls game gives a lot of room to be lazy because if something is bad you just chalk it up to ""being a Souls game.""I don't know what the future holds for Game Science, but this was a genuinely solid first effort.  It just managed to really get on my nerves.  I'm going to keep my eye on patches that might address some quality of life stuff for map and level navigation, because the map design is a dealbreaker.  It's extremely bad to use invisible walls instead of coherent design, no matter how many real world areas you scan.  That's just too much of a burden on a player.Performance, that may never change either.  But I think if you can look past that, my opinion about action game combat notwithstanding, there is so much to love about Black Myth: Wukong.  I love the production value and I love that it's not trying to steal my money and mentally addle me in the process.  I have some hopes for this studio.  I don't recommend it, but it's also not a bad game.  There are bad qualities to it, but overall I hope that Game Science continues supporting the game.  I'll be keeping my eyes peeled in the event I can change this review to positive.  But I think success is better than any harsh words I can deliver."
Negative,"This game just didn't clicked for me. I honestly expected something way more than I was given too, but it is what it is."
Negative,It wasn't the earth tremor assist
Negative,"The map design is really bad. It's easy to get lost, and the map is ridiculously large. Everywhere looks the same (in chapters 2 and 3, and maybe in later chapters as well). It's really frustrating to run around the whole map without knowing where it will take you."
Negative,"As a casual player, this game is too difficult for me. I'd rather not spend hours trying to beat one boss. I just want to go through the story without getting pissed off and rage quitting the game. That's not fun to me and I don't have the time and patience. The visuals are stunning and I'm sure the story is great, but I'd rather not give myself a headache to get through it. I'll leave it to the pros and die-hards who slay these types of games (I'll check yall out on YT lolz)Maybe if they add a noob difficulty, I might come back to it. But until then, it will remain uninstalled."
Negative,"Shit game dumb game. not user friendly,  no diversity"
Negative,"Great Graphics, very cool animations, but quite repetitive fights and too much walking simulator. It is not my typical kind of game but it was worth a shot for me. It might be a beautiful for those who love this kind of game, but to me I felt it was very empty and redundant.I wish I could understand more about the story because it seems very interesting though, but dunno I had some difficulties into grasping the core of it. I know why the main character has to do his travel, but I've lost all the nuisance and flavour around it because maybe there is a barrier between the eastern and the western culture, and it wasn't conveyed accordingly, or maybe it is just I wasn't able to get it.In general, if you are into this type of game, I think you will love it. Lot of bosses and lot of fights, even if you have to walk a lot (veeeeery boring even by using altars). If you are into game where you have to think a lot and more intensive from a logic perspective, this one will surely be a torture for you, so skip it."
Negative,"This game is only for people who enjoy the difficulty level of Dark Souls games. This is far, far more difficult than a mainstream game franchise like God of War. It's even less forgiving than Elden Ring in many ways. Anyone who tells you different is definitely lying.Other than the difficulty level and the amount of frustration that certain bosses and sections induce, the game is amazing. But, I can't imagine that most players are going to have a fun time with trying to beat the same boss over and over again.Not only that, the controls aren't very responsive sometimes and some bosses are difficult to hit."
Negative,The game starts off strong but gets really annoying starting from chapter 3. Starting from chapter 3 I started noticing more of my moves just straight up going through the enemy or not registering. The Chapter 4 final boss is a real kicker because his hit box is horrendous. Running rock solid and deflecting a good chunk of moves help but I'm probably losing about 1/4 of my damage just from my moves not hitting him. It is actually fantastic how he has 2 different instances where he is basically immune to damage.  It just isn't enjoyable watching my heavy miss over and over again because it went between his stick legs or my staff connects and just pushes me away from him but does no damage. Although I did get close to beating him a few times I'm not going to continue until a mod or the devs address it.
Negative,Game looks stunning.But after 2 hours of only tweaking and bench testing in game. Searching the internet for fixes for the problems i'm having i had to refund cause it just won't work.My pc has the recommended specs on the store page but the problems i'm having are insane graphic stuttering even on low settings. Audio which stutters and doesn't line up at all. And to top it of after multiple checks and resets the controller which works everywhere else just doesn't in Wukong
Negative,"It is the very first time in over 18 years of playing games, that I just don't want to finish a game I bought for its full price on release.The game is clearly souls-like inspired, the devs will say it is not, fanboys will say it is not, at the end of the day, it is still a souls-like, very permissive difficulty-wise, but a souls-like nonetheless. You find the  expected bonfire around the maps where you can rest, setup spells/upgrades (you can upgrade your character anywhere on the map) and buy/craft equipment/items. Upgrades do not work like your typical souls-like where you increase stats, instead working with several upgrade trees at your disposal (some nodes still give you a stat increase).The story is complete shit, no point arguing. I am a decent fan of asian literature, nothing fancy, just decently interested, and I enjoy the mythology that originates from those parts of the world, but the way the story is narrated in this game is just fucking dumb. Imagine you have a decently complex classical literary book from a certain part of the world, now you ask a writer from FromSoftware to make the adaptation for said book to be used in a game, then add a fancy poetic-like type of narration where a good chunk of the story is explained in riddles and finally you grab a bunch of cinematics (which look great!) and you place them around the game with no cohesion at all, making random jumps on  the VERY SAME CINEMATIC that you started watching 30 seconds ago. There you go, here's your story.For the first 10 hours of gameplay the character moveset feels unique and inspired, giving a Jedi Survivor type of gameplay compared to the more attack-commitment type that you would expect from other souls-like. Then, after that 10 hour mark, you realise that every single fight plays the exact same, repeating the very same basic attack combo over and over and over, to then use the 4 charge heavy attack, rinse and repeat. The issue that I have with this is that although you have up to 9 different upgrade trees, you will play the very same game at the 10 hour mark than at the 30 hour mark, as all the ""fancy"" new features are granted at the beggining of the game. All the other upgrades no matter which spell it is will just make the base version better, which is not necessarily bad. The issue is that all upgrades are something of the sorts of it lasts for more time!, it deals more damage!, you spend less mana!, etc. None of them feel inspired in any way once you've used them for a while. You have 3 types of upgrade trees that will be related to the type of ""basic"" attack that you will use throughout the game, from what I've seen, only the very first one is worth anything, because the other 2 place so many constraints on the player that will straight up be unusable in some of the bosses, and will just make it a chore in the ones they would be useful in.Boss-wise, the game is just a boss rush with fancy corridors that connect each boss room, with your group of enemies in-between. Some of the bosses aregreat, nearly at the level of the best bosses in Fromsoftware games (although a bit too easy for my taste), but like in Elden Ring, you will have  multiple bosses which are just reskins of the same boss you've seen multiple times already, we complained in ER for having way too many dragons with just a different colour breath attack, well here you have the very same thing.Graphically, it is the very best you will find out there, and very few games will get close to the quality found here, I'd say Cyberpunk2077 with everything in ultra together with some of the visual fidelity mods will be able to top this. Performance-wise, I have been able to play the game on Very High with very few performance drops with 4070ti & Ryzen 7 7700.Overall, i'd give it a 7/10. It is not a bad game by any means but I am just bored, it is great that you enjoy this game, but anyone that gives this a more than an 8 from an objective pov should start playing any of the truly best action RPGs. In a way, this game feels like a properly done presentation card from the developers, where they show you all the fancy things that they are able to do. Now what we need is or them to gather eveyrything they have learned from this game, and make a brilliant game for the following one, because they are without a doubt able to do it. It is unfortunate that lots of people have completely lost the meaning of what a true masterpiece means, giving games like this a 9 or a 10 takes away all the merit of making a true masterpiece."
Negative,"The game starts great, it looks great and the art direction is top, but the futher i ventured into the game the worse it all becomes. Combat is fancy flair and gives so many tools that some bosses can be pushed into a corner and bullied to pieces, i feel like the game is giving the player too many tools to overpower the enemies. Because of this i felt more and more towards the end of the story that the bosses and enemies had to resort into cheap tactics. Bosses would fly into the sky and shoot, they would do massive aoe, grab you, shift phases and just plain become immortal at times to prevent the player for overwhelming them, all in all bad game design for my tast.Past the flashy clucky combat the story is based on something called the journey to the west. That lore seemed interesting, the design of creatures captivating, but since i have no clue on what the novel is or what chinese lore is, the entire story was near impossible to follow. They make a poor job at making it friendly to anyone with little to no knowlagde on the subject at hand. I resorted to trying and reading some of the in game lore about creatures and characters, but even they are vague and hardly very informative, at least the once i read.I tried my best at finding secrets and doing as much as possible, but for a full priced game like this, i feel it is not worth the price to me, I don't know what the story is other then collect some stuff and kill some bosses. The combat was unblananced, clucky but flashy fun. the level design pretty but made little to no sense with no context to the story. For some that are well versed and love the lore and can follow the story it would be an easy recommend, but the gameplay just don't hold up the game on it's own for me.I wish i could recommend this, just not a game for someone like me at the end of the day."
Negative,"It's too short. Wait for a sale or bum it off your Big Brother. You can use the deluxe version once and you keep all the stuff, although only the cats-eye beads are worth anything past the first boss."
Negative,"This is a no for me because it is purely a combat/fighting game. No real game play, just kill a boss, run to the next and repeat. Nothing to do in between, no quests, nothing to solve or figure out.If you just want to fight a boss that will take many tries to beat only to be frustrated 30 seconds later by the next boss, great game for you.Crafting, leveling, skills are all very basic. Couldn't be more disappointed with a $60 game that has such high reviews."
Negative,"The devs have no idea what the word 'optimisation' even means. I have an RTX 4080 Super and I can't even get a stable 60fps at 1440p with max settings, no RTX. Not only that, but in just 1 hour of gameplay I had at least 10 audio/visual bugs and multiple frame drops. Super disappointing, wouldn't recommend until they fix this. A flagship GPU can't even hit 60fps consistently and suffers frame drops even on lower settings. TL;DR: optimised like dookie, frame drops on an RTX 4080 Super, refunded for now, wouldn't recommend buying until they've bothered to fix issues or if you happen to have a 5090 on youNot to mention, if you say any of this on the subreddit everyone downvotes you and copes"
Negative,"Suffers the same monotony of every souls-like in the genre that tries to be ambitious but fails because the basic combat doesn't feel fluid or free. The lack of actual animation cancels and light attack combos having a delay that makes it so you have to commit to lose is crazy to me. I don't like having to stand and watch a 6 move combo where if i get hit even once I'm fried, but whenever I do a combo the boss can just slap me once and be free because apparently bosses can have infinite poise and hyper armor but the character cannot when they are literally meant to punish the boss in its combo gaps. If the game had a more consistent combat system that truly felt reliable and less of a prayer that the game will actually perfect dodge this time then I might have thought to stick around. But between all of the horrendously oversized hitboxes and terrible fluidity of combat this game is sadly a waste of time and money. There are so many indie games that do everything this game does but better without the ugly UE5 graphical up-scaling visual vomit and VFX diarrhea. I cannot recommend this game to anyone in good conscious."
Negative,"Terrible performance with framerate fluctuating somewhere between 60 and 110 most of the time. Occasional dips into the 40s or lower. The pretty frequent stuttering is probably the worst of it all. (Running a 5900X with a 6800XT GPU)About the gameplay itself: The combat feels really uninspired and plain. You just mash light attack to build your meter and then spend it for one heavy attack. It's really boring tbh. The fact that you have such simple combat but then ONLY ONE WEAPON TYPE makes it so much worse.The attacks also have no weight to them because hitstun is completely missing so it just feels like you are swinging a pool noodle instead of the solid staff you are actually holding.Enemies also kinda fluctuate. You have some cool bosses, but then you also have random trash mobs that have instant AoE attacks with gap closer that are just infuriating to go up against.All in all a pretty mediocre souls-like. Wait for performance patches and then for it to go on sale for about 20-25 bucks. If they don't fix the stuttering, ignore the game completely.Play Lies of P instead."
Negative,i'm convinced every single influencer was paid to shill this game. it's a fine game... for $25. it's just to shallow to warrant a $90 price tag
Negative,Most people seems to have a good experience with this game but unfortunately I have to get a refund due to the thecnical issues with the game the sounds delay and constant lagging is too much for me and it is just not enjoyable to play a game in this state I may revisit this game once it is fix.
Negative,"VERY poorly unoptimized, and i cannot justify playing this game with how it currently is. The game needs to be optimized and i am more than willing to buy again and play if that happens, im not a fucking streamer and cannot handle these graphics on my computer and i cant afford a super computer. Games should not be released like this by any company, this is early access issues. Delay the game if need be but games released for super computers, graphics not loading and audio cutting entirely or just not matching up to the scene is an alpha or beta test issue."
Negative,"The Good:- Good combat.- Very good story, lore and world building.- Level design works when it works.- Decent basic mechanics (e.g. estus upgrades, etc.) but it feels bland since this is in every soulslike ever.- Decent exploration mechanics and rewards.- Cutscenes are excellent.The Bad:- Optimization is subpar.- Some story NPCs get literally zero screentime, some REALLY interesting NPCs are basically shown very little. Maybe they're saving them for a sequel? Idek.- The weapon upgrade system and armor upgrade system becomes boring after about Chapter 2-3 since it's literally just the same thing over and over, i.e. ""beat major boss -> new set -> craft it all -> repeat"" not sure why you can't find sets in the world and stuff or have these as rewards for side quests..- Honestly the soundtrack isn't really that good.The Ugly:- Horrible boss mechanics pretty much across the board. Unnecessary wind ups, sometimes there's no wind ups, bosses immediately jump back up when attacked after being flinched (why???), some bosses have way too much health.- The difficulty spiking is all over the place, one major boss is easy as hell and the next one is somehow harder than every boss in the game and then it flip flops over and over for no reason.- No map hurts this game probably more than anything, exploration at times is such a pain in the butt since everything just melts together environment wise so you end up constantly backtracking and going over the same locations over and over, artificially boosting game time way beyond what it needs to be. Look at how Souls handles level design, miles better.- Having no obvious world border makes for absurdly obnoxious exploration.- Bugs that affect combat begin to pop up around Chapter 4, currently dealing with one that turns the destined one into a giant slug and makes all of his movements 10x slower out of nowhere which makes boss fights tedious as fuck.- A lot of side quest NPCs are very bland and most side quests basically are ""hey get this thing for me, thanks now I sell u things"" and it's laughable how bad these quests are when compared to the games that inspired this.tl;dr add a map for christs sake, make bosses less obnoxious, give NPCs more love, fix world borders and make the difficulty more consistent."
Negative,"Played this game for a little bit. Despite the egregious data collection agreement, this game is clunky with bosses (while being easier[?] than dark souls) have a series of unseeable attacks that you still have to memorize. For souls lovers, y'all love that nonsense.But the game is still very clunk. The character turns on a large circle instead of in place, and there is a lack of options for you besides rolling and jumping. Feels like they spent a lot of time on the artistry, but the execution into the game has models reused, the monkey's feet clipping through the cloud, and the shaders taking a long time to load just to give 2D leaves and plants.Also, the lack of instruction is disgusting. There's a lot of tutorial for SOME things, but there are plenty of instances where clicking an option will screw you over (for example, you get turned into a cicade for some reason early on. Your only available options are 'move around' and a spell with an unhelpful symbol that removes the cicada mode and forces you to play as monkey, with no more options for that section to play it in cicada as the game wants you to.Feels like a game funded to get my data."
Negative,"Looking at this matter as a boy, the black myth production team Youke has not responded or apologized for insulting women and yellow accents so far. This matter is still reluctant to say politely today, which is enough to glimpse the narrow-mindedness and arrogance of their team.作为男生来看这件事，黑神话制作组游科至今都没有为辱女、黄腔回应和道歉，这件事时至今日客套话都不愿说，足以窥见他们团队狭隘、傲慢等问题。"
Negative,Constant crashing another win for AMD. joke company
Negative,Its not running on a 7900XTX..
Negative,"En chapter y medio el combate se me ha hecho repetitivo. Le pasa como al Nioh que te mete mil putas mierdas que me vienen sobrando.Los enemigos son puñeteras esponjas. Los ataques de ciertos enemigos los han querido hacer tan flashy que no resultan agradables de esquivar. No puedo explorar ni mierdas porque hay muros invisibles por todas partes.Combate como el Sekiro y un nabo. Entiendo a quien le guste, pero desde luego no es para mi."
Negative,"Everyone saying how good the game and looks like never played a good game before. so i am pointing out some key points,1.Story itself is very bad. doesn't make sense you need to know journey to west to understand the game. if you need to read books to understand the game whats the point of playing a game, just go and read the book and if you have time yeah play the game.2.As the game took longer time to release and i was expecting it to be really good, specially the story. seems the game is developed by a company who doesn't care about story telling and pay lot to graphics and game machanics departments or lack of ability on creativity.3.

Negative,"Yellow Wind Sage, completely broken mechanics combine for a truly frustrating experience.I dodge and the game doesn't give me the dodge, I use immobilize and if he's in his sand form it doesn't work yet I'm charged for the ability. I use a pluck of many and if I'm hit while using it I'm charged for the ability yet I have no duplicates. If I accumulate 3 power points and use Pillar Stance to heal up I can still be hit while on the top of Pillar Stance and am charged all 3 points for it without the heal, what's funner is that when I'm at the top of Pillar Stance and press the heal button (LB on controller) Monkey just ignores the input and so I wind up having to spam LB to heal at the top of Pillar Stance. If I dodge Yellow Wind Sage's hail mary football punt kick that literally takes half of my health away, the game says I didn't dodge and I'm either kicked or track kicked anyway. See the problem with this game, unlike Sekiro where if you time a block imperfectly you can still block, this game, if you don't time the dodge perfectly you're punished for it big time, and then unlike Sekiro where the block animation is way faster you're asked to account for an animation delay with Monkey, you're asked to factor this into an incredibly small dodge window (feels like, and I'm not exaggerating, a 10ms perfect dodge window) and it's just beyond aggravating, oh and for whatever reason, the environment can hinder your attacks, for example, I had 3 points built up and did a Smash Stance attack but there was some sand in between me and Yellow Wind Sage and wouldn't you know it, whoops, the game decided to charge me all 3 points for the attack that was hindered by this and well, Yellow Wind Sage can fly all around the screen, all kinds of bullshit attacks and you're asked with a straight face to dodge them and when you do you're still penalized and hit anyway. To add insult to injury, after you're killed, repeatedly, by this broken boss (and every broken boss before it, don't even get me started on Tiger Vanguard) you then have to wait out a, and I'm not exaggerating, 30 second animation sequence where Yellow Wind Sage dispenses some wisdom over your dead body, something about mercy, and it's always the same line, the same 30 second sequence, followed by another 30 second loading screen (this with a 7800x3D and a Samsung 990 Pro M.2 nVME with 6GB/s read and write) and then another 10 second hair falling animation sequence at the last respawn point and then you're asked to run back to the enemy for at least another 60-90 seconds, so every time you die it's waiting around with your thumb up your a$$ for 2-3 minutes. And I don't understand the 30 second load time because the area in question (the Cellar) has no NPC's, no assets whatsoever, nothing needs to be reset, and all of the textures look like Playstation 2 quality even on Cinematic (another gripe I have with this game). Like it's just baked in, the developers want to make the experience as punishing as possible and waste as much of your time as possible. Then I'm right back at the fight and I know what attacks are coming, I know what must be done to counter them, but the game only gives me a dodge maybe 65% of the time and a perfect dodge maybe 10% of the time. I'm not incompetent, I'm not a bad gamer, I don't have bad reflexes, there is simply something fundamentally wrong with the dodge mechanic, it's window and how it's connected to an animation delay that the player is asked to account for. So it's 2-3 minutes of fighting and invariably dying because of broken mechanics and then another 2-3 minutes of loading screens and animation sequences and running the same barren path back to the boss and after about an hour of this I'm ready to punch my monitor. Like this is absolutely not fun in any way shape or form, and after I beat this boss, I will be asked to do it again in 30 minutes with another equally frustrating boss. That's been this game up until now, no real exploration, no real mentally challenging navigation or interesting fights along the way, it's one frustrating boss punctuated by a slog of uninteresting enemies who all similarly do cheesy crap along the way with the same broken dodge system after another broken boss.This game has NOTHING on Sekiro, absolutely nothing, I understand the praise it received during a time when every other game is peddling woke propaganda, and I appreciate that, I just don't think the actual mechanics are very good nor the combat very fun. Hell it doesn't even run very good. I have Dying Light 2 which also has Ray Tracing and I can run that game on Balanced DLSS with Frame Gen @ 75 FPS basically everywhere with an RTX 4090 @ dual 4K. This game I had to go with HUB Medium RT Performance recommended settings and with DLSS on Performance (doesn't matter actually, because the texture quality is so bad they look that much more out of place with higher DLSS) I'm at 70 FPS most of the time but this is basically on Medium RT with DLSS on performance and it doesn't hold a candle to Dying Light 2 yet seems to cost 50% more performance. So it runs like crap, feels like crap, combat sucks, lore sucks, story is meh, I don't know man, I think this game has a lot of undue praise. Add in the bad boss design and eventually after about an hour of bull$hit I'm here writing about my thoughts of this game. Oh and I got the stupid item from the stupid bore that shuts down Yellow Wind Sage's wind mode, my issue is, how is the player supposed to figure all of this out without a youtube tutorial? Like seriously, how many of you got all of these items the boar wanted and found him constantly moving around all over the map an satisfied all the requirements of this side-quest without first hearing about it on a forum or similarly complaining about how difficult Yellow Wind Sage is and being told to go an get this item / ability?"
Negative,Most beautifull game i have ever seen! Playing on an Oled is almost real life! Gameplay is mid at best! Bad damage numbers from your character! weird and non funcioning abilities! No usefull dodge mechanic! No usefull counter mechanics! only Ultimate abilities that are on a timer wich makes fights extremely long and unfair! Extremely frustrating and Bad timing optimization wich results in only unfair enemy types from the moment you start up the game! If there was a  possibility for better timing or better visualisation then the game would be a bit better!
Negative,"Really unimpressed by the story, lost me within the first 20 secondsv just because it showed how shallow the understanding the writers had about the literature. Sure, the visuals are outstanding, but that seems to be the only thing. This game requires someone who has a rough background knowledge of the original story but not a deep understanding to love, because to me the writers don't really have an attunement with the spirituality which grounded the original story in the first place, nor do they have a literary appreciation for what it means to be 悟 空. Referring back to 齐天大圣 is literally regressing, but the story is set after the original story ends - that's a joke and should be treated as such. It is just as plastic as any other contemporary Chinese aesthetic: mass produced, superficial, spiritually empty. Other than the story, it is a well-coordinated production. But lol, what is the point of building up this fancy-looking temple if the people who are going there are all hallow inside.To audience who are just new to Chinese mythology: this is not even remotely good when situated in the realm of historically mind-boggling Chinese productions.Plus this game requires you to have a ton of time for games, as if you don't have other things to appreciate in life. Getting a refund."

Negative,"The combat in this game is just not fun.  It feels very clunky.   You get locked in long animations that cannot be cancelled.  Inputs do not get queued so if you push a button slightly too soon before an animation is over, that input is lost.The game promotes exploration, but there are invisible walls everywhere which make it feel like a chore.Edit:  After another 20 hours this game is just plain not fun.  My initial comments stand and after chapter 5 I cannot wait for it to be over.  Not even sure if I will finish the game.  If a sequel is released you could not pay me to play it"
Negative,game is ass no map and and no way to know if your doing anything right
Negative,Crashes almost every boss battle.
Negative,No map and much too difficult.
Negative,"Performance sucks.Come on, devs...fix your damn game."
Negative,"it looks very good, but the game becomes boring very soon.99.9% game play is fighting against a boss in a small arena.A couple of minutes of a corridor way to a boss10 minutes - X hours of tries with the boss, kill the bossrepeatthe bosses are great, it's really disappointing that the game play is only boss fighting.I regret that I've  bought it for a full price, and don't understand why so many positive reviews"
Negative,"I don’t understand why (almost) everybody likes this. Perhaps my mistake was taking the ""RPG"" and ""action RPG"" tags seriously.+++ You can make me a jester, but I still don’t see this tag for the game > Dead SoulsThat’s exactly what it is - nothing more than a (?)complex(?) hack-and-slash game without any real depth. If it had been tagged as such, I would never have bought this title, because I know I don’t like that type of game. But as long as this game has the misleading ""RPG"" and ""action RPG"" tags, my comment will remain here. You can mock me if you like, I don’t care. However, the tagging of this game is misleading. It’s just an action game with no real RPG content.I hope this unnecessary lie with the tags of this game will end, and when it does, my comment will end with it."
Negative,"games is absolutely frustrating AF. you get no direction on anything. this game feels more like a GD job than something to enjoy. if i wanted to fail 5600 times i'd keep trying at life. this is supposed to be fun. yet all i've done is swear at this SOULS LIKE game because thats what it is, this isn't an action RPG it's souls 4.0. if you don't like smashing yoru face off the keyboard all day then please DONT BUY."
Negative,"Game is good, though i have a mouse with 12 thumb buttons on the side, remapping is impossible. Have to use a third party software for macros, this is utter bs. Modern games that have keyboard/mouse inclusion should let you map your keybinds however you want, i've seen comments about left handed people refunding the game, and people like with other keys unable to bind them. There is no excuse"
Negative,"Another Elden Ring/Dark Souls game. Don't believe other reviewers comparing to it to anything else other than the forementioned games. Visuals are great, audio is great, concept is cool, game play is the same song and dance as other games. It's a no for me, huge disappointment."
Negative,Great Game but use DENUVO.
Negative,What i dislike is that it takes 40 minutes to get to the start menu and then if it even get to the game it lags and glitches like crazy and it is simply not playable
Negative,Many time cash game but no have any update for that isssue
Negative,Definitely the worst hit boxes and invisible walls i have ever seen. The bosses are constantly clipping out of bounds and every fight is 10-15 minutes long since apparently giant sponge=difficult and engaging gameplay. 90% of this game is figuring out invisible wall boundaries in boss arenas that the bosses themselves completely ignore.
Negative,"I read it is something similar to God of War. it was advertised as it is not soulslike. I got soulslike and it's nothing like GoW. I feel basically scamed. It has boring story, terrible areas (first two chapters are nice and after that it goes downhill) and horrible toxic bosses. combat loop is fun but overall difficulty is destroying immersion and creating frustration. I would recommend only to somebody who really enjoy soulslikes and it's his bread and butter. If you want reasonably challenging story games, this is not for you. like at all lol don't even bother."
Negative,"Nothing but boss battles. Crafting is uninteresting. The strength and resilience of your character doesn't change much at all, even over 100 levels you only become moderately stronger. Hope you enjoy banging your head against a wall as you try to kill the same bosses for hours and hours and hours."
Negative,"graphics 9/10lore/storytelling 9/10combat 3/10difficulty 4/10beautiful looking game and nicely told story, but thats it. Skill Tree is boring. Sometimes annoying invisible walls (looks like path). And most important: horrible combat. Spam dodge and light attack and u can win any fight eyes closed. only time u cant go braindead button smash is when u face a big boss. Got bored after 12 hours of hack n' slash"
Negative,"7.5/10Map: The first few chapters use air walls to make the small garden map, and the fifth and sixth chapters are half-finished. Especially the sixth chapter, lacks sufficient guidance.Battle: There is a lack of a reasonable pre-input system, and some boss battles are performed for the sake of performance. The throwing skills starting at 0 frames are speechless.Plot: The spiritual sequel of Douzhanshen, but even if it is understood as a sequel, the whole plot is fragmented, and most of the causes and consequences need to be supplemented by imagination."
Negative,"It's a fighting game trying to be open world. Another attempt to make a game where you just roll around on the ground and wait for powers to recharge. All you get is a monkey that can't jump or climb, oh and he has a magic stick which is useless in boss fights. You have to fight a giant wolf like this. So do I spend a half hour waiting for powers to recharge over and over again or go find a game that's actually entertaining and doesn't feel like grinding in an old MMORPG. People also said it was like God of War. Do you remember the part where you run down a tree of life branch to go between worlds in God of War Ragnarök? that's what this whole game is like. As far as fighting it's broken fighting game mechanics for everyone no exceptions."
Negative,"""Black Myth: Wukong"" draws heavily from Chinese culture and mythology, but if you're stepping into it without prior knowledge, like I did, you might find the story a bit confusing. Unfortunately, the lore didn’t engage me enough to want to explore it further, and I’m not really into hack-and-slash games with an over-the-top fantasy setting—it’s just not my thing.I got this game in a bundle for free when I bought an RTX 4090. That being said, the character designs are impressive. I also discovered that the developers have placed some unusual restrictions on early-access reviewers, banning discussions on topics like news, politics, Covid-19, and even 'feminist propaganda.' Since when was feminist propaganda such a controversial topic? And what even qualifies as feminist propaganda? Advocating for women’s right to vote or equal rights? I get that China might have different perspectives, but seriously, lmao.As for the gameplay, if you’re okay with audio lag, repetitive mechanics, and facing off against characters way out of your league without much in-game lore to help you, this might be your kind of game. But if you’re after a more cohesive experience and don’t have a background in Chinese history or mythology, I’d recommend saving your money. On the other hand, if you're a content creator looking for something new to add to your YouTube or Twitch channel, this game could offer some interesting material."
Negative,Boring and repetitive combat.Exploration is awful with invisible walls and empty world.The most overrated game of the decade!
Negative,"if you want a game with AI that constantly kicks the shit out of you to the point where its not fun, waste £50 on this"
Negative,Permanently remove from my account it junk .......
Negative,game is too hard for casual gamers
Negative,"I'll preface this with saying i'm not far into the game, just a few hours in, so maybe it just didn't click for me yet, but up to this point this seems to me like the most massively overhyped game in recent memory. The graphics are great, but art direction is uninspired to me, it walks on the UE5 crutch, but nothing more.Level design is quite frankly the most bland i've encountered in the last years in a ARPG, and often confusing due to invisible walls not making the paths clear. Can i go there or not? It's a mistery you'll solve only by pointlessly bouncing in an arbitrary barrier. Combat... eh. It just didn't click for me yet, maybe it will, maybe not, I'm leaning towards not. The different lenght of the attacks in the single combo make using the specials (3, 1 for each stance, inputting a heavy attack id light combo) kinda clunky, charged heavies are slow and force trading, transformations are once again clunky. Spells are nice, but cooldowns are still really long (maybe it will change with progression, don't know), so they're once in a fight pretty much.Bosses. Okay first of all, this is a boss rush, period. The space between bosses is occupied by a handful of pointless enemies posing no threat and no fun disseminated in the forementioned bland levels, On the bosses proper. I'm not enjoying the battles. Difficulty is calibrated nicely, but it gives me no satisfaction beating them, Attack patterns are often confusing and hard to read, delayed attacks out the wazoo, visual clutter in certain arenas, very, very , VERY bland soundtrack detracting any semblance of epicness the encounters might have.So far it's a solid 6, doesn't really make me want to play it more if not out of lack of anything else."
Negative,"Really hate those instant, continuous attack that would last like 10 seconds, no map, but what annoy me the most is some bosses simply halt my attack rudely with no reason and more than one cutscenes come in. Yes, the art is fabulous, but the combat interactivity, which is a core of an action game, needs a lot to improve. The plot is obscure for those who don't have the corresponding kowledge of that journey to the west."
Negative,"beautiful game, nice level design but a lot of the bosses just feel cheap or boring, phases were you cant attack them at all because they turn into fog or sand or something and constantly attack you while being unable to be hurt, then other bosses have 1 shot cut scene movespoor attempt at a souls like"
Negative,Had high expectations given the positive reviews but this game is just dry. Let me start by saying this is not an open world game. That's normally fine if the gameplay is unique and exciting...this game is neither. You follow one path and fight bosses. The bosses don't feel any different from one another so you end up up grinding only to experience repetition. Can't believe I paid 70 bucks for this crap
Negative,"This has to be the most boring game I’ve ever played. Yes, the game is beautiful, but that’s the only positive aspect about it."
Negative,"After the update you have done, I have to kill some bosses 50 times. WTF is this. I am having them at zero health but they do not die. I didn't pay for this shit.."

Negative,"I wanted to like this game since I paid full price… I wanted to give it the best shot that it could… I wanted to like it as much as I like “Lies of P” and “Stelar Blade” but I can’t…. I just can’t…From here on out everything is my opinion, with my pov, but to make it short and simple I have prior experience with almost every single soul like // god of war so the “get gud” part we can skip it (I know how defensive people can get when you make constructive criticism out of the game they love so that’s why I’m saying the get gud part)…My main issues with the game are two: Storytelling and Gameplay, where this game fails so miserably that it annoys me too much… so much so that I gave it a bad review. But let’s start with the storytelling… I’m sorry what? Does this game have a story? I don’t know I skipped everything from chapter 4 onwards because despite trying my hardest to understand the cutscenes… reading the diary, etc… I just couldn’t understand anything! There is a story, yes, it’s the story of “Journey to the West” Yes… is it greatly told? How could I know? I’ve never read that book nor do I know anything about Chinese mythology… so yeah… the game was not made for me a foreigner that does not know Chinese… and it shows… If we compare the story to Elden Ring for example… you don’t need to know anything to play Elden Ring and enjoy it, you can skip cutscenes but most are a few seconds long and even if they talk everything is so cryptic that you leave it at that... but here… having to wait for 5 to 10 min cutscenes where you don’t get anything is just pointless… And before you come here munching at me, games don’t need to make a compelling story to be good, but if they are trying to tell one… the least they could do is tell the goddam story, right? So yeah, in terms of storytelling a 4/10 the only saving grace is the visual in this regard…Now the thing that made me the angriest… the gameplay… I love gameplay, I do not care how trashy the game is if it has good gameplay… But this game… this game made me rage quite bad. and not because of the difficulty but because of the feeling you get while fighting! Your hits have no impact, you feel nothing while hitting enemies it’s like hitting a cloud, but you feel when they hit you, you feel it like a truck… the weird part is when they cut your combos, sometimes the same attack cuts your combo and other times it does not, yeah inconsistent, that the word! This game has the most inconsistent gameplay I’ve seen in a long run! Sometimes your combo just does not land because the game said so and you are left feeling like “Oh well that must be my fault let’s try again” and you try again only to be met with the same fate… For example, when you do a full light combo there is an ability that activates the first stance and allows a final heavy attack at the end of the combo, that heavy attack is telegraph, meaning that it follows the enemy to help you land it, got it? Well, this does not work 50/50 times and for the life of me, it was driving me crazy… how am I supposed to play If I don’t know when and where my attacks are going to land? Because remember you have almost no feedback from the game when you hit. Also, the game thinks that making an enemy hard is just giving him 100000hp and making you do 1hp per heavy hit… “OH YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE GREAT? MAKING A 100000HP ENEMY THAT MOVES AT THE SPEED OF SOUND!” yeah, this part infuriates me… I know… I know… get gud… but when fights feel like a marathon instead of a fight… when fighting a boss takes 20 minutes…. And when the game is just a plain boss rush with nothing in between but pointless exploration… it gets to ya’… I’m sorry… I tried to like the game… but I just… 5/10 gameplay…To not end everything with a sour note… the visuals are the best out there at the moment… no shit they invested everything into visuals making diarrhea of animations and lights and cinematographic bullshit that they didn’t have the cash to fix the storytelling and gameplay asfipweugfvbwrigbv…..Final score 7/10… buy it if you like god of war, you are going to enjoy the game… if you want to be a monkey (this is why I bought the game) also buy it too it’s entertaining, to say the least even if it ends up making you as angry as I was… i really want to end things up by talking about how much I expect from these guys for their next game. Now that they proved that the could make games, visually stunning games, and with the sales numbers that they have.... I want them to take their time... look back at this game and improve everything... i know they can make one of the best games out there... i know it... they just need to take a small step back, a little chill pill and they will make an awesome game... sadly this was not it for me..."
Negative,"Great game! but..Terrible performance.Unreal 5 traversal stutter.Bad motion blur.Ugly DLSS / or any upscaler destroys the image quality.Strange artifacting around character.(even without DLSS/  or any upscaler)Mega frame-rate drops at water puddle (even without RT).

(Medium RT is broken ATM)3: Installed disable sharpening mod.4: Use Digital Foundry or Hardware Unboxed settings.Update 31-8-241:HT issue is fixed in the last patch ATM. so you can turn HT on in BIOS if you wish."
Negative,"Don't get me wrong, the game itself is fantastic. Unfortunately if you have never played soul-like games (like me), the punishing difficulty will make you want to delete the game. I spent SIX HOURS on a single boss and almost requested refund from Steam. Rethink before you make your purchase."
Negative,"EDIT: Dropped the game on the last stage, after running around more then one hour trying to undestand what I had to do. The game has no map and gives you no clue on where you've got to go. If you don't want to use youtube or guides, exploration in this game is an absolute chore. The design of the area completely spoiled the game for me. I'd recommed the game only to people who don't mind using youtube for help to figure out staff, because you'll need it, that's a part of the game that't total axx.Good, but not enough to recommend it at full price. Issues I have with the game: most areas are too big to explore and the game has no in game map, which doesn't make any sense. This game had metroidvania elements and no metroidvania has no map. I actually prefer games with no map but areas can't be too big otherwise exploring becomes a chore, and that what happened to me here. Combat is fun but it could be improved a lot, for example by including a proper parry or some attacks that you have to jump to avoid becuse right now it's like in every souls game where you just roll through everything. Most of the game is not particularly hard, but then you get to some bosses that have super cheap patterns and hit box problems. The last boss of level 4 is one of worst designed and problematic bosses of every time, it ruined the experience for me. Definitely wait for some patches and around a 40sh price"
Negative,"Just another PC game released in (current year) with glowing reviews that frame drops every 3 seconds on a 4090 and can't keep 116 fps steady with frame gen + dlss regardless of settings. Man, I need to start making games. Seems like a free money printer. Who gives a fuck about playability and QA when the majority of the human race is perceptually and/or intellectually impaired and will defend your shit game for you? But it's souls like guys amirite haha goty! We need the holoc@ust pt 2 for game developers and gamers because gaming these days is a sad state."
Negative,I really dislike games such as the Souls series and Elden ring as I detest repeating the same mission/boss numerous times as I am more intrigued by the storing then the 'accomplishment'.  I thought I would give this a go but I have returned it as its too difficult for my liking.I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who wants to relax after work. Not a bad game just not for me.
Negative,why i cant start game
Negative,"A broken, heavily un-optimized game with significant issues and bugs.Somehow has positive reviews"
Negative,28.5hrs played. Only figured out the game is awful. Wish I could refund.
Negative,"I love souls games, but this is just a tedious boss grinder. No real substance just 1 boss fight straight onto the next with very little in between. Not for me unfortunately."
Negative,"So far  graphics are great, But  there is no  Map, no N,S,E,W indicator, No Quest marker, No story line, Open world is limited to your road or creek, No save, Hard to see what to pick up, Tiny text cant enlarge,It came with my PC bundle , I am glad I didn't pay $65 for it. wait till its $20.  I chose English but thats for Text  they speak chinese I guess But graphics are great. maybe if I could get to another level it might get better."
Negative,"Parry in this game would have been perfect. I also experience  a lot of frame drops and crashes, and then I have to go in task manager to set the game on high priority. The game is broken and how people are saying this is a contender for goat confuses me. Since I paid for it and pass the 3hr mark I'll muscle through it but I 'am not enjoying it. Hope this game is better for other gamers. I see the potential but it falls flat."
Negative,This game might be awesome but I cant get past the loading screen because of a out of memory error. I cant seem to find any resolutions to this problem. Since I spent 60 bucks on this game id actually like the opportunity to play it lol. I dont know if this is just a 14th gen cpu issue or what but im requesting a refund and will most likely play it on my ps5 i guess.

Negative,"Visually very impressive, game ran smooth enough on a 6950XT on High settings. But refunded the game because the first near 2 hours couldn't impress me enough. Combat seemed very dull by that point, basic attack combo's combined with a unique heavy attack that requires you to commit. Similar to smaller arena sized maps filled with enemies giving the impression of freedom, being constricted in a very linear world. This game will very likely open up later on making the combat very engaging, but if the bare basics aren't that fun, and the game becomes fun the further in you get, then the game wasn't really that fun.Maybe I'll pick this game back up on a discount, but the very - mostly - annoying english dubs combined with lackluster gameplay and no introduction to an in-depth combat system made me feel like this was a very high quality production, just not a high quality gameplay experience (yet)."
Negative,"Another game my dumb, old gamer self can't play because it's woefully unforgiving. Why can't games be fun anymore? Why can't games just have a casual and fun mode?The graphics are nice and the overall visuals and enemy design are well done. You can jump but there's invisible walls everywhere with no indication of when or where you can't go someplace. It staggers your character and really ruins the experience of a beautiful landscape. Want to explore over there? Nope, wall. 3 feet to the left though, there's an open path. It's very disorienting and linear.The combat feels jerky and there's a lack of polish between moves. This game is all about dodging but half the time I can't dodge because animations wont cancel or I'm having to worry about an unnecessary stamina bar. If you like those ""Souls"" games, you'll probably like this. If you want a fun, more forgiving experience play something else."
Negative,"After getting to the last boss, changing this review to negative. Chapter 6 was basically filler.,This game oscillates from having a trivial difficulty to being stupidly hard. There was multiple bosses that i got on the first go, multiple that took a healthy three to five goes, and then the occasional demi god - ridiculous, broken boss that took 30+ goes.The final boss is broken levels of hard, anyone who says otherwise is just humble flexing. I would ping the final boss at approximately 2.5 times harder than any boss in elden ring (though I haven't played the expansion).There's challenging, and then there is just straight up irritating. This is just irritating.Unless you have psychological issues or a very sad real life, which gives you the need to get some kind of fulfilment out of beating an insanely difficult video game, I would not buy this. whatever enjoyment I might have had, was, in the end, overshadowed by the last boss."
Negative,"you need 4080 to have fun in this game ,the game need a highend gpu she's too heavy"
Negative,Can't even launch the game.crashes on shaders so i just gave up nty
Negative,"I beat the game just so i didn't have to hear the argument ""get good"". The game isn't bad, however it isn't as good as described. some enemies feel unbalanced ( tentacle man ) for example and no real way to deal with ranged enemies except rush them. the lack of weapon diversity, there are  a number of pole-arms that could have been added. I also wanted to see more options with armor and abilities. I found the story to be far too short for my liking. lastly the last boss fight is for lack of a better term bs and felt like i was being trolled, i enjoyed no part of it. overall great story but the gameplay felt ... incomplete and lacking. story: 8/10combat: 5/10level design: 5/10value: 4/10"
Negative,"Game design in general is heavily lacking when compared to any recent fromsoft title, level design is awful, with barely memorable locales and poorly places checkpoints. boss mechanics are janky, combat is clunky and the difficulty is lacking. This game feels like if you gave fromsoft 5 times the budget, but lobotomized the game designers. If you havent played ghost of tsushima, sekiro or DS3/Elden ring, knock all of those out before this, because they are all significantly better. The only noteworthy aspect is the graphics and art direction/source materialNot worth $60 in any way, only playing it because my copy was free"
Negative,"I never played game like this before, and I understand this game might be not for me. I am really confused where to find fun in this game. I spent some time killing few bosses but there is no reward/satisfaction from killing them(besides better gear) and a feeling: ohhh I finally won after 100 deaths. There is no story around the bosses, just another body to beat, and the next one is probably going to be more difficult with more magical skills, but nothing that drives me to continue. I appreciate the thought and effort that was put into this game, graphics and animation is really amazing, but this game is lacking something that would make me want to continue."
Negative,畫面11/10分優化0/10分打完亢金龍劇情：既然入了此番輪迴 就別想輕易涅槃然後直接閃退 亢金龍重打我操你媽目前才一周目 亢金龍黃眉都已經打贏兩次了呢!!!!!打完boss戰 系統先存檔不是基本功能?進個劇情直接閃退?然後毒敵大王更扯打了幾次之後 直接消失 打都沒得打
Negative,CANT SETTING HOTKEY ON CONTROLLER
Negative,"It runns very bad on my machine, the sound is stuttering for some reason even in the title screen. I´ll refund it and wait for it to be fixed."
Negative,"While this game is visually beautiful, the gameplay is wonky when up against bosses. The hotboxes on some of the bosses was not well placed and made combat unnecessarily difficult. The controls at times also dont work. I wouldnt recomend until some things have been fixed."
Negative,"So far the game play experience and atmosphere has been great, and I've even defeated a few bosses already, but the constant crashing has diminished my experience. I hope that it is fixed soon, It's hard to be immersed when every 25 mins I'm back at the steam library."
Negative,This game made me unalive my 7 siblings
Negative,The bosses suck
Negative,This cant be better rated then Elden Ring
Negative,"I thought it was like a God of War, this is more of a Souls Like, skip the trash, grind the bosses that kills you in 2 hits. Can see how souls like players would enjoy, but I do not get it"
Negative,"Go play GoW, the direction in this game blows."
Negative,Another one of those poorly optimized shit game. Its evident the chinese are trying to boost their regional game and nothing more to it.
Negative,"Not worth the hype. Game ran well on first launch after it had a chance to (load the shaders) but it doesn't do that after the first launch. So now it's a slide show every time I start it up. Decent for a $30 game, but not worth $60."
Negative,"Overhyped button masher.Graphics and setting are amazing, but the combat is impressively simplistic and boring.I wish i looked into the combat before buying, because i blindly bought this after seeing some short videos of people doing cinematic combo's.In reality the progression or skilltree doesn't change much to the core of combat; mash the living shit out of the light attack button and time your dodges right.Rather repetetive which is a shame."
Negative,"This is a fairly good game on most part. The maps looks really good. the characters design are very nice. nice game play loop.  The bad part are the gameplay in certain situations. Some of the bigger bosses are not hard on their own. Most of the ""hard boss"" have like 3-4 move set thats about it. Fighting the camera is the most frustrating part of this game. The fov can not be changed unless modded. The camera will auto lock even when turning off that feature in settings. The camera sometime locks on to a part of the body thats protected by plot armor.(air wall)"
Negative,"This my saddest review of my lifetime. im 35, ive beat 100s of games including most fromsoftware games. this game is this hardest thing ive ever encountered in life. I tried to beat the first main boss (snake) probably 2000 times and never got half way past its 2nd stage, for the first time in my life i downloaded cheats and used them to beat him. I turned off the cheats and now im stuck on the next boss, idk how this happened but this game is the hardest game ever made imo. im sad and my pride is hurt, this game made video games un-fun for the first time in 20 years of gaming be my hobby. This not a joke btw, idk how im the only one with this problem but it is what it is i guess."
Negative,"A bit over-hyped IMO. Game looks great, but felt pretty boring and soulless (no pun intended). Combat feels too button-mashy with very little strategy and variation. From what I played there didn't seem to be any stealth attacks/backstabs or any execution attacks after staggering enemies or any parrying or any variety of gameplay to make it more interesting to play. Perfect dodges have little, if any, benefit. Bosses were a bit boring with how much health they have and how little damage you seemed to do.I made it to the water snake boss fight and saw there was a phase 2 and decided I had enough of the game lol"
Negative,This is the most poorly designed game I have ever played in my entire life.
Negative,Venomous armguard drop is absolute peak trash game design. I hate this stupid game.
Negative,Its a worse souls with less skill required yet somehow more frustrating bosses in the worst ways. The movement just feels clunky as hell.
Negative,too hard for casual players..i wish it has an easy mode. Boss fights are hard for father  like me who just wanna enjoy the game after a long day from work and daddy duties.
Negative,fuck this game
Negative,"it's not a terrible game, but it's so heavy on spectacle.this is not a souls-like in any way besides you run around attacking, dodging hits, and healing when you fail to dodge.a boss might spend a full minute doing some RP stuff mid fight, floating in the air, or eating you, or pinning you to the ground. there is so much time spent not fighting during a fight. it's boring.I'll probably come back to this when I have nothing else to do. but it's not a good use of my time right now."
Negative,"The game is enjoyable, but it’s not very beginner-friendly. There’s no option to adjust the difficulty, which makes it challenging for less experienced players. After retrying 10 times, I decided to give up. If you’re a pro player, you might enjoy the challenge, but others might want to think twice before diving in."
Negative,"People are saying that this game was Elden Ring worthy. It's not even close. The game is not open world. It does look great.  I am not asking that you dumb the bosses down but, having to kill 8-12 of the same NPC's over and over again just to level your toon up to be able to do a little damage to them is not fun. I wish I would have waiting until this game went on sale before I purchased it."
Negative,"This is a very ambitious game but has a lot of flaws. I ll go over the pros and cons-Pros:1. Game looks stunning.2. Has a lot of content.3. Gameplay is good with a lot of depth, spells, potions, combat stances etc.4. Lots and lots of bosses (but some are very poorly designed).Cons:1. I have an RTX 4090 and this game still dips below 20 fps even with DLSS on quality and settings reduced to high at 4k but only sometimes. Needless to say this isnt optimized well. Most of the times I get over 60 frames but this game has massive frame drops and that can mean you can easily die in a boss battle when that happens.2. The Story is deep but not explained at all. You will have to do hours of googling, youtubing and reading the journals in game to figure out WTF is going on.3. Level design sucks with a lot of invisible walls.4. No map or objective marker or anything whatsoever to guide the player.5. Combat is good but has a few major problems, first you have no animation cancelling so if you are locked in a combo of light and heavy attacks to hit the boss, you will not be able to cancel to perform a split second dodge which this game demands. Resulting in the controls feeling sluggish.6. Second issue with the combat is MOST enemy attacks stagger your hero so you can get hit over and over allowing the boss to kill you with a 4 or 5 attack combo where you are stun locked.   Overall would not recommend unless its on sale after the game is fully optimized."
Negative,Late-Endgame design is trash. 6/10
Negative,"Give it a few weeks, this game is boring."
Negative,"I'll be a dissenting opinion here. It's a beautiful game, polished, interesting world, etc. I'm just not having fun. I've had hundreds of hours in Elden Ring, Nioh, and other Souls and Soulslikes, so it's not that I'm just not used to the genre. The bosses are hard but beatable. I just don't feel incentivized to persevere. There's no blocking, and limited parrying, so pretty much your only choice on the harder bosses is to memorize their movesets and get your dodge cadence perfect, while pecking at them with chip damage in short windows, and that is the opposite of fun for me. I don't really enjoy the player stances/movesets, Attacking isn't fun. And there are no new weapons with different movesets to find something I do enjoy. If copious dodging and memorizing movesets is your cup of tea, you'll be at home here. If you want to feel like your mastery of interesting techniques, weapons and abilities can get you by, you might be disappointed."
Negative,Game crashes with higher end intel processors. Known issue by developer but no fix.
Negative,janky as hell. Too focused on making it look good so they made poor core game mechanics
Negative,By the time I had 2 minutes of gameplay I had 3 crahes.
Negative,The performance problems are awful. The game was constantly crashing during cutscenes even though i have high end pc
Negative,"Chinese boss rush souls-like hack-n-slash with branching linear paths with beautiful high end graphics. If you're a casual gamer looking to turn off brain and mash buttons to kill bosses with ease, this aint it. Look elsewhere."
Negative,crashes once every two hours
Negative,boring souls like
Negative,The least optimised game I've played since Starfield.
Negative,"I want to love it, but its just too difficult. I can barely get past any of the bosses- even the first few. I'm constantly dying. There's NO difficulty setting so you wont be able to progress through the story. Very frustrating because its visually beautiful and it seems like the story line is amazing."
Negative,"cool ideas BUT!! the way that the game is leading you toward certain areas is very old and i feel like they could use more energy into making it more open. theres a rock i cant jump onto. when i get turned to a beetle i cant fly over small hills. the game is up for a good start but when the intro is done it loses it charms. i would prefer not to be turned into a beatle than having the exitement of flying and not fufill it. the other thing is the story. wukong IS a special person who is immortal and when he gets burried under the mountain you play as a wukong wannabe without any introduction to him or anything else. he just so happens to posses the special staff that only wukong possesses, the ability to transform AND turn hair into needles. no history of how the wannabe wukong possesses such abilities, because son wukong didnt inherrit the abilities. he earned them through learning. the staf is one of a kind and how did he get that one. did he stumple upon it when he walked in the park? its lack of story is frustration. the other thing is the heavy attack that takes too much time to make and the animaton requires that he first takes staff behind the back and then flip up in the staff and then bonk the enemy. seems like a lot unnesesery movement to make a heavy attack. but if ppl enjoy it then do it. i for one dont and have gotten a refund."
Negative,"Too much business, not enough monkey. 3/10But for real, if you strip away the visuals, this is not a very good game ESPECIALLY in comparison to similar games. It lacks any real identity and combat is downright boring. There is a complete lack of depth to so many aspects that it falls short in every area except visuals, which fall apart rapidly toward the end of the game anyway. The most challenging part of the game was running around in chapter 3 lost for hours. Most bosses are easily defeated on the first try and there is no need to learn patterns or anything. Also, many of the combat techniques can go completely unused without any detriment. Doom Eternal comes to mind when thinking about forcing players to use ALL tools given, whereas this game feels like it was designed with the opposite idea in mind so that you only have to use 1 tool to win.I would like to think of myself as a completionist, but this game is a nightmare when it comes to 100%. Missable content, RNG drops, bugs, crashes.All in all, if you enjoy challenge and depth avoid this game. It is closer to a playable novel than it is a souls-like or similar style game. Think God of War on the easiest difficulty."
Negative,Game is not optimized in its current version of the game. I meet the recommended requirements for the game but cant event achieve stable frame rates on the lowest settings. Turning on DLSS does solve some issue but results in the game looking a lot worse.English voices don't match the face and for a game that costs this much I expected more.
Negative,"Been playing for 10 hours and the only thing great about the game is the graphics the game play is plain garbage, took hours to even get past chapter 1 and couldn’t even pass chapter 2, I keep crashing within every boss fight, can’t really explore if the gear is shit and getting 1 shoted, Game is a straight up headache."
Negative,"Granted, I need to put more time into this game before judging it. But that's kind of the problem- I'm really struggling to get into it so far, and there isn't anything that's really grabbed me to pull me in. Up until this point, there hasn't been anything in the storytelling that has caused an emotional reaction within me. So far, my experience is that the game is too combat heavy, and the combat is astonishingly clumsy and unsatisfying for the price tag. For the standard mobs, button mashing is just as effective as using actual tactics. On the flip side, the bosses I've encountered so far are way over leveled.  I find myself fast traveling to earlier points so I can kill the trash mobs again and collect more sparks to beef my toon up, rather than leveling through natural progression.I'll give it another 4-5 hours to change my recommendation, but if it doesn't hook me by then I'll leave the thumbs down and move on."
Negative,"6/10PROS: GORGEOUS graphics, interesting characters, overall nice soundsCONS: Boring gameplay, you basically light attack your way through the map, doing same combos over and over again, can't even parry attacks or range, no variety makes it very repetitive.Bosses hit so randomly, sometimes there is visual indications sometimes there is none, stun animations are 3 second long and you just basically laying on the ground paralised till its over. it gets tedious not because bosses are hard to beat, but because combat is limited and clunky. (spawn points are too far from bosses too)Overall enemies are hard to find, world feels so empty, you just go from one boss to another, and if you lucky to find any, you kill them in 3 hits.Forget the story, its non existent, no lore, just bunch of bosses spawned in trying to kill you for who knows why.Awful voice acting of main character, squeaky voice, annoying to listen to.Stuttering from time to time, something is really really wrong with performance. Im running 4090 and still have issues.If you are planning to get this game, wait till they fix performance issues."
Negative,"I don't get the overwhelmingly positive reviews, and then games that are really good or not bad at all, get ""mixed"".Well, I bought into the whole hype of ""amazing game with amazing graphics"" - and resulted in a boring experience. I don't care if it's more souls like or more GOW like, the point is that it's just getting more and more boring. It's not even that difficult because it's just a matter of learning the big boss patterns and going on, boss after boss, rinse and repeat. Normal NPC are not a challenge at all. You repeat the same staff combo over and over, because you basically can't combine all different attacks in single combo (you remember the Batman games? those were combos) so you rinse and repeat the light combo and sometimes the heavy attack, followed by this or that power. It's even more cryptic than the souls game with the plot and the items and the secrets you can (won't) find....Scenery is nice most of the time and graphics are good but nothing crazy, especially considering how demanding the game is (compared to other games)It's an ok game, definitely not a masterpiece and I'll try to finish just because I don't like leaving stuff unfinished. I just don't consider it this crazy game everybody hyped it to be."
Negative,"Mixed...Pros: Great graphics, unique story line, controller support, and lots of bosses.Cons: Extremely repetitive boss fights, lots of button smashing, no meaningful content between boss fights.The game mechanics are pretty bad, why does the mana bar not refill when attacking enemies? makes 0 sense to nerf 50% of your in-game abilities.This game reads more like a 29.99 title than 59.99 imo.** Final Edit **Building on from my points above, I think this is a good game BUT not at the 59.99 USD price tag, and that's not even including the rip-off 9.99 deluxe version that comes with a couple items the devs probably put together in less than a day. At 29.99 - 49.99 this game makes sense, but not at it's current price tag. The mechanics are a serious problem with this game. For a game that is best experience on controller, why is the chaining of attacks so limited? Limiting the ability of attacks to be chained in interesting combos reduces the knowledge requirement of the game but also makes it feel like I'm button smashing half the time. The hitboxes on some bosses are completely off, bosses with more than 2 legs don't register hits properly even when auto-lock is enabled and I'm directly facing the enemy. The player guidance needs a serious overhaul, why create such massive maps but provide no mini-map, or expand the trails to include sub-quests? This is the main reason the game feels so disjointed, lots of content not properly connected from a narrative perspective. It would take the game from ""beat boss A, walk around killing pointless enemies to then beat boss B"" to ""Let's go on this quest to a side-story where I can gather an item with X significance which can make defeating Boss B more straightforward"". This would give players a clear direction, whether that is to do all the side quests or focus on the main story, right now unless you're aimlessly exploring every corner of the maps or watching a Youtube videos you won't easily find most side-quests. This is especially an issue since the game is so graphically detailed it's not like tunnels and wooded passageways are easy to spot. This game could have been a masterpiece, had the writers and devs spent a bit more time connecting the all the characters to the main story even if briefly and giving more substantive backgrounds to the bosses, without this background I'm left feeling like I'm fighting the same bosses with different skins.Conclusion:Good game, but overpriced and hard to follow. If money is no issue buy the game you'll enjoy it, otherwise wait for a sale and prioritize upgrading your PC to run this game smoothly."
Negative,i don't like the movement :)
Negative,Game crash right a few seconds after the beginning of the journey. It feels like the game does not playing nice with AMD Cards.
Negative,Game had terrible performance when it ran. Now it just constantly crashes while compiling the shaders.
Negative,"Doesn't feel complete. Lots of invisible walls. Map feels small. Not alot to do, or pick up. Weird progression through areas, bosses without explanation or story. Feels empty."
Negative,"Unable to customize dodge controls. Who locks down the dodge key. What was the decision? Lets make 80% of controls customizable, but not the most important one, the dodger key. Must have taken months of conversation to come up with this great idea. .....................Fix it and i will play."
Negative,I hate controller games
Negative,Fix the audio syncing error where the audio during cutscenes cuts out and delays from what is actually happening. I've tried everything to fix it and multiple other people experience this same issue.
Negative,"This game sucks.  All the bosses are just sponges to your stupid stick.  Graphics A+, gameplay F-."
Negative,"The game keeps crashing every five minutes after the prologue, again and again and again, which makes it unplayable. It is not yet in a state to be released."
Negative,"Game is beautiful , graphics amazing , yeah yeah.OK let's go with the problems:1 - Repetitive game-play2 - You die, try again, repeat, you die, try again , repeat, save point, (loop)3 - Lack of lore, objectivesIf you are in this stuff, go for it.I think is just boring after 2h"
Negative,"This game is meant to be watched and not played. I have genuinely found my breath taken away during cinematic moments of this game, but have also found myself wishing I was playing any other video game during the actual moments of gameplay. I don't know if elden ring and the dark souls series has just spoiled me but there are so many elements of the world exploration, side quest progression, and combat itself have left me either bored, frustrated, confused, or some combination of them. I'll list why I would not recommend this game in regards to each portion of my complaints.Gameplay and Combat: Everything poise breaks you. After fighting my 90th bat getting poked with a stick mid light attack finisher to be stunned and take my health bar in damage, wondering how a needle prick can knock a monkey swinging his massive staff with the force of a few tons, I started to hate the fact that you don't have poise. This is problematic because it puts an immense amount of pressure on you pressing the dodge button. Pressing the dodge button then forces you to time perfect dodges because often, if your dodge isn't perfect, your dodge won't function as a dodge at all and you'll lose health and your ability to continue your attack combo (a skill node I have had throughout my entire playthrough). The game feels unrewarding in both of these regards, it only rewards masterful play without even mentioning how incredibly likely it is that your strong attacks will straight up miss your target or leave you sitting in an animation to be hit. It just feels horrible, after 40 hours, I feel like I never want to use a strong attack and I never want to finish a light attack combo because I always need to dodge, ALWAYS. Tl;dr lack of poise to even the weakest enemies makes you feel overly reliant on dodging every enemy in the entire game. This forces you into slowed down combat and force feeds how you string attacks together. Furthermore dodging and strong attacking often leave you more vulnerable than advantageous. (The strong attacks are probably only 75% accurate, IF THAT against a target that moves at all) You end up feeling frustrated over half the time you press the dodge or strong attack button.Exploration: Invisible walls, but it's the entire map, but there isn't a map or mini-map either... This really has ruined several hours of my gameplay so far. The reason the invisible walls are particularly infuriating in Black Myth as opposed to any other game is that, the game DOES reward you for exploring. What I mean by that is, occasionally you'll see a tertiary path and find a secret or fun loot at the end of it. However, the game has visually designed hundreds of paths that look like you would be able to traverse them. Almost every rock, every arguably obvious path at the edges of the map, and every tree that you see is NOT MEANT to be climbed or jumped over. BUT there is a solid 5-10% chance that a sneaky winding path, or unorthodox parkour trail will actually lead you to something interesting. In practice, this just means your ramming your head into walls and jumping onto constructed walls, literally everywhere you go. You have no clue whether a path that looks legitimately obviously designed to lead you somewhere, is actually that at all. I really like to feel like I haven't missed anything while playing through games like dark souls/Black Myth/Sly Cooper/etc etc. but no other game in my memory has forced me to jump around like a maniac at walls that you cannot see. You can't even describe it as insanity either, because you'll randomly jump over a roof and end up in a secret area, or jump on a random rock that looks like every other rock and figure out it leads to a ""secret boss."" That leads me into the last point.The Side Questing: I think this game is heavily affected by translation issues so I will give this one a pass to some degree, but undoubtedly, if you find a key item or meet an npc that you want to progress, you're going to have to do some googling or spend multiple hours per item you find to figure out where the hell you need to go. I have looked up the first 5 secret bosses after trying my damnedest to figure out where an npc has gone or figure out where these key items that'd been in my inventory for tens of hours belong, only to realize that without googling, I would have likely never found their home. i think most games with secrets can be somewhat guilty of this, but within the game there's virtually no guidance whatsoever as to where npcs will be going or where key items belong. There was a singular npc that I can remember which told me roughly where they'd be going, and I STILL needed to look up where it was that they described because it was so obscure. The real reason I am mentioning this is because key items and npcs lead you down dead end trails that feel just like a waste of time, in hindsight. MAYBE if I didn't feel completely obligated to look up how to progress the sidequests or use the key items I would have been given a moment of epiphany, or an ""Ah hah! I figured it out, nice!"" moment but I was given nothing like that at all, and was mostly frustrated the entire time I was side questing.Tl;dr: The game doesn't feel good to play, combat is a chore and gatekeeps you from playing in a more nuanced way that similar games provide, exploration makes you ram your head into invisible walls for quite literally hours and hours and hours without any sense of sarcasm, and side questing/secret finding is WAY too obscure and incomprehensible for direction making you feel like the solutions to the ""puzzles"" are intentionally obscure and designed to waste time if you hadn't googled them.The game is phenomenally gorgeous and the way that it tells the story is really lovely, it's quite poetic and I love how all of the dialogue is spoken in a poetic/prophetic way. The game does an absolutely fantastic job orchesetrating/illustrating mythological creatures from Chinese history and storytelling in a really fantastic way, it's like your dreams are coming to life. The problem is just that the game is not functionally fun to play, for me, whatsoever. If you're looking for a purely cinematic experience and an exploration of Chinese mythology this game will still be a great experience because the gameplay elements that are lacking will fall to the wayside. If you find games that are overly gimmicky and challenging in ways that feel unrewarding, you will likely be furious while playing this game.Overall I had to stop playing the game because I was tired of running into walls and dying to having my pose broken by loose pebbles, or being roll caught for the 1350th time after feeling forced to dodge. I will personally be watching someone else suffer through a playthrough of this game on youtube because it feels like that's how this game was designed to be enjoyed.Solid 6/10 video game, 6 points of which entirely come from the graphics and storytelling elements of the game."
Negative,"Black Myth Wukong is a beautiful game that had its enjoyment diminished through a variety of clunky design choices and has a hollow narrative that is masked by its rich cultural nuances.It is without a doubt that the visuals and animations in this game are breathtaking with unique and fun challenging boss battles along with interesting move sets. This is not something that needs to be explored further. I will be doing more of a critical take to the game so then the same mistakes do not appear in Game Science's future releases (Thus the negative review).What needs to be addressed are the questionable design choices that, by themselves, can be tolerated, but put together, causes frustrating and clunky game-play.- Lack of auto rest at save point. Although not a giant issue, implementing this would have allowed a smoother game-play where you do not need to click rest at the save points to reset your status. There has been many times during my exploration where I have found a save point, traversed away, find a boss, use potions, and then realising that I am at half hp with no mana. - On the topic of save points, there is a specific debuff in one area that does not get reset after resting. This made fighting a certain boss especially frustrating since after each retry, one will need to wait for the debuff to clear in order to have a fair fight. This wait took around 1-2 minutes where the only thing to do is to twiddle your thumbs.The next few are design choices that individually, are fine but collectively, very frustrating.- Lack of map. This makes it hard to traverse but make for an interesting exploration experience. However, it does make it hard to find places where you may have missed.- Invisible walls. Given such beautiful scenery, it is frustrating that there are so many areas that look like it could be explored be blocked off with the boundaries of the map. This is actually one of the issues caused by having such beautiful visuals. It prevents you from intuitively knowing where places can be explored and what areas are completely out of reach, making you attempt to jump onto a platform only to be disappointed that it is inaccessible.- NPC positioning. Some NPCs are hidden away quite obscurely and sometimes found relatively late in a chapter making them easy to miss.- Most of the bosses are fun and some are an exhilarating challenge. This is because they are fair fights. Unfortunately, some bosses have an unfair abilities which causes you to die in a way that seems like dumb luck rather than lack of skill unless you have a specific item from a side quest.Now putting things together, a lack of map makes exploration interesting and, like the developers put it, increased an immersive experience. However, with invisible walls everywhere, traversing became a chore as I find myself continuously running into and bounced off wall after wall. This made some hidden areas hard to find since they are placed in areas where, after continuously ramming into wall, one could assume is another wall.Without a map, sometimes one can feel like they have explored everywhere already and decide to fight the final boss of a chapter only to see them use an ability which makes them seem unfair. But surely you have looked through every nook and cranny no? Turns out you missed a turn somewhere and missed an NPC quest line to give you an item to counteract the unfair ability. If the NPC starts closer to the start of the map on a main traversing location, it would be forgivable since you become aware of their existence and know to explore through their quest. This give you a better idea on whether or not you have explored through the entire map. - Some exotically shaped bosses, although interesting and have beautiful move sets, also have some annoying hit boxes. There are times where I find myself running as close as possible to a boss and performed a full combo only to have it completely miss due to the hit box and the space it takes up be different. Story wise, it is a sequel to Journey to the West, paying homage to the original material but completely neglecting its overarching theme and motif. Unfortunately, the game's story lacks depth and is void of any sort of meaningful development to the character you play and to those around you, apart from a selected few. Thus, it is also another victim of a Chinese animation/game narrative displaying a large variety of rich cultural elements without the depth and backbone to hold it together. AKA, the toppings without the bread.All in all, Black Myth Wukong was a visual spectacle but as a game and a story device, has many flaws which I am unable to give it a free pass on, especially because I want to love this game. As frustrating as some aspects were, I still had a decent experience (As can be seen from me 100% ing the game).6.5/10"
Negative,"Sooo as of right now for me its a thumbs down, 69.99 now, enjoy the game later. What i mean by that is from opening cut scene audio delay or none at all. Game play for me has been extremely laggy and freezes just moving through the map and entering into new areas. I mean the intro to the game the entire scene was broken with no audio and froze every few seconds.  Ive made it to chapter to at the time of writing this review and its been buggy/glitchy the entire time im on high end hardware and still having issues...might now be the same for everyone else, but for me its a no big dawg. sadly now updates have been pushed out at the time of this review. also if you've played souls like or Elden Ring or even Sekiro, this game is super easy compared to those."
Negative,"Crash after crash.  I can't get past the opening intro. I can't even get to the game play. The main menu even studders at 1080. Are you kidding me.  Audio cuts in & out.  And right to left speaker. When will they ever learn,  DO NOT PUT OUT A GAME THAT DOESN'T RUN!  I know the gaming industry is controlled by GREED.  But in that sense there losing money putting out a broken game, that will get a bad rep.   My Rig RTX 3070 i9-12900k 32 GB RAM.  Be warned..."
Negative,"Not impressed.  visually great.  but its bang head against wall on a boss, kill a few small guys.  Do it again.  I feel like nothing is out right now for people to spend time on so its huge.  Refunding.  been watching hours, not worth playing"
Negative,need to be optimized for certain parts of the game.. Hope to see some bugs cleared for the next patch before any plans of dlc comes
Negative,"u walk 5 meters bos fight.. take a piss boss fight, look around boss fight.. u want to quit game, boss  fiht.. fuck u dev"
Negative,"I wanted to play this game for the rich story in JTTW and the comparisons to GOW. However, what I ended up playing was more similar to ""souls-like"" than I wanted.As someone who doesn't know the inner details of JTTW, the storytelling was very disconnected. Though beautiful, I couldn't understand the importance of the ending cut scenes for each chapter, especially as they didn't really have any context to build from. The random characters that you meet throughout the game also don't tell you much. It has a similar ""storytelling"" mechanic in other souls-like games where item descriptions and journal entries fill in the gaps in the narrative.As the game progressed, there seemed to be more glaring issues with difficulty and general jankiness with combat. Many chapters have a secret item which makes the final boss of the chapter much easier, but nowhere in the game does it tell you that these items exist (which I believe is fundamental for making the game a more enjoyable experience). Many boss fights end up being a slog with not much reward due to the incredibly high HP that they have. Later chapters also turn into souls-like difficulty of learning 10+ move attack strings with a tiny opening to counterattack. It also doesn't help that many attacks have poor indicators, leading to spam dodge combat.If you are looking for a very very challenging game that is more like a fast paced, boss rushy souls-like than a GOW, this is for you. Otherwise, for an average or casual gamer, you will likely spend many frustrating hours trying to beat bosses just to progress the lackluster narrative."
Negative,Вообщем и целом обезьянье дерьмо
Negative,The game is just a God of war copy but they have added the sites of grace from Elden Ring.
Negative,the more you play the more this game becomes shit
Negative,"Games insanely hard, dont even post reviews but if youre a casual this game aint for you lmao, good luck. Shits hard, the first level is insane"
Negative,"Let's start with the positives, the game has good graphics. Moving on to the negatives, gameplay is mundane, strategy is brain dead legit just spam spells your way through the game.  Level design is mostly generic either wide open area's or 1 path that branches off occasionally.  Bosses are nothing of note of except for maybe 10 of the 80 and don't even get me started on how bullshit the final fight is.  If anyone cares; beat the game at around lvl 85.  Never touching this game again."

Negative,"Another souls clone with boring combat. Dodge, attack, dodge, dodge, attack, dodge, super attack. Same for every fight."
Negative,It's basically a boss rush game. You can't play 10 minutes without running into the next boss. Content between them is almost non existent.
Negative,It's crushing  at the beginning on my rx7600s
Negative,"Looks great, but plays like shit. Combat is shallow, then to make it even worse there are a bunch of gimmick bosses which just turn off pieces of your already limited kit."
Negative,The only thing good about this game is it's graphics
Negative,"Poorly designed levels, no map, cheap knockoff souls-like with combat that doesnt allow for blocks or dodges in all cases, shitty boss design in some areas, and damage sponge enemies at higher levels to artificially increase difficulty"
Negative,"Games that are better than this.Darksouls 1Darksouls 2Darksouls 3BloodborneDemon souls Nioh 1Nioh 2Sekiro  The game play is jank alot of what makes it smooth is locked behind being level 30+ which after you still have most of the same problems.Bosses feel like the same mob reskined the hit boxes are all over the place the camera is your main enemy. This game falls short of its price point.  The only reason i would recommend getting this game is if you like the Wukong. Not that you play as him tho...Maybe i expect to much from games now, there is so much similar content out there its hard to understand why they would try and make something worse."
Negative,"I ended up refunding after 1.5 hours. The game is great, but it's not for me. I was expecting something like God of War Ragnarok or the Jedi games. This game is a souls-like, whether the developers or journalists try to say otherwise. It may not be as unforgiving upon death, but the combat is very much souls like.I've tried DS1, DS3, Bloodbourne, Sekiro, and Elden ring and none-of them were for me. If you didn't enjoy these games, stay away from this one too. As much as I really wanted to play this, it's just not for me. If you don't enjoy souls-likes stay away,"
Negative,"essentially, if you like fighting bosses, and don't mind a few bad ones, its good.2/10 level design9/10 boss designBUT -extremely boring, tedious sections, with no reason to explore -sometimes poor performance that makes fights far less fun-the ""challenging"" aspect is somewhat tedious and artificial instead of fairIf you're looking for something a bit easier than FromSoft titles, this game is probably perfect.If you're looking for something as rich and challenging as Elden Ring? You will be sorely disappointed. The hardest thing about this game is keeping a solid framerate."
Negative,"This game is not for casual gamers. It's too hard. You have to make your way through small areas with a boss to fight at the end of each path. There are a few mobs to fight over and over again in order to level up; it gets old very quickly. When it comes down to getting through to the next area, you have to fight and get killed by the boss over and over until you can get lucky and beat them. It's very frustrating. It seems that Game Science took a page out of the Dark Souls playbook; making it annoyingly difficult to just walk through a main quest line like a 'fun' RPG. This game is not fun and only enjoyable to people who love a constant challenge."
Negative,every enemy is so strong but we don't have enough power every time we need to play from beggining to get that power this game sucks
Negative,"Jogo mais bosta de todos, so tem grafico."
Negative,"Simply cannot recommend this game in its current state.The visuals are amazing but its painfully obvious that the devs didn't bother testing this on more modern hardware configurations. Until such a time that it is optimized further, I cannot recommend this.I'd refund, but I spent too much time trying to troubleshoot the game, and steam refuses to issue a refund."
Negative,"I am a huge history nerd, I love Journey to the West. I was totally looking forward to this game, and I cannot in good conscience recommend it in it's current form.The game stutters very often, so bad that it desyncs the audio and ruins any chance of the story catching me. The stuttering also persists through gameplay, even on the lowest settings. I am running well above what the system requirements are, and I've read several posts having to deal with people who even have 4080s and have the same problems I do. I will remove this review if this gets patch. But as of now, don't bother wasting your money."
Negative,"I am still going to finish the game because I paid for it but the difficulty is enough to put lots of players off, I hate souls games but the story of this game is keeping me here. I have enjoyed it somewhat but the constant boss fight to boss fight isnt exactly inspiring. inbetween those fights its quite boring and the ai mechanics are just cheesy at best."
Negative,"Starts of impressive but the longer you play, it peeves with:- the lack of animation cancelling- unresponsive controls- tons of invisible walls and shallow exploration - basic level design - some poorly telegraphed boss attacks- stripped basic kit such as resuming combo after a dodge for the sake of ""progression"""
Negative,"Massive souls fan, got good a long time ago, and the game runs fine on my rig. Here's why I still won't recommend it: It's boring.This game plays like Dynasty Warriors straight up, there's essentially no difference except in DW your cooldowns are based on meter gain, in this game it's just time. You mash light a few times, hit heavy when you can, and spam your moves.Okay, this game IS a boss rush. Do not listen to people telling you there's ""tons"" of exploration, listen there's SOME, but tons is cap. The trailers make the game look super fun, but while playing you're almost always just mashing square. This genre is overdone, not because these companies can't do better, they simply aren't, they're getting by with the bare minimum. Trust me, the game doesn't look like it's the minimum, but essentially what they've done is take a bunch of mid, weak enemies, and put them on the map, they intentionally funnel you towards a boss, and that's it. You do it again. I only have 2 hours in the game but I came across 5 different bosses in that time span just walking forward, and even when revisiting areas, it's for no reason. Everything about this game other than the appearance, is extemely dated. This gameplay is about the same level as that crappy Korra game that came out on PS4 for $15. Do you want to know the difference between this and Elden Ring? Elden Ring has 308 weapons in 31 weapon classes with 213 spells, allowing you to mix and match and do whatever you want, in Wukong, there's 3 ""stances"" on your weapon that change your heavy attack, there's skill trees that introduce novel concepts like running attack and making your dodge actually responsive (Dark Souls 2). This game is nothing special imo, other than the look. I'm just gonna go watch a webseries on Journey to the West to learn the lore and let people keep getting tricked by these bot reviews, I'm good on it broski. This is a glorified tech demo."
Negative,"I was skeptical about this game from its very first announcement (mostly because I thought it would never be released), but after seeing numerous positive reviews and hearing good feedback from my co-workers, I decided to give it a try.I’ve heard people comparing this game to GoW (by the way, have you played GoW?). Sure, there are some ""epic"" scenes, but I wouldn’t say the storytelling is particularly strong. In fact, there doesn’t seem to be any consistent narrative flow - just disjointed parts here and there. This could be because I’m not familiar with Chinese culture, but it’s worth mentioning that I never expected strong storytelling. I’ve always viewed this as a typical Souls-like game, where you're left to investigate and piece things together on your own.Personally, I didn’t enjoy the sheer number of boss fights. I get that some players will appreciate the challenge, but for me, the amount was excessive. Almost every Souls-like game follows a similar formula: 20-30 minutes of exploring a location, fighting NPCs, collecting resources, and then a boss fight. However, in this game, the NPCs are extremely weak, and you’re constantly thrown into boss battles, one after another. (The biggest streak for me - 4 bosses in a row, but I think it will be more in a late game?)For those who really enjoy a tough challenge and love Souls-like games, this one will be right up their alley. But for me, it doesn’t even come close to GoW. I don’t understand why people are comparing these two completely different games. God of War had impeccable balance, a variety of gameplay mechanics, and flawless storytelling. It was engaging to explore the world, while this game just didn’t do it for me.In summary: from a gameplay perspective, no doubts, it is a really good try, but I found this game boring for me personally. If you’re not willing to spend 30-40 hours learning boss patterns, this game isn’t for you. There’s no good balance between relaxing and intense moments during the fights—you’re under pressure the entire time (except maybe in the early stages). I don’t want to invest my time in that.UPD: Although my overall experience was mostly negative, I want to pay respect when it's due, like certain boss interactions — grabbing you when you're on top of your staff or stealing your healing potion — those moments were really dope."
Negative,"Game is a boring chore with odd difficulty scaling. Why am I slicing through the tier 1 enemies with a few basics but the local boss is like 10x more difficult. This isn't exactly an issue as is however it is a proof that NO ONE REALLY BOTHERED to BALANCE THE EXPERIENCE, this would NOT be a PROBLEM if the game had a difficulty slider but it does not.Exploration is odd, so so many invisible walls and seemingly easy to reach places you just cannot get to for no good reason, also the game has no map, big oops.To sum it up not once have I felt like I had fun playing this and I do not want to play it ever again.Normally I'd just say that souls like games are not for me and move on but this game has insane rating spike due to the current drama so I feel obligated to tone it down just a bit.refunded."
Negative,Perfect example of what happens when you put all of your budget into visuals
Negative,"This game looks like actual garbage no joke. I'm running RTX 4090 with maxed settings and it looks like a blurry, ugly, washed out mess with TONS of ARTIFACTING. Most boring intro fight i've ever played. And NO HDR."
Negative,gamme nhu con cac
Negative,I like the game
Negative,Crashes after prologue every time .Literally unplayable at the moment
Negative,glorified button pusher ...
Negative,"The GRINDING needed to defeat most bosses is just NO FUN.Be ready to die more than 100 times to beat the bosses, for some, double or triple that, its just too much, I cannot live to play this.The combat is not so well balanced or fun to justify it!The graphics are the BEST, the story is different.Wont recommend unless you  are aiming to live to master this and be very frustrated for the unfairness in some mechanics and glitches.DO NOT RECOMMEND IT IS UNFAIRLY HARD."
Negative,"Overhyped. Combat doesn't feel as tight, as it does in games from FromSoft. Not even close. Graphics are not bad, but constant hiccups and performance issues are too noticeable. I'd give it a 5/10."
Negative,Performance issues on PC make this game unplayable....
Negative,This game seems fun but its ass
Negative,No ultra-widescreen support. Disappointing.
Negative,Poorly optimized game that is made only for DLSS cards. Even with a 6950 XT my fps drop below 60 (Low graphics). Not a good experience.
Negative,The 2nd zone is some of the worst designed dark souls ripoffs I've ever played. With the addition of a final boss that breaks the camera and requires balls to the wall tactics for the final phase. One of the most over hyped games I've ever played.
Negative,"I made the mistake of buying this game because I thought it would have something unique or exciting to offer, but no, its mid. Just another unoriginal souls-like with unresponsive controls & unsatisfying combat. Everything outside the bosses is boring and during combat, It rarely feels like you're even making contact with your hits. People I guess love this game because the studio is creepy and there are no pronouns for whiny gamers to shit themselves over. Idk, but If you're really curious and you want ANOTHER souls like for some reason, then do you. Its not terrible, but I just can't recommend it at full price these days. Especially with its performance issues. I regret not waiting for this to come down in price/10"
Negative,The combat is mediocre because it ends up being all dodging and left clicking and the worst is poorly designed bosses that inevitably drain 40% of your health which you can't do anything about or bosses that never stop attacking and have an extremely small window of time where you can attack only for them to start their next combo where you have to wait another half minute to attack again. Rarely did I really enjoy a boss but when I did I usually got it on the first try and the bosses I didn't get on the first try were often the worst bosses the game could offer you and would throw bad principles and techniques at you such as reducing your stamina by 90 and killing you instantly if you didn't dodge everything perfectly.The game is okay overall but you can tell it's their first release in the genre.
Negative,Lords of the Fallen is a bad gameWo Long: Fallen Dynasty is a bad gameNioh is also a bad gameBUT Black Myth: Wukong is a masterpiece?Are you kidding me? Black Myth: Wukong is much worse than each of these games because it's a stupid corridor clicker))
Negative,"I guess I just don't vibe with this game. Got it for free when I bought a laptop, so, it's whatever. I would definitely have returned it otherwise. Movement feels clunky. I don't really understand the story, who I am supposed to be, what my motivation is, or why I should care. Combat seems...not fun. The world is very on rails while looking open, yet I still didn't really know where to go, what to do, why I should collect things, etc. I don't think it's a bad game, it's just not for me."
Negative,"*edit after finished 3 chapters with 100% journal completion: no change to the ratings unless this game gets discounted to $30-40. - Almost blinded by the light and shade in chapter 2 and 3.- Its combat is definitely not comparable with other games around $60. Weird target lock and still way too familiar movements.===========**Graphics: 10/10**  The visuals are overwhelmingly beautiful, but they end up detracting from the overall gameplay experience.**Map Design: -10/10**  This is one of the worst map designs I’ve ever seen. In a game without a traditional map for navigation, there should be enough visual cues to guide players along the main path and hint at hidden areas. Unfortunately, this game’s map, though aesthetically pleasing, is practically useless. It’s difficult to tell where you can and can’t go, and everything looks so similar that it’s hard to distinguish between explored and unexplored areas. Locating enemies is a challenge due to the cluttered environment. It doesn’t feel like I’m playing a game; it feels more like I’m struggling to survive in the wilderness.**Combat: 5/10**  The combat is average. Bosses' movements all look famiiar, and perfect dodging feels useless. There's also a slight but noticeable delay between key inputs and the corresponding actions.**Overall Experience**  Negative experience so far given how heavily the map design weighs in such kind of games. Will keep trying for another couple of hours to see if there is any overturn.minor comments: In 2024, there’s a $60 game that doesn’t support mouse side buttons? Unbelievable."
Negative,Game looks great. That's all.Most of enemy encounters are designed to cause you pain by setting up tons of shooters behind one or two melee enemies.Battle camera is just bad - when enemy is moving it lags behind. Bigger bosses are not tracked properly at all witch leads to lack of visibility of their animation to react to.Fights are just a chore with how it is easy to interrupt your combo just by gust of wind and enemies transforming to unmovable block of stone during their attacks. This is really infuriating during boss fights where you get slapped by quick attack that was started and performed during half of your animation that you cannot break with dodge.Weapon crafting is straight up lacking - two 'paths' to chose from accumulating to total of 6 weapon variants.
Negative,"It starts out good then quickly becomes a nightmare. After 8.5 hours of trying , failing, grinding out levels, to level 26, I still can not beat the Whiteclad Nobel. Basically the final level 1 boss. Why did the developers have to make that boss so powerful that you can't win, can't advance and can't enjoy the rest of the game. if you can not beat that boss you can not advance in the game. I'm not the only one, Youtube is full of the same stories.  It's a bad set up when no matter how  many levels you get (even adding 10 levels) you still can't gain enough ""power"" to best him.  I'm done. The fun is gone, such a shame. Save the money till it's 75% off then try it if you want."
Negative,"animation delays and hard bosses keeps repeating on the same level, guess souls like game is not for me."
Negative,"Good monkey, Horrible PC port... Key presses are being ignored"
Negative,"i have a great computer. i am able to play and run any game you can think of. this game no matter what i do just randomly crashes. i have done everything on my side to help it run better ( redownload, update drivers, update BIOS, run in cap. mode, cap frames, run in medium/low quality, etc...), this game is will not stop randomly crashing. it like oh you touched invisible wall? crash. you are fighting a major boss with high graphical load no crash. it makes no sense."
Negative,"Edit: 53hrs and 74% of the achievements complete- This game is sadly a hard pass even thought the story is great and the game is beautiful. Its a hard pass because the main story bosses have some of the worst cheez mechanics Ive ever played in ANY game, including all the from Software titles. You do not make a good boss fight by having the fight last 20+ mins. You do not make a good boss fight when the boss has over 10+ combo moves that they just constantly chain one into another into another into another, only to have a tenth of a second window to do maybe one hit. One does not make a good boss fight buy having the boss read player inputs and dodge player attacks IN THERE RECOVERY ANIMATIONS. One does not make a good game when the input lag is so bad I can clearly see the icon of the medicine flashing as if its being used but nothing. Ones does not make a good game when you are punished heavily in the vast majority of the fights when using smash stance heavy attacks because the wind up animation is literally longer than any NPC's recovery animation.This game would be amazing but these things I have mentioned plus many more things I didn't even mention keep it from being one.The game would be good if every boss didn't just sit on the wall of the arena. Also garbage mechanics that completely obscure your vision when the game relies heavily on visual qs from the boss does not make a hard game, it makes a cheeze boss fight that is just not fun."
Negative,"Spent an hour just tweaking graphics to get it to run.  When I finally did, well, underwhelming to say the least.  Looks like an Unreal 5 tech demo.  Combat is uninteresting and nothing in the skill tree makes me excited to level up.  Oh boy, attacks do slightly more damage.  I can stand on my stick now."
Negative,One question: how did the entirety of chapter 3 make it past any kind of quality check? how?!Game is pretty good but chapter 3 completely ruined it for me.Sadly by the point you get there you are well over 2 hours in and refunding is no longer an option.Oh yea and input reading is just a mechanic that should not be in any wannabe souls-like game like this one...
Negative,"Runs poorly for me. Audio and visual doesn't match with each other, they voice acting is pretty meh. Didn't play much because the game is just unplayable for me. Got a decent pc that can run modded Baldur's Gate 3 on highest settings but this game is too unstable."
Negative,Crashes every single time
Negative,"nothing but bosses and they get progressively harder, nothing to build on before the next boss, kinda lame, graphics are great."
Negative,im not playing as zaddy wukong :(
Negative,"pretty mid, better play Sekiro"
Negative,"Apart from the obvious fantastic graphics and fun combat (during boss fights) it's incredibly boring, lackluster in exploration/world building/ narrative and about anything else an open world should be."
Negative,as of right now i don't recommend getting this game unless u have some type of super pc because there's know way i prerecord the game and have parts that are in the requirements to run this game smoothly and my game wont even allow me to get to the main menu before crashing feels like i just wasted my money
Negative,The game has definitely souls-like difficulty. Of course there is nothing to lose after you died but it is extremely hard to continue. There 91 bosses in the game. They must bring difficulty settings to the game. I don't like to spend my 1.5 hours to dodge perfectly. I am decent player and I want to enjoy the game and the atmosphere after a hard day at work.
Negative,"All you do in this game is fight bosses, then fight some more bosses, and then after all that you fight EVEN MORE BOSSES. Having to overcome a boss just to 5 seconds later have to overcome another with no breathing room or good reasoning for doing it is tiring, eventually you (me) might become quite apathetic towards it and lose motivation to fight them. This game took everything i don't like about Elden Ring and made it in to a video game. I don't know how they manage this but it's more vague and confusing than Elden Ring is. My character has no personality, no voice, nothing. And this would be fine if i made this character myself, then i could use my imagination and roll with it, but i didn't make this character, the game did, and the character they made is very boring and i know nothing about him.But hey the game is really pretty, and the gameplay is satisfying to pull off, and so far i have run in to 1 boss that was kinda fun out of like a million though."
Negative,"Much of the game is very fun I will admit but being a fan of dark souls style games with very challenging but clever and fun boss fights many of this game's harder bosses are only hard due to incredibly cheap and lazy design choices. It is NOT a matter of ""git gud"", anyone who tells you that knows jack sh!t about good boss design. Many bosses use unavoidable cutscenes to inflict damage that cannot be avoided a very lazy and dumb desing choice. The core combat is fun and the dodging is often very fun as well. The level design can be a bit all over the place and a lack of a map was really lazy as well. The story is just OK nothing great and the leveling system is good but not great. This game is not anywhere near as good as a Fromsoft game but it still has fun moments but also has a TON of lazy design choices that really start to ruin the fun after a while. It also has a lot of performance issues due to it being an unreal engine game. Lots of shadder studder and frame pacing issues. I'm playing on a 4090 so my card should be killing this game but even on non max settings the frame rate can really be all over the place with really bad stuttering. If you are dying for a souls like this game isn't awful but just know that it's far from the quality of a From game. If you can look past the just ok combat and really lazy boss fights it has some fun to offer just not nearly as much as I was hoping for. Especially considering how easy most boss fights are. The only hard ones rely of really cheap large ground coverage animations and spells that are very hard to avoid with skill and simply require you to memorize the patterns. Very lazy stuff."
Negative,"The game is visually very impressive, and many of the bosses have really interesting pattern design to them.  However, in the end the game just didn't do it for me.  This isn't a strong ""avoid at all costs"" style opinion; I think there are people out there that would find this game fun due to the strength of its visuals and the context of its story.  If you're also a person that doesn't often play this style of game, I don't know if you'd also share many of my concerns.  But, for me, as a long time action game player, there were a few things that generally turned me off.1) The controls of the game are in a number of places inconsistent in their responsiveness.  Breakpoints in combo chains can sometimes be frustrating, especially when you are trying to use the baseline counter system of the game.2) The game is quite linear and features an exceptionally large number of invisible walls.  It's often quite unclear whether you can actually are meant to climb up a location or not.3) More of the attack tells than I would like are based on memorization of pattern than on attack recognition.4) The baseline combo often just doesn't feel that good?  Since you never fundamentally change weapons you'll for the entire game be working off of the same 5 attack string, and the 4th attack of that string is almost universally the point where the enemies will stop flinching and counter attack you.  The consistency of this pattern was so high I could just presume this was the case for every new enemy I foguth.5) The game features a decent number of encounters where you have multiple basic enemies attacking you at the same time, and the combat system doesn't feel super well equipped to dealing with those situations.Overall I do think this is an impressive game in a number of respects, I just didn't enjoy my time with it."
Negative,Game seems good but is horribly un-optimized. 3070ti is struggling to run this on medium settings. Maybe wait until they fix the performance issues before you buy.
Negative,unable to remap keys WTF???
Negative,not optimised and wierd resolution problem even on the highest its not good
Negative,"The story is a drastic and disappointing twist on the Monkey King legend. It's filled with meaningless conspiracy theories that don’t add any value. The background and logic are poorly developed, leaving the story fragmented and incoherent. The fighting system, which seems to be a blatant attempt to mimic several games, falls short and feels like an unpolished, incomplete copy. Overall, the experience is frustrating and lacks the depth and originality it needs."
Negative,"Looks like it has an amazing story line and well polished gameplay, but without a difficulty slider I'm unable to progress past the Whiteclad Noble boss.Such a shame because this game was marketed as ""not soulslike"" but here we are, another oppressively difficult game impossible to enjoy for those with a life.If you're looking for a game you can come home from work to enjoy and play, this isn't it.This is easily the worst good game I've ever encountered."
Negative,"over-hyped. cannot play the game just to enjoy the story cus the bosses glitch out of the arena and godmode kill you.. some insanely hard bosses, some retarded ass animation locks, and even some maps with no boundaries, where you would get knocked out of the map and die over and over again. Only stupid game designers would come up with this, would NOT RECOMMEND SPENDING 70 BUCKS ON THIS CRAP. if it was 20 maybe go ahead and buy it."
Negative,"the game looks amazing and performs really well technically and i love the setting of monkey.the combat is fun,fluid and i have thoroughly enjoyed the game up until the last boss in chapter 6.i have now been stuck on this boss for a total of 24 hours of actual game time and have come to the conclusion this game is unfinishable for me at least.i got the game free through an nvidia promotion so thats a bonus but i would actually be furious if i had paid real money for something i cant completer.if you like extremely difficult games then you may like it but i cant in good conscience recommend this to the general gamer."
Negative,This game is a target for unemployed persons to keep them busy and is not the target game meant for people who have time limits or anything else rewarding to do. This game is two pegs above Sekiro /Souls /Ring games in being difficult. I am normally a glutton for punishment. This is NOT fun at all and I fell bad for falling for the hype.  You felt something after beating a boss in those games. After beating a boss in this game its so emotionless its wild. I attempted my refund after the White Noble fight double phase fight. 4 hours have been spent on 4 bosses and I cannot defend spending any more time on this game when other games have a better story to be delivered and have decent scaling levels of punishment. I would rather beat my own D**k in with a hammer than continue playing it.
Negative,"Not a bad game. Great looking, fun combat (for a little while). Some fun bosses. None of the bosses were particularly memorable, but I did have fun for a while before I just got tired of it sometime in late chapter 3. The game just doesn't have enough variety to carry it beyond maybe ~20 hours. To be clear, no matter what anyone says, this is clearly heavily inspired by Souls games. Rechargeable flask, stamina meter, bonfires, hard-hitting enemies and bosses. The only core feature it's missing is dropping ""souls"" on death, which is a nice omission IMO. If you don't like that style of game, you won't like this. If you do like souls games, you might like this. Just know it's not to the level of Dark Souls.The map design is awful. Very few landmarks, no map. It's very easy to get lost. After getting frustrated in chapter 1, I started using an online map, but it was still hard to figure out where I was. This is the absolute worst part of the game.Exploration isn't fun. You can get some decent stuff via exploring, but it just doesn't feel good. This is really a result of the terrible maps.Don't even get me started on the invisible walls everywhere. Any chance the game might have had to make exploration fun is ruined by an invisible wall in your way. Think you can jump up on that platform or rock? Nah.Combat is very repetitive. It's fun for the first one and a half or so chapters, but there's really no evolution in how the game plays. You can upgrade your weapon, but it's still the same weapon with the same moveset. There are 3 ""stances"", but they add very little. I was confused at first when I changed stances and the light attack was exactly the same. The only different is heavy attacks, so calling them stances is a stretch. I ended up using the one with the longest reach because you can charge your attack and get a free hit on the terrible enemy AI. Speaking of, the AI has literally no pathfinding capability. It has no idea how to go around obstacles of any kind. All it knows is to run at you in a straight line. As an example, there's an area with prison cells. You can hit the enemies to aggro them through the bars. Well, there can be a prison cell with a wide open door and bars on either side, but the AI doesn't know to go through the door, so will just keep running face first into the bars for a free kill. The bosses are one of the few redeeming qualities of the game, and there are a ton of them. Unfortunately, after fighting 20-30+ bosses, they all start to feel the same. I can only really remember one boss from early game, but that is only because I was under powered and died to him a bunch. He's really nothing special and fights the same as all the others. The exception is the ""main"" bosses at key points and the end of chapters. These guys are pretty fun, but unfortunately there are only a handful of them. The game would have been better served with cutting down the number of bosses and improving the fodder enemies found in the world. Which, by the way, very few of the enemies pose any sort of threat. They're just filler until you get to the next boss.Overall, it's a pretty disappointing title. It is a beautiful game (ran on a 4090) with decent combat, but there are too many big problems. The map design is downright awful, the combat has very little variety with the same moveset throughout the game, and the majority of bosses feel exactly the same. It's not a bad game, but it's not really good, either."
Negative,"So, before I continue, this game is basically about 7.5/10 for me. About the level of dark souls 2, which is kinda bad, comparable to ds1, but better than any other game came out that year. Basically somewhat disappointing, hence why a thumbdown. Good stuff:GraphicsEnemy and boss varietyEnvironment detailsGuiStuff to complain about:Firstly, the combat resembles me more of DMC than soulslike. Many enemies and bosses are just damage sponges which often are avoided by chance rather than by skill. Except that in DMC you had many different weapons, and here you just basic attack your way through almost every non-boss encounter. Secondly, the exploration/non-boss area design vary from mediocre to atrocious. Inivisible walls are everywhere, and lots of environment is very same-looking. There's lots of completely empty spaces in latter chapters. This is the first soulslike game which I REALLY wanted to have a map because otherwise navigating through it is terrible. Lastly, the plot is completely nonsensial. It feels like all cutscenes were done some time after most of the game was finished as the game clearly was not designed to tell any sort of compelling easily relatable story. Looking back at all of that, I don't wanna say it's a bad game, especially for a first studio's game, but I also can't deny my mild disappointment and I probably wouldn't buy it for a full price if I were presented with a choice."
Negative,"combat is VERY clunky, almost monster hunter-ish. Not really worth the buy, get Nioh 2 instead"
Negative,"trash game, full of buggs, has the same broken dodge glitch like in dark souls 2.and on top of that i can't even play the game anymore since the update and it also doesn't lert uninstall. weirsd chinese software i suppose"
Negative,Received for free as a bundle with my brand new gaming computer and graphics card. Prone to crashing every five minutes. I give up.
Negative,"Overwhelmingly positive reviews Steam players??? What am I missing. This game is terrible. Lacks a TON of content, puts a new meaning to grinding, you are ALWAYS under leveled for all the activities. Horrible, just so boring."
Negative,"beside the good story line, the gameplay, moveset, lv system, quest bugs ... so lame and repeat all the time ( im rushing boss ng+++ for unlocking the true ending and giant shigandang only for achivements and its a pain in the ass."
Negative,There is no blocking ability during any combat. Who thought this was a good idea? You are sitting duck against aggressive enemies. Yes you can pull off the perfect dodge here and there but it's beyond frustrating and just plain stupid. Not worth purchasing right now with the bugs anyway. Best wait for a discount sale.  No blocking during fights....
Negative,Level design lacks imagination.Invisible walls everywhere that restrict exploration to a tunnel.Boss arenas are simple shapes with no interactions.The combat is mediocre with the full combo unlocked.NOT more than 20 euro.
Negative,"I have a high end computer and this game runs horrible with constant freezing, v-sync issues, and the gameplay is a bit lack luster. The combat is very slow and seems more like a button masher at times. I believed it would be like a new Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice but black myth is nowhere near that level. It seems like it will be much easier... sadly..   I don""t believe this game should be 60 dollars. Maybe 20 to 30 at the very most. The prelude skipped so much I missed a lot of the fight scene. With every perfect dodge the game freezes for about 10 to 15 seconds.  I restarted the game hoping after a freeze start it would play better. Once I hit new game it stopped right before he jumps off the mountain to confront the giant oni and after 10 mins he was still standing there. I hope you all enjoy it more than I did. 07"
Negative,"Most dog fucking shit game ever, how tf do the boss never get stunned by heavy moves at all, how do they predict where im dodging every fucking time, like dog shit, whoever created this should fucking recall this shit ass game."
Negative,"Game looks great, lots of polish on the surface, The more you play the more you experience the jankiness of it though. Camera is terrible and they like to mess with visibility on top of the bad camera. Pathing issues (sometimes on rails, sometimes not, bosses moving outside of arena). I could go on but its hardly worth the effort. Mediocre gameplay really wrecked an otherwise beautiful game."
Negative,"dogshit souls rip off, horrible game design, don't buy it, pirate it when it gets cracked"
Negative,Not bad except for all the crashing.
Negative,to much use of the stamina bar and a perfect dodge system with no timing bar.
Negative,"Game feels far too linear for the current era of gaming, you don't really feel like you can explore or go anywhere. There's very little early on in the way of gear upgrades which makes it feel relatively boring to kill bosses for not much reward. The game is fun at it's core but is just too limited for my liking. Healing and dodging feel really janky and like a bit of an afterthought which unfortunately doesn't really work for this type of game."
Negative,"The game is really good except in chapter 6, due to the team in China working too hard , they lost the Fc minds. the team designers make some part of chapter 6 unplayable because you have to land on the stupid bug called Feng Tail General although i have all stamina 400 and health 400 plus. in a few second and hang on or it kicks you off , i have tried for 6  hours, i finally gave up. to me this is Fc stupid of the developer. I uninstalled the game because this stupid thing make me not able to go forward with the story. Very disappoint it. total waste of money ."
Negative,"THIS GAME IS DEFINITELY NOT AND WILL NOT BE GOTY!(Before you read this, be aware that I've finished every fromsoftware game except DS2, and I've also finished Lies of P and Sifu, so my review is relevant and my opinion on difficulty is absolutely spot on. Yes I also finished the Elden Ring DLC and killed Consort Radahn)PRICE AND LENGTH OF GAMEPLAY:If you want to buy this game, I recommend waiting for a discount. Anyway, I think the price on steam with a wink of an eye corresponds to the length of the gameplay (about 50 hours to finish?).POSITIVITY AND TWEAKING THE GAME TO PERSONAL PREFERENCE:I'll probably start by saying that one of the most positive things about this game is the impeccable graphics and art of this game. Also the environment is very beautiful and fits the game. Unfortunately, this is the first and last big positive thing for me. Too bad this game is not run as open world. I think if it had a similar style of gameplay to Elden Ring for example (levelling that would make sense and thus you could even lower the difficulty to your preference). Because there is a minimum of quests in the game and 0 interaction with the characters and the world overall. In later playthroughs, I didn't even enjoy exploring anything at all because 90% of it is a copypasta of chests from God of War or some useless item that you use once anyway. I've listed everything that pi*** me off in 26h below. STORY:I don't know if this game is what a normal mortal would seek out. The game is absolutely sous-like, if you thought it was an RPG or just a story game with boss elements you are sorely mistaken. Yes there is probably a story, although it is interpreted in abbreviated versions and if you don't have enough knowledge about the journey to the west or Wukong you will be absolutely lost and everything will feel like a random generator of cutscenes, stories and random dialogue. Also, another thing that is quite funny and sad is that the main character talks at the beginning of the prologue, has a conversation and you can empathize with the role of the monkey, but after the prologue he doesn't say half a word in the cutscenes or in the entire gameplay, which I played in 26h, not even a single sentence. He comes across as a character with no emotion, no zest for life and comes across as an NPC.GAMEPLAY:Now for the gameplay, I have 26 hours of gameplay at the moment and I'm about halfway through the game (chapter 4 of 6). As an avid fan of soulsborne games fromsoftware, I can say that the difficulty of the main bosses in this game is absolutely over the top and the boss attacks are not balanced with your character at all even if you go through the entire location at 100%. You'll be giving minimal damage to the bosses and it will feel like you're tickling the boss in quotes with a stick. Yes there are spellashes and other easing mechanics in the game that you can invoke, though these mechanics are limited so it only makes the game a little easier. If you've ever played Sekiro or Lies of P you'll have experienced the game rewarding you for ""perfect"" dodges or parries in quotes. Anyway, in this game, you're more likely to pray that you give a perfect dodge or else you'll get ridiculous damage or you'll dodge normally, but you won't have time to give an attack because the bosses spam attacks like absolute spammers. I'd also like to point out that some bosses' hitboxes are absolutely but absolutely fucked up.  This game isn't difficult in that the bosses have unpredictable attacks, but some bosses are designed to punish you for playing the game at all. It seems to me that the developers have absolutely not played the game since chapter 2. It also annoys me that you have 0 windows to attack, so you pray the boss doesn't start spamming. Sometimes it's really just a running simulator and waiting for abilities to charge up or for lives to regenerate with one of the armors. I'm also sorry there isn't at least a minimap. Because 90% of the game you're wandering around trying to find your way to either the boss or something else. Another annoying thing is the invisible walls around the map, which look really weird and shouldn't be there at all. Also another one I don't know if it's a bug, but sometimes it happens that I press the heal button on the gamepad but the monkey just doesn't heal, I don't understand if it's a bug or some feat that wants to piss you off again. Also, one thing that annoys me is that you play as a damn monkey but you have no place to use the jump, which is probably just made as a useless part of the movement anyway. In fact, there is no parkour in the game, nor any options to make you feel like a monkey, which is primarily supposed to be fast, able to jump and be flexible. In Sekiro, for example, it's fun to explore the surrounding buildings and other parts of the terrain using a double jump or at least a grappling hook, and the gameplay then is fun and you get to put yourself in the role you're supposed to. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. Here you're happy to have dodge work sometimes and use jump very minimally.CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS:I probably wouldn't recommend this game to people who like themselves and don't want to spend even 3 hours on one boss. If you really enjoy boss rush this is the game for you. From my point of view, I would consider this game very average and not innovative or a game of the decade at all. I won't give a numerical rating here because it wouldn't give anything away."
Negative,"As someone who's played Dark Souls, Sekiro, Code Vein, Lies of P, Nioh, and almost every game of this genre.... I'm sorry but this game did not hit.It is BEAUTIFUL and I think the integration of Chinese mythology is very cool. Great character designs and themes. But the combat is weird, to the point that I'm shocked a how much praise this game is getting. The enemies have ZERO tells, but it isnt even a bad thing because they're so easy. I got to the second boss (real boss, not the minis) without dying once which felt weird compared to other games like the ones I mentioned before. I felt like I couldnt be strategic or precise with my combos or actions and there was no repercussions for playing sloppy (spam the weak combo while taking damage until the enemy dies), everything was almost too fast paced.I'm actually quite upset that I didnt like this game. I dont hate the game and I would suggest anyone who likes action rpgs to try it. Maybe my hopes were too high."
Negative,"im giving it a thumbs down because i didnt know this was going to be one of those obnoxious overly tedious souls games. MONKE LOOK GOOD! yes monkey does look amazing, but the gameplay. Its so tedious. Everytime you die to a boss you have to rekill alllll of the little enemies along the way and get cheap shot by ai forcing you to fight a boss with lesser health. I was hoping this was gonna be more on the casual side. It even says when you first launch the game to grab a controller and lay back and relax. But thats just not this type of game.I want to like it and play it more but i dont see the core gameplay getting any better only more tedious as time goes on past the point of no longer being able to refund. *die to boss 50x and every time you run back you also have to fight the useless npc enemies along the way that cheap shot your health* Tedious frustration doesnt make a game good, making the player badass is what makes a game good. Im not one of the people that feels literally any kind of satisfaction after killing a boss in these souls games. Cause they are just not fun. Shouldve been on the more casual side, wouldve been the perfect game for a more casual feel to it. Amazing visuals, big bad ass bosses, lots of magic and stuff, skill trees. its just ughh the thought of actually playing these tedious souls games and their mechanics its so cheesy"

Negative,"This is far from optimized. The FSR implementation is awful, so unless you have a supercomputer, don’t even bother buying it you’ll likely be stuck with a game that’s nearly impossible to run smoothly with native res."
Negative,Meh. Also my 4090 couldn't get more than 70 FPS on full settings on Samsung Odyssey G9. Shameful.
Negative,"This game is good, but it didn’t resonate with me as much as I had hoped."
Negative,this is very difficult game i dont understand why there isnt levels of difficulties like any other normal games...not fun...
Negative,The game's combat is extremely simplistic and mostly revolves around fighting 0-challenge mooks and bosses with difficulty determined by delay windows that you need to memorize.
Negative,Very poorly optimized. Might be a great game but if you don't have a top-of-the-line PC it will probably run poorly. Just fyi.
Negative,The GoodWorld: Great Graphics: TerrificMusic: BeautifulThe BadCombat: Boring and repetitivePerformance: Stutters and runs heavyStory: Meh
Negative,"It's to HARD ! Unfortunately, the gameplay broke me mentally.Two first bosses, one of which doesn't even react to strong hits.It hits so hard that it strikes me twice, and I'm dead.I tried to kill that fat pig 10 times and almost threw my computer out the window."
Negative,The number of times the game crashes is insane. I still have not been able to play the game continuosly for more than 15 minutes. I wish I could refund this game. Waste of money. This is the first time such a thing has happened.
Negative,I don't get the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I agree more with the many game review sites that gave this middling reviews. Buttons are unresponsive which makes the fights unfair. It is boss after boss with no context as to who I am fighting or why. It might not be a soulslike but the main reason I say that is the combat is too unpredictable and clunky. Souls might not have the most responsive controls but when I press a button I expect it to work. Wish i could return but I beat my head against a wall for too long trying to beat a boss
Negative,im going to preface this by saying i love the game at its core. that being said having a 3050 and till finding it difficult to play the game even at low settings irks me and i feel that they need to provide a patch that gives it better optimisation
Negative,Tired of trying to pop medicines and they dont activate in fights
Negative,"Stuttering, no HDR, forced sharpening, input lag, unresponsive combat... I got sucked into the hype, and I regret it."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.Quite clear the developers only focused on a decent Chapter 1 and 2 to entice you to play past 2 hours so you cannot get a refund.Chapter 3 onwards is woefully bland with inescapable hindering mechanics, badly designed bosses and inconsistent terrain borders.The only praise I can give are the environmental effects, and the voice acting but everything else just falls short."
Negative,"Beautiful visuals,  but I just want to give a heads up to casual gamers before you buy, I had less than 2 hrs, refund requested. It is absolutely Souls like and no difficulty levels. If you just wanna relax and play a game after work this is not for you."
Negative,"while the game looks amazing. spending an average of 3 to 6 hours just trying to kill a boss over and over again is really a painful experience. would not recommend anyone to play , unless your a very skilled ""soul"" based playing style gamer, the money spent is completely not worth it just to enjoy some nice rendered graphics... you can experience it for free on youtube, there's tonnes of them. Honestly, the lack of content too is pretty obvious, and i can see why they made the difficulty so high just to ""make up"" for the really mundane content."
Negative,"AMD users please refund this game until a new adrenaline driver resolving the crashing issues is released, this game looks stunning but even when trying every graphical setting and locking frame rates doesn't make a difference, it's time to give up. This game is clearly not optimised for AMD GPU's. Fresh install of drivers and Visual C dist's make no difference."
Negative,"Horrible release quality, lots of stuttering and texture pop-ins even with medium gfx settings, super delayed audio, and a couple times the game even freezes. I'd advise everyone to hold off purchasing this game until every issue is patched."
Negative,"Game crashed twice during the tutorial. I had to change the graphics settings to low until the first bonfire. During the first boss fight, the whole computer crashed. The game isn't optimized and I would suggest to wait until the first patch at least.GPU: AMD 6800XT with 5900X.***** Update (8/29/2024) after AMD 24.8.1 and the first patch : This ***** game crashed my PC AGAIN. Can you PLEASE fix this game."
Negative,"The graphics in this game are absolutely beautiful. The concept is great. I really want to love this game, however, the combat is insanely difficult. I have tried and tried to get past the second zone and just can't. I went online to see how others are getting through the battles and tried their tips, but still no luck. Either I'm unlucky or I just don't have the skill for this game. Be warned: this IS a soulslike game, and you have to have crazy skill to play it."
Negative,fight and run fight and run .... boring as s....
Negative,crash and crash and cra-
Negative,kak gamegame doch kadouy
Negative,This game is not banned buy the Chinese government. Majority of sales are targeting the Chinese culture. Their are better games out their
Negative,Game refuses to launch despite all my troubleshooting. Wait a month or two to buy this game otherwise enjoy ramming your head against a wall trying to launch this game.
Negative,"I'm hard pressed between Yes and No. As of writing this, I kinda have to lean towards no. FOR NOW. Really If only because of the lack of optimization that exists. I am sure after a time, if the game is has continuous support and updates, that it will be a superb game. The Visuals and game play are good, and the flow feels just right so far. It's just the lack of optimization that takes it all away for me, especially for it's current price point."
Negative,"Reviewing this game is tough because, at its core, it's a solid title. The graphics are impressive, with intriguing character designs, and the bosses provide a satisfying challenge. Combat feels responsive and engaging.So, why the thumbs down? In a word: Elden Ring. After experiencing a game like that, jumping into this one feels like a step down. While the combat is enjoyable, it becomes repetitive over time. You're given spells, transformations, and stances, but eventually, it all boils down to repeating the same light combos. The lack of a blocking mechanic, while an interesting choice, further limits combat options, making it feel even more monotonous.Exploration is another area where the game falls short. It presents the illusion of vast areas to explore, but in reality, all paths lead to the same destination. There are some nice Easter eggs scattered throughout, but again, I can't help but feel that Elden Ring has set the bar too high.I don’t want to be overly critical because this is a genuinely good game—a potential Game of the Year contender, even. But it's just not for me. My biggest issue is that I can't stop comparing it to a far superior game, which is what drew me to this one in the first place.If I had bought this on sale, my opinion might be more positive. But at $60, with less than 30 hours of gameplay and no motivation to continue, I can't say my money was well spent."

Negative,"Game is pretty boring. You basically rush from boss to boss with little to no reason to explore the vast landscape. Also you just need to use first combat stance, freeze magic and clones to make it through these fights, living little to no reason to do different upgrades."
Negative,"Tried for 58 mins, most of that time was spent watching stuttering cinematics and laggy sounds, readjusting settings and resolution from Very High down all the way to Low. I am Windows 10, AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080. Way above recommended graphics settings. If I chose recommended game settings, we are talking game breaking stutters! Developer, if you are not ready to launch, don't! You do not have the right to spoil my gaming experience. As for the others who put 2 thumbs up, you either have a NASA computer, or you are in denial. I refunded."
Negative,"if you have an amd 7900xtx do not buy this fucking game, cant even run this game past the opening scene trash ass company keep on sucking nvidia's dick. it is my fault for choosing amd but i still hate this game"
Negative,This Game is on another level but boss fights are undefeatable making it consume hrs of time game is good though...
Negative,"...Tech Demo, nothing more."
Negative,"Until they fix the graphic issue, don't. Part of environmental models have extremely low resolution even though you play with highest setting."
Negative,"I really enjoy the gameplay and story so far, but there some performance issues, and the game crashes habitually. It's not even random crashes either. As of right now, an entire, albeit optional, area in chapter 1 is inaccessible due the game crashing whenever I try to unlock it. I can't in good conscience recommend the game until the devs get this mess fixed."
Negative,first half is great second half is full of cheap gimmick boss fights that are full of bullshit environments are just there to pad the game time. if they remove all the cheap gimmicks from these bosses the time for the game would be cut in half. terrible second half and such cheap bosses ruined the experience and are just unfun and unsatisfying to beat as you need a key item that is only obtainable through certain quests in order to stand a chance. even more so on final boss its such bs and full of crap that a no hit lvl1 unarmed punching only once every hour would be less bs then this fight
Negative,"Rating: 5/10 - MediocreBlack Myth: Wukong is a Mediocre action game that could have been so much more than it ended up being. The setting is Great, the graphics are gorgeous - even though the game does run like absolute shit - and the combat is decently fun in the beginning. But sadly the game has a large number of issues, most of all that it peaks around Chapter 3 and from there it is just a downward spiral of boredom, Bad bosses and level design so Terrible it makes the level design of the early chapters - which is already Bad - look Amazing. It goes to the point where Chapter 6 feels almost insultingly Bad, even if the last boss and the last secret boss are some of, if not the, best in the game. Any linear game that has to use invisible walls automatically looses points, it just feels like whoever was in charge of level design had no fucking clue what they were doing. Black Myth: Wukong's combat also doesn't feel that Good. It is smooth but lacking in variety and depth. It can be quite fun in the early hours but quickly stagnates.Overall Black Myth: Wukong is a Mediocre action game with some souls-like elements, a boring incoherent story, decent combat and some of the most Terrible level design I have seen in linear games. It commits the greatest sin any game can commit: it is boring. Black Myth: Wukong is nothing special, it does nothing to set itself apart or to: stick it to the gaming industry or the ""woke"" people like some people like to claim"
Negative,"I don't understand the hype on this game. Why would you like this? This is beyond frustrating ... I wish I could get a refund, I am passed the 2 hours mark and can't. Do not buy this game. The game's feel and the journey feels like is developed by a bunch of rookies. It's only boss fight all the entire game. Do not waste your money and time."
Negative,"Massively over-hyped. After barely an hour it already feels like a chore. The cinematics are great, but the level design and combat leaves much to be desired. It's not worthy of being compared to Elden Ring or God of War. Not in storytelling, combat, or design.I just don't see myself liking it. Would pay $10 to watch it in cinematic form."
Negative,"So I’m voting no for those who are viewing negative reviews to determine whether they want to buy the game or not. And due to my personal opinion being on the fence. My vote will be minuscule anyways, since people are voting positive despite their cons outweighing the pros.Big takeaway:If you walk into this expecting a Souls-like, you will have a horrendous time. It may look like one, but it definitely does not play as one.If you walk into this expecting something like a Chinese version of God of War, you will have a good time. Expect you will just have a long stick and some power ups, and also get stunned from any form of attack, even during those cool power ups.Otherwise it’s f*ing epic if you ignore the combat portion. Now you may ask, isn’t the whole thing combat? Why yes, yes it is."
Negative,"The developers get up to receive their TGA award—only to be blocked by an invisible wall halfway to the stage.“Black Myth: Wukong” could have been an epic journey through ancient myths, but it ends up feeling more like a tour of poorly marked attractions. The map design is a true work of art—if the art in question is abstract confusion. Invisible walls are scattered everywhere, turning what should be a grand adventure into a frustrating guessing game of “Where can I actually go?” It’s almost like the developers wanted to create a maze, but instead of walls, they used the sheer force of player disappointment.The story had so much promise, like a novel you can’t put down—until the last chapter, where the author apparently fell asleep. The plot starts off with grand ambitions, only to fizzle out into a limp ending that feels more like a rushed conclusion than a satisfying finish. It’s as if they ran out of budget or ideas and thought, “Eh, just wrap it up.” If you enjoy investing hours into a story that builds up to… well, nothing, this is the game for you."
Negative,i am playing the role of a victim in a rpg game
Negative,"Bad visual clarity in boss fights due bad animations, too many particels and stuttering/low performance on high end hardware. Level design is way too complex with no map. Story is really not that interesting."
Negative,"Clunky gameplay, poor optimization. Would possibly recommend after updates and if purchased on sale."
Negative,"horrendous hitbox, boring combat, unreasonable boss movesets. Only one good boss: Yaksha king"
Negative,"The game is great, but the optimisation is extremely poor and causing the game to glitch out and crash often.I can't recommend this game yet, wait at least a month for some performance updates to release.My PC is very robust and with a 4080 and 64gb of ram, so I find it unacceptable for a AAA game to run so poorly and crash so often."
Negative,"the main character is a monkey.... the only weapon is the fighting stick.... the weapon feels really weak... the lack of block requires you to dodge everything making the game a dodge fest and reflex show... when you press attack button the monkey becames uncontrolable doing acrobatic idiotic  things that you don't want it to do .... If I could I would refund the game but unfortunately I bought it from third party , not very happy to follow the hype train and not watching more gameplay before buying it. the game is generic and borring button mashing"
Negative,"For all players not interested in soul-like games steer clear. While I understand why the community says it isn't souls-like because is less harsh, you can respec, and grind experience. It is HARD for people that have been avoiding souls-like because frankly I'm just not that good of a player. And I'm not trying to grind or memorize movement patterns that then change to be left frustrated and annoyed. I want to like it, the design and story really appeals to me. It feels like a great game but be prepared it is much more difficult than GOW."
Negative,"It's a beautiful setting, but in the end its just glorified Street Fighter.  You move from boss fight to boss fight and each is essentially the same.  Sure they look great, have interesting and novel attacks - but for you it is basically an exercise in timing the dodge button press repeatedly.  Mistime a dodge - dead.   So you die over and over to learn the moves - i.e. -  when to press the dodge button.   If you can't dodge, then your attacks are really irrelevant because you can never tank a boss.   For me, this setting had a lot of potential.   But in the end it is not even as open world as Elden Ring.   If you enjoy boss fighting, then this is your game.  If you want an epic adventure set in the time of Sun Wukong, then you'll be disappointed.   Worth $40, no more."
Negative,"I'll modify this review if the game gets better, but honestly I feel like I'm just forcing myself to ""get to the good part"". It's definitely neither Elden Ring, God of War or Star Wars Survior, etc. You sort of run around from constricted (lots of invisible walls) level to level (no open world as of yet) killing mini bosses and sometimes bigger bosses that are somewhat annoying but mostly pretty easy. I assume it will get better?I generally like lore and story and in this game I feel like I'm mostly wandering and killing shit for no reason whatsoever. I haven't encountered a single quest in 4 hours. There are a few friendlies you can talk to, but that ""intrigue"" isn't there. There is written lore once you encounter enemies, though, but it's poorly translated into English. That said, English dubs are bad, but it's a Chinese game so that's acceptable. Looks good though. But it's got some weird sharpening I can't put my finger on. I wouldn't say it's ""spectacular"", it's not graphically the best game I've played, but the performance *is* good. I upgraded to a rtx4080 super just to play this, somewhat disappointed none-the-less.Don't get me wrong, I'll still probably keep going a little while longer, it's not fair to play for 4 hours and claim this is a good or bad game. I honestly don't get the ""overwhelmingly positive"" hype either."
Negative,"This seems to be a great game that being said It is only because the standards for what a great game is has dropped compared to years before.Im not really captivated by the story so far, because there really isn't any story. This is a boss fight game and that's about it. Nothing more. If you see it as that, you may enjoy it but if you are looking for a story to captivate you, that you can feel part of, this isnt it. Additionally, the choice to not include a difficulty setting really is a confusing one as most of the bosses in this game (e.g White clad noble are very difficult to beat most times having to retry upwards of 10,20,40 times to beat them.) Additionally, there's no option to skip some bosses. On my end, the game is broken for me as I cant justify sitting down trying to beat one boss for 5+ hours. If you cant spend upwards of 5 hours grinding to beat a boss, I cant recommend this game for anyone that has other things to do besides gaming."
Negative,"It's sad we cheer on games for just doing the bare minimum and not put out broken slop for $60 with microtransactions. To be perfectly honest, the game is just ok. Nothing special. Despite of what others say, Black Myth Wukong is a ""souls-like"". Fromsoft makes adventure games. Anyone who makes an adventure game inspired by fromsoft is a making a ""souls-like"". Here we got a metroidvenia style adventure game, in a 3d environment, fast travel points you need to active (bonfires). Resting at these spots replenishes your red, blue and green bars (health, mana, stamina), spells and reusable items. It also resets the area, respawning enemies you can just run past if you feel like (they even give you a spell to make it easier). It has a single difficulty that focuses on a single experience you can counter by leveling up with the RPG style system, and finding items to make it easier or you can change builds altogether. It has a focus on 1v1 boss fights, and you use a refillable healing item to try to last longer. It is clearly a ""souls-like"" with no originality. You can create adventure games without it being a ""souls-like"", this ain't it.Does it have inclusion? No it doesn't. It also doesn't really have people in it that much. Just furries. Which is fine. Though i was ""loong""ing for some queer characters, instead of boring plots involving heteronormative activity. Inclusion was clearly not an interest to the devs. Neither was good level design. They should have just made this more of a boss run style game, allowing us to fly around on our cloud and feel like Wukong. Instead you get a couple bosses, with a ton of boring areas to run though, only getting our cloud in the last chapter, that's only usable in that area, and not in combat (unlike a certain other poorly designed boss that can). The thing devs looking to make a ""souls-like"" usually overlook is environmental storytelling. It is mostly absent in this game, which is sad. It can improve level design and if done well, can elevate the narrative as a whole.Would I recommend this game? After playing through it fully, nope. We are given 113 bosses. I like about...maybe 5 or so. And I can only remember 10 or so. Bad Level design (as in boring, sloppy, thrown together with no thought), quantity over quality bosses, and a level up path that is very shallow. And in the last chapter they pretty much strip it all away in favor of equipment that has really high stats."
Negative,"Not optimized, dont buy if you dont have a supercomputer, you wont be able to run it."
Negative,"The bosses in the game is too challenging to be considered relaxing. The exploration feels linear, similar to Sniper Elite. The graphics are impressive, but it really needs a difficulty setting."
Negative,"Don't be fooled. Maybe its some kind of Chinese propaganda but the game is bunk. No way its getting these reviews. It's just a series of boss fights. Bad controls, poor performance, poor story { you will have no idea whats going on } weird non-sensible dialogue. calling it overrated is an understatement."
Negative,"They put so much effort into the art that they forgot they had to also make an enjoyable game. This game is enjoyable only in small parts, the rest feels awful. Attacks that dont connect because of funky animations, maps that look all the same that you get lost in and have to lookup a guide because they couldn't include a simple map, and lets not talk about chapter 3, the prison section is awful, attacks designed to oneshot you by pushing you down, a weird unexplained mechanic that halves your health, zero checkpoints inbetweenI wouldnt spend $60 on this, $20 would be more like it until they fix it. Buy it from a key reseller, not worth the triple A price"
Negative,"Nope. Don't do it. Pulling the trigger on this game is only going to incite rage and fury. I will say that it is beautiful however it's not fun..Boss mechanics are BROKEN AS HELL. The have an obvious AI that isn't fun to fight as it is cable of bending game mechanics for it's own best interests. Small example is the first spell you get is a stun. It's cool, works well, until the AI realizes that you are good at interrupting the attacks with it so it simply decides to let you cast it and just not be stunned. Great right? Nope. Items you need to fight bosses, for instance a fire resistance potions, limited number, so the more you consume the harder the boss fight gets because you can PERMANENTLY run out. Most bosses have two phases at the point I'm at in the game. Second phase is harder, to be expected, but they get more and more ""cheaty"" the more you fight them. Lets also mention that the bigger the boss is, the more likely your attacks will miss! Why? Well because the model for the boss is SO LARGE that when it moves, you can't hit with your combo or the big finisher that should do a ton more damage than the rest of your attacks. The last thing I have to mention is that my i9 14900k and watercooled 4090 keep this game around 60fps or higher without many issues. Temps are good throughout. However the game has a built in ""slow motion"" effect that seems to slow you down more than the bosses. It's VERY frustrating."
Negative,garbage combat. no patterns to boss combat making the fights just luck if you can win at all.
Negative,shit fucking boring cunt of a game
Negative,"First of all I've completed the game and beat every living thing there with a stick. Only way to go is NG+.Second of all my main problem with this game that in the end I stopped trusting it and next I will describe what I mean by it.Often in games you have short period of knowing eachother and setting rules and boundaries. This game however likes to not abide by rules set previously and break your trust which in my opinion is the worst thing game can do to a player.Obviously it is a large game which was made within several years and not every boss was made by same individuals as well as not every location. But the problem is that there should be rules that should be enforced throughout the game for bosses and levels that should be consistent. Because otherwise players' trust is broken and they get frustrated.So here is my list of how game has broken my trust:1. Level design. Invisible walls and inconsistency. There were no rules for this one from the chapter one. In the older days you could simple look at the textures and if they were worse than you would think that you can't go there. However here you can't really confidently guess if area is accessible or not without bumping into it.2. Input buffer. Here is the main problem of this game and it comes out into play in later hours when you don't have much spare time in the bossfights. You will notice it earlier for sure but it bites the hardest when enemies start to hit you for 70% of your healthbar.Because of abundance of input buffer you can't trust this game in healing, using powerups, using abilities or even attacking sometimes. In final(secret) fight I found myself walking for a few steps after rolling just to be sure that game will accept my input to heal. I noticed that I started pulling my fingers away from the controller before using abilities so game will recognize the next ability input. After a decade of playing souls-likes it sounds insane!  3. Combat in general. I beat all game in the first stance without swithcing. At first I thought it will be like in Ghost of Tsushima where you use different stances for different enemies but it is not the case here. Game does not force you or promote using different stances in any way. You can try to use them out of curiosity but more or less you fight loop is still the same: hit same light attacks for all stances->hit one big heavy attack different for each stance->repeat. I understand that you can only do so much with a stick but simply giving you a reason or/and ability to use different stances throughout the bossfights/exploring would do wonders because at around chapter three it becomes too repetitive.Also there is a lot of inconsistency in bosses' attacks. Be it hitboxes or general timing. I had more then 2-3 tries only to Tiger, Chapter 4 boss and Secret ending boss and I can say for sure Tiger is the best one of them. Attacks are clearlty telegraphed, boss does not miss you for some weid reason and you don't miss your attacks and for most players it would be a first obstacle which will set an expectation for the next bossfights. However it is untrue. Many bosses have weird hitboxes. Sometimes you feel that attack sould hit but it just does not. After Tiger you think that you have a feeling when a perfect evasion sould happen but it doe not. You think you would know when attack should not hit you but it still does. Easiest explanation is that different people made different bosses so it is where inconsistency comes from. But as a player I should not care about it. All I care is that game sticks to it's own rules. But it does not.4. Locations in general. It is clear as day that different people were doing different chapters but inconsistency can be seen throughout all chapters. In the first two chapters you still learning the game and what it is like to explore it. They like to loop paths here into each other for some reason and not give you  good landmarks to keep track of where you've been. In third chapter they stopped doing it but gave you the opposite side of hell with big open area with low amount of landmarks and low visibility so you could get lost easily without any good rewards for exploring. In chapter four they decided to add vertical exploring to chapter three's frustrating exploring. And in chapter five they made your path as linear as possible for some reason and you ask yourself if it could have been done to the first four chapters and why did you need to struggle so much before if a game could be just tunnels and it would not lose anything.5. Camera. If you are playing a game where bosses or even random mobs can combo you to death in a few seconds you want to be in full control of your surroundings. You don't want your camera to be locked while picking ingridients. Sometimes you don't want to be locked to certain bosses' attacks just to throw few extra hits (Hello Chapter 2 boss). On the other hand sometimes you want to be locked onto boss but game refuses to do so and you left with a choise of taking a hit or panic rolling. Again you have years of souls-like before you and can't handle camera play still. Give me ability to unlock the camera if I want to. Lock camera when there is no good audio input of boss attacking from invisibility. It's that simple.Next I will do some cherry picking. Not very bad stuff but something that I did not like:1. Crafting mixtures. I've played without drinking mixtures for all fights and was just fine but I've noticed this watching steams and friends. I did not like this in Elden Ring and I find no reason to repeat someone else's mistakes after two years it has been out. In my opinion if your game is a bossfight after bossfight I should not be doing farming or/and crafting resources. Ideal for me is you go to next chapter -> you don't need to gather any resouces for recipes from previous one. They should be at shop as full crafted mixtures or all ingridients should be available. Randomised seed drop and different timings for seed growing is frustrating and does not bring anything to the table.2. Crafting weapons and armor. Do you want a first chapter's ingridients for armor dropped from chests and minibosses in chapter three or even in the last one? No? Too bad. It comes down same as with the ingridients. It is single player boss rush game. I don't want to farm here. The more you progress the more items should appear in vendors' shops. You can keep current chapter's materials in bosses. But after I've passed chapter just throw them in the shop.3. I did not really follow the story but what I found really frustrating is mute protagonist. Other games make it work differently but way better than this one. Some games are action driven and cutsceens don't really need your character's voice input. Other just make dialogues so that your character is on receiving end and their voice input is not really required as well. But I find it strange here that our protag's face appear so much in the cutscenes and many of them are just talking and fore some reason he does not react. Just plain face. And there are a lot of occurances. Like why?4. There a lot more little things that I did not like such as: deux ex machina armor set in the final area that destroys all builds for last fights an ng+, way too many bosses which are easy and give basically nothing, quests dissapearing after killing chapter bosses, quests breaking, empty locations, fps drops and so on and on. But let's wrap this up.TLDR: Game did not utilize a decade of souls-like genre and carried many mistakes from other games also having it's own problems which make you not trust the game in receiving your commands and bosses' attacks. If you really want to make your life miserable you can buy it now. Other path is waiting until price drops and playing it while looking at good walkthrough guide so you won't waste as much time as I have exploring vast but mostly empty chapter 2, 3 and 4 locations for mostly nothing."
Negative,"Don't be fooled by positive reviews or game journalists. Performance is trash, combat and boss designs are garbage. And there is NO MAP. How can you have a game with no map?!"
Negative,"Listen, I dont know WHAT you guys are on about, I think the hype is blinding most of you.The gameplay, sound, animation looks tight. The game looks fun...BUTThe graphics look super grainy. Some textures are blurry or stretched out, everything looks Oversharpened during gameplay but the cinematics look really good. There's Hair and fur dithering and flickering arround the character models. Performance is all over the place. I reloaded a save and I could not even move my character or open the settings at one point. I have a 3080 / pretty good pc, I can run most games at 60 fps on 4k high / ultra and games look and feel 10x better than this game. Wukong looks super interesting but in 2024 the lighting and texture rendering method looks terrible and its unnaceptable, Im holding off until there's a few patches.edit: watch this and tell me im trippin."
Negative,"im not sure how anybody can recommend this game to other people, the battle system is horrendously frustrating. you cannot target your enemies consistently and they get really glitchy. the camera does not help at all you have to constantly move it around manually. it's such a terrible primitive battle system. i do not recommend this game to anyone. it's a waste of time and good money. look elsewhere, this game is close to unplayable. the frustration other players have is not because they are bad players, but because the mechanics of the game is a complete joke."
Negative,"The combat is the worst I have ever experienced in a game, it's clunky and unsatisfying, and almost every attack of almost every enemy is faster than the last attack in your (weak) light attack combo that you can almost never max out cause every enemy out speeds you, it has almost never a staggering effect and hitboxes are a mess that makes varied combos unusable on huge enemies, cause they won't hit. Speaking of big bosses, they will completely screw with the camera angle when focused on them, making battling them a hot mess.Most enemies will throw 2-3 attack combos at you completely depleting your stamina from constant dodging. Most of the time the game just feels annoying rather than difficult. The game isn't all that hard, it's just that everything is thrown at you at once. So beating this game isn't a question of skill, but rather how much s*it you are willing to put up with"
Negative,"this game is ridiculously hard, for some reason the basic enemies in the game are fairy simple to beat but the big bosses are dam near impossible if your just a casual player not every one is a pro gamer ! i find it just stupid that there is no difficulty setting in the game. in my opinion unless your a dam good gamer, dont waste your money, wish i could get mine back"
Negative,"This game will die faster than palworld, mark my words. Not what I expected, yes the graphics and bosses are good and at best interesting, the rest of the game is absolutely depressing, I wanted my refund but got denied, would refund 100% not worth 60$ at all. Where's the map in the game,there is no MAP dude like whaaaat ??? People are brainwashed by paid up streamers and youtubers at best an AVERAGE game. Cheers (I would have rather donated de 60$ to a homeless guy instead of buying this game hawk tuah)."
Negative,Horribly optimization i had everything cranked to low and couldnt get over 25fps.
Negative,bad optimization off the game why its so laggy in good pc
Negative,bad why is every ability on the same button so dumb
Negative,typing is required
Negative,not worked with Radeon videocard (7900 xtx - example (newest driver all)) crashed
Negative,Rating: 5/10Good game but can't recommend it until the developers fix the horrible input delay which makes dodging and skill activation not work properly turning the game into one of luck and chance instead of player skill.
Negative,"I  do not understand why a developer , who makes games for pc wont support super ultra wide monitors!!!! 32/9 It makes no sense!!!! Cost zero dollars to program it into game! Games that were made 5 years ago, support 32/9!!! If i buy it on ps5 i can play it on a 75 inch tv with zero black bars!!!!  Even if there are only 20 percent of gamers who use 32/9, why not make it available? It cost the developers zero money and very little time!!! Spend this kinda money on a, amazing rig and have to go back in time just to play game!!!! And to charge 60 , screw that!!!!"
Negative,"this game struggles with understanding what makes a challenging game fun. at several points in this game you are given a cool new ability just for the next boss to be a perfect counter to it. taking away the fun new stuff we are given right after getting it is not good design. the cool abilities are honestly all that kept me playing the game. the game has cool abilities and it looks great but every encounter in the game feels janky. The final boss is a perfect example of why the design of several bosses don't work, every single ability and attack you spent 40+ hours collecting get countered randomly by the boss. The entire encounter just feels like several rng checks in a row. he has a random chance to counter your heavy attack, imobilize, healing, duplicates, light attack, and if you think he's not countering enough don't worry because he will freeze you in time so that he gets a garenteed hit that you have no way of avoiding. i don't think there was a single boss that i fought that left me feeling satisfied with the accomplishment. i give it 4/10"
Negative,"Questionable technical decisions.1, No option to turn off Supersampling (DLSS, FSR). I just want native resolution instead of a blurry mess. At least let me have that option to balance fps and other graphics options.2. Colors are washed out. Tested on an IPS monitor. Colors are washed out and has bad contrast. This is to be expected in an IPS monitor, but tested on an OLED TV as well. It's not any better. HDR might be able to fix this but the game doesn't have that option.There's a lot to like about the game but I think the 2 things I mentioned are important and I don't understand why they decided to not fix them.If colors, contrast, clarity is important to you, I do not recommend this game."
Negative,"I did read the reviews before buying this game but the reality was disappointing. There is no storyline, no quests, not much information of where we are going and why. It was said that it’s based on the Chinese Myths but there is not much info in game about them except for some random stories about the enemies. There is no map but it’s not needed either since it’s typical dungeon by dungeon type of game. Basically it’s very simple, you go along the road and fight some random enemies until you get into the area where you find mini boss. If you are lucky you kill the mini boss and pass through and get to the next dungeon. If not you can try again the same mini boss or go back killing the same respawned enemies in order to get more experience and hopefully some day you’ll pass through the mini boss and get to the new dungeon.There are also potions that might be helpful which you can buy from so called shrines but be aware that the stock is limited and once you buy them all, they are not restocked. There are some materials that I suppose you would be able to use in future, but I was not able to get this area as of yet since there is no way to pass to the new area without killing the mini boss at the entrance of it. The game is great if you need to unwind at the end of the stressful day and just go killing someone.In general I regret buying this game since I am more interested in the storytelling than killing the same enemies over and over again. The graphics are good but you need a really great computer to play it as it lags a lot on my Ally Z1 Extreme."
Negative,"Obviously, Black Myth: Wukong is a soulslikeit's boring for me and I can't play smoothly"
Negative,I hope whoever designed and greenlit pagoda realm is sent instead of hell.Bootleg irithyll dungeon
Negative,60$ usd for a game i cant run on low with a 2000 dollar pc
Negative,this game deserves a negative review solely because of yellow wind sage and how fucking awful it is but id still give the game game of the year its absolutely phenomenal
Negative,performance not very good. remove denuvo
Negative,monkey is stupidmonkey dont have a mapmonkey always lostjourney my assmonkey cant climb a lot of cliffmonkey cant jump off a cliffeven monkey cant walk through nothingjourney my assthe only fun part of this monkey is the boss
Negative,"Overall not that bad, but neither is good. First time playing souls-like and everything seems like not fully finished.Farm in this absent as it is (maybe it should be so), aim when you fight diff enemies just swaps on itself, 85% of the bosses are too easy and others which are not that easy are idiotic in the way the fight goes. Almost no response to my actions, freezing their attack in the middle of the process to make it harder to evade, however, just making the fight tempo feels bad, some of the just make attacks in any directions without real movement, bosses are jumping and just fucking dissapearing because of the camera, big bosses ( not a lot of them) have some insanly idiotic aim point,when you monkey instead of beating it tries to beat it at the spot and just moves instead of making a normal combo. Also, closer to the end of the game, you just do not care about plot in any capacity.Still has some good points which I enjoyed a lot, however, the price tag should have been 2 times less as overall this game is not even close to games like W3, baldur, tsusima or anything in that price range"
Negative,"I have .8 hours trying to get past the first cinematic/fight and the second cinematic. Audio is choppy, fps is fine, but then it will crash out of nowhere.I would have loved to actually play the game, but as of now i literally cannot get past the first 5 minutes of content, not for lack of trying. Needs fixing. Once some updates come through maybe I will update this review."
Negative,"Started very well, got bad very quickly. It IS a souls like indeed, don't get confused by the marketing and what many people are saying. If you're planning to buy the game and don't like souls level hardships, unfairness and rage-inducing gimmicks, maybe redirect your budget on something else.Have I become the only gamer who doesn't find endless trial & error and grinding a massive boss' healthbar for 10 entire minutes fun? Is there anyone else who feels much more rewarded by beating a boss in just one or two attempts after an engaging, focused and fair fight that forces you to play well and use all the mechanics that the games has to offer, but doesn't force you to learn the boss patterns by heart through endless repetition and a dozen unfair deaths, just to finally beat him because you finally had some luck?Chapter 1 is perfect at doing what I just described and I enjoyed it a lot. Difficulty was well balanced there, fights were engaging, challenging and fun without ever getting frustrating. But in chapter 2, suddenly, it becomes a proper souls like with a massive difficulty spike, bosses with endless health bars that barely take any damage but have endless combos that can destroy yours, camera issues that become your enemy more than the enemy himself. I was halfway through chapter 3 and got to the Pagoda Prison boss, that's where I uninstalled the game. After beating a stupid massive dragon in a totally random way (because the fight itself is purely random) and having to go through the most annoying level design ever in the prison, here we are with another huge, annoying boss with an almost invulnerable health bar... no, thanks.Moreover, exploration gets so damn confusing from chapter 2 and a lot of rage-inducing elements are copy-pasted from Dark Souls and randomly introduced. To make it even worse, the environments are just not at all impressive. Chapter 2 is just red rocks everywhere, chapter 3 is just snow everywhere (excluding the prison, that's awfully confusing to navigate and definitely not fun to explore). Everything gets repetitive, frustrating, infuriating and uninteresting very quickly, and it's a real shame because the combat system is very fun to use in fair fights, the design of the enemies is really inspired, the general atmosphere of Chinese mithology is fascinating, but that is not enough. A game needs to be fun in the first place and this one stopped to be after less than 20% of its length.I feel like From Software has ruined the action genre as every action game nowadays borrows the WORST souls-like elements just to follow this damn trend. I'm sooo sick of it.P.S. I market the product as received for free because I got a free code with my Nvidia graphics card. I didn't receive the product from the software house directly."
Negative,damage dealt is so low its awful. feels like i am fighting with a damn pool noodle
Negative,"This game is not for me, bosses too hard.I've spent 4 hrs on the 2nd boss and only got frustrated and had not fun.I hope the rest of you find fun in a very challenging enemies."
Negative,"Game doesn't feel that special. My attacks feel very unimpactful as if I'm attacking with a wet noodle. Story is a mess in its presentation. Another game with developers afraid of numbers; wtf does ""increase slightly/moderately"" even mean. Not hooked even after 6-8hours of gameplay."
Negative,"Shader Compilation is so bad it caused hardware damage to my 14th gen Intel. If you have a 13th or 14th gen Intel make sure you update your BIOS with the patch for (0x129), or end up like me and be unable to access BIOS without resetting CMOS, as the game essentially overclocked my CPU, with OUT my consent, with it's terrible optimization.I've spent 2 hours on debugging this nonsense already. I'd get a refund of this if I hadn't tried this via Steam Family.The game could be fantastic and God-Tier, but 90% garbage dev decision and 10% trash Intel decision makes this an easy NEVER RECOMMEND.Straight from Intel themselves for those who deleted their comments: https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/Microcode-0x129-Update-for-Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop/m-p/1622129"
Negative,"As a casual gamer, this game blew me away from the reviews, graphics  & combat. I purchased the game and while letting it download I read some reviews (mostly good) but some were saying the game is super difficult which I didn't hesitate to continue to play as I don't mind a challenge. Boy let me tell you I couldn't even get close to killing that Big Baby within the first hour I died 10 times and he killed me with ease. I instantly thought I need to refund before I hit 2 hours as the game obviously progressively gets harder. Kind of a shame I'm not even that bad at combat games I'm quite competitive but this stresses me out more than I can enjoy it therefor I don't thinks it's worth it as I play games for enjoyment not stress."
Negative,Well made game but with some of the worst combat I've seen in a souls like. Game is visually beautiful but is completely baron outside of the mediocre boss fights and the combat pretty much just comes down to button mashing. I've read the entirety of journey to the west and I was very eager for this games release for a couple years but sadly it just ended up being god of war with worse combat. If anything could fix the game in my opinion it would be boss specific music that syncs to their attacks to make the fights feel more rhythmic and a parry system that doesn't have a 30 second cool down. Get it if you've got genuinely nothing else to play and 80 bucks to spare but otherwise just go play Sekiro.
Negative,"I can see the effort the developers in the creation of this game but making it Eden Ring , Dark Soul style makes a lot of casual players turn off . I was excited to play this game and as I grew with watching various version of Sun Wukong. This game frustrating difficulty turns me off. It is still a good game"
Negative,Well newest patch that got downloaded today just deleted my save file. 43 hours of game play all down the drain. The game was my pick for game of the year but sadly now I can't recommend it. Because the devs fucked up. I was almost done with the game.
Negative,the reccomended specs are a fucking lie this game is unplayable at anything over low with more than the reccomended specs on my end the game crashed and wouldnt close for 5 fucking hours so now i cant even get a fucking refund
Negative,"I realize this game is very popular and it does look cool, but I think I felt mislead as I thought I was going to play a RPG type game. This is way more souls like. I know a lot of folks prefer the challenge of those type of games, but personally I suck enough that I hate dying  10-12 times before I can beat any single boss, sub-boss, tree, etc. Not for me, I don't see this as fun gaming. Hope others enjoy."
Negative,Yes King Give Me Your Nutt
Negative,"Game is awesome, only leaving a negative to signal for native HDR support, it could really use it"
Negative,fucking hard game to kill boss
Negative,Cant play it due to crash on startup.
Negative,so overhyped XD just a whole lot of mid
Negative,"buy it for the 1st two chapters,delete it after thatthe game is not that fun and most of the bosses are easy or annoying, the enemies are useless and the game is based on farming witch take s much time to learn everything... the 3rd chapter is the worst chapter i've ever played in the last 5 year"
Negative,"I wish there was a neutral review option, as that is what I would like to give this game, but since there isn't I'm going to go ahead an give it a negative review because ultimately I just didn't have the much fun with the game. Here are the reasons I ultimately decided this game was not that great:1) Invisible walls everywhere, and often in places that really look like you should be able to explore them such as caves. This makes exploration feel really bad to be honest, and exploration is actually quite important in this game.2) Non-boss enemies are incredibly monotonous, and later in the game there are a lot of them and many are actually kind of tough. This is exasperated by issue 3 below. 3) Half-baked soulslike elements like shrines that respawn most enemies when you rest and consumables that are lost when you use them and then die to a boss. This is not a true soulslike so these mechanics just make the game less fun in my opinion.4) Incredibly uneven difficulty that really just makes the game feel like it has some kind of multiple personality disorder. Most boss and miniboss fights are quite easy and can ususally be beat in one or two tries, but certain bosses are obnoxiously hard (especially if you don't want to explore every nook and cranny for better items). These harder bosses often have difficulty elements that just feel cheap (such as one boss that has unavoidable scripted attacks that do massive damage) while also having mountains of health, insane amounts of damage, and, in certain cases, nearly non-existent punish windows. The boss fights are very well-designed visually and conceptually, but the harder ones leave a lot to be desired when it comes to how they challenge the player. As a fairly experienced soulslike player, I would not say this game is quite on the level of most FromSoft games in terms of difficulty, but when it gets hard it gets hard in very unfun ways.Overall, I really wouldn't say this a bad game, but I will say that I didn't have much fun with it. Oh well. Not every game is for everyone."
Negative,"The story of this game is, revolting. The story of the journey to the west is the growth of Sun Wukong from a very powerful baby to a responsible enlightened man/woman/adult monkey. This premise is immediately reversed in the beginning of this game, and the actions and inactions of all the gods and buddhas were completely inexplicable.  It's difficult to view it as a brainless action game either as the writers use a condescending tone to convey their very immature childish messages. The only reason I want to beat the bosses so bad is that I would like for them to shut up and feel useless and reflect on their total lack of motivation, randomness of their actions, and utter stupidity.----------Previous Review---------------------------------------Just ran the in-game benchmark again, problem solved. Now it's a great game!!! Gorgeous pictures, fun boss fights. The dialogue is not good as many misnomers were introduced by idiot writers who thinks they are good at classic Chinese when they are not even good at Chinese. Anyways, small problem.----PREVIOUS REVIEW------------------------------------------Very poorly optimized compared with the standalone benchmark tool which came out many days before. Mashed together pine needles and flickering shadows of objects obviously standing still.  I use Ryzen 5700+ Radeon 6600XT, not the best machine out there, but I expected the game to be at least as good as the benchmark tool. Massive, massive disappointment!"
Negative,"After 6 hours in, I'm done with this game. White clad noble was my last straw. Wanted to play this game for the story, but I don't have the time to spend 2-3 hours trying to clear certain bosses (like wandering wight). I realized while fighting white clad noble that the bosses are actually regenerating life while all the while I am just doing chip damage to it, but when it hits me, it is like a nuke. No mana regen, limited healing,... As a working adult, there are better things to spend my time on, and so regretfully I will be returning this game and asking for a refund. Until difficulty is patched, I'll watch youtube playthroughs instead."
Negative,Game is beautiful to look at and listen to. That is all there is to it for me. I hoped for god of war / darksiders (not the 3rd) experience.No puzzles to solve and normal* enemies are few and far between. Bosses taking the spotlight and make the gameplay loop very frustrating to me. If you die 10-50 times to a same boss only to get another boss right after then there is no high from overcoming that challenge. Just the bitter aftertaste of lost time ranging in hours. So if you like beautiful games and you are either very good with dodging nearly zero frames attacks or you are just masochist then go grab this game. Its certainly not a garbage material. But it is also not typical action rpg that Ive been led to expect. More of a boss rush with only quiet moment when you turn it off.edit after 270 hours:Still will leave this as not recommended. There is just too many issues on a pretty cover.Combat system lacks moves and combos in general. Moves that are in there are situational and very hard to pull off correctly unless you know every single moves of your enemy.Animation cancel would benefit this game so incredibly much.Bosses execute their attacks poorly. They wind their attack for several seconds so you can prepare but then the attack itself is so fast it leaves me frustrated as you really need to die to the enemy several times to know you have to dodge earlier then the actual attack is executed. Bosses have too many gap closing attacks so do not expect having a space.Your flask and medicines are very inconsistent as there is no input queue system. So maybe you are in the last frames of your roll or other animation and the game will not obey your input and you will die to it or take unnecessary damage.Is this a terrible game? No not at all. Its just severely flawed on many levels like localization /performance /combat and some other minor annoying stuff like unskippable cutscenes that you cannot pause and they can lead straight into a fight.If you buy this game that is fine. I do not recommend buying the dlc though unless you wish to support the company.
Negative,"Nerf con rồng đi rồi tao chơi lại, không tao xóa game đó. năn nỉ á nerf điCon rồng đó như cc, cạp cái lol"
Negative,"great game. stupid ass ""talk to this NPC NOW or miss the true ending"" Garbage NEEDS TO BE OUT OF GAMING. PLEASE STOP DOING THIS.Only rating negative because of this in CH.5 If I'm wrong please correct me."
Negative,"While the combat is smooth, the graphics are impressive, and some of the cut scenes are cool, I believe the vast majority of adults will regret buying Black Myth well before finishing it. The decline in fun is rapid and extreme, and you will inevitably find yourself saying “This is it?” It has about 6 hours of entertaining gameplay (plus however long you spend just repeatedly dying) before the redundancy and lack of content starts to be a serious problem. It’s an empty, lonely slog of a game devoid of NPC’s, towns, a viable plot, or anything other than just a line of little enemies you hit with a stick on the way to big enemies… that you hit with a stick.Unless you’re buying it specifically because you’re a fan of Chinese culture and propaganda, I’d wait for a deep discount. You truly aren’t missing anything except the hype."
Negative,"There's literally two rules when it comes to these games make it a challenge but make it fair, this started off as ok but quickly became more annoying than challenging. The bosses have cheap attacks, yellowbrow literally has three scenes in his fight and each cutscenes drops your health to 1/4 and there's literally nothing you can do. This is basically on par with lords of the fallen when ever you beat a boss it doesn't feel like an accomplishment the whole game feels more like chore than a fun challenge. All this game did was get me more excited for the lies of p dlc and I can get back to an actually fun challenging game."
Negative,"dont press any button at the boss and u never die, the moment you press a button u die, good mechanics boss reacts to what buttons you press absolute dog shit game mechanics"
Negative,"For me personally the first 1 1/2 - 2 hours where really boring.The combat system is basically just spamming one button and occasionally doing a heavy attack. You dont even have to roll most enemies (that includes bosses). Also it gets even easier, because you can just use the stasis thingy and basically become certain bosses to do bullshit damage.Story seems interesting but tbh I can just buy the book of the myth for like 10 bucks.All in all I wouldnt recommend if you want a hard game.If you are a story enjoyer then it might be for you."
Negative,Do not waste your money on this game it is unplayable for a number of reasons but the worst one is the fact that it completely lacks a map or objective markers so you will have an insanely hard time knowing where you need to go game progression is atrocious some bosses are borderline impossible unless you are a sweat and spam buttons like its a fucking mortal combat game it is really difficult for casual players like myself who just want to enjoy a game and not dread every fucking boss fight i have never rage quit a game more in my entire life DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
Negative,"Game looks solid, but that is where the praise ends I'm afraid. Off the bat the combat felt weird, then got to a big mob that wasn't a quick jump combo and slap, and had annoying delayed attacks (where you'd think to hit to knock off balance/interrupt, but you'd be wrong it's just times dodge...nothing else) and massive attacks that even after dodging away would hit and also there's delay with your attacks that just made the combat not fun, given that this is 99% of the game is just bad.Then there's the death/re-spawn animation that is un-skip able just adding to the tedium of dying to janky mechanics, you have a kinda stun spell that works...sometimes and if for whatever reason is doesn't it's on cooldown adding another layer of frustration.The story of what I played I guess is there but you need to fill in all the blanks, invisible walls galore with no real exploration to be had no jumping/climbing to explore, I did hear you can sometimes go off the beaten path but that's not exploration that's just going left or right and eventually your going right.Just feels like a poorly/un tested game that considering the sum of it's parts the bad is the main part of the game."
Negative,"I have not experienced this many nonsensical invisible walls in a game since from the ps2 era.Certainly they will understand, in future releases, that this has to be managed in a less akward way. See what God of war did. For example.I played for a while, wasn't sure if I wanted to blow past my viable refund time so I watched a few parts of longer playthroughs and, to me, it's seems like the gameplay loop is waaaay less interesting skillbased wise and much, much more buttonmashy.I get it. Now the low skill players have got their Soulsborne too. Fine. Not for me. Also not impressed by the level design. Pretty much one huge asset dump if you ask me.Very little work done on the textres. Just basic, plain, unworn, unstorytelling, unalive if you ask me. Yes, naughty dog are the masters of this but even if you lower the bar there is still a hell of a lot of work missing here in this aspect.Gold is gold, steel is steel , wood is wood and that is just about all there is to see here.Very bland."
Negative,"First things first, the game is pretty. Beyond that, the gameplay is very one-dimensional. The bosses attack, and you dodge. When they don't attack, you left-click or right-click, and that's about it. The game feels like trench warfare, filled to the brim with boss fights, which is nice and all, but it gets incredibly annoying when you can't take a minute to take in the game and see what's what. Wukong is a good attempt, but honestly, I don't understand the hype around it. It has a strange amount of ""God of War"" and ""Souls"" gameplay elements in it, and they feel very much like a copy-paste.All in all get it on sale."
Negative,Great game but the hitboxes are too broken for such  demanding fights.
Negative,"This far more of a hack and slash than a souls like. The first hour is either instantly killing mobs or encountering a boss/ mini boss damage sponge. Combat is dull, feels very loose and has no weight behind it. The camera is with out question the hardest fight in the game. It's a very pretty game with some really great art design, but after some leveling and a few boss fights (also very well visually designed), it just feels dull. Wait for a sale, I likely will re-purchase when this drops, but it's not worth a AAA price tag."
Negative,"This is not the next Elden Ring. Graphics are beautiful, but gameplay is not good. Combat is very strange, entire system revolves around using your cooldowns and then running away. Enemies are super easy and can be killed by spamming, bosses are the only thing that are difficult - and some of them are stupidly difficult. Unlike Elden Ring, or other Souls games, there is little to no story, lore, or worldbuilding. Just fights and bosses. It's bare bones, just a fighting game with a subpar combat system. You'll like it if you enjoy fighting bosses but otherwise I would give this title a miss."
Negative,"The goods- incredibly beautiful- awesome character/enemy designs- when the fights are fun, they are really fun- cool monkey lorethe bads- invisible walls everywhere- really poor level design (getting lost a lot in a super generic environment) - lots of jank (bad lock-on/hitboxes, some game breaking glitches)- unfun fights (50%+ of the bosses float and spam projectiles???)I am glad a lot of people are loving it! It just didn't hit for me like I thought it would."
Negative,"The game is very linear. Combat a boss, combat another boss , and then another boss... I tried to get a refund but passed the 2 hour threshold. This game really has nothing to offer if you are into RPGs. Graphics looked good, but so do older games."
Negative,"The game is too inconsistent, the bosses mix match combos, (sometimes they don't stop doing combos),  the controls semi work, (sometimes the dodges work, a lot of the times the dodges don't), you cant regain mana during a fights or exploration until you visit one of those things you heal from by resting at it, you use a gourd to heal but you can only heal from that 4 times once you used it up you cant heal until you visit that shrine thing again before or after a fight, i got the assumption that this game would be similar to Elden Ring, its so much worse than elden ring, the only good thing about it, is the aesthetics, THAT'S IT, Gameplay wise, its ASS, do not get this game"
Negative,"I really hate to leave this game a bad review but it's simply unplayable. I have a pretty decent pc and the game barely starts and when it does it crashes frequently. Steam also won't refund b/c I ""played the game more than 2 hours"". Unfortunately more than 1.5 hours of that time was spent trying to actually get the game to function. Intel 14900kf, 4090 super, 32gb ddr 5"
Negative,"garbage boss design and map exploration, prepare to lose to game glitches and poor design choices instead of game difficulty"
Negative,Can't turn off motion blur makes this 0/10 for me.  Motion sickness out of 10 for me.
Negative,Another repetitive soulslike with amazing graphics and fighting same bosses all afternoon.. One hour in and nope... Refund
Negative,Slightly overrated game. The last two chapters pretty cool though!
Negative,"I bought the game on Nov 9, 2024, thinking the bugs would have been fixed and performance optimized. Boy, was I wrong. It won’t start without compatibility mode, and with compatibility mode, it crashes at the first scene."
Negative,"Amazing environment i have to say. But the game is only a series of bosses, that noone bothered to explain who they are. The game asks to not go online and spoil the experience.. however  it gives nothing. Where are we? when are we? who are these people. Awful learning curve. Foes are either extremely easy or extremely hard. And in between bosses, just a few minutes of 100% linear walking until the next boss. After the fifth consecutive boss, which was even a double one, it starts to get old.."
Negative,at this stage even with an I9 and a 4090 has too much bugs and crashes. is cool but cannot reccomend it in this state. let s hope they can improve a little the stability of the game.updated now it runs but it is another frigging stupid soulslike..... is it really so difficult to put a slider difficulty on a game ate least? like jedi survivor? beautiful graphic and nice idea to use son goku charachter but gameplay is really badly implemented. even for a soul is really disappoiting. go to elden ring dear masochists players. for less  money i can send you to a mistress for a real BDSM session. you will enjoy it more.btw if there was a soulslike tag i would never have bought it.
Negative,"The game seems more interested with constantly stopping you for some new exposition or weird stuff than it is with letting you play the game. Starting out basically every other big enemy is just ""Well hold up there, Mr Monkey Man! Let me tell you about this new thing!"" And its never anything you want actually explained to you like combat or managing stamina, ""Ah yes. In ancient times we used to stick our hands up cha cha real smooth"". That's great and all but can you show me how to best whack someone with a stick?Objectively the worst part is this game just does not run well. Set me up for max settings possible at the drop. Ran okay but a few minor issues here and there. So I decided to lower a few things and cap the frame rate to keep it consistent. Game just decides to occasionally drop me down to like 20fps in places. There's something wrong with water in general, which is awesome as the first map is like 40% water. As soon as I see a body of water the game feels like its just wants to die. Generally with challenging games you want a consistent performance so there's no issues during fights so this is a major issue.I don't think fixing the performance would help me enjoy this game either. Just a bunch of things here and there that kill my enjoyment. Sadly I can't get a refund as I'm too far in. If I could I'd do it in a heart beat."
Negative,"Game is a whole lot of fun, but i cant recommend it at all. its been incredibly frustrating to deal with the performance issues this game has. for someone who has the recommended specs, the game should run more than fine. but it doesn't. i have given up this game on the 4th chapter because every time i start up i crash, not to mention the stuttering issues that make the game artificially hard. i hope in the following months this game will get some performance issues fixed and ill give it another shot because i still really want to finish it. If you have the kit well above the recommended specs, you will have a good time."
Negative,"I enjoy a challenge, but most of the difficulty in this game games seems forced and cheap. Most of the bosses do a very poor job of signaling their attacks, if at all. Level design and combat options are very sparse. Technical issues galore. Lighting is very bad, leaving a lot of areas too dark and hard too see. Hit boxes are very erratic. Hard to cancel out of animations and button inputs get missed constantly. I did enjoy what little I experienced of the story and characters. When not screen tearing or having weird hiccups, the game looks beautiful. Wanted to love this game, but I had so many issues with it from both a tech and combat perspective. I understand that many people enjoyed this games difficulty, but it started to feel like a slog around the middle part of chapter two. I made it as far as the last boss of chapter 3 before deciding to call it a day, as I was just beaten down and not having fun."
Negative,"Mediocre. Great presentation and spectacle combined with dull and repetitive combat. Things to consider before buying:Plays nothing like God of War. Actually plays like an action souls-like. Actions cost stamina. You have flask with limited charges to heal. You rest to respawn enemies and replenish resources. You can't choose difficulty.Invisible walls everywhere.Your only free defensive option from neutral is dodge. You will be dodging a lot.You have only one light attack chain which you will be using throughout the game. You will also have three heavy attacks and a “combo” attack for each of the heavy attack. All heavy attacks and variants cost resource. A generator/spender system. Encounter design is abysmal if you can even call it like that and is there just for padding out the game. Essentially this is a boss rush game. No interesting interactions or counter play with regular enemies like backstab, tripping, wall slamming. etc. Almost all enemies are designed in same way. They have attack chains, you can stagger them and they get hyper armor afterwards to attack you. You either kill them with light attack chain immediately, dodge their chain and kill them or you initiate with charged heavy and they just die. You will repeat this throughout game.You don't have ranged attack so ranged enemies are pain to deal with if you can't rush them.Inconsistent level design. You can't fall of the ledge throughout most of the game but when there is a specific section of one chapter there you can and will get pushed off the ledge. This will happen multiple times.Some bosses are very cheap and will do things like: grab which will kill you at full health, untelegraphed grab into half heath bar damage, obscuring/restricting arena while doing damage, flying out of reach while doing damage, have weird hitboxes, conveniently will move out or your charged attacks, will steal your flask, will do devastating attacks and/or arena changes or apply status effect unless you have a secret item that will counter it, will have very long attack chains, will have attacks with weird hitboxes, will have infinite attack chain, have invincibility of some kind.The last chapter has huge drop off in overall quality."
Negative,souls-like difficulty. not recommended for casual gamers.
Negative,"I was told this game was like the God of War, but it is more like Elden Ring, which I passionately hate. It is too difficult from the get go. I am asking for a refund."
Negative,"No story, no plot, just endless impossible boss fights with no goal. Do not recommend."
Negative,are we serious with this?
Negative,"Lot of repetition in attack moveset, however game looks beautiful and bosses design are good."

Skip shaders got in game got to 1st fight DEATH TO PC HARD CRASH Like who tested this Get your money back devs So at this time refunded and a big nope
Negative,My game is crashing on chapter 2 loading screen. Thinking to refund
Negative,I totally waste of money and time. I'll go back to elden ring
Negative,"This game is a scam. stop china from scamming with BS games and fake reviews. This game is a joke and not fun at all. The combat is stupid. It looks horrible. Cash grab, trick American market. Fuck CCP"
Negative,Performance much to be desired.
Negative,Plays like nails on a chalk bored
Negative,"When the enemy doesn't get dmg stack, dmg reload, dmg stop from me - i give it only 4 - for visual only. Not recommended. (player have dmg stop animation - enemy not)."
Negative,Game states full dualsense controller support.Game only supports dualsense through steaminput. You can change the glyphs manually to look like dualsense.Fun game the parts that I played
Negative,"this game is very cool. I want to love it but it keeps crashing, I played 40 hours of the game with very few issues and then it started crashing at the end of boss fights or during important cut scenes forcing me to beat a few very annoying bosses more than one time because of a crash. Also the level design is kinda lame, and there are lots of invisible walls that made exploration a drag. If they fix the crashing I would recommend this game, until then, stay away, it will only break your heart."
Negative,"The game Looks nice, The graphics are beautiful. That said, i have performance issues, where light is too bright, and the dark too dark, and whenever i Mess with the Brightness it gets ultimatley worse, where the Light is tolerable but i just dont see anything anymore. Worldbuilding is fast, extremley so, if you only could actually enjoy it. For a game that is advertised as ""Soulslike"" (spoiler it not) there are just too many damn Invisible walls. It makes you not want to explore the world. Cause every minute or so, when i see a cool cliff or a nice plice you can be sure you will run into an invisible wall. For me thats just poor worldbuilding in a gameplay sense. Thers plenty of ways to etablish a fast world with boundaries without invisible walls. The Combat system is okay, i can enjoy the fights, and they arent too hard. As many other stated there are some controller based input lags, or animation locks, even if you dont spam buttons. Some animation just take way too long till you can actually dodge for the Fast paste fights the game wants you to have. If you want a Linear game, that leads you through an amazing amount of hard based boss fights this game is for you. I will play it till the end since i payed for it, but for me it was not worth the Price so far, maybe my mind will change with future patches and further into chapter 3"
Negative,"This game is much worse than promoted on so many levelsupd: no, it's downright trash, composed of quixel bridge assets, no optimisation whatsoever, lumen cannot be disabled, severe ghosting due to DLSS (TAA), and on top of that we get a mediocre sekiro cloneWhoever was responsible for level design on this game should get fired and never let develop games ever again. Trees growing out of the cliffs, randomly mashed quixel assets that don't even match by color. Sometimes there are 3-4 packs used in one place. No virtual texture blending, but lumen yes yes yesLight is pretty much static and could be baked, but no, it's dynamic for some reasonAuto exposure in on another level in this game. It's extremely off, pitch black shadows, some areas are so bright you can't see anythingAnd i'm not even mentioning smaller issues like terrain stretch, misaligned objects, useless invisible walls and so on and on, countless. It doesn't take a genius to understand the quality of this game. Which is alarmingly low, considering all this weird hype and price tag.      As indie game, not bad, maybe even good. AAA - not a chance. Some student project more like it. Just copy-paste souls games, add some boring characters, mash together all the quixel assets and you're done. Would recommend on 50+% discount only"
Negative,"As much as I enjoyed the nostalgia, I cannot recommend this game.- Game play is repetitive, I get bored very fast and didn't bother new game plus- Storytelling: they try to learn from souls and god of war game and end up terribly mixing it. I barely understand the motive of the bosses and the world around them. And the stories from the bestiary further make it too vague. They indeed really put a lot of effort into storytelling, but how they tell the story is confusing to me.- The beautiful graphic and environment design cannot be an excuse for neglecting those two above. I personally find Sekiro has more 'life' in the environment and art direction- RPG elements is built in the impression of 'Action RPG'. They also tried to pull in elements such as  ""set bonus"" and ""skill tree"" which makes an already simple game a bit deeper, but not really deep enough to fully create builds ourselves.You should wait for this to be on sale, otherwise it is not worth it."
Negative,"There's a permanently missable hidden boss fight, that requires you to get a random rare drop from an enemy to even be accessible. I spent hours looking for a boss I missed. Yes, I'm pissed off. That is all. Added after finishing the game: The game is generic, formulaic garbage. If you've played new action games in the recent years, you've already played this game as well. It shares all the problems with modern action games: delayed attacks combined with only one universal defensive method, multi-enemy encounters in a game designed for one-on-one combat, a bunch of fancy moves but no enemy hit-reactions, meaning you can't really use any of them very often and the list goes on. Moving on to enemy and boss design, as mentioned before, the enemies almost exclusively have delayed unreactable and uninterruptible attacks. They have a ""flourish"" animation preceding the actual attack as a signal to the player, but the attacks themselves are unreactably fast and you need to know the timing beforehand in order to deliberately dodge them. Therefore, whenever any enemy or boss does an attack you haven't seen yet, you will either get hit by it or guess the timing correctly, there's no skill involved. And the goal for every bossfight is to just sit there and take a beating while you memorize the dodge timings. After the boss is dead, everything is the same, you're not better at the game, you didn't learn anything significant, you didn't grow as a person. You simply memorized a bunch of very context sensitive timings and gimmicks, and pressed the dodge input with the correct timing. Yippee. Keeping that in mind, one might suspect that the game is really hard. Well, it's not. You are the monkey king after all, one of the most powerful beings in the world. Which means most bosses are just going to smack you around for a solid 3 minutes with their delayed bullshit and then just die anyway, begging the question ""what was the point?"". I feel like I've had enough visually impressive spectacles devoid of any purpose for a life time, just from this game alone. Because there's a lot of bosses. And unlike ""masterpieces"" like Elden Ring, this game doesn't repeat bosses other than a select few. Yes I'm dissing Elden Ring in a negative review about the monkey game. Anyway. The level design is just kinda there. It's not good or bad. Some levels are on rails, others are fairly open. Invisible walls everywhere. Sometimes you look at a cliff and go ""I wonder if I can jump down there"" and the answer is ""fifty fifty"". Can't remember how many cliffs I checked only to have the game rub its invisible pengas on my face. And the MK does a ""whoa don't wanna fall down there""-animation, unless the devs specifically want you to be able to fall to your death, then you'll just fall to your death. Actually nevermind, the level design's pretty bad. Overall, Wukong is just another game overhyped by a bunch of people who were never gonna play it. Coupled with its popularity in China, being their first game with a triple A budget, you get a game with these insane player counts. If you like visually impressive spectacles, then the game might prove to be a worthwhile experience for you, but I doubt anyone looking for that is going to sit through 532 words into a steam review to find that out. If you're looking for a great game of substance, then I would suggest you look elsewhere. And remember to give me all the clown awards for daring to criticize a thing you associate with positive emotions."
Negative,The input lag & stutter in a high-end (4080 super) pc is unacceptable.I'll wait for a patch before continue playing this.
Negative,"I was really enjoying the game but it kept crahsing constantly out of nowhere. When they fix it and Im actually able to play it, ill come back and review my review."
Negative,Did not play for long but just wasn't what I expected. If your looking for something challenging this really isn't it.
Negative,"I was expecting a souls-like but its just another god of war/assassin's creed/generic AAA shit game. Are everyone expectation that low ? Yes the game is really beautifull but gameplay/gamedesign/worlddesign cmon ! Also, after the intro, you start the game and close to you there is an invisible wall, like, for real ? What year it is ???Hopefully, all this problems are visible from the start so i can refund it :)"
Negative,"EDIT - After Steam refused to refund me, I decided to play through the entire game to attempt to 'get my money's worth'. Finished it, and my opinion below has not changed a bit. In fact, my overall opinion of the game is worse.Terrible enemy design. There is a difference between intelligently designed enemies/bosses that are truly difficult (think Dark Souls/Elden Ring). However, the devs of this title believe that cheap insta-grabs, random lock on disengaging, insta teleport across the map, AOE that is literally not visible is what makes 'difficult' enemies. I could go into a lot of detail, but just know if you buy this, you'll experience it throughout the entire game.Story is virtually non-existent, half baked at best. The best I can say about this are the animated cutscenes between chapters - which don't have much relevance to the game itself.Combat is so clunky - especially during boss battles. I'll literally just be walking, I press heal during my window before a troll move (very frequent) - and my idiot monkey does nothing. Happened ALL THE TIME.The crashing never stopped. Crashed in the middle (virtually at the end) of a boss battle. Crashed during many boss battles as well.I can honestly say this is the WORST 'big title' / 'higher price' game I've EVER played.-----CONSTANT CRASHING makes the game even more frustrating to attempt to play than the horrible/lazy enemy design. I'm on a high end PC so my system is not the issue.Steam won't allow me to refund as I played 11 hrs at time of review - mainly due to the Overwhelmingly Positive reviews here, which must be China farmed as this game is lacking in so many aspects aside from the CONSTANT crashes.I'm going to keep this brief but I hope you take my word for it if you are debating on purchase.The first clue that the devs were lazy was the English version not matching the mouths of the characters like the OG Godzilla movie. Second clue is the map design. They have SO MANY 'invisible walls' that is really annoying when trying to explore an area. Small rock ledge? NOPE, you can't jump on that! This rock? NOPE! It looks pretty, but as a player it is incredibly annoying. Third clue of laziness are the hitboxes. For one example, there are enemies with shields in one hand. I time my attacks when they reach in the air to slam the shield. My attacks are literally hitting the legs/mid section of the enemy. However, I'm doing damage to the shield bar. Why? The lazy devs programmed this shield to simply be ""all attack from the front"" vs ""all attacks from behind"". If that is the case, make an enemy that has an armored front or something, not one that is holding a shield.Bosses are lazily done. Think ER/ Dark souls where some attacks would be so similar, or the timing was odd, so that on its own made it a creative challenge to battle. Not in Wukong. Its just constant spam chain attacks. Sure, some of them look cool - but thats what they are focused on - looking great - so they forgot about the basic (or don't even know) gameplay mechanics.I'm seriously shocked at the 'Overwhelmingly Positive' reviews after giving this an extended play, practically assuming it would grow on me. My only conclusion is there is something fishy going on here with the reviews.$60 down the drain. I wish for games Steam refuses to refund, you could just give them to someone (its how it would work in tangible form). And to that point, I will begin to consider other platforms due to these policies. It should be a case by case basis - and in mine, the last straw was the consistent multiple crashes EVERY TIME I played.If I knew this would happen from the onset, I would have requested a refund immediately."
Negative,"First off, I want to say that at its core, this is a fantastic game, and I was especially surprised by how damn good it looks while still running incredibly smooth.Unfortunately, the combat system is the main reason why, for now (I'm open to revising this review in the future!), I'm giving the game a negative rating. I'm not a big fan of Soulslike games, and it's definitely noticeable that this isn't just a Soulslike.Yet, it still frustrates me like one:You're constantly trapped in some sort of animation, and there's absolutely no fluid combat feeling. Even though the game technically runs very well, it somehow feels like the char reacts infinitely slow to my inputs during combat, so much so that I’ve definitely dodged enemy attacks, but the response time was so slow that I still ended up dying. The game is supposed to be difficult, of course, but this is just frustrating. And honestly, I have absolutely no energy to waste my time repeatedly trying the same bosses just because the combat is slow or doesn't respond to my inputs.Another negative point is the complete lack of direction. You have absolutely no idea where you're supposed to go, and you can end up spending 10-20 minutes just trying to find the right path while running in circles. I'm not sure how this could be fixed without implementing a map or something similar, but as it stands, it's too time-consuming for me. I simply don't have the desire to deal with that after a long day at work; I want to play and relax. Unfortunately, the current experience with Black Myth: Wukong is anything but relaxing, and apart from the fantastic visuals and excellent atmosphere, it's more frustrating than fun for me.I sincerely hope there will be some improvements. Maybe some things could be implemented as optional features, since there are clearly thousands of players who seem to enjoy it just as it is. I think I'll set the game aside for now and check back in the winter because I really want to keep playing it, but definitely not in its current state."
Negative,i just dont think this game is for me
Negative,Keep on crashing. Waste of time
Negative,THIS GAME WILL NOT STOP STUTTERING EVENTHOUGH I HAVE GOOD PC AND MY GRAPHICS SETTING IS LOW
Negative,stupid game with stupid final boss system that can freez me and can't freez him and when do heavy attack he take 0 damege with this glitch
Negative,"Bought it and after 2 hours of Gameplay decided my unit didn't need measuring and requested a refund immediately! Then I read the Partners behind this game tried forcing online Streamers and influencers to follow their rules,,, Do we really need Chinese though control in the Gaming Arena? Best decision I ever made no matter how seductive the Graphics are! NOT RECOMMENDED and for the Micro Units out there... your welcome to keep measuring up! No fun to be had here at all!"
Negative,"Hard games can be fun, but this was not. It is marketed as more god of war than soulslike, but the unforgiving combat and awful input lag on things just made the game tedious.you can't really explore the map, invisible walls everywhere, so the game feels like running a gauntlet rather than exploring a world. I made it past the first couple of bosses before I realised its the same buttonmash combo for the whole game."
Negative,"Way to difficult and unfair for the random casual player, especially those that look for games to relax. This is just frustratingly annoying overpowered boss fight after bossfight, having to try 20+ times on (some) bosses that can attack indefinately, some that will even resurrect after you finally manage to kill it....and can AND WILL 1-2 or 3 shot you, while you do nothing but try to dodge their 50 front to back attacks before it leaves an opening of a second or 2.  DO NOT BUY if you are a casual player, this is hardcore diificulty"
Negative,"Asking for a refund after playing the game for about 7 mins, got error that I don't have enough video memory to play the game during the loading of shaders.  Finally got past the shader issue by putting windows power mode to ""Power saving mode"".  Got super stoked it was going to work only for it to continue to crash after the opening sequence fight and introduction to ""Chapter One"". BTW I am operating on a 13900K with a 4090, DDR5 5600 ram, and gen4 MVMe's this should not be happening. I may try again later if there are updates to the games I have been waiting for 2 years to play this game and built this PC for just such a game..."
Negative,"If I could give a mixed review I would, but seeing how many reviews are praising this game I will play devil's advocate. The game is soo cinematic and aesthetically great (the OST bangs), but in comparison the combat feels hollow and there's some very frustrating design choices.A lot of reviews compare it to GoW and I agree, but I think GoW specifically does the skill tree significantly better. The skill tree in almost every case feels boring, I don't want to manage 5 different skill trees, with 3+ sub-trees, especially when a huge percentage of the skills are incremental percent changes. The GoW skill tree specifically shins in comparison because every many skill points are a new tool to add to your combos and tool belt. Meanwhile, Wukong is locked to 1 light combo with only 3 possible variations (all being limited by the spirit gauge) just feels hollow, 3 heavy attacks with long windups only available after tearing the spirit gauge. Of the hundreds of skill points you can invest, only 6 unlock new moves. Having 3 separate mechanics to increase stats, the celestial fruit, skill tree points, and gear also seems redundant.That also brings my next frustration which is the weapon upgrade tree. Upgrading your weapon with a newly discovered material will lock you out of a different tree, unless you are willing to lose almost all the materials spent upgrading. Just allow people to craft separate weapons each time.My final complaint is the camera and some boss designs. Like most souls-likes, the camera is bad. But worse than the average soul like, in an attempt to be cinematic, the camera has inertia. When a boss is locked onto, and flies off screen or above your head, the camera will attempt to follow, but in the process, both your character and the boss will be off screen. This becomes wildly frustrating when you end up fighting 3+ flying bosses back to back. Additionally, most bosses are just damage sponges, which on its own is fine, but becomes very obnoxious when you fight flying bosses that only give you a damage window every 30+ seconds. Overall like 6/10, 10/10 cinematicly and graphically, but the frustrating combat design choices have me question if it is worth completing. I kind of would rather just play Sekiro or GoW"
Negative,"game just goes from boss fight to boss fight with nothing in between, no story, no map to explore, its lame"
Negative,"lord, this game is difficult"
Negative,"Crashes all the time. Can't play, can't refund. Waste of money.I have RTX 3060 6GB, 16GB RAM, i7-12700H"
Negative,"The game is a massive let down. complete trash. The combat is overly simplistic, the story is lackluster, the hit boxes are complete trash and the movement is embarrassing. Combine all this with the fact that you cannot enable all graphic features or the game crashes constantly. Wait for this game to be discounted it is not worth the money."
Negative,I do not think the current state is worth the money at this time. I have issues with some of the play style choices. Great story and graphics but the specific play style does not cover all players and how they play imo. Some adjustments should be added for all play styles. Just one example: charging the heavy attack. I never use this and would like to see a talent to make that more instant. (Speeding up the charge speed talent especially in a boss fight does not help) Then I have heard this in several videos and have experienced input lag myself not to mention it. That may be the port to PC. Think most reviews complaining are from PC.
Negative,"I hate to do this, because it is in fact a fun game MOST OF THE TIME. Visually breathtaking, story is pretty badass, soundtrack, enemy design, boss fights, all top tier. But sadly, all of that is completely overshadowed by the fact that it is a plague of invisible walls, absolutely atrocious level design, and a dumb crafting system. Made it all the way to chapter 6, but cannot hype myself up enough to push through... The amount of invisible walls and pointless backtracking due to the absence of a map, and the absurd amount of time you have to put into simply farming basic medicine materials is ultimately what killed the entire experience for me."
Negative,"The game really isn't what you'd expect. It's really pretty, that's a given, but that's about it. The level design isn't clear and is full of the kind of invisible walls that make little sense. The combat is much more simplistic than you'd expect, with most of the variety coming from limited-duration transformations. My biggest gripe is the story. Granted, I'm pretty unfamiliar with Journey to the West, but the game provides little to no context regarding what is going on or why. For example, you meet a guy with a big gourd on his back early on. Ok! I heal from a gourd! Does that mean I get a tutorial on how to upgrade my healing item? Nope! He writes something on your gourd and now you can apparently eat ghosts or something in exchange for super moves? I feel like I'd have liked this a lot more if the game did a better job at explaining things to the player."
Negative,"-Graphics: They are so good it's bad for the game. It makes no sence that a game so visually realistic limits the space the player can go with invisible walls, it get's you out of the inmersion to try to reach a tree and not being able to get to it. I don't have a problem with the game limiting the space of the player and not being an open world but there are better ways to do it.-Gameplay: The first 20 hours is so enjoyable but 2 out of the 3 stances feel so bad I just stopped using them and sticked to the first one. ·The pole stance's heavy barelly has any use cause it takes so long to charge it and you cannot move nor dodge while you are doing it so majority of times enemies are just going to take you down (and there is no timing for using it cause bosses' attack windows are so short for it to be charged to the maximum damage and all of it for doing less damage than the basic stance) not to talk about the variety combo it brings which is just useless.·The thrust stance feel so good and fun to use but it consumes so much stamina for ending up doing less damage than the basic stance (and with worse variety combos as well) that it's just not worth using.-The bosses: Only half of them are fun. The other half have straight up bad hitboxes which makes that sometimes hits you see connecting do not, making you waste the focus you've stored up (and the mana if you used the invis) with no reward and not because you missed but because the game decided that you did. There are also some bosses' mechanics that feel unfair such as some of them doing an undogeable grab that takes half your HP away for changing fases (some bosses do this twice) or spending half the fight flying while attacking. These kind of things majority of bosses have makes the game stop feeling challenging and fun and start feeling annoying, stressful and unfair as majority of bosses are only hard cause of these things and not because the bosses' attacks are hard to time or predict. Overall a dissapointment. First half of the game was really fun and felt like a GOTY but as the game progresses it gets artificially hard by pumping up bosses' damage, annoying hitboxes and unfair mechanics. It's a RPG that tries too hard to be soulslike that ends up being a pain in the ass."
Negative,"The beginning is nice, but everything is repetitive and boring"
Negative,"It's a good game, but nothing special.The price is too steep for a recommendation, get this when it's on sale."
Negative,"I want to start off by saying i am not the most experienced with these exact type of  games nor this title outside of internet hype. Understand my experience may not be common and my issues may not be a problem with the core game play. That being said in my first day of playing i feel i have never been more frustrated with a game feeling broken as i have with this game. As beautiful as this game looks every input feels incredibly slow, sometimes just outright does not register the input. And no it is not my controller as it is less than two months old and has no issues with other game and testing, as well as my computer has plenty of performance and does not have issues with other games. I have also considered the possibility of the slow reactions being part of game play mechanics to make things more difficult and while this i'm sure is the case in some scenarios, there are times where movements differ from the inputs i am giving, or even when no action is occurring it takes multiple inputs to make the action happen. I have even had issues getting into menus where i had to press the menu button several times for it to eventually pause the game while nothing is happening. This all maybe be individual bugs i am experiencing, and my issues will probably never be seen."
Negative,The game is kinda mid...Not worth the hype xd
Negative,Nice theme and looks pretty nice... but pretty boring and frustrating to play. You're much better off with something like Jedi Survivor.
Negative,"The game is great fun and I really enjoyed playing it. However, since the most recent patch on September 23rd the game refuses to launch from Steam. I have tried every solution I can find on the internet and emailed customer service twice with no reply. Leaving a negative review for now and I will change it to positive once I can play the game again."
Negative,"Couldn't play the game on high end gaming PC.  Frame rate issues, game crashing on opening cinematic.  Tried several ""fixes"" nothing worked.  Had to refund it.   Very disappointed."
Negative,"Beautiful game with what may be an interesting story. Unfortunately, it's also very repetitive, uses invisible walls to make up for poor level design, does little to help the player understand the tools and skills acquired, has little progression, and has a difficulty too high for casual gaming."
Negative,"Losing the fun after long hours of playing. Great graphics and initially interesting fight mechanisms followed by horrible storytelling techniques, sometimes confusing maps, and grinding with mostly repeating combat systems. Also, one thing I always found amusing was that the hero is a monkey, but he is way less agile than any of the other animals appeared in the game..."
Negative,"Beautiful game, visuals, and interesting story telling. The combat however is fundamentally flawed. Perfect dodges still lead to taking damage due to no iframes, many bosses have erratic attack patterns that prevent you from consistently perform your combo. This goes hand in hand with the flawed skill system where half the trees (or even the whole pillar staff stances) are not useful in any of the boss fights. In the end you are left with three moves, light attack, heavy attack, and combining them in a varied/ evading combo...and to execute them you sometimes rely on your immobilize spell. And if it is on cooldown you are just dodging until it is available again."
Negative,"Unbelievable how shit this game is on PC. Serious graphics problems. The game doesn't save my progress, and it keeps crashing every 30 min I play it. I never post reviews about games even if their bad, I only post about games when they are genuinely unplayable. I hope everyone else who buys this game doesn't face the same problems I did. I hope they never have to experience it because they don't have to buy this game. It's not a hard game, quite enjoyable when you do actually get to play it. If you really want to buy it, don't waste your money on a PC that the game won't let you use all of it, instead get it for playstation. Very dissapointing I drop $65 dollars on a game and it can't even do the simplist of things, like SAVE, SAVE MY GAME. It's really fun and all but when I beat a boss 4 times and the game keeps crashing and I have to keep restarting the same boss fight over and over again, it's very frustrating, again, not cause it's hard, but because it is genuinely unplayable."
Negative,"Alrighty, this is coming from a soulsborne lover. This game looks great and all and i really love the idea, but i have spent 4 hours in this game and pretty much hated every boss fight since they are pretty annoying, not difficult, espicially that lightning frog. The combat feels... wierd, you are just spamming one button, the staff abilities are a neet idea but you can´t use them most of the time since you´ll get punished for using them, they take too long to use is my problem. the runbacks can be quite annoying on some bosses as well. All in all, i don´t recommend this game and i don´t care if i get hated for it, this game is not what i enjoy.I enjoy challanging games but this game just doesn´t feel right. In my opinion not a game of the year, Elden Ring DLC takes that title."
Negative,"It is not necessarily a bad game, but at the price their are significantly better games in the genre."
Negative,"Stutters like crazy for no reason even though i have a pc that meets the recommended requirements, maybe buy once the game gets optimized, right now tho its not worth the high cost."
Negative,"Story is good, others bad"
Negative,This is boring; I expected more from a AAA title.
Negative,"An indie game with triple A budget:Combat system is very half backed and unsatisfying. Enemy design is very unpolished. So, if you just continue to press the same button like XXX and YYY, you won't be sucked.The visual is quite good, and I guess that's where most budget went. But you better have good a pc because the optimization is not very good.  Level design is very linear, I wouldn't even call it semi open world, so don't expect soul games or god of war.Story is meh, some people may like it, but more people will just forget about it in a few month.In conclusion, this is not particularly bad, it's just very tolerable. What I really don't like is the misleading marketing campaign that got people overhyped. Also there are tons of Chinese player that are politically attached to this game, which bloated the game sales and review.If you can wait , buy this game during discount."
Negative,"Buy it if you want a beautiful world and extremely interesting lore. Also buy it if you want millions of invisible walls, boring and pointless exploration, an environment that feels like you're walking through mud, the requirement to spam the same spells over and over again, and combat that is repetitive, soft, and boring."
Negative,game and voice acting beautiful. combat is donkey dick. :)
Negative,just not fun for me
Negative,Too hard. Not enjoyable to play
Negative,no map. dont want to mod game
Negative,"No Map, werid story telling, Werid Boss fights but at least no DEI"
Negative,"Pretty sure I'm going to get dropkicked for leaving a bad review but this game really is just a bad Sekiro.The good things I liked were the game is by far the prettiest game I've played in a long time. The spells are really cool and the bosses look very cool.The bad is controller support at least for ps5 controllers was laggy af. Alot of the time my buttons felt like they were just not working. I have to spam dodge in order for it to work making it really hard to perfect dodge to a point where I'd get lucky and do it like crazy or just get hit like crazy. I know people who play keyboard and mouse are going to hate but 90% of people play on controller for dark souls games. Only other game I played that had this issue was Sekiro and its the same reason I quit.Next is combat. I know alot of people liked it but perfect dodging over and over and then spamming light attacks is not good combat. Heavy attacks feel like they dont stun or do enough damage v.s just spamming light attacks and spells. Also just doesnt feel like your attacks have any weight behind them. You use skills with focus and the monsters dont even care but light attack them and they are stunned for like 3 seconds. Just feels bad and repetitive. I feel if they copied the feel of a batman, spiderman, ghost of tsushima or even just dark souls game's combat it would of been amazing but it felt more like witcher 3. Guard or dodge then spam light attacks and spells till thing dies. Just not good at all.Story was good but 2 hours in for refund isnt enough time to let me say how good. If it continued to be dark souls like and hide the lore then thats stupid because its a single player story game. That only works for dark souls because its co op and you can pick to not care.4/10 If they fix the controller support for playstation controller lovers then 6/10 but my biggest issue was how basic the combat felt"
Negative,the game crashes
Negative,"i'm gonna try to finish this one and avoid refunding it. but this was a huge disappointment.  it's not an RPG, it's an action game, and a pretty simple one at that."
Negative,"I bought it cause I kept hearing it was soulslike, its not really, its more like an action adventure game, sometimes its soulslike, in that you can  die easily, but yeah I wouldnt recommend it based on the reasons I bought it anyway, but you might like it if you like relatively easy fast paced fights (i do see people say its hard so bear in mind thats just my opinion, some bosses are disproportionately difficult for no apparent reason), its a very linear game and you can pretty much button mash  through half the bosses, it looks nice I guess if that has value to you, but its  riddled with invisible walls in  front of places that look fun to explore but arent, and theres a bunch of permanently missable content if you dont scour the crap out of everything carefully, I would say get it on sale  maybe if that sounds appealing to you, id have refunded but i went over the time limit and they wouldnt refund lol so i just continued"
Negative,"Black Myth: Wukong is a good game at its core, but lacks the passionate personality of other games in the genre. the combat feels jerky, the framerate drops are HEAVY, and the bosses seem like the team put very little effort into each one. each level is so short i end up wondering if the level was even a level, and was perhaps just a “secret” area. the game is great. easily 7.5/10. but does NOT deserve the hype it’s getting."
Negative,the game so suck
Negative,i SUCK AT DARK SOULD
Negative,"Now this game is good. Not gonna deny that. I recommend it if you don't care about the OST. I bought the Deluxe edition with... Selected soundtrack because why give us the full soundtrack but the biggest issue is that it uses an in game music player rather then give us the file.So you can't really use the soundtrack without running the game which is in my opinion make it pointless. Unlike say... Persona 3 Which I only got the game for the soundtrack and had this BS System, at least I like this game so it wasn't a complete waste of money."
Negative,"This game is NOT for the weak. The very first ""mini boss,"" who is supposedly the easiest mini boss (Bullguard) to go against was hard to defeat. It took me a total of FOUR tries to try and beat it. This is my first time playing a game of the genre, so it was extra difficult for me. This game might be fun for people who enjoy similar games to this one, such as Sekiro, but it wasn't fun for me. If you've never played a game like this, DO NOT buy it, it will be a waste of your precious $60. Right now, I'm waiting for Steam to accept my refund request because playing this game felt like a chore, and was almost like complete TORTURE."
Negative,This game would be so great if the actions didn't feel clunky at times with using abilities and if you could break attack combos by dodging. Also Yellow wind sage is the worst boss and boss arena of all time in any video game I have played. The moves are dumb the tornados are stupid. The fact that he can just hop out of the arena and fling stuff at you without you being able to see is crazy and you just cant hit him at all while hes out there just takes me out of the game completely. Its just all up to RNG if hes going to stay in and let you win or not because the arena is 4 steps wide. Sad really because the game is good and looks amazing. Im giving it a thumbs down for the sheer fact that this boss is like that and so early on is just detrimental for the game.
Negative,"Im not quite sure why everyone loves it, its barley fun enough to play.10 hour update, level 24, cannot kill snake boss, cant get anymore potions or do anything except just keep leveling up in the same 20ft area for 3 hours i dont get it, why does the store not restockwhy does no chest or anything restockwhy cant you adjust any fkn setting or difficultyi have to beat some silly boss before i can proceed on to do anything else and thats absolutely shati get some kids have no issues but for a regular gamer being pinned behind such asinine things is beyond me, if i didnt spend so many hours the first day playing i would 10/10 refund but now i have to play it out of spite"
Negative,"The game looks beautiful but sadly that's about all there is. Level design is messy and confusing, with invisible walls that are just frustrating - your super agile monkey all of a sudden decides that a 10 cm rock is too high to jump, making exploration extremely frustrating and giving you the feeling of having to navigate an invisible maze more than enjoying the area.Combat is dull, enemies will go down just mashing buttons, it's extremely unsatisfying.The story is boring and extremely unclear, makes you want to start skipping cut-scenes just out of frustration.I'm seriously considering refunding it. I heard it was a souls-like, then I heard it was more god of war, to me it seems like it does not hold a candle to either of those."
Negative,"graphics: graphics are okay i guess. nothing special. had to buy it on pc so it didnt look horrible. (originally got on ps5)story: i dont really know but you're definitely a monkey. i don't really care for the story in this one.gameplay: open world (outside of bosses) is unfun at best. all you see is a buncha enemies, useless items, etc.bosses: possibly the most unfun bosses ever. (but no, im not bad at video games, hear me out) ive played elden ring, sekiro ds3, ds1, bloodborne and lies of p. when i beat a boss in those games i feel happy, or relieved. in this game, i go ""cool"" and run to the next boss room. now ill explain whyBoss problems: 1. hit sponge. if ive spammed square for 5 hours youd think the boss'd be dead, right? wrong, its phase 2 tiiiime!!!! (over-exaggeration but you know what i mean)2. terrible moves. ""oh hes about to do the sweep attack! alright i practised this."" but wait! you're so very wrong, that's actually the ground pound, dummy! (basically, attacks, especially ones used by big enemies (bear mf) are not telegraphed enough.) problem 3. insane boss damage. ever heard the phrase ""glass canon""? well in this game, you're the glass and the boss is the canon!!! (ingenius, i know) seriously, why do i do nothing while the boss can 2 hit my monkey cheeks!?variety: there's literally 0 variety in this game other than the armour. seriously the only time i was happy in this game was when i got a cool mask (so good fashion i guess, devs.) for weapons you're limited to just different staffs with crappy designsqna: ""are you gonna keep playing the game?"" yes, with wemod enabled.Bye Bye now!"
Negative,I wont recommend this game to anyone until the developers learn how to be competent and make it where the controls work the way they are supposed to. When i play games like this and dodges wont dodge and attacks wont hit then the game is absolute trash. I was looking forward to this game but i am extremely disappointed because it is just another Dark Souls rip off where the mechanics and controls dont work the way they are intended. Fix the game mechanics and make it where the controls and shit work.
Negative,"I am so tired of games thinking difficulty is what makes a souls game good. This is the worst excuse for one I have ever played. There is no joy to it. It is nothing but back to back boss fight after boss fight. Its all linear and the paths between the bosses have seldom enemies if any. All the bosses are over powered and there is no where for you to grind to get up the level needed. The most maddening thing about this game is that Its fucking Wukong, the most OP character in almost all myth, I got this game cause i wanted to be tho overpowered monkey king, not get my ass kicked in boss fight after boss fight. There no side quest, there is only sparse few craftables to collect for making armor. I have never been so let down by a game as to think that a refund was not enough. I want to be compensated for the time i lost waiting for and playing this game. I would say save your money for the mods to make it better but I dont think even they can redeem this game. Its only saving grace is that it is visually satisfying, IF you have the machine to run it."
Negative,"I'm aware the negative reviewers are a microscopic minority but.. yeah.Writing this a bit after the start of Chapter 2:Do you enjoy spending 15 minutes staring at the screen when your character takes that long to get up from a hit ?How about getting caught, mid combo, by an archer who shoots like a machine gun, from a far off rooftop ? Whilst you're forced to watch how you become a pincushion, because you cannot staff spin due to stagger stagger stagger...Then this is the game for you !Combat is shallow, lacking substance.It feels you start with negative 800 poise, whilst most enemies have 5 million.I bit into the hype of this game, being a Souls veteran - but this is the first time I felt dissatisfied after killing a boss.And that says a lot in my opinion."
Negative,"First, there is no map in the game. This is terrible because you can get lost and not know to go.Second, you cannot just stop playing the game whenever something in life needs you to stop. Always will revert back to the last check point.Third, the game is just a linear railroading. This sucks for a game with endless boss fights, as you cannot skip them or come back when you have leveled more."
Negative,"Unplayable on PC. Input delay that can be measured in human lifetimes is probably the single worst thing that could exist in a souls clone. The game routinely ignores inputs for entire seconds at a time, even when absolutely nothing is being done that could otherwise occupy your character. For example: There is a very solid chance that pressing the heavy attack button versus an idle boss/enemy does absolutely nothing for long enough that the enemy has already started an attack, only to lock you into the uncancelable heavy you pressed four seconds previously. Just pathetic."
Negative,Frustrating and difficult game.  Got stuck on one of the first few bosses (the white huge dog in a temple).  Tried a dozen times but still could not beat him.  Some attacks from every boss are extremely difficult or simply impossible to dodge.  I don't understand why the game developer did not offer difficulty settings as not all gamers are pros who enjoy extreme difficulties.
Negative,"Start with smooth fps (no crash) then  update to Version: 1.0.8.14860 (crash every 3 - 10mins). Today , version 1.0.9.15179 still crash. Smooth game and devs patch the game till unplayable, speechless. Crash game of the year."
Negative,"It's a fine game. I love the fact they gave Sweet Baby Inc the finger. I love that there isn't a battle pass or anything like that.  The graphics look great. The optimization seems, ok.  Bosses are challenging.  My issue is people are talking about it like it's Monkey Jesus.  Like it's the best game of the year. Like it's a souls-like.  Like it has such a perfectly written and compelling story... It's none of those things.  It's a ""kind of souls-like ish... hack and slash."" There's no real build diversity or alternate ways of playing or attempting things with different weapons.  You just go from one boss, to the next boss a few feet away, and repeat.  It's not a bad game.  It is just nowhere near as good as the review scores and hype is making it out to be.  The score needs to reflect the quality it actually is.  I'll change my review to positive once it levels out around Mostly positive, which is what it is.  Mostly Positive or Positive.  It's fine.  Even good.  7.5/10 I'd say.  Just not as great as people are making it out to be."
Negative,"Garbage Timer Gated piece of shit game. Glorified Unreal Engine Graphics Demo with about 30% of a game put in the middle of constant timer gated seriously stupid boss  fights. Combat is stale and boring by the third level. Equipment is trash and does literally nothing for you for anything that approches fair play. Potions? Timered. Dodging? Timered. Take one step? Timered. Beyond bad. That and the amazingly blurry graphics of the new cinematic unreal engine games that come out for a one size fits all, so im forced to accept the crap the industry doesnt want to innovate for. Spent over 3 hours modding this piece of shit just to play this? Literally all levels are Asian mythological themes w/ different biomes. 1 lvl = Asian mythology with trees. Second with sand and third with snow. Etc etc. Snoozefest by the third level.Fights literally give me no incentive to care about dodging as there are no rewards. No counter attacks, no executions attacks, no critical hit attacks, no real interesting combos as you cannot spam spells because of this timer gated piece of trash, and nothing to keep me interested in doing perfect dodges. Like thats all you do is perfect dodge and then maybe 2-3 light hits for 3% of the bosses health then rinse and repeat. Then all you get is a shitty weapon, armor, crappy transformation, or something else you dont care about. I got one transformation from a boss i fought for over 10 rounds just to do NO DAMAGE per hit when transformed because im not fucking built into EVERY SINGLE skill tree! Transformations should literally be easier to upgrade than that. Its a totally broken part of the game. They entirely suck to use in any case.If youre a timered type of gamer and you think that means anything real, please do buy this game. Im sure itll make you think your good and is totally ""fair"" to fight one boss for 10 rounds just to get nothing in return."
Negative,"Never in my life have I seen a game be this overrated for political reasons lmao. i dont care if its ""anti-woke"", this shit is MID"
Negative,it's a souls-like
Negative,"Went into this game expecting a masterpiece. Was very dissapointed. Game starts off pretty solid but with some impossible to ignore performance issues, especially during the cut scenes. I thought this would go away but it stayed throughout the entire game. 80% of the time in cut scenes in this game the screen will literally just be straight frozen because of the fps tear/lag. You can't actually see whats going on in most of the cuts scenes in this game. The lore seems to be all over the place and you don't know what you are actually fighting with in most of the boss fights. This game is a boss rush which back to back to back bosses, in rooms right after each other with no build up whatsoever, that are mostly garbage design, being either way too easy and quick, or just a long drawn out gimmick fight. The checkpoints in this game are placed horribly. You will kill a boss with no hp left and have to run past 30 more enemies to make it to the next checkpoint, meaning if you die you just have to run all the way through the previous boss arena again for no reason. There are some instances where there are two checkpoints within 20 feet, and other instances where you feel like you have foughten an entire army of enemies and been running for an hour with no checkpoint. Another thing this game lacks is the variety for your character. In games like Elden Ring you can change up your weapon type, use different spells, and use upgrade points to further different attributes, which can make it so much more fun, and gives much more replay value imo. Overall this game doesn't even feel like it was tested for the most part, with some bosses being just pure aids spamming the same projectile moves for the whole fight, while there are also tons of bugs and glitches like falling through the map, or even getting on the game to have to replay some of the bosses you have already defeated, because it didn't save your progress."
Negative,"as much as i mostly enjoyed this game i just cant bring myself to leave a positive review.i started playing this game on my laptop rtx 4060. After a few crashes my laptop straight up shut off. left it for half an hour and came back to switch it on. completely dead. this game killed my new laptop. bricked the GPUit looks ggreat. and the enemiies reacting to heavy attacks is pretty cool. the reasons for the bad review are as followthe combat system and skills seem fun but later in the game they are just punished and become useless. majority of later fights just become a test of endurance as you will run out of mana and light attacks dont do enough damage at all. so you are left to constantly dodge the enemies onslaught of barely readable attacks until u eventually die. i mean 10 attacks with a 1 second delay then another 10 attacks. it becomes a rolling simulator. new game plus then becomes super easy with ring of fire and rock solid spellthe amount of crashes in this game are a nightmare.chapter 2 the end boss is just ridiculous unless u have a secret item u will never find without a guide. i mean the difficulty spike is nonsensical. also im this fight there are invisible walls which the boss can pass through continue attacking u while u cannot touch him. i died to this multiple times. straight up brokenalso input lag or ""not storing inputs"" is a bad design, often a heal or well timed dodge just does not execute"
Negative,"I'd love to recommend it, there's good points and it's a stunner visually. However, irritating technical issues far overshadow the good.Invisible walls. Silly me thought those were a relic of the past, well they're back with a vengeance. This game is painfully riddled with them. It caused many an eye-roll when it turned out that flat ground in front of you was actually inaccessible. Saw your heavy attack hit the boss smack-bang, right into its back? I guess you imagined it because that caused zero damage. There are a couple of bosses this will happen with over and over, and over again with. You know the hitboxes are pure trash when you're missing a bear the size of a house. I started to be convinced that there was just something wrong with my controller. I'd have to smash the heal button before Monkey would actually take a sip, for some reason this wasn't an issue in early game but in later bosses it sure was. These things might not seem like a lot, but when they are causing you to lose when otherwise you would have won and there are over 70 bosses in the game? It gets old. The first two chapters were the hardest because those are before you get your broken spells/abilities. There's literally things that will allow you to skip an entire boss phase. That said there are some cheap things bosses can and will do, such a grabs that seem unavoidable, and tracking so good that even if you dodge a move, the boss will instantaneously spin around and hit you anway.I basically only got through this game because I'm stubborn and I love Journey to the West."
Negative,"I honestly don't understand why this game did well. It looks pretty and some boss fights are fun, but that's it. Having completed it, I just can't recommend it.1. There are bosses and quests that can be missed after progressing to certain points for no reason whatsoever. This sort of design should've been thrown out years ago. If something is going to become missable then give the player a prompt so we can do what we need to do first. I'm not going to do NG+ just to kill a handful of bosses that I didn't get to experience.  2. Whatever story is trying to be told, it's failing to be told. Badly. I had absolutely no idea what was going on for the entire play through other than I'm collecting relics belonging to Wukong. Everything else was just nonsensical because nothing was explained. The story hinges on you having intimate knowledge the original myth. Perhaps a Chinese audience will appreciate it but if the developers wanted to appeal to a global audience, they should've taken into account that we're not experts.3. Combat gets repetitive.4. The world is very static and empty. You have next to no impact on your surroundings which I personally cannot stand in an adventure game. If you kill a mythical being, you kind of expect there to be some sort of consequence. Maybe not for every boss but at least some of them.This game would've been great if they'd just taken the extra effort to educate its audience about the characters and plot points of the myth they were referencing. Because they didn't, it felt like I was just going place to place killing stuff in my path. Even with the end of chapter bits where you're shown a tapestry of the things you saw, it still doesn't lend itself to explaining what you've just done."
Negative,"Despite the overwhelming positive reviews I can't for the life of me share that opinion. Visually everything looks nice, but calling it stunning is a bit over the top. The art style is unusual and therefore catching, but in itself nothing that has blown me away compared to other titles.I can't talk about the culture or history behind it, as I don't know anything about it. While it may be a positive point for everyone who is familiar with it, I can't imagine that being the selling point to push through this game.The maps are way too complex to comfortably explore. While movement gets restricted quite often through invisible barriers, other times you walk through huge areas where literaly nothing waits for you.Small enemies are mostly irrelevant, as they die pretty quickly. To compensate that, while progressing the game more and more of them are placed in positions you can't reach or where fighting is almost impossible ( for example archers on cliffs or enemies right next to a small bridge or a ledge) The idea is nothing new but the frequency gets way too much.The main point is the numerous bosses. You spend way more time fighting bosses than exploring, not only because you get stuck at bosses but also because of their sheer amount. At the beginning it felt like a nice new touch but a couple chapters in and I am absolutely sick of it. Every boss feels like a chore. You have to learn movesets over and over and over again, just so 5 minutes later the next boss arrives. I feel completely burnt out playing this game for a while. ""Yes I did it!"" became ""Thank god that's over"" most of the time for me.This is made worse by the whole movement of everything. Enemies like to delay their attacks and seemingly hang in the air. Sometimes they hardly move at all, sometimes they move like gliding on ice despite taking a single step and covering the distance of the whole arena. The attack frequency can get absolutely nuts and you spend like half a minute doing semi perfect dodges before you can do anything again. While on the other hand, most of the time you get about 2 to 3 hits in before they just start attacking again while ignoring everything you do. Hit boxes also get quite weird as you are getting pushed back while attacking sometimes (for example everytime while using the spear or in particular while fighting the chapter 4 endboss). So you don't just have to learn their moveset but also whats kind of quirky in their fight. On the other hand our own moveset is pretty limited and with not much variety at all. Either you are into it or you are stuck with it for the whole game. Instead you customise stats, buffs and a few gimmicks to support your basic moveset. You can respec at any time which is great. But it also feels like it doesn't matter much anyway.All in all I don't really know the target group for this game. Definetly not recommended for anyone who just wants to play a bit casually. But it also feels not really worth to put a lot of effort in, at least for me. I gaslight myself to continue playing in order to get my moneys worth, but looking back I definetly wouldn't buy it again."
Negative,"I don't understand the hype. Combat is boring, the game runs like doodoo, even on a high-end PC, it has insane crashing issues with AMD GPUs (I had to redo the Prologue three times due to crashes), the sharpening filter is cranked to the max and unchangeable (it legitimately hurts my eyes to look at), and exploration is unrewarding as there's really nothing to find. Keep in mind my playtime, I haven't experienced everything this game has to offer, but first impressions are everything, and this game makes a bad one."
Negative,"Wildly overrated, not sure why people are raving about the graphics because they are just mids. Gameplay is meh"
Negative,still can't sex the rock :(
Negative,"Feels more like a concept instead of an immersive game. A myriad of invisible walls make you feel like you are running in an alpha map in the unreal engine editor.  It's so bad that in some maps if you run to the edge you can see the boundaries of the entire map covered in poorly textured objects.Convoluted combat with somewhat questionable controller mapping. A lot of the actions can be animation cancelled, but some trigger ages after you pressed it, making the pacing fall of the cliff. The story is fragmented and incoherent, after every level you just get teleported to yet another 'map'. Nothing is connected in the world. The entire game feels more like a boss rush mod of the actual game that it could have been. Unlike god of war or elden ring, this game does not have any depth or memorable characters, nor any real builds or the feeling of discovery.  The only good thing that it has going for it is the artistic direction.This is a $30 indie game that was pushed to be a full-priced released. For $60 it's very average and frankly not really worth the investment of time."
Negative,"Do not believe the hype. This game is aggressively mediocre at best. Performance is terrible, even on a high end PC with a 4080 and a 5800X3D. All the chapter ending bosses have a gimmick where if you haven't found a obscure side quest the fight is incredibly hard, but not in a fun challenging way. It is hard in a dumb way where it is not a fair fight. When you do find the obscure side quest (after you Google it because the game is beating your ass) the fight becomes so trivial that it is stupidly boring.Out of all the bosses I have fought only 2 or 3 were truly interesting and fair with their challenge, all the others either went down after the first or second try, or they beat my ass 25 times until I looked it up to realise I should have done some dumb as fuck side quest. Graphically the game can look amazing, the eye candy during the Yellowbrow fight in Chapter 3 for example, is the best looking I have ever seen in any game in my entire life, but the poor performance really holds it back. As soon as the screen is filled with the lightning effects the framerate drops instantly from 130ish to below 60. The game also feels really unresponsive a lot of the time during battle. Especially when you want to use your health potion or an item. There is such a delay when executing the buttons for it, that you never know if the game registered it at all, but this will often also have you drink twice because you repeated the input but it was just delayed. The same goes for the spirit move, which is executed by using L2+R2 on a controller, but it often does nothing or only reads the L2 which has you spin your staff like an idiot, so instead of doing a high damage move that often staggers the boss, you flail your staff around and get stomped on. If you use frame generation it becomes even worse with the input delay, so I turned that off immediately.The game has a couple of very interesting mechanics and probably has the best implementation of the healing flask in any game that uses the mechanic. Being able to freeze bosses and stagger them regularly really adds to the power trip this game is going for. Until it doesn't.... The immobilize spell is so powerfull that the devs decided to not make it work on a lot of the late game bosses, making it completely useless.The game is also repetitive as hell, you're just mashing the light attack combo until you can mix in a few heavy attacks and untill you can unleas your focus heavy and that is it. You will save your spells for boss fights because you don't have enough mana to use them during exploration.Level design is terrible. It all comes down to just corridors that lead to maybe a chest or an optional boss. The world is filled with invisible walls, even where they make no sense. It is very poor. There is crafting but not in an interesting way. You collect shit and then you can upgrade your staff. There are no weapon pick ups and only very rarely will you find a piece of armor as loot from an enemy.The game also leans heavily into the ''put some shooters up top and a tough enemy down below'' setup to increase difficulty. It's just not very good.This game got the opposite of a review bomb and most of all positive reviews are from Chinese players with less than 2 hours of playtime.If you're looking for a fun action RPG with a clean combat mechanic and good performance, you need to look elsewhere."
Negative,Poor level design and poor boss design - cool theme though.P.S. where's the map!?
Negative,huge problem with spawn point
Negative,Camera lúc đấu trùm quá khó chịu. Chưa kịp nhìn chiêu của boss đã dính dòn rồi.
Negative,Really wanted to like this but after only 8 hrs got really tired of the boss rush gameplay with button mash combat. Not to mention the constant invisible walls limiting already lackluster exploration.I can see why people enjoy this but it just isn't for me.
Negative,"I have been super hyped for this, especially seeing as its based on Journey To The West. Haven't made it past 5 minutes in game. Im running a 5950x with 32GB RAM, and a 7900xtx, and it literally crashes every single time within the first 5 minutes. I have tried everything- reducing graphics (why though, i didnt pay for my machine to run games at low)- run in compatibility mode with administrator rights- turned off sampling- turning on/off vsync- limited frames to 60- updated everything- ran DISM commands- set process affinity to high/real timenothing f****** works at all! game is optimised like dogsh*t for PC"
Negative,"The game is beautiful and has a great overall theme, but it has this very annoying lack of responsiveness such that the combat is more frustrating and harder than need be. There's this irritating delay and lack of responsiveness when controlling the character that makes the PC version of this game feel like you're still playing on a console with a controller. Like other PC ports in which no matter how fast you move your mouse the on screen character is stuck at ""Console Speed"". Plus the inability to remap mouse buttons while not game breaking is yet another example of a console game which does not transfer to PC. It has souls-like ambition, but failed to deliver."
Negative,Китайская скучнейшая халтура
Negative,"Not my cup of tea.  The game appears to be mostly boss fights strung together by a tiny bit of exploration with very few incredibly easy enemies scattered about.  I enjoyed the theme, the graphics, and the music was just okay.  Probably a great game for people who enjoy the boss fights from other games in the genre, but this isn't something I enjoy."
Negative,"Impossible soulslike, it says adventure, it's a scam and theft, give the money back. With some incomprehensible strange abstract plot and monotony. And also very bad optimization. Shader compilation, 2 hours will not be enough for you to check the game, problems start right after them, the beginning is interesting and easy. Bosses are either easy or soulslike, and the ending boss is impossible. There is no honest demo version. There is no demo version at all. The devs and the store are not honestly presenting the game and do not write that it is soulslike difficulty. I thought it would be an adventure, as they write. On the day of release i read several reviews and no one wrote about souls, but it is logical because at the beginning the game is easy. And on the same day i bought a game that should cost 5 dollars, no more, because of its quality in everything, not to mention its difficulty. Secondly, it should be described honestly. Thirdly, the impossible final boss, this is not even souls, this is a broken game that is impossible to complete.The boss for getting the secret ending is also impossible. Even Wukong's special set did not make it possible at all and all the skills with these bosses.After a couple of soulslike bosses, i couldn't return the game anyway, the ""support"" service refused me, and i decided to check the game and write a review. It was excruciating. Don't thank.If the developers hid some secret weapon or ability in this whole world, it's still unfair. Firstly, I don't know if there is one, secondly, how am i supposed to find a needle in a haystack?! Spend more dozens of hours just running around the world?! And i don't even know if there is one. I went through the whole game, pumped everything up and found everything, read guides and couldn't beat those final bosses. That is, whether there is a way or not is not important, because it is not available to the player. Besides the fact that the game is not described as souls at all, etc.It's amazing that it's legal to sell a game that can't be completed without purchased cheats.It's amazing how many false reviews there are from people who either haven't completed the game or bought cheats and don't talk about it.It's amazing that it's legal to write a description of a game that deceives the buyer.And the most amazing thing is - why? They could have simply added a normal difficulty.I will never forgive you for this and will never forget it, developers and Steam and all the lying reviewers.There should be a law to write in big red letters - ""There is no easy difficulty"".And the buyer should not read reviews, waste his time, reviews of people who haven’t even completed the game or completed with the help of paid modifications, but the store is obliged to describe the goods it sells honestly.Developers are very stupid people, and people in general, they don't know how to make games. I know that they don't play games themselves, only their own a little, and they like it because they play a little and because they created it, they love this shit like their own child. A game since time immemorial, it's something balanced and exciting.. I don't understand how investors invest so much money in amateurs and suckers, I don't understand how such stupid people became rich.You can clearly see it in this ""game"" and store, the best example that some people remained Neanderthals, and it does not matter what nation they are, you can see it in the news. The same level of stupidity is in the gaming industry. The dumbest developer is called a genius. If a person likes to do the same thing like a fool, then he is a fool on that half of his brain. I am a professional player, I have been playing for decades on maximum difficulties without damage. It wasn't for pleasure, that was the job. This difficulty based on replay, it is necessary to study timings, etc., another reality, implausible. And I tell you, there is no reason not to give people a normal, plausible difficulty. Moreover, it should be default. And there is no need to deceive and write an action adventure.. And for such a deception, I would be offended even for free for the wasted time, why are you deceiving me, I would say? I just wanted to play. And this obvious garbage costs 70 dollars. This is real theft and the most offensive and funny thing is that it is absolutely not necessary, which proves their level of intelligence .. on the contrary. These people earn money because they were lucky with the design of the game and because there are simply a lot of Chinese (made in China), who value their myth and turn a blind eye to the deception of difficulty.These are simple, understandable things and if you do not understand them, then you are evil. Steam too. And very stupid, because it contradicts marketability.besides the fact that you are deceiving in the description, it is not clear why? If you believe in souls difficulty, then write souls.. If your game has souls difficulty and you think that souls difficulty sells well, then write souls difficulty. If it sells poorly, then don't make such difficulty. And why lie, for what purpose? If you want good sales and you believe in souls difficulty, then write souls and you will get your audience. If you understand that people won't like souls difficulty, then don't make souls difficulty or add easy difficulty. What kind of crazy, stupid and criminal logic do you have?! By deception you will only get a temporary reward, but then the harsh truth awaits you. Why sell apples to toothless people, meat to vegetarians, etc. Are you crazy or something? You don't even begin to understand how stupid you are... Especially since I wrote a review in the first week of the release of this utter crap, this parody of thinking, this mockery of human intelligence besides this primitive difficulty. You are disgracing the human race. Do you understand how serious this is? This is really a great deal of impudence besides stupidity etc.I am extremely sorry that there are trainers for games. But even without trainers, it is clear that the game is trash, because firstly, there is a deception in the description of the game what does stealing mean, secondly, if people play with trainers, and as far as I know they are paid, what does this say about the game? A person playing a game, it does not mean that he liked it. Maybe he hopes that what he does not like is temporary or he suffers for the sake of another aspect of the game or he is sorry for the money and he tries to complete the game, but he suffers, and does not enjoy or enjoys with suffering in anticipation of changes. Or he completed it with a trainer. Why make people suffer?! This is evil and it is not productive. This is torture, a trap. And deception is theft, in addition to torture, etc.Any normal developer makes 3 difficulties because there is no desire or time or skill or feels bad to play an idiotic and implausible and unrealistic difficulty, easy, normal and hard. Games are for playing and enjoying, not for replaying and suffering. Or a disabled person who really needs games. It's fair, and secondly, you increase your audience. On the new game + even harder. Except for the souls of dumb Neanderthals. Also, easy difficulty saves when the game is very monotonous and boring or it seems that way to someone, or with cheap controls or with some stupid ideas because of which you are killed at every step and you replay like a dumb idiot because of a stupid developer. Read my reviews, I have always written about this and will continue to write. Learn from other developers who are truly talented. This doesn't even need to be explained, it's common sense, as well as instant dodge like in life and plausible damage taking which i always write about. Late skills and lack of ng+, also mentally retarded developers. This is a product for money, it should be available or correctly described in a visible place, without tricks, otherwise it is real theft."
Negative,"Sometimes wanting to like a game really hard isn’t enough and you have to accept that maybe this game simply isn’t for you. I wanted to like this game so much, I’ve been hyped for it for 2 years (I think?). Sadly, that’s a big no for me, although I seem to be in the minority here so make it what you will.The game is pretty, that’s simply a fact, but it’s not always pleasant to look at. Sometimes it’s too bright or visually charged so you can hardly tell where you’re supposed to go, what’s a path and what’s simply a pretty background. So even what I consider the biggest pro of the game isn’t that nice :/Combat is boring as hell, you only have one kind of weapon, a staff, and up to three stances, each with its own heavy attack variant. So it’s repetitive as hell on top of being a bit annoying, since most of your damage will be dealt by making combos, combos that will lock you in animations for you to get walloped by your enemies. I also hate the inconsistency of your attacks. Sometimes your time lock spell will be cancelled instantly, but you’ll still have to deal with the cooldown and the mana cost. Sometimes, for some unfathomable reason, the enemy attack will miss you by an inch when you use rock solid, making this clunky parry mechanic even more useless.Story is inexistant, I’m also curious how little people who haven’t read Journey to the west will understand. For starters, I’m infuriated by the plot of the game: “Sun Wukong died, you need to collect six relics to resurrect him.” Really, THE Sun Wukong died? The 7 times immortal stone monkey that wrecked the heavens and could only be permanently stopped by THE Buddha himself? Sure, whatever you say, game… When my favorite parts of the game are simply its callbacks to Journey to the west, I think it tells a lot about how much I enjoyed this game.In terms of difficulty, the game is really easy. You’ll face a shit ton of bosses that you will kill in one or two tries, kinda like Dark Souls 2 but somehow even worse. Exploration is okay once your eyes get used to the environments. The rewards can be pretty nice.To finish on a positive note, the cinematics at the end of each chapter are easily the best part of the game and each is a delight making worth sludging through this visual mess. The enemies and boss design are also consistently great, and while it’s kinda fanservice, I enjoyed seeing some well-known characters and references to Journey to the west.That’s about it for me, I won’t platinum this one, completing the lists of yaoguai kings and chiefs was annoying enough. Check other reviews or gameplay videos since I seem to be one the only 5 persons on Earth that dislike this game. If you can have fun with it, good for you, maybe it’s just not for me. :/"
Negative,"i cannot run this game at all, i've run plenty of huge games with no issues such as CyberPunk, Elden ring, Ghost of tsushima, RDR2 all with no issues and great graphics. no matter what settings are used this game will not  run even 5 seconds without freezing and lagging. i have a better GPU than recommended so there is no valid reasoning as to why i cannot play this game even on the lowest possible settings. ive spent over 3 hours alone on just trying to optimize the game and now i can no longer return it. (if anyone has any tips please comment i would still very much so like to enjoy this game)"
Negative,"Basically Monkey Dark Souls. Looks amazing and runs OK if you turn off ray tracing, but if like me you don't see the appeal of dying over and over and over then you will hate this."
Negative,Great graphics but too difficult to actually be enjoyable.
Negative,why does the dodging suck???????????
Negative,So you play a monkey but can't climb trees? Poor design /s
Negative,Waste of time for anyone that has a life
Negative,"There's little open world exploration in this game. Instead it's a linear tale of one quirky and (often very) demanding boss fight after another with no way to adjust the difficulty settings. As a sidenote, why is the protagonist Sun Wukong so arrogant and spiteful? Didn't he achieve Buddhahood? If only the game didn't feel tedious after about three hours perhaps I'd care to find out more."
Negative,"We have seen many overrated games throughout the years. But this game....... It is the MOST over-rated video game I have ever played. I would rather be playing any other souls-like i have played that isn't even FROMSOFTWARE. And many of those weren't even good. But I can't bring myself to play this. It hurts even clicking the launch button. I will be questioning why this video game is getting all its praise for the rest of my life. You can call me an outsider, I don't mind that."
Negative,"I've played several from soft and other souls like games. I love many of them. I had high hopes for BMW but the game is both boring and too hard at the same time. Regular enemies are a joke and you can one shot them. They are incredibly boring. The bosses are beautiful too look at but are way too fast, do way too much damage and have lots of delayed attacks. The controls are kind of clunky, lots of animations are delayed and last for seconds, and there are invisible walls everywhere. I love deliberate mechanics, where you have to commit to certain actions (that's what souls games are all about) but in BMW it feels like you're lagging. You often smash into an invisible walls trying to dodge a boss ability that will take 80% of your health. In DS3, Bloodborne and Elden Ring, fighting regular enemies is a lot of fun. The bosses can be hard but the pacing is great. If you feel like a boss is too tough, you can also level a bit more and it's fun to do so. BMW is a boss rush where bosses just feel overpowered and it's not fun to rinse and repeat 100% of the time while you get one-shot, run into walls and feel like your character is lagging."
Negative,"A lot of people are comparing this to God of War or the Jedi games but the characters and plot are just not at all on the same level. It's basically a linear souls-ish game with miniboss after miniboss but the combat is less satisfying imo. Not necessarily bad but it doesn't feel great to play to me. Something about the combat in God of War/Elden Ring/Jedi felt smoother and more responsive to me and it just feels like that's missing here. Whether or not attacks stagger an opponent and when they stop staggering an opponent feels kinda weird too. They'll be getting ragdolled and then suddenly stop caring for no reason other than it's time for them to fight back now. I think having them dodge away or something would have felt better instead of just randomly acquiring infinite poise mid combo.I might just need something to click for it all to feel right, hard to say but initial impressions are mixed. Would give a thumbs sideways if I could but I figure a negative suits the tone of the review more."
Negative,Fuck the tower level
Negative,The hitbox bug in some boss which make me feel not enjoy when fight with those bosses. (Final boss in chapter 4 etc.)
Negative,Another dodge button masher. Have enough of them already. Not for me.
Negative,"First off, I have never liked ""souls-like"" games so right off the bat, this game wasn't made for me.That said, I got the game for free with a purchase of a 4080 super and decided that I might as well give it a go, hoping to be proven wrong and finally enjoy something in this genre that people praise to the high heavens. And, admittedly, it was off to a pretty good start. It felt responsive, ran well, had competent voice acting and music, and generally looked very pretty.Unfortunately, as I ventured further down the boss-grinder-corridor of utter nothingness, the normal problems that I expect of any souls-like started to appear. Sluggish responsiveness, dull and linear progression, some of the most crazy ""button mash-y"" fights that I have ever seen, the monkey deciding to stand around randomly for no discernible reason despite getting inputs like it's an online game with high latency, really wonky combat mechanics featuring my biggest gripe of all time which is constantly being locked in every single stupid animation for ages, forcing me to sit there feeling like I was about to pop a vein while waiting for the apparent privilege of actually getting to play the game, unnecessary running and cutscenes that accomplish nothing other than waste your time, and increasingly ""cheap feeling"" visuals (the game is very pretty, but the lack of environment interactivity and general physics make the world seem very dated and static).All in all, I did not enjoy it, unfortunately. But then again, I did not expect that I would. I can see why people could like it, though. But it's not for me and that's okay."
Negative,"Tbh kinda ok, but not worth the price, the gameplay is basically just fight bosses over and over again, kinda boring tbh"
Negative,game too hard for my small FPS only brain to wrap around.
Negative,"This game is trash, it looks good but the game play is buggy as hell. I don't get the hype for it other than it looking visually appealing."
Negative,"Even though it's an action game, it's very lacking in Feeling of Impact"
Negative,"Not fun.- punishing mechanics- terrible hit box- boss fights uses cheap mechanics to make them""challenging""- inconsistent dodge mechanics- no satisfaction when killing bosses as it doesn't feel like you've defeated them out of skill, but out of luck."
Negative,"*Update* There are a number of PC mods to fix this game a little (funny how players can make these in weeks to fix a game that took years to make). Fixes for performance, a map mod, cancel attacks with dodge, better movement and many more, I suggest checking them out if you are on PC.Its like trying to play Temu Dark Souls with your feet.Input issuesPerformance issuesGraphical glitchesBad gameplayI found that disabling ""allow data collection"" improved the input problems a little.Chapter 3 is awful, a real shame, it started off so well, I wish I hadn't wasted my time.I realized that one of the things about this game that I find disappointing, Monkey is a silent protagonist, anyone who had read or watched any journey to the west knows that the best thing about it is Monkey himself. His brashness and boldness, his humour and endless prattle IS what makes the stories so great and enjoyable. Something that is completely missing in this game.Would you read or watch journey to the west where Monkey was silent and had no personality? No?Then why would you want to play a game of it?"
Negative,"You will spend the vast preponderance of your frustrating time fighting bosses. The game might as well be called boss ladder. Of all the hours you will spend playing 90% of it will be dying on repeat to bosses while you try to memorize their move sets.The game offers a little filler between bosses, and that filler is insignificant. The RPG elements feel mostly worthless, and while the skills you learn will be needed as you progress, the fights themselves demand skill and move set memorization more so than anything else which just turns into hours of time in memorizing something you immediately forget as you progress past each boss. I love the combat, the mechanics, smooth, fluid, beautiful animation and graphics. But for me it is spoiled in the painful repetition of combat failures as you fight the same boss over and over and over hoping to either get lucky or get better. Not exactly a relaxing way to end your day.For many this is what you are looking for. For me, like many souls games, the challenge comes with cheese. You can save yourself tens, maybe hundreds, of painful frustrating hours, in unfun time by giving it a pass. Not to mention saving 60 bucks. Somewhere along the lines video games wanted to become punishing and not fun or relaxing. If that is what you want than this is it."
Negative,Worked first itme i played it know its really laggy dont know what to do
Negative,"Not balanced at all, just a slog between bosses who's attack patterns you have to memorize for hours - forgets that games are meant to be fun :("
Negative,"Game runs horribly. I have a top end gaming rig that is only a few months old and barely get 20 frames a second. Not sure how they are expecting anyone to run this, but I am giving up for now. Maybe they will wise up and fix it to run reasonably on realistic hardware."
Negative,"I haven't been able to proceed beyond the first boss fight so this review is limited. Nice graphics at 4k but look terrible on lower resolutions. Very high end PC required to play this.There seems to be issues with input lag, keys don't respond, game spends time showing animations when I try to move. Three hours attempting to defeat the very first boss (Wandering Wight) has proven this game unplayable on my machine."
Negative,"It has decent combat mechanics and has a rich atmosphere and story. However, I find it really difficult to play because of its performance. It prioritizes a realistic look of 30 fps, over having a stable game. I have a beefy pc already it always ruins my experience"
Negative,"Will the game is good, but it missing a lot of things like the map design is small and I get confuse and lost most of the times, the combat is also short and there's not any creativity on it.If you looking for challenging boss fight game, this is a good choice."
Negative,I was hoping for something more like assassin creed. This game more like mortal combat.
Negative,"Story and visuals are fantastic, pretty everything else was really disappointing and ran poorly.tldr:  3/5 get it on sale. Combat feels meh... even after making an effort to get used to it. The game encourages you to use strong attacks, but implemented them in an unusual way that isn't explained super well in my opinion. Feels like it took inspiration from fighting games that focus on complicated combos which amounted to some interesting ideas that that weren't implemented well. Once you finally figure out how heavy atk is meant to work, its still annoying to use properly and constantly whiffs. I had a similar experience with all other special moves unlocked in the skill tree and ended up constantly respeccing everything back into just health and stamina. I gave up and just used light attack at all times, which made combat far less frustrating, but very tedious.A cut-scene in an early level pretty much directly tell you that you should explore and look for resources or carefully plan how you approach encounters. Exploration is also disappointing.  Constantly running into invisible walls quickly kills any motivation to explore. Collecting resources on the ground is really annoying as you have to carefully stop in exactly the right spot to get the prompt to collect and its nearly impossible to do on the move. Combine that with crafting and consumables feeling pretty irrelevant, killed my motivation to search for resources.  As a result, I completely stopped looking around to appreciate all the beautiful scenery they put everywhere.A (partially) unskippable cut-scene in the middle of a boss fight that most people will probably have to retry at a least a few times is admittedly a pretty minor issue, but still super annoying and unnecessary. This was the last straw for me and I kinda just checked out for the remainder of my short playtime.Really don't understand the hype with this game.  Seems like it was marketed as a souls-like, but missed the mark on several key aspects of what makes a good souls-like and tried to make up for it with fancy visuals. Its ok, but not worth full price."
Negative,Game mechanics are not fully there ive had my dodges make the noise and take stamina but not move at all also spells like to just delete themselves mid use
Negative,Bad game trash mechanics repetitive gameplay
Negative,"Um jogo baseado em ""chefão"". Fora da luta, o personagem não tem uma grande jogabilidade e movimentação realista. O  cenário de fato é muito lindo, mas não passa de um grande mapa gerado por unreal engine, o personagem mau tem habilidade de andar por esse mapa acidentado e bate em paredes invisíveis o tempo. A história inicial é fraca, não há uma guia de propósito a se fazer, vc só segue em frente o tempo todo. As lutas com os personagens ""não-chefões"" são ridículas (normalmente resolvidas com um golpe) enquanto os ""chefões"" em sí, são desnecessáriamente difíceis (nada na jornada te prepara para esses chefões). O jogo podia ser tranquilamente um ""Mortal Kombat"" onde ao matar um chefão, vc parte para outro, por que fora disso, o jogo não oferece absolutamente nada."
Negative,The game got hang and crashed.
Negative,"i have a really good working pc, and it still stutters with the audio and is still very laggy. what the fuck"
Negative,"it looks good and has good story, maybe.love the idea and was full open on this game because it looked awesomeBUT wtf is this gameplay???u totally get thrown in this mush of ultra big invisible hitboxes from walls or more whole places u cant go, random dropped far too easy enemys, random dropped soulless harder opponents and fighting feels like swimming.I really tried to like it but its aweful to me, sorry.its more like final fantasy and NO SOULSLIKE!"
Negative,Controller input lag ruins this game for me.
Negative,"Unironically a good game. story is only interesting if you're invested in journey to the west otherwise it's meh, gameplay is a good mix of linear action-adventure games, and soulslike mechanics, mostly the respawning enemies and the bonfire, although a lot more forgiving and funOverall it's a fun experience, even if it's not the GOTY most people make it out to beI had a good time with the game although getting all the achievements was a pain in the assBut I'm downvoting it *just* because I loathe the third chapter, specially the pagoda realm. Just be wary of that one level, the rest is quite fun, still not worth full price tho, pick it up with a small discount"
Negative,"I don't feel the ""this game is too difficult"" really captures my problem with this. Having played Elden Ring this game is easier but certainly challenging. The issues I have with this game is that there is no ability to reduce difficulty level, you cannot skip bosses, and there are no ways to progress your character further (make them stronger) before fighting the same boss you've die 20+ times to. You just have to suffer and grind it out and perfectly dodge all of the moves while doing slivers of damage. This game is annoying as hell. For someone who is a casual gamer I do not recommend this to those who have a limited amount of time to play and enjoy games. This game is more like a chore than a fun way to spend some free time. Graphically it looks great and runs well."
Negative,Sorry to say but this is overhyped. It feels more like a $30 game. Gameplay is so 1 dimension and you just have to keep repeat same fights until you manage to kill the boss.
Negative,"Unlike Dark souls, this game makes bosses feel unfair rather than a skill issue."
Negative,Id praise this game if it weren't for the horrible frame drops and delayed audio during cut scenes
Negative,"This game is utterly FRUSTRATING, I cannot pass from the first mini-boss just at the begging of the game. I've watched YT videos and all that to see is there is a a way but there is not. Devs MUST include difficulty levels in the game settings for Wukong. There are thousand of thousand of guys ""not talented"" as I am that will find this frustrating as hell instead of fun."
Negative,"The game has so many bugs like the screen flashing black or the whole screen lagging, its practically unplayable half the time. Though the graphics are good and it has a nice storyline, the bugs ruin the whole gaming experience."
Negative,BS GAME CRASH MY 4060
Negative,consistent game crashes during boss fights for no apparent reason and the game always crashes when the boss is around 5/20% hp left it ruins the fun
Negative,erlang boss is bullshit
Negative,died to the black wind king 30+ times cause every time i try to use the immobile spell he changes to spirit form and kill ills me
Negative,"I'm stuck in the game, I can't save the game, I can't continue playing"
Negative,"Selten hat mich ein Spiel, das zu Anfang so toll war, so genervt, gelangweilt und gegen Schluss richtig angeödet wie Wukong. Dieses ewig gleiche Button-Mashing, das schlechte Leveldesign, es wird so richtig mies im 6. Level. Nachdem der Endkampf einfach nicht aufhören will, 4 Phasen hat und immer dümmer wird, habe ich null Bock auf das Ende. Ich will das Spiel nur noch von meiner Platte haben. Sorry, aber dann ist es eben eine ""unpopular opinion"": Wukong beginnt grossartig und endet grottenschlecht."
Negative,There are two ways to play this game:1. Stay stuck on a boss for many many hours get frustrated and get up angry with carpool syndrome or2. Try going back to the beginning of the game and beating every single creature a tenfold over again to get skill points and upgrade. If you enjoy frustrating games with smooth graphics and epic scenes this should be your lifetime project.
Negative,i was very excited for this game followed for years and when it finally came out bought it in an instant and wanted to play immediately. Yet from the getgo ive had way to many issues. how i got as far as i have i dont even know because even with recommended setup it takes upwards of 10 minutes just to load past the main menu it is super grainy no matter what i do with the settings and half the time i cant even move without a terrible lagspike or freeze framing. i had tiny spouts where it ran smoothly and it was my favorite game and overall its amazing but persoanlly? i regret buying this and if i could id return it.
Negative,I am loving the game just finished chapter 5 and everything have been fun but now as i have got to chapter 6 i wanted to go to chapter 3 for those cocoon food for the bug but everytime  i try to fast travel the game crashes. I am writing this after 5 straight crashes. I am playing on a laptop but there were only a few crashes till now. but 5 crashes in a row feels really bad.
Negative,"Minuses:1. making a boss with two health bars and you are doing 10 damage with the maximized attack.as the result, you fight for 10 minutes and then die because the boss did 1 quick as fuck move that youcan't see.2. during 1-2 chapters I tried to watch cut-scenes, but in the 3-4 chapters it just becomes boring and stupid. of course, lore is more understandable, when you know an original story of the sun wukong, but I don't want to watch a separate film to play the game.3. I like the fact that for defeating end boss of 4th chapter you should kill a main boss in the secret fucking area. Why? Because you need that stupid one needle which allows you to fight fair with the bullshit boss which removes half of your stamina in the second phase (and of course u r still doing 10 damage)  (I was level 70 and I killed him only after using the needle 1st try)4. you charged 3 focus points, you try to do a charged heavy attack, boss touches you, and fuck off, u should start all over again, you can't keep your 3 focus points that you can charge by stupid small 10-damage attacks (fuck off if u say that there are other ways to charge). It's okay when it's just 1 point that being removed, but all 3? 5. recommended hardware for the game is a fucking lie. you can have rtx 4090, and the game will still lag from time to time. 6. bullshit bosses: dusk, hundred-eye guy, yellow brow (1-3 cut-scenes during the fight and you lose health anyway (yes, 1-3 because you can avoid some of the cut-scenes using specific spell) and the big-ass boss in this stupid biome after white dragon which can only take great damage in the head (once again, you are doing 10 damage on his legs)7. too much bosses: okay, most of them have unique moveset, but you will defeat most of them after 1-2 tries. the real problem is the bosses at the end of each chapter, so you just making a game longer. most of the regular enemies are easy, the game just becomes a boss rush8. you have three stances, but the main difference is the charged attack, usually you still use a small attacks to gain some focus points. well, sometimes the stance is helpful. for example, when boss runs to much, the thrust stance can be useful in such case.9. monkey doesn't use heal when I click it sometimes, I heard this problem from others too.10. if you want to reach every single path in each chapter, it becomes painful. they say the game is linear, it is, but you can easily get lost, since you have 4 different fucking paths when exploring.Pluses:1. graphics (it's lagging but the game looks beautiful)2. u r monkeythe game is still descent souls-like (go fuck yourself if it's not souls-like in ur opinion), but still it lacks story, better game design and etc."
Negative,"This is a really amazing game in almost every way. The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is fun, the combat is tough but short, none of the fights drag on, and the story is interesting, albeit slightly confusing. However there are a few things that ruin it for me. One, the game doesn't let me fully rebind controls. Come on, it's 2024 and I am still using Autohotkey to bind my mouse buttons, WTF?Two, a complete lack of any navigation or direction. I can't for the life of me figure out where I am! I completely missed the blessed gourd in chapter one and kept playing the game wondering why I could never absorb spirits. There was no indication, no entry in the journal, nothing. I just kept thinking I must not have unlocked it yet, until I eventually searched on google and figured it out. There are key items behind walls you have to break with certain spirits that unlock certain encounter later that you would NEVER EVER find by exploring. The ONLY way to find it organically is by accident if you used that spirit during a fight in the area, or by googling why the encounter in a later chapter isn't triggering. The maps look so samey, there are areas that look completely traversable that are blocked by invisible walls, and areas that look clearly out of bounds that are traversable, leading you to constantly bang your head against invisible walls trying to figure out where you can and can't go. I missed over 2/3 of the chapter 2 map because I thought I would be okay just following the obvious paths, only to look at an interactive map online and realize I had missed about 5 whole areas.Elden ring didn't need a map because the world had enough landmarks and uniqueness to make it hard to get lost. This game has far too many tunnels, similar looking areas, and identical environments that it becomes impossible to ever know where you are. Just completely blindly bashing into invisible wall after invisible wall in hopes that you aren't missing any massive areas or key items. Until they add a map my review will sadly stay negative."
Negative,lots of screen freezing
Negative,Good game but definitely way too overhyped
Negative,"at this point id say the game is soo terrible due to the lack of harmony in the actions such as healing,dodging, pressing the e button on things. im an elder rings guy all the way and want to like this game but when your fighting a boss and he dissapears and you keep hitting the heal button only and no other actions are goin on and to no avail the heal doesnt work or take so long to finally get a heal after spamming heal over and over.  or when you go to use a special move on a boss fight and they constantly just dont apply. ( immobilize one example.) game difficulty not the issue just doesnt jiv well on action transitions. jump also decides when it wants to work or not."
Negative,"Ok so, i will start by saying that i like this game... BUT there are many things i dont like/enjoy about it. I will try to give an honest review from my pov of this game because i feel like i at least got baited by the hype train on this game. for now at least i am halfway through with chapter 2 and i will talk about all the pros and cons i ve met so far.Pros: -game is pretty fun and enjoyable-i like the visuals and sound designs a lot-combat is satisfying-some bosses feel really cool-really cool scenery and backgrounds. by this i mean that the maps look really good visual design wiseCons:-game is pretty hardware demanding-the combat gets a bit repetitive-the level design is honestly GARBAGE. In chapter 2 u get at every big checkpoint around 4 path options which makes the progression extremly hard to track, confusing and honestly frustrating/annoying.-the fact that if u attack an enemy that is near a ledge that u can drop off from u are 90% gonna fall-the camera lock system is pretty bad -the game feels a bit like a boss rush . u just get boss after boss after a long ass path filled with mobs and than more bosses. -the game doesnt really give u clues about begining a boss fight u just happen to get in them completly unprepared without mana and heals-there are quite a lot of bosses in this game with bs hitboxes/animations or aoe attacks that will literarly almost 1shot u-there are a few annoying bugs(might not apply to you) but for me sometimes when i go in the main menu of the game the screen bugs out and feels slugish and flickers wierdly and i have to just alt tab to get this fixed but gets annoying after a whileWith this being said i dont really feel like this game is necessarly hard. If u get stuck on a boss u can just farm a bit of xp or amterials to get a better armour and get it over with, most of the bosses so far(reminder im still in chap2) i beat 2nd try because the game just threw a random boss at me and i went in quite unprepared(no heals or mana). I felt the need to write this review because as i ve told before i felt like i got really baited by the hype train of this game. I dont regret buying this game but IT IS NOT A MASTERPIECE. It has a lot of room for improvement but also a lot of potential. I do feel like this is one of the better game that came out this year tho."
Negative,"Worst Dialog of any game ever , specially with the English with a Chinese accent. So boring , even witch 3 is more fun of a dialog."
Negative,"TL;DR: Overhyped game.This game is not bad, it's just mediocre.Visual style is great at the beginning and become more and more generic in chapters 2-4.Ordinary enemies don't pose a danger to nameless monkey protagonist. Even bosses are not a challenge most of the time.The only challenge is game length.  Distance between checkpoints is ridiculous. Sometime it's too short, sometimes it's laughable long. Checkpoint placement isn't always great. Especially near boss arenas. It's not far away, but almost always you have to run for 30 seconds to arena. And not like in souls games. In soulslike long path to boss is challenge itself. In this game you just run extra 30 seconds to make another attempt.Even though ordinary enemies are no threat they can depleat your MP - it's faster to use ""magic skills"" on some of them then slowly fight them. So the biggest challenge with bosses is reaching them with zero MP.Everythin is odd.Hiden quest lines are almost always odd.Either they are extemly easy - ""extra"" quests in Chapter 1 is activated by ringing 3 bells (yeah not 2 bells from DS1 but 3). And you hardly miss them.Or quests are overcomplecated, e.g. starting Four Loong questline requires you to hit specific wall in Chapter 2. In my opiniopn you have zero clues for that. You only knew that you didn't find important item. Bells from previous example has clear interaction markers and this wall is just ordinarry wall (may be a bit darker than others). And guides I've used tells you that you need to hit this wall in a very specific way.Gear is odd. Sprirts of enemies. Gives you one attack ability and passive boosts. Just upgraded the very first one and completed whole game with it. Armor and weapons. You may find new weapones that are worse than your current one. Poinless new armor that gives you +5% for protection. Curios/accessories. Most of them are wortless. Artificats. The most usefull. Reward for hiden/extra questline in chapter gives you advantage over final boss of chapter.Skills and abilities are odd. You have very limited pool of magic.And you can switch it only at chekpoints. I've completed whole game with first magic skills obtained. Summon your copies + freeze enemy + smash enemy with spirit + transofrm in other creature + repeat on cooldown = no big challenge with most bosses.Fighting skills are gained with level up. And you can always respec.The game kinda asks you to alter your fighting style with better gear giving bonuses to other attack types. However you are not forced to because of weak enemies.The Plot. As far as everybody knows it's higly influenced and based on Chinese classic novel ""Journey to the West"". I haven't read it. And you will not understand most of the game plot without it or google. Minor spoilers ahead (really minor). In prologue you are fighting one battle as Sun Wukong. Then Sun Wukong dies and you begin your journey as nameless silent monkey in order to ressurect him. During your journey you are faced with consequences of Wukong's actions. The problem is Sun Wukong is not positive character in this game. He is not even antihero. He is greedy egoistic narcissist. And soon enough you understand that Sun Wukong is not worth bringing back. However you are forced to. To sum up. It's not soulslike. It's ""ok"" as action game with debatable fighing and plot. Give it a try on sales."
Negative,Probably the most overhyped game ever. Its so boring.
Negative,I *was* going to give this game a glowing review but unfortunately the Great Sage's Broken Shell stole that too.
Negative,take a shot every time you think you've found an interesting side path and run face first into an invisible wall and you'll be dead before you're out of the first area
Negative,Very disappointed with controller support I’m forced to use steam input for my dualsense which is such a delay in action I can’t perfect dodge 🥲
Negative,"After a month of waiting for update to take away crashes, i'm still crashing. I got all the bells and whistles in my PC and still its pooping out. This game is ABSOLUTELY incredible, i just wish i could play it :("
Negative,"Game is over hyped. Besides graphics (which arent even that crazy), game gets boring fast."
Negative,keeps on crashing!!!
Negative,This game had so much potential but it is all ruined with one boss. The yellow wind sage is the worst boss in any game and this is coming from someone who has played every single souls and souls like game game there is. the whole fight you can barely see him because of the constant sand that is everywhere. and the third phase of the fight is so dumb with a constant tornado and the fact the arena  is shrunk for some reason. All in all worst fight in gaming history.
Negative,"nothing special, cool story if you are into chinese mythology but other than that, pretty bland game. invisible walls ruined it, i dont mine linear games but dont put invisibel walls to limit the map, make the map limit itself."
Negative,"still lot of bug and crash. every time play the game for 15 minutes or every time trigger some event boss, when play it a while, its crashing and force close by itself. even I try to follow all the instruction from the support web or even Steam Support. its still lot of bug and crash even though I didn't use any mod at all. Please fix it. I Already update all the driver start from the windows until the Graphic card driver."
Negative,"The graphics and game play are good. However my biggest complaint stems from the lack of direction or guidance. No map content. Some players may enjoy free range and exploring, however after about 40 minutes of being stuck and not knowing where to go, I gave up after this."
Negative,"this game is good until you realise 50% of the bosses are hidden and require a guide to find, i would've gave this game a 8/10 but i wont play it since i don't wanna follow a guide on YouTube on how to progress. so i will give this game a solid 2/10. I hope the developers realise hiding this many bosses and doing things so absurd to unlock them is awful."
Negative,The final boss ate me out and took my gourd
Negative,shouldve scrapped this disgustingly awful game at chapter 3. one of the worst experiences ive ever had
Negative,"ill put a 3/5 stars,the game is good and phenomenal,it just crashes every 2 seconds,it crashes at some good parts and i promise itll make you wanna rip your hair out"
Negative,my game keeps  crashing at the start of chapter 2
Negative,"Bosses do grabs out of nowhere with 0.2 sec animation, even if you perfect dodge or parry them, they will grab you anyway. No matter what you do.Perfecting dodging some attacks will still damage you.Lot of garbage design deicions and cut corners in an otherwise great game that makes the experience bad."
Negative,"Pros:- gorgeous world- great portrayal of chinese mythology- the 2d cutscenes are amazing- fun player combat mechanics- great skill tree & gear upgradesCons:- almost every single cutscene lags to the point where the audio is unsynced- i could make a cup of coffee and play with my dog during loading screens and it's still not done- level design is lacking. boundaries are unclear and inconsistent with tons of invisible colliders used- lots of confusing and unnecessary branching paths that encourages missed content- some bosses are easy whereas some are really unfair. who decided it'd be a good idea to reduce the player's hp during a cutscene? you should never penalize a player for something that is not within their control. also, expect to have big differences in the animation you see vs the exact time you should dodge. in some cases, it's also definite that you'll get hit. overall, i had fun at the earlier chapters but the boss fights in the later chapters has caused a burn out. is it GOTY quality? i'd say not at all. do not expect elden ring from this game because it is far from it but still worth trying if you're into chinese mythology."
Negative,"My main issues with the game include persistent lag (despite my computer meeting the hardware requirements), a lack of player damage, and bosses that frequently slide around during fights. Overall, the game feels poorly balanced. For instance, after reaching level 30, I no longer feel any sense of progression. Instead, it seems like I'm hitting a glass ceiling—whenever my damage increases, so does the bosses' health, making it feel like I'm stuck in the same place. This is in stark contrast to the Souls series, where each level tangibly impacts my build, allowing for strategic meta builds focused on specific stats. In Wukong, however, character development feels stagnant, as if there’s a deliberate cap on how much control the player has over their build."
Negative,I really wish combat was better - for a game with amazing set pieces its really sad so many bosses just are so unrewarding. Boiling down to light attacks dodging and then heavy attacks in between. Several have un-dodgeable cutscenes that force you to take damage and artificially pad the difficulty of bosses. As well as they suddenly are immune to your spells making the only option light attacks. This isn't supposed to be batman arkam knight where I spam the same light attack + heavy on every enemy to widdle down their health pool
Negative,runs really bad and is boring
Negative,"Great game and all, but a lot of performance issues, shitty out of sync and stuttering cutscenes really takes away all the best parts of the game, needs to be optimized"
Negative,Its just a cheap knockoff of elden ring dont buy it
Negative,"dogshit game, overhyped, dodge isnt even working how it should, i regret buying it"
Negative,"Too many bugs, bad performance, repetitive gameplay, boring story"
Negative,It looks pretty thats all. Terrible perfomance and no real character developement for the Destined One. Boss design is also not very good. They all look cool and stuff but combat-wise its just painful. I had less and less fun while playing this game but I guess I had too high expectations for this game even though its as expensive as a AAA game.
Negative,"I was really excited about the game, especially with all the hype surrounding its stunning visuals and fluid combat system. The game looks incredible, and the prologue shows a lot of promise with its atmospheric design and engaging story. However, I unfortunately had to request a refund after encountering persistent technical issues.The game crashed consistently during gameplay, especially when trying to progress past the prologue boss fight. I spent hours looking for solutions online, trying various fixes like verifying game files and updating drivers, but nothing seemed to work. It's frustrating because the little I was able to play felt amazing, and I can tell that this game has huge potential.I'm sure future patches might fix these issues, but as of now, my experience was too unstable to enjoy. I’ll definitely keep an eye on future updates and might give it another try when the game’s stability improves. For now, if you're on the fence, I’d recommend waiting until the technical issues are sorted out before jumping in."
Negative,its fun until u get to the half of the game than it becames a true souls game like its not even fun after that poiint and ohhh if u get to the end game the last boss defo gonna destroy u not for hours for days im trying to defeat the lsat boss but idk what  the devs smoked when designing that boss fight but its unfailry unbalanced and hard i lost all my interest to the game until i get to that point and now i literally hate the game despite the good story it tells
Negative,"first time playing it, it took 30 minuets to load and the opening cut scene was hard to watch because of lag causing the audio to unsync. 2nd time I lowered the graphics to medium and played in compatability mode and now its even worse with combat being impossible thanks to lagging and stuttering"
Negative,三周目中，索然无味，完全没必要，感觉不值。。。二周目，决定还是认为不推荐。多周目玩耍几乎没意义，尤其是第四章和第五章，简直是半成品，十分恼火。二周目数值几乎崩坏，开无双就可以了，闪避的意义还不如直接喝葫芦硬刚。二周目所有剧情的硬伤黑点全部出来了。相比老头环，只狼，黑魂，血源，这个的二周目只能说不及格水平。完全没有三周目的任何动力和意义。而且更新后战斗反而出现顿卡了，这是负优化？二周目发现过多“借鉴”的元素，但是借鉴不提原作者就是抄袭吧。比如第五章的那个鹿，跳跃动作太老头环了，犀牛也是似曾相识。二周目体现很多大图真的很无聊，即便打了筋斗云mod，跑图还是特别恼火，觉得很无聊。由此来看，游戏的深度还是不行。所以，转为不推荐。一周目10/10 有瑕之作 个人觉得娱乐性大于老头环DLC，而且这是没有联机模式的前提下。先认了赛博干爹家庭号通关，才决定入手直接存档继承。一周目小心摸索通关，二周目上了mod继续爽玩。建议二周目，加上优化mod，全图筋斗云，人物mod如小狐狸。Pros：1. 8/10 画面基本达到UE5的水平，优化开中特效可以接受，更新了A卡显卡驱动闪退变少了。缺乏细节打磨，光影一坨。2. 9/10 战斗系统总的来说我觉得有意思，有一定创意。轻击攒豆，重击回血有血源的爽感，禁字诀一开见谁就是当头一棒。熟练这套操作后，有无装备都是瞬秒，感觉自己变强了。轻击第三下是一坨。3. 9/10 游戏性。首先没想到这游戏还挺上头的，前期Boss Rush很刺激，后期大地图探索有一些小期待，捡到超神武器，练出极品武器十分兴奋，打造盔甲升级盔甲很爽。一周目拿的水里回血那套，最后很帅。打怪，打Boss闪避容错率高，连续闪避攒豆然后四豆戳棍乐此不疲。三种棍式无缝切换戏耍Boss。雪地地图，地狱地图是一坨。一周目没有Boss卡很久，交了学费的是白衣术士和小黄龙，最开始用魂系蹭刀属实折磨，想到攒豆以后瞬间简单。4. 10/10 音乐，几首战斗BGM还是很燃。5.10/10 二周目有新武器，爽玩Cons：1. -10/10 空气墙。虽然习惯了国产游戏地图一本道，但是空气墙绝对是被滥用了，这是没有关卡和地图设计能力的表现。仙剑4都没这么多空气墙。很多空气墙反直觉。不过方向感够好，没有迷路过。2. 8/10 部分特殊道具Boss是一坨。比如百眼魔君和黄凤大仙，对，我一周目无道具硬怼过去的。好几次差一丝跪了我真是想问候。3. 2/10 隐藏图反直觉。地图设计略等于没有，NPC个个谜语人，绕来绕去反直觉。每过一章要开下攻略不然会漏掉隐藏图。不过还好不像老头环烧树就等下一周目。4. -9999/10 剧情是一大坨。这是大圣被黑的最惨的一次，和白骨精谈恋爱? 改编不是乱编。制作组稍微阳光一点可以吗，什么都是厚黑阴谋累不累啊。第二个动画小狐狸直接给我看反胃作呕了。第三个倒果为因稍微可以，后面的动画纯纯故作高深。写不来剧情，你照着原著原封不动行不行。唯一优点就是台词还不错，终于不是其他RPG口水话连篇。影神图故事挺有趣的，但是厚黑的多。人物演出效果不错，各有各的性格很突出。但是剧情仔细一想是一大坨。5. -9999/10 地图设计是一坨。仔细一想撒把米在键盘，让小鸡来啄也比现在地图强。简单来说，一张空旷的大饼，撒几个复制粘贴的怪属实没意思。点名 雪山 和 小雷音寺， 妥妥的马拉松。地图比例特大，主角跑的慢，无意义的跑图无聊时间在大地图无限放大。打了筋斗云mod感觉好很多，这就说明地图大而无物。6. -9999/10 小怪设计约等于没有，粪怪倒是不少。除了让人觉得不适，没有几个印象特别深刻。尤其是小雷音寺的盲僧毫无必要，搞了半天这么大的地图就是殴打残疾人是吗。7. -9999/10 2024年游戏还经常爆6600xt的显存，尤其是雪山乌龟场景，还有小雷音寺打龙那里，一共崩溃过四次，全是显存占满，有两次是打赢结算重新打，还有两次是即时演算动画直接崩溃。好好研究下ue5行嘛，简单的垃圾回收内存回收都不做，打一两个小时显存就没了直接崩溃。克服完这些困难，游戏还是挺爽的，至少目前有三周目的意愿，这个游戏每加一周目就感觉天命人更像齐天大圣。有当初魂一的开山辟地之作的感觉，虽然问题多多，还是期待续作。
Negative,game looks amazing but the auto lock on feature sucks on mouse. even with all settings turned off it still does it. makes it pretty much unplayable.
Negative,Mobs attack randomly and not timed
Negative,I died and it said game over. refunded.
Negative,absolutely garbage boss design. boss always dodge ur attacks that you have been charging.
Negative,"game crashes constantly, devs dont do anything to stop it."
Negative,"The gameplay is fun and i love the theme/style but the game is so hard to navigate. There's no quest menu or mini-map so you're just running round the forest aimlessly. The cut scenes are super cool and the voice acting is amazing but that's only like 1% of the game. If you plan on getting this game, i'd definitely wait until it's on sale. Me and my brother split the cost but i still regret spending that much on this."
Negative,"I have no connection to the story or cultural relevance, making the game feel aimless. I don't know why any of the characters are doing anything. I'm not sure of the protagonist's motivation. Revenge? The graphics and presentation are fantastic. I dislike how linear the game is. I want to explore, but there are lots of invisible walls stopping me from leaving the golden path."
Negative,"DONT BUY THIS GAME. This is the most bullsh** game I have ever played. There is nothing rewarding for beating the stupid bosses and 91 bosses for a 30-40 hour game is the most outlandish thing Ive ever seen. I can't tell you to not buy this game more. It is challenging but its overly challenging, some bosses you have to fight to progress forward and it is the dumbest boss fights I've ever been in"
Negative,frames are really really bad and audio cuts and sometimes will repeat one sound. Put everything on low and still had frames and audio cutout. Kinda immpossible to enjoy the game like this
Negative,"Beatiful game, with amazing art direction and music, but boring combat"
Negative,worst game ive ever played
Negative,"STUCK IN FIRST PART OF GAME COS DODGE MECHANIC DOES NOT WORK, WASTE OF MONEY"
Negative,"Love the game but performance is terribly inconsistent. Traversal stutters are present but they are not too frequent however, what does bother me is sporadic 1% low dips during combat, boss fights and even from just camera movement. This affects cutscenes and transitions as they will ""hitch"" and during exploration and gameplay even though the game is running at a high framerate. The 1% low dips cause noticeable lag and delay in actions.I want to continue playing but the smoothness of the game needs to be improved for such an action-oriented game."
Negative,"The game itself is really fun and has an enthralling mythology to it. That being said, I do not recommend getting this game until there is a patch for the performance issues because holy hell, is it terrible. Stuttering every 3 seconds, framerate drops, horrible audio desync, it's very unfortunate. Until it gets patched, I cannot recommend this game in good faith."
Negative,平时几乎不玩这类动作 RPG，但是因为画面、故事背景也一直能玩得下去。第二、三回我最喜欢。第二回开场的陕北说书是个惊喜，整个地图开阔了很多，空气墙也没有第一回那么难受。第三回内容量感人，通关后回头仍然发现了几个新区域。打完了前五回，中间虽然也有遇到一些小问题，但基本都是那种可能轻易在后续更新中被修复的类型，可是到了第六回，踏上筋斗云以后，整个游戏体验崩掉了！有了飞行能力，地图变大，但是没有内容，在空荡荡的地图里飞，找 boss 来打，感觉像是玩网游断线后在空无一人的地图上溜达，跟前五回的体验差太多了，作为最后一回，给我的不爽翻倍！
Negative,"i can't even play the game, the game wont even make it pass the loading screen. i've tried doing everything to fix it. i'm just hopping that uninstalling the game and reinstalling the game might help it"
Negative,I hate wind Sage and Animation
Negative,"This is the first game where I've disagreed with such widespread hype. Combat is static and uninteresting. New skills and abilities remedy this slightly, but you're generally just spamming the same light attack combo throughout the whole game. There's a different version of the main staff that is actually a ""spear"" that I switched to solely because of the fact that it has a different move set and I got to see my character do a different combo, despite the spear having worse stats. This is only exacerbated at the end where the game removes practically your whole kit and leaves you with one heavy attack. Not sure what the devs were thinking there.There's some other nitpicks like attack cancel timing being different for every attack, and sometimes felt very inconsistent. Buttons would take multiple presses just to heal or use medicine.Sometimes you would have to run several miles to get back to a boss if you died, others had rest points immediately before them. Call it a skill issue but I don't enjoy sprinting past multiple enemies just to return to a boss fight. I don't think that is good level design.Performance is okay, no crashes or soft locks.Story is alright but the ending is lackluster. No real goal and nothing feels complete at the end. Overall the whole thing just feels lazy. I won't say don't buy it, but I definitely can't justify a positive review. 4/10 wouldn't touch new game plus with a fully extended Jingubang."
Negative,"Super over rated game, its literally running around killing bosses.  No where near as good as elden ring though due to no exploration and combat is a lot easier"
Negative,"watch the opening cutscene, it is the only good thing about this game. It's a bossrush of shitty bosses."
Negative,"Like most of the negative reviews, I would like to say it’s a just a boss rush game, and the experience of fighting is definitely shit. I don’t wanna repeat why the combat design is shit, most negative reviews concluded it and other shortcomings well, and if you completed this game you will get it. So the major content or the most important part of this game is shit, so this game’s core is shit, I would like to describe this game as a shit warp, like a warp which looks like a delicious one, but once you eat it, you will find shit in your mouth. And please Chinese don’t overhype this game, this game is not internationally popular. Don’t deceive yourself. Just look at the steam reviews of this game, you will find out that the majority is written in Chinese simplified. Those people who think the developers will do better in patches or dlcs, naive i have to say, this game has been developed for such a long time, and the developers give you such a semi finished game, do you think they can do better? By the way, do you think the developers didn’t play the game they developed? And why they didn’t fix the issues which other negative feedbacks mentioned? Because they are not capable to do that.At the beginning I wanted to dodge every attack of the boss, just like how I enjoy the boss fight of other games. I only say dodge because this game only has dodge. They may have some parry designs but do you think it’s possible to take advantage of them to fight? And I tried to achieve nohit boss fight, but finally I found it impossible and meaningless. After that I just wanna beat the boss and continue my way to next one. And I feel no achievement after I beat bosses.I accomplished the plat trophy of this game. And honestly I used cheat engine to collect seeds, curios and soaks, besides that I didn’t apply any cheat engine to my game experience. I used it  only because I don’t think it worth wasting time on it."
Negative,"This game has some stuff going for it. Amazing visuals and story telling are where this game shines, it tells a captivating story and looks great doing it. The gameplay is pretty trash overall though. It has some great ideas, like a stance system similar to Nioh, but worse, some cool spell abilities that are basically just the easy mode of the game, and a fun to engage with progression system. However, the combat in practice has almost 0 weight to it. In an era where FS has created the heaviest and most impactful feeling combat ever, the standard for ""weight"" in Action RPG combat has been high since 2011, and this game is in the little leagues in comparison. Combat feels like a wet noodle. None of my attacks have weight, the enemies barely react to them in a meaningful way, and character models slide around the ground due to just unacceptable levels of laziness in terms of animation integrity.It's already looking bad for this game because bad combat in an action rpg is detrimental to the game, but the level design makes you realize the poor quality has only begun. I'm not sure who approved this kind of level design, but it's unacceptable (a term I'll use a lot with a AAA title asking for $60). Invisible walls are used in this game to the most annoying degree I've ever seen in my life, and in 2024 that's just mind blowing to me. You're constantly reminded that, despite the beautiful surroundings you play in that appear to provide some interesting exploration and combat options, you're actually just in a hallway of invisible walls, and this game is as linear as Dark Souls 3 or Lies of P, while appearing to be more open. This just sucks objectively, ESPECIALLY for a game that takes like 130 gd gigs on your memory (Elden Ring shipped their game at 40 gigs).I've never really felt this unmotivated to play a game I payed $60 dollars for. I feel like I have to cause I payed that much, but it really feels like a chore. If you're a soulslike fan, definitely skip. If you're an action rpg fan and are willing to deal with these issues, you'll probably have some fun. I can't personally recommend it though."
Negative,"At best it’s a 3.5 star game, the pathway construction is very linear, vs the more common place open world.The bridge areas that simulate things falling but you can’t fall off into the void… like why not.. it’s too constrained.Besides the graphics looking good it doesn’t really bring anything new to a tired format.So I would say in a totally different meaning it does lack diversity in gameplay. If I could return it I would"
Negative,"I had high hopes for this game, really wanting it to be great. Unfortunately, the controls are disappointingly slow and sluggish, making the gameplay feel unresponsive. The spells suffer from a noticeable delay, where the cooldown is triggered, but the spell itself doesn’t seem to impact the enemies you’re facing, leaving you frustrated and unable to effectively engage in combat...Also: My god, what is up with all these invisible walls?"
Negative,"i had a lil bit better than recomended specs and the game was f*cked, sound and video out of sync in the first cutscene and in general laggy, searched it up on reddit and it seems other people with much better specs have this issue as well. Propably game is not optimised for pc yet, as i understand it is a small studio but game should be ready on lunch date. i was lucky and could get my money back"
Negative,"Several problems critically hamper this beautiful game:1) No map, no compass, no way to mark where you've been2) More invisible walls than any game I've ever played3) Lack of responsive controls4) Souls-like5) Lacks stuff to doBlack Myth: Wukong is a frustrating experience of epic visuals and legendary aesthetics crippled by vapid game design decisions, lack of responsiveness to controls, and tedium. It is a souls-like game mechanic copy of Nioh, lacks anything to do, and leaves me disappointed because the potential for this game could have been more.I played this in my native Chinese and was beyond thrilled to see all my childhood characters come back to life in such an epic manner, and to tell a tale that hasn't been told, what happens AFTER the Journey. For the first 3 chapters I struggled with staying alive. By the 4th chapter, I completely gave up on trying to make sure I didn't miss major parts of the game, because of the lack of a map or even just a simple compass. By my estimation having consulted some walkthroughs to find important bosses you'd easily miss even following the tutorials on where they are, I missed 40% of the game because I wasn't willing to walk around in circles anymore. If this game was more linear I can understand the decision ... you don't want to break immersion, fine. But the fact that this game has neverending invisible walls that tell you that you've met the edge of the map makes you feel absolutely BLIND navigating and breaks immersion ANYWAY. As a result, I made the decision to beat it as fast as humanly possible.Further, there is nothing to do except fight. Despite not being touted as a souls-like game this is definitely a souls-like game. It's absolutely NOT an action RPG (WTF??), and it was made with a specific audience in mind. I got what I can out of it without rage quitting midway due to poor game design.Lastly, the lack of responsiveness to combos or controls is unlike any other game I've ever played and if you go on discussion boards there are tons of people with the same problems. Without spoiling anything, at one point in the game there is a QTE where you have to hold down a SINGLE trigger buttons, and multiple people have noticed that success is completely arbitrary, and you had to use your keyboard instead. There are also Spirits you activate with both triggers which invariably cause you to either trigger one or the other buttons, but not both at the same time causing you to instead whirl your baton like an idiot waiting for the enemy to hit you, costing you absolutely precious health that you cannot afford to lose in this game. I have no issues activating combos in any other games that require them, my controller is fine, this game is too difficult for it to be so unresponsive. It's extremely frustrating to die because you tried to drink for health and for some reason RUN and DRINK at the same time just didn't freakin' respond. I didn't pay for this game, and I did beat it out of love of a childhood story. I'm happy to see my culture front and center, even if for some weird reason they stripped out almost all of the interesting female characters from the original (???) and I don't regret SOME of the time I spent because of the sheer visuals. But I'm sad to see that this game was designed to get people to write positive reviews for the first hour of gameplay."
Negative,Wish i could get my money back. Never had a game stutter so hard the whole entire playtime even after changing the settings in every which way. The book is better than the game
Negative,the game is unplayable it wont even start.it will go to a black screen and kick me out right after. i have tried all the tips on to fix it.it is clearly not only me having this problem.
Negative,Everytime i try to get past the first chapter screen it just automatically closes and i tried everything but nothing works.It is so frustrating.
Negative,literally constant bugs happening. may re evaluate after some updates.
Negative,"Too many crashes, it's impossible to play. The game itself is good, but until they fix it, I don't think it's worth buying"
Negative,"Updating my review to mostly positive after realizing that various graphics settings can dramatically impact input timing in ways that aren't immediately obvious (I hadn't noticed any screen tearing, stutter, etc).  Using a 3080Ti I knocked the automatic presets from Very High down to High and all of a sudden my hits / dodges started landing."
Negative,好评差评并不是推动游科进一步发展动力的全部 购买才是 所以我觉得一份更为详尽的差评并不比一些纯粹感情宣泄的好评在推动国产游戏发展的作用来得小二周目全成就通关 两种结局也都打了 我想应该我打差评还是够格的吧评价一个游戏好坏的唯一标准就是：你觉得它好不好玩那我的答案是 我觉得没有那么好玩 满分10分 黑吗喽在我这里差不多就是个7-7.5的水平 本来我是想给好评的 但是独木桥和保龄球实在恶心 你可以说我之前从来没玩过魂类或者类魂游戏 欣赏不来 那是你的事 请勿过分护主这个游戏有很多好的地方 我就不一一说了 喜欢的人表达能力比我强太多 可以看看如潮的好评中怎么夸的配乐配音和每一幕前后的不同风格的动画 非常讨我喜欢 这个也必须承认所以这篇差评主要应该集中于令我不满意的地方其他场景差不多移动端3070能够稳定2k60帧的情况下 雪地场景能有40就很了不起了 一卡一卡地折磨我 明处暗处的切换就跟客厅的顶灯随意开关一样让人难受同一幕中的场景内容高度重复 这个我能理解 毕竟谁也不会花太多成本在外景上 但是缺乏明显的指引 就导致 迷路 撞空气墙等事件不断不断在发生 对于玩家的游戏体验是很糟糕的一件事整部作品的剧情 我觉得真的很一般 此外  相信在二周目游玩时 很多人能够注意到 每一幕的剧情质量或者说内容是在不断下降的 前两幕中大小boss精英、npc的动画 语音 特写都比第三章往后多了不知道多少 在二周目迅速推图的过程中 明显感觉到狗尾续貂之嫌 再说实际的战斗系统 大小怪物的连续攻击手段真是太过丰富 虽然连续闪躲并不是真的很难的一件事 但是往往在多段攻击中 吃到一段攻击后 由于硬直 后续的攻击基本就不要想去躲开了  吃一次跟吃全部几乎没有差异  另外 作为“孙悟空” 我认为应该有足够多的攻击手段或是操作 结果技能的多样性却是体现在变身和随从的多样性上 我百思不得其解 最后一点 锁定系统真是让人费解 跑图过程中锁小怪经常锁到身后的 boss战boss在眼前你又锁不到了 再有些怪物的体积或是模型问题 导致在特定动作姿势（直立、抬手等）时 锁定的位置与动作的判定箱相距甚远 根本打不出什么有效伤害 希望能够进一步做相关优化调整 谢谢了掉落系统 我个人建议要学会宽恕自己 不然  会像我在小雷音寺寺门那里刷了30组怪 没有掉珍玩和装备  接下来的部分就是个人的情绪输出了 中立性有失偏颇烦请见谅第三幕、第四幕的独木桥 我二周目通关也就死 犀牛 鹿 大圣残躯   三条命 你知道我在独木桥场景死了不下两位数？ 然后这个保龄球  你搞三次四次要躲的不够？ 非要搞这么长一条路都得跟过街老鼠一样走？ 总体而言 黑吗喽作为一款万众期待已久的国产游戏 交出来的是一份相对合格并且有些惊喜的答卷 其中的缺陷同样十分明显 但我希望它不要成为国产作品的巅峰 而是应该激励更多的后来者 创造新的辉煌 那它的意义才会更加深远 希望这份差评 能够让游科继续优化这款作品 改善其他新来的天命人的征程体验 去当更加自在的齐天大圣
Negative,"I STRONGLY DON'T RECOMMEND this game , it is too BORING and too DIFFICULT for everyone. ONLY BEAUTIFUL OUTLOOK BUT NO MAP, NO HINTS , NO DIRECTION and NO REASON WHY YOU FACING THOSE BOSS. It only make you to play in one of the area again and again. It seems that make you strong, but this is only making the gaming hour longer to make the gaming look so popular only.  Even though you try your best to upgrade your skill and equipment , when you facing the boss you feel nothing !!  POOR DEFENCE SYSTEM  only make you fail many many time. YOU CAN'T ENJOY THE STORY and CANNOT MOVING FORWARD in other way, that means you just WASTING YOUR TIME and REPEAT IN ONE LOCATION AGAIN AND AGAIN . Therefore you easily spend over 2 more hours and you do noting because of you CANNOT REQUEST REFUND.  Finally, I believe game should be FOR FUN and MEANINGFUL for everyone NOT FOR PAIN and LOSS.  Spend money on this type of game especially come from this area only make you feel NOT COMFORTABLE AND LOST YOUR IMPORTANT LIFE!!!"
Negative,"1. Oversharpened without being able to reduce it2. No HDR3. Stuttering4. No native ultrawide supportGood game, but needs patches and updates first. Will update the review if those are fixed/added"
Negative,"terrible map design, uninspired boss fights, too simple moveset and overly easy"
Negative,Boss fight: The game.
Negative,its cool but rlly not story just boss after boss kinda boring
Negative,THE MOVEMENT IN THIS GAME IS SO CLUNKY 18 years of end lag and the best way to get out of it is just keep rolling
Negative,enough invisible walls to compete with 2010s PS3 level design. insane developers. save yourself the time and just play sekiro again or something. maybe worth it on 50% or greater discount.
Negative,"Idk game feels of some way, its very linnear feeling and i have no idea why im eaven playing as some monkey man. hope i get a refund i want to play dota or someting."
Negative,"Overrated and over-hyped. Ill get it on a sale maybe. Not worth the 60 bucks, beat multiple bosses didn't die a single time. Also no way to turn off the upscailing at all. You must choose an Upscaler no matter what. Refunded till sale."
Negative,"I was really excited to try this game, but it quickly fell short of expectations. The over-reliance on Unreal Engine bridge assets made the environments feel unimaginative and repetitive, severely impacting immersion. Furthermore, the game lacks a proper learning curve; it's either too simplistic or fails to provide meaningful progression, making it frustrating rather than enjoyable. Overall, it feels like a missed opportunity with a lot of potential squandered."
Negative,"I HATE this game. Don't get me wrong, Its beautifully done but the difficulty will 100% make me rage quit very soon. I don't enjoy games that force you to fight the same baddie over a dozen times before you defeat it only to find out that the baddie will then change form and you'll have to do it all over again. I cant afford to continue to play this game because if I do, I will most definitely throw my controller directly into one of my monitors. I really wish I had done more research prior to shelling out the premium price. Some people like this type of game.... I do not. One last note. for some reason, this game plays better on my SteamDeck than it does on my brand new $2,000 desktop. I cant figure out why but the PC version constantly stutters and freezes whereas the SteamDeck, although lower quality, plays near flawlessly."
Negative,can pass second boss
Negative,Not the type of game I play looks great though.
Negative,"wukong sounds like someone stuck a coffee filter through his throat, other than that gameplays alright just not for me"
Negative,"This game requires infinite amount of time, don't waste your time on it"
Negative,Boss rush game
Negative,"The game is well made, it's fun but holy shit it looks bad...... textures don't load, the sharpness is terrible and all that on a rx7900xtx. This game needs a patch to fix all of that and it will become my fav game, until that happens i can't say i recomend it"
Negative,"Story seems good, just wish i could progress. The dodge timing is off by a millisecond its noticeable and its annoying, it seems like there is a dodge window just after a enemy hits you that you dodge and its a supposed perfect dodge, Anyway, Kang Jin Loong is the poorest boss design I have ever witnessed. She flies around the whole fight, you are lucky to get a few hits on her tail. Her attack she usually starts with is a nose dive towards you, she snatches you in her mouth and throws you to the ground dealing almost all of my health, and that shit is pretty much undodgeable I've tried dodging early, I've tried dodging late, nothing works. Anyway good game if those issues were fixed."
Negative,"The game is fun in the beginning but the more i play the more issues i find which bother me really hard.1. Input delay/register is the biggest one for me. Sometimes using the flask (gourd) just does not work and you have to spam the button.Also doges or attacks are delayed in some cases which makes the game super frustrating.2. The bosses are art design wise great and really varie. But the designs of the fights are horrible in my opinion. They are not hard just really boring and frustrating to play against. I dont want to run around and wait for the boss to come back to the ground just to attack him 4-5 times until he jumps back i to the air where i cant reach him....3. The camera just fucks you over so many times its not even funny.Overall the games has god potential but fumbles the ball in some key aspects for this type of game. If you compare it to a souls like where things are consistent and you always know why you fucked up and what went wrong, i have so many moments in this game where i die and dont know why or because the game did not execute what i pressed. So i cant recommend it.P.s Graphics are great"
Negative,"I guess this is what the Dark Souls style games are like. This game looks great, but the environment feels very flat as you don't interactive with it much, which is ironic considering you are in a mountain area. So, far, you run around and kill a few easy mobs, apply a few skills, find a boss or mini boss, die 15 times, almost refund the game because it's overly hard for no reason, but can't because you left it at idle at a menu for 30 min too long. You finally kill the boss, and think, man why was that so hard? Then, you move on to the next stage, where it's just more of the same stupid thing over and over. The story doesn't really seem to matter, there is no adventure, it's just a quick dungeon crawl without the hack and slash fun. The bosses look awesome, but who cares. I just found out about WeMod, so at least maybe the difficulty won't be so stupid now.EDIT: WeMod saves the day, now I can be the Boss, well see how THEY LIKE IT!!!!!!!"
Negative,i played through to chapter 3. yin tiger ruined this game. i don't like games that advertise themselves as a skill combat based win condition and then they throw and over-leveling boss rush sim. this game is trash. i would like to beat what i'm fighting. not sit here for 3 hours trying and trying and trying cuz the monkey brained devs designed a boss with zero counter-play. i get sun wukong ego challenged everyone but this game doesn't let you do that and get away with it. very falsely advertised and now i regret purchasing this trash.
Negative,"as of now this game doesn't run on my rtx 3060, really poorly optomized even on the lowest settings"
Negative,Why does this game block you from getting transformation and spells. If it is there allow persons to be able to get it by going back to complete the quest and secrets than just removing it over all and persons can go back through the chapters to places they missed. This is a big downer for me
Negative,I liked the game it felt lovely but it lagged way to much it also Froze a bit so I ended up refunding it if in the future they can fix the stuttering lags and freezing ill probably buy it again my pc is good enough to run alot off games that need more recomended settings than this so I hope there comes a fix to this some day
Negative,"After beating the game I gotta say, as much as I liked the game and I very much loved the story there is absolutely no way I can give this game a good rating for the following reasons- Extremely bad optimization (partially due to the engine) causes constant stutters, audio desync, my specs are far above the requirements its not a graphics card issue even if I switched all my settings to low I would get constant stutters that cut out audio and desynced it.  - I've played a lot of ""difficult"" games but this, let me put it this way imagine you're playing Elden Ring but 95% of all bosses are turned into fire giant, so much artificial difficulty which does nothing but add artificial time. I get they had to make the bosses hard so players didnt beat the game too fast but jesus making them have the same HP as an elden ring fire giant was not the solution. Not only that there are WAYY too many big npcs that once again add another factor of difficulty because of your camera spazzing out.Overall I like the game and Im looking forward to replaying it once all the bugs and optimization issues are hopefully ironed out but for now I cant recommend this unless you have a super PC."
Negative,"This game is, from the portions of the game I've actually been able to play, a really well done game. the issue i have is that large portions of the game are completely  unplayable.  i have spent more time trying to figure out how to adjust the game and my pc to make it playable. I have a $2000 PC and i cant walk more that 20 feet or every time  a new enemy appears on screen, without having either constant stutters, or completely freeze the game for 15 seconds or more. just for my character to move 2 feet and freeze again. from what ive seen theres not much to complain about with mechanics, story, or even likable characters. and i love the chinese mythology. but the game on PC is so incredibly unplayable that ive decided to stop playing the game alltogether until an update comes to fix.....anything.   otherwise, no microtransactions and no political or sexual bullshit to complain about."
Negative,Overly delayed attacks with never ending strings make this game a slog. Bosses have way too many HP as well.  No parry mechanic makes combat one dimensional and boring. Getting the game to look decent and perform requires a computer that doesn't exist. Story doesn't have enough foundation to make it clear why your little monkey is doing what he's doing. Zones are tiny.
Negative,"Poor level design with invisible walls, confusing areas that all look similar, camera glitches/collisions, and an unresponsive combat system with a strange heavy attack (about 3 seconds?). I also experienced motion sickness even after removing motion blur. Overall, the story and graphics seem good, but the gameplay is lacking."
Negative,"The game looks very nice and the combat seems interesting. It's also got serious graphical and engine issues -- using an outdated version of UE5 plagued with shader compilation and streaming issues, horrendous frame drops and stutter so bad it makes controlling the character at best unpredictable. Not playable in its current state."
Negative,"TLDR: TOO HARD, not fun.I play games for entertainment, to enjoy myself in my free time. I do not play to be punished, inspire anger, develop wrinkles and lose hair as I tear it out after another cheap death. This game is frustratingly difficult!I don't play or enjoy Souls games (and I've tried several). Punishingly difficult games that require you to replpay the same hallway over and over and over is not a good game in my opinion, and Wukong wasn't even supposed to be souls-like but more of an action-RPG. The only non-Souls feature is that you don't drop anything when you die. Some people have touted that this makes it ""not hard"" but I say it's just less-punishing to failure. You are still going to fail and die a lot because the combat is unforgiving.I've reaad in a few places that it's easier than God of War. I did finish God of War...on Normal, like a normal person, not Ultra-nightmare like some gamer-masochist. This is WAY HARDER THAN GoW on NORMAL and there isn't even a difficulty selection to ease it up. And on that point...Why no difficulty selection? What is so hard about tuning player HP/damage and/or enemy HP/damage output across Easy/Medium/Hard so that the non-soulsers can enjoy your game? This isn't a multiplayer online game that requires us all too be on the same footing (which would excuse the lack). You could even call them ""Story, Easy and Normal"" to inspire people to bump it up a bit.I bashed my head in for 3 hours in attempts to get past either the Wandering Wight or Guanyin (or whatever the Tiger-with-flaming-bladed-staff is called) in Chapter 1 with no luck. I'm getting perfect dodges very often but the buggers have NO patterns like bosses in any other game would. They take chip damage on a huge health bar while you die in 2 hits...or sometimes just 1. Every fight they're combining their abilities and attacks in random order, even skipping the charge-up on super-abilities to hit you with one mid-combo. Sometimes it's stomp, stomp, stop. Sometimes 3 stomps. Sometimes it's 2 stomps then a power attack. Sometimes it's Stomp, swing, swing, super-stomp, jump attack, swing, stomp, super-Kamahameha, stomp, swing, swing. How am I supposed to beat a CHAPTER 1 demi-god enemy that follows no logical pattern while I'm supposed to be learning how the game works? They didn't even explain that heavy attack isn't a standard attack move...you can only use it after a significant charge up or after gaining a Focus point (another feature that is  barely explained to  the  player). There are also very few opportunities outside those bosses to learn the combat mechanics. There are so few small enemies to practice on and they die in 2 hits. I'm not learning anything from them.On the positive side: the little I've seen is GORGEOUS! Kudos to the artists and technical wizards who put this together.I'll come back if/when an Easy Mode is integrated."
Negative,"""Wukong"" has a great style and engaging concept, but it feels overly difficult. The extreme challenge seems tailored more for hardcore gamers, making it less accessible for casual players. It's hard to understand why the difficulty has to be so intense, as it can take away from the enjoyment for those looking for a more balanced experience."
Negative,This game will not run if you have an AMD 7900 series card. You will not be able to progress past the opening scene after the initial fight. Avoid if you have an AMD card.
Negative,"If I had to rate this game I would give it a 6.3/10After pondering on this for a couple days, I cannot recommend this game. Simply because If I knew what the game is now, would I still buy it? No. I don't neglect the fact that the game is beautiful and the fighting is fun. It is just not for me and this is why. After 8 hours and 15 + bosses, I feel I have a good tone of what the whole game will be like. This is how the last 8 hours have gone for me. Run on a Path, fight 5-20 soldiers/easy people on this path and then you fight a boss in a caged area. Rinse and repeat. Over and over and over. (few days later) Okay, I gave It a few more hours and my opinion has not changed. The game is fun, challenging, exciting when you beat the bosses and beautiful. It is just not for me, there is no depth in the story, very little/no character development and it just feels a little empty. You may love it? I have not. The start of the game is Epic but after that? It has been me chasing that feeling again. I am in chapter 3 of the game and I am giving up on it. I don't hate it, your call."
Negative,"Getting tired of un-optimized games. In no world should this game be 150 gigabytes when games like Cyberpunk arent even 75. How is this game over double the size of a real open-world RPG? Optimize your assets.Other than this the game loses me in Act 3. Boss design becomes more tedious than fun. A flying thunder dragon in a game with 0 ranged weapons? Awesome, add it! Not 1, but 2 lock-on laser bosses? Awesome, add it! Game looks beautiful and I want to like it but after beating Captain Wise Voice I realized I wasn't getting satisfaction from learning, and then beating the bosses. I was getting it due to the fact I'd never have to see or fight them again.Overall 5/10 game with bad optimization and some bad boss designs. If neither of these things bother you than you'll probably love it."
Negative,"It's a great ACTION game. It's not what I would call an RPG. If you like Action RPGs like The Witcher, this is not your game. This is much more souls-like than I was hoping, so I don't enjoy it. That said, it's a fantastic game for those that enjoy pattern memorization and timing. In that way, it's classic while having 21st century graphics.Would I recommend it generally? No.Would I recommend it to a specific type of action game play? Hell yes! It's good!"
Negative,"Furry Dark Souls. Can't get over how extremely pretty this game is. Finest eye candy yet made. The gameplay is typical dark souls, no major changes that I can find. It exercises the memory of that other game based on the book Journey to the West. Unlike that one, this has an actual monkey.  Do you need this game in your library, only if you're done with Elden Ring, Dark Souls, and Sekiro. It is really good looking though, but I think I'm repeating myself now."
Negative,Even Starfield has a map.
Negative,"Unresponsive controls with gamepad, unbalanced gamplay"
Negative,yellow wind sage is the worst shit ever created in the history of boss fights
Negative,"Can't even get pass the prologue. Game crashes over and over again, I've had the game crash when even trying to adjust the graphic settings. Don't buy the game right now."
Negative,The game is honestly terrible ive been stuck on the same boss in the marsh of white mist for over 2 hours now no matter what i do i cant beat him because he has 2 stages
Negative,"Game stuttered like crazy when I ran it, seemed like a lot of fun, but am leaving a negative and hope they optimize for anything other than a top of the line 40 series cards. was having issues with ray tracing off and a textures set to very high everythign else on high or medium. The thing that got me is that the stuttering spread to other games. So i'm gunna wait until someone smarter than me makes sure it doens't have any kind of bad code and/or they fix the performance or NVidia comes out with their new cards. idk. it seems to run perfect on any of the higher 40 series cards, unless you wanna play on low or something id wait if you've got a 30 series.oh, running at 4k"
Negative,"I still won't recommend this game to  someone who has never play a game like this or Final Fantasy or any of the other games.This game is NOT user friendly, there is no MAP nor GUIDE, is just you and the open world, you have no idea where to go.Unless you don't mind spending lots of time watching youtube videos, this game is not for you, to bad, is not hard to put at least the same light stream that appears when you are close to a save point, add that to the whole game to guide players, to where to go, and some pop up window with what is an optional Boss and which you  has to beat.There would be also a good idea:to have a window pop up when you are about to fight a boss, that tells you what you need to beat it, there is nothing, you will get destroy over and over and over, until you go to youtube and see more videos.Simple changes can make this even a better gamegraphichs are awersome, play is great"
Negative,"no map, no quest markers. Some bosses are annoying as hell"
Negative,"If you are going into this expecting Journey To The West: An Elden Ring tale, you are going to be sadly disappointed. This is nothing more than a boss rush mode in a shiny wrapper. The combat is basic enough that you can literally get through most fights with 3 button presses (light attack, dodge, abilities)The hit markers feel off and the camera in some of the more fast paced fights is the hardest part about this game.If you are wanting a new soulslike, this aint it. If you want to just fight a bunch of bosses and feel cool doing so, I'm not sure this is it either..."
Negative,"The little gameplay I was able to experience was lots of fun. The combat feels very good. However, the game looks and runs like garbage in its current state. My PC is well within the requirements, and no matter what combination of settings I tried the game remained a blurry, pixelated mess of oversharpening and flickering foliage textures. Even on the lowest possible settings, I was plagued with audio lagging, freezing, and devastating framedrops. The gameplay itself is fun and I have no doubt the game is good, but it looks like graphical problems are the main issue people have been having. Give it some time to iron out those problems before buying it."
Negative,"First of all this Game is a Masterpiece, the Artwork, Caracters, Bosses, Cutscenes, Enviroment everything is awesome.The Combat is my personal Problem, spam the same Combo over and over again there is no variety, build up focus with spamming light- and use it with heavy-attacks, the dodge is wonky and felt laggy, some hitboxes of bosses are weird (Hundred Eyes Daois Master) and the Scorpion Lord Boss despawned after some trys.Game Science told Streamer dos and donts, you guys know there is freedom of speech and we arent Chinese Citizens?PCGamer Quote:The guidelines move onto subjects that are sensitive within China, the home country of Game Science and Hero Games. Streamers are told not to use ""trigger words such as 'quarantine' or 'isolation' or 'COVID-19'"", a requirement that seems to relate to various theories about the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak.Finally, it gets explicit: ""Do NOT discuss content related to China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc."
Negative,"TL;DR Great game, add skippable credits.Start to near-finish this is an amazing game. Love the graphic design and all the work that was put into making this flawless masterpiece. Level design is out of this world. Constantly changing environments and new enemies added to each zone. Highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a solid single player game. Replay ability may be lacking as I have yet to start the next cycle (so I can be wrong here).Only reason this is getting a no vote from me is the unskippable end credits. I appreciate the people who made the game. But you can easily just add a credits selection on the main menu."
Negative,I dont understand the fuss about this ridiculous game.I am not going to elaborate more on this because EVERYONE likes it.Suit yourselves!!!
Negative,not good at all. very bad combat and boss design.
Negative,Dark Souls w/o actual builds.
Negative,"i came home from work so excited for this game ... i am so so disappointed.. the graphic on my 4060 pc is so so bad i don't understand it... i played god of war 2017 and elden ring last week,  compare to those 2 games.. i don't understand why so many people are raving about this game's graphic.. sigh.... i refund it after 2 hours.. i can't look at it..   i am sad... oh well.. god of war is coming to pc in 3 weeks.. oh well...."
Negative,I just don't think it lives up to the hype only good thing it has are the visuals but in some places it needs improvement like in boulders in blast in opening and when pressing heal button have to spam sometimes and also it is just a boss rush which is not worth for its price
Negative,"I do not recommend this game. For a game that isn’t supposed to be a souls like game it definitely feels like a souls like game. The following reasons are why I do not recommend this game. 1) poor optimization, this game apparently can’t run on anything less than a 4090. My PC has well over the recommended specs required to run the game and still runs poorly.2) boss hit boxes and attacks are really hard to pin down on some bosses, one boss in particular really needs to be reworked and tweaked, the bear boss at the end of chapter one, his hit box is all over the place and in my play through the only way I’m able to hit him is if I get behind him, and his attacks are all over the place as well and follow no particular pattern. And lastly his over all difficulty as a whole is way to high for a boss that’s in just chapter one of the game. “A test of your skills so far” is what I see online when I see others talk about him and I disagree with this as it’s a boss in the first chapter of the game not the last boss of Elden Rings most recent dlc. And lastly, getting animation locked in attacks is incredibly annoying as I will clearly dodge an attack but because of being locked in the animation I will still take all of the damage from the attack. I was really excited for this games release, as I love games like Monster Hunter and Elden ring but something about this game just doesn’t vibe right with me and unfortunately I played it past the 2 hour mark so I can’t get my money back for it so I have to eat the cost. I know there will be some who disagree with me and say this is the best game to come out this year and that’s fair as it does have a great story and lore behind it, but the issues I listed my reasons why I’ll be passing on this one."
Negative,"This games graphics are 10/10 but this game is so frustrating. This is Dark souls minus the xp. I tried, i really tried to play this game but it's rinse and repeat over and over , out of my 5.1 hours 3 hours were Boss fights re-do's. I wish i could get my money back or just play story mode"
Negative,feels like cuphead but is not fun
Negative,Can't Walk Myth: The Invisible Wall
Negative,Preformance No and has denuvo
Negative,"This game broke my computer, but i love it :("
Negative,Cant heal on xbox controller. It just does the deflect that LT does
Negative,won't load past black screen tried everything under the sun still doesn't work can't even get money back
Negative,Nice game but unfortunately it does not support Arabic language
Negative,"what a waste of money! I play game to relax and take my mind of from work. This game is way to difficult to play, the bosses and way to hard , sometimes taking you 10+ tries to complete. I was excited when it was announced, but after playing for just a day, I am already done."
Negative,I really wanted to play this game .. But It is very demanding .. It needs Optimization ..I have a very good laptop and I can play any recent game on High or Ultra Graphic settings ..But This game I can barley Run It on Low settings !! I can't recommend This game in it's current state Unless You have a NASA Computer ..Refunded
Negative,"No support for native dual sense controller, doesn't even recognize without steam input on. So just a simple lie that it has, cant recommend a game that just sells on disinformation."
Negative,Boss rush game. Next to no story.
Negative,"I love this game because of its creativity in what players can do with their builds which soulslike don't usually do. I am a gamer who loves to binge play though and not be bothered when exploring the game. Sadly the game for me has this huge bug. This Huge bug that I have to swat at because it is getting in my face every 30 mins. The bug is when I open my inventory or unlock a new shrine my screen begins to shake uncontrollably. This shaking not only hurts my eyes very bad but it stops me from continuing the game and to be honest is also stopping me from enjoying the game. I really hope this can be fixed soon because I love the story, culture, and history that this game brings to me and to others I just wish that I could continue playing it."
Negative,"to quote someone else ""Black Myth: Wukong is a spectacle, for sure, but it feels like it's using that spectacle as a crutch to distract from how little depth there to the gameplay, it feels like all of the mechanics of a good RPG were created, they just forgot to create the world to go with it."" @Ivor Spatch https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197987105858/The combat feels extremely lacking in any sort of feeling of power, and the motion feels like it lacks any speed unless you are dodging. This is not a deep game either, the depth of gameplay is shallower than the gene pool of modern dodo birds. 1/10 shallow gene pool"
Negative,"It's alright but does a terrible job explaining stuff like stances, focus points, will, basically all the stuff they should tell you, you have to find stuff out for yourself and you probably shouldn't have to figure it out for yourself, it's core mechanics.It has the same problem games like Nioh has where it's clearly just artificially difficult, you can fight a boss and they're not really difficult but they'll have a move that's never telegraphed and does stupid damage and there's really no shot for you to dodge it. Also areas filled with enemies and then just 50 archers to shoot you at the same time, it's a mess.I'm still going to play it and finish it, it's fun at times and looks amazing but in all honestly it's worth buying at a lower price, and you should probably play something like Lies of P instead because you'll have a better time and it won't run like shit randomly either. Certain areas will be 60+ fps all the time, then mid-fight drop below 60 and it will cost you. (To be clear, my PC has no issues with the majority of games, and I've never had an issue with any souls-like). TLDR - It's alright, does a bad job explaining basic stuff, buy play Lies of P instead if you never played it, it's far better."
Negative,"Terrible and cheap boss design and fight, boss projectiles spam, infinity combos and charge attacks are the name of the game. The abilities are useless as the damage is extremely low. Tried to mimic souls games but in bad and cheap way (quantity over quality). I enjoyed very few boss fights tho. 7 / 10."
Negative,"I can see why the game is very good  but visually speaking it just isnt as pristine as it could be I mean the cutscenes look better then the gameplay , I have a good pc 3080ti and 5950x but this isnt impressive alot of screen tear  and the game is very dim. This wont be a popular opinion which is fine I just expected it to be  a bit more glossy granted I didnt have 4090 with Ray tracing so ya maybe those gamers have what I wanted."
Negative,"When the game works I recommend it. However I've noticed 2 CTD in the first chapter.  1. After beating the guy that you fight on the water.  I went off the left to ring that bell.  A cutscene that showed a gate opening would start.  The the following loading screen would be the CTD every single time. 2. I cleared the first chapter then then part where you ""proceed to next chapter"" brings up a loading screen that is a CTD.  This CTD is a death loop so I guess I'll have to wait for hotfix."
Negative,"Am I the only one who thinks the combat is super janky and lacks impact? Its an action combat game, hitting shit with a big bonk stick should feel amazing but it doesn't feel strong at all. Playing Dragon's Dogma 2 and Elden Ring spoiled me a lot and raised the bar for action combat games. Another thing is that the main character feels so weak, I was so excited to play as Wukong, but I got cucked so hard and was forced to play some random monkey who just looks like him.Also come on, Im supposed to be a monkey, why is my jumping attack so weak?The reviews about this game being 'mindblowing' really raised my expectations a lot. I know Im supposed to support this kinda games but I just cant get into the game. I'm waiting for a sale and consider trying it again."
Negative,"No difficulty slider, and it's incredibly repetitive. run, kill trash, die at boss 100 times, kill more trash, die at another boss 100 times. spent 2 hours playing and 3 hours on one boss and my refund was refused. I cannot progress the game anymore and i basically bought a 60 Eur brick."
Negative,cant close the game without task manager
Negative,game looks nice but plays too much like gow for my liking
Negative,"I honestly want to love the game. Everything about it has been amazing other than the fact that bosses have a terrible ability to essentially track you through any dodge. This to me is kinda game breaking. When the whole concept is to fight and dodge, bosses being able to almost negate it all together makes no sense."
Negative,"using a 2070 rtx the game runs very poorly. 30ish frames, audio cuts, lag, very long loading screens, etc etc. gameplay seems fun but the technical problems are too bad to look past. wait a few months for updates / game to go on sale and enjoy it then."
Negative,"Sure wish I could play this, but it freezes multiple times in the very first scene; requiring a hard reboot.  My system is pretty  high end: i7-14700 CPU, GeForce 4080 Super, 64 GB RAM, SSD, Windows 11 and runs other games just fine.  Had to request a refund, because it's unplayable.  I don't know how they got so many positive reviews.  Bots?  I wouldn't waste your time until its better than this beta release."
Negative,"Some bosses are a breeze, and some are equivalent to what you would find in a souls like (Spamming AOE combos, multiple phases, etc..). For me I didn't expect this to have souls-like fights as it's not mentioned in the game tags, and I hate souls like combat.Apart from that some weird game design choices, like shops running out of 'buff' potions, invisible walls in spaces that don't look like it should have one, forced cutscenes, and distant spawning from boss fights that you might need to repeat several times to beat."
Negative,"So far this is a yawn fest, game looks like its going to start amazingly then after the opening fight its mash some buttons move on mash buttons move on... story so far has been none existent ... i followed this games development for years eagerly waiting for release only to find sun wukong is painfully weak and even the basic enemies are damage sponges let alone the bosses!wait till you hit eh wight clad warrior boss youll re do that a dozen times straight!do yourself a favour and wait until this game comes to the bargain bin or a free epic game.... this is calysto protocol all over again 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️"
Negative,"If you are like me and dead tired of souls-like games, then you will not enjoy this game.Graphics are pretty good (with particularly good animations) and the actual design of the world and enemies is interesting and refreshing, but the gameplay is not as advertised by multiple reviewers.Easy enemies that respawn whenever you die, bosses that will practically one-shot you from a distance, plus all the other mechanics and excuses for bad AI that you expect from this overdone genre.Refunded before I get stuck with another game that I will never play again."
Negative,It's too hard for leisure player.
Negative,"The game seriously lacks hints,making it difficult for players to advance the storyline without a map."
Negative,Game is clunky monkey feels more like a robot that an ape.
Negative,not too bad but the missing map kind of pushes it into negative
Negative,"Frame drops on my pc, so i can't play it. Not sure if i want to buy a new cpu / gpu just to play this game"
Negative,This is star wars force unleashed on the psp but it has better graphics and costs triple the price. Nothing new. marketing did a good job
Negative,"IDK who's playing this, or reviewing it....Graphics  7/10 at best imoEverything else its so mediocre or boring. Unless i'm missing something. Running sim, where you fight bosses using the same mechanics on every single fight. roll roll roll roll, do your combo. rinse repeat. The ""open world"" its just a long hallway, with a bunch of dead ends and one path that leads...... to a boss battle. Customization its just as linear. All in all, i don't get the hype for this."
Negative,"I mean... it could be worse. It's literally just boss fight after boss fight though. I want to like it, but I finally finish a boss, run around a corner and into another boss fight. I guess if all you want to do is that it's probably pretty enjoyable. If you're looking for more than that, however, save your money."
Negative,unplayable for me
Negative,crashed after tutorial.
Negative,Wait awhile. its a technical Mess! the audio and video arnt synced very well and it studders like mad! they need to work on the settings
Negative,Game has some weird lag and control feels bad.
Negative,"The theme is great, but the game itself is just a rehash of some current AAA action titles.Aside from appreciating the art, story, and a few combat scenes, the gameplay itself is rather lacking.It seems like Chinese players have tied this game to their sense of pride.As soon as the game was released, it was flooded with overwhelmingly positive reviews, but it's clear that these aren't entirely fair evaluations.Ancient China created a brilliant civilization, but today, all that's left is a sensitive nation clinging to borrowed power and driven by vanity.The most striking thing is that they organize groups to flood the comment section and insult fellow countrymen who leave negative reviews."
Negative,"Tbh, I'm going be  surreal when nobody remembers this game a few months from now and we have new game coming out such as Stalker 2, Vision of Mana and Metaphor ReFantazio at least all three of them look far better and enjoyable than Black Myth Wukong and what really bad for this game is the camera angles are pure crap especially the dragons or massive monsters have gotten worse."
Negative,considering that this game crashes while loading the shaders.... and makes you use a intel extreme tuner just to run. is extremely disappointing. especially when you have a 14th gen processor... fix your game before releasing next time
Negative,"The review board is flooded with Chinese fanboys, so i thought i'd write a review for normal players. This game has good potential, but it lacks depth and polish. IMO, it's not worth the $59 price tag. If you are not a die hard fan of Journey to the West, I would recommend wait 3 ~ 6 months for patches and discount. the good:1. good graphics and art design2. a wide variety of mobs and bosses. the meh: 1. the map has a lot of high contrast of shadow and very bright sunlight, but has no HDR option. Even my OLED monitor had issue displaying it right - the shadow section is hard to see when there is also sunlight section on the screen. the game also looks a bit washed out color wise. 2. invisible wall everywhere on the map, especially in chapter 1.3. there is basically no tutorial, which is surprising for this type of game.  the bad:1. map design. there is no map or mini map, and the overall map design lack visual ques and memorable mob, easy to get lost. 2. Atrocious frame rate drop. My 3070 generally hold up to around 80 fps, but it can drop to low double or even single digit during certain boss fight. Not what you want in a quick reaction boss fight. 3. combat lacks depth. there is no blocking and guard counter. Most boss fights end up to be so a repetition of  charged heavy attack, spell and wait for spell cool down. 4. control is almost laughable. This is no input queue: you have to wait until the animation completely finishes before pushing another button. so, expect the drink potion command to fail about 50% of the time."
Negative,"Parecia que seria un souls-like, tiene tintes, pero no, es mucho mas cercano a un Action RPG.pero esta bien, se ve bien, y de momento no he tenido ningun problema de rendimiento, eso si descargar actualizacion de drivers por si acaso, yo lo hice antes de abrir.los desarrolladores no supieron diferenciar entre dificultad y ser unos cerdos jajaja osea niveles donde te ponen 3 enemigos que te pueden tirar de una  viga :I que porqueria es esa?"
Negative,"beautiful game but way too hard...im hard level player on god of war and this game is way too hard, had 15 attempts at 2nd boss and i just had to refund. what a shame..."
Negative,- 没有地图- 字幕太小- 店不进货
Negative,wht a surprise another crap game with crap optimization that just crashes even with a 4090 i914900 k
Negative,"The graphic is not bad, just the graphic.  I'm dissatisfied with the combat, map design and Boss AI. It is like a low Souls Like game. Are you really sure this game have enough content of 130GB?(Elden ring is 50GB. SEKIRO is 14GB) Obviously that fails to deliver content commensurate with its size .  maybe the reason of large storage size is bad optimization.But most importantly, why the game is always crash and freezing?(I have 4070 graphic card)  It is really bad optimization."
Negative,It’s a enjoyable experience if you can deal with the audio cutting out and some frame glitches which suck in a boss fight I honestly wish I would have waited until they patched it up before starting a play through and mind you I’m playing on a 7800x3d and 4080 I’ve tried different settings but nothing helps
Negative,Lets be honest this game is Meh but compared to what we have been getting its pretty good. no game of the year imo. the combat dodge system could use some fine tuning as well as the gourd mechanics. item stats could feel like they have more of an impact imo. i also think the progression doesn't feel as rewarding as it should maybe they could add some cosmetic rewards with some of these fights. all in all a decent game that looks good. id compare it to god of war with some punishing souls like mechanics. i honestly would not recommend this game if you havent already got it because they have already nerfed bosses and i suspect when all the people stuck catch up they will continue to do it more. and there was a bug that allowed alot of undeserving people to beat and pass bosses they were not skilled for. the patch fixed that even thought it was too late for people who beat the game with the glitch before the patch... all the cool stuff comes from new game plus which most people arent playing because the base game lacked that rewarding powerful character feeling that makes a game fun vs work. so dont expect to play this game and beat it and think your good they nerfed it for the people who shouldnt be playing this game.
Negative,"Wet dream of chinesese developers without penises. Why the F*** is now trendy to do the game NOT for the normal people who wants to just enjoy the game and story but f***ing creazy dark soul hardcors where every boss is creazy difficult af. Why would you destroy so good game like that.. and athmosphere? There are so many people they would like to just play and enjoy the story but they can't coz of the lavel of difficulty.. Devs just destroyed the whole fun.. and now what.. I need to just stop playing it.. coz that's not for me, wasted my money and can't enjoy the journey. Really, there should be some ''adventure mode'' where you can just do normal play the game like in the GoW without hardcore neverending fights with bosses. And yes, someone nailed it very accurate ''boss simulator''. Yeah.. that's fun but just for a small group of people they like darksouls games.. pitty. and wasting of potencial for me. Again game for streamers and people just watching it..."
Negative,"I really do not understand how so many people seemingly are capable of playing this game. In contrast to super easy games like Elden Ring, AC, etc. this is ultra excessively difficult, at least for me. After playing for many hours, hundreds of deaths I have to say that there is absolutely no single chance to even defeat the second boss, Wandering Wight. Even after youtube videos, many many tries, no chance to get him below 30%. I understand that many, better suitable people love this type of difficulty, but for me no normal difficulty mode available just spoils this surely beautiful game."
Negative,"Overhyped.Graphics are not really good, full of artifacts (NO I'm not using Upscaling or Framegen!), completely oversharpened and forced blurry Temporal AA. Blurry Textures and waaay to much contrast.The game also doesn't use UE5s virtual-shadow maps but instead uses it's own so shadows look atroucious as well, expect if you turn on full RT, which only looks good on very-high - But even a 4090 struggles to maintain 60fps on 1440p then.Laughable technically. Also, everyone that say this is like GoW or any other action game and not a souls-like can go stick your you know what into you know where.I hate souls-likes with a passion as I'm old and don't have the time to grind out a single boss for hours.On top of that, the game lacks any visual clarity, so tells are difficult to even see."
Negative,"hm. the combat looks a lot nicer than it plays. it does this thing where quick attack combos transition into moves where a single input triggers an attack animation far longer than any other one, which feels awful to me. enemy attacks are a mix of attacks which make physical sense, some which are paused and follow by super quick animations and some that are paused and followed by slow animations. some may like how this comes together, but i do not feel like i am in control of my character enough to have fun with this combat.i think the proper way to engage in this combat is to play defensively, and essentially engage in this combination of turn based combat and qte. this may be fine for you, but it is not what i like in my game.game at least runs well though, and looks nice. animation quality is really superb!edit: wait, that deluxe edition armor, which you start the game with if you buy it, just is straight up a LOT better than the default starting armor? cool..."
Negative,"After 4 hours of gameplay, the absolute hardest boss so far was... the first one. This is ridiculous - After Remnant 2 this is the second Souls-Like game I played that fails at difficulty scaling.I have zero tolerance for incompetent boss design, thumbs down. For everyone interested: I'm talking about Wandering Wight boss. As it is right now, you either need to devise some sort of pillar based stagger strategy, or make a specific build that allows staggering or knocking him down reliably. Accidentally I put my first skill points into light combo, and after fighting him enough times, I maxed out 2x heavy attack with focus points. if executed correctly you can reasonably land full light combo twice with stagger finish, and then start first light attack and land 2x heavy blows resulting in knockdown, then insta spell freeze then wait 2-3 sec to recover stamina, then 2x light combo all over again.  You probably need to dodge his attack sequence once or twice - ideal moment to restart your combo sequence is after dodging his heavy distance attack"
Negative,It get's repetitive and boring after 2 hours
Negative,Me no like Monke game
Negative,"Just too difficult, much more difficult than DarkSouls or Elden Ring.  Requires a lot of backtracking and farming the same area over and over to get leveled up enough just to do enough damage to the main bosses."
Negative,"After spending a solid amount of time with Black Myth: Wukong, I have to admit I walked away with mixed feelings. There’s no denying the game's impressive visuals – the graphics and animations are nothing short of top-tier. The character design and monster models really do capture the mysticism and folklore of Journey to the West in a beautiful way. But, beyond the eye candy, it just didn’t hold my interest.Let’s start with the gameplay and world design, which were a letdown. Despite Black Myth presenting itself as an adventure game, there’s little room for actual exploration. The world feels more like a set of gorgeously designed hallways than a place that breathes or invites you to get lost in. The lack of environmental storytelling or any kind of world-building narration makes it all feel somewhat hollow, especially when playing as a silent protagonist. It’s just you moving from one place to another, often with not much to do between fights.The combat, while flashy, feels repetitive after a while. The moves look cool, and it’s fun initially, but there’s not enough depth to make me want to go back for an NG+ run. There are moments where it feels satisfying, but it never reaches that level of addictiveness.On a brighter note, the story has some strong points, though I noticed some inconsistencies – particularly in Erlang Shen’s motives, which felt a bit forced at times. But overall, it’s interesting enough to keep you somewhat invested if you don’t mind the gaps.Black Myth: Wukong could be a fun experience for someone who mainly values graphics and spectacle over immersive exploration. However, as an adventure game, it feels like it misses the mark. My rating reflects the mixed experience:Combat: 6Story: 8Sound: 9Graphics: 9World & Environment: 6Overall Rating: 7.5"
Negative,"I wish there was a middle ground between yes and no for recommendations... if you love banging your head against a rock, this is your game! JK, but only a little... it follows the ""Souls-like"" formula pretty closely. If you like those games, you should like this one. Giant enemies with cheap a$$ arena spanning\tracking attacks? Check. Bosses that tee up consistent behavior just to in inexplicably change said behavior? Check. By that I mean the timing between when they tee up an attack to when they actually perform attack is variable. A big swing will take ~1\2 a second to wind up for most of the time just for the boss to sometimes take 1/4 second or 3/4 second at random moments. Makes timing not fun when you have it down, then it changes with no animation or skin changes to signify the boss is 'going hard'. Makes it double not fun when it is obviously a cheap a$$ tactic thinly veiled as 'difficulty'. So far, for me, it has been pretty, but not really fulfilling. I will say that controls feel much crisper than other souls-likes I've played. You don't feel like you're walking through molasses or that your character takes an extra quarter second after a button press to respond. I am still early game, but so far it has been painfully linear. Hopefully that will change as I get further in the game.As of right now, I would say pass unless you are really into the souls-like experience.EDIT:Ok, the game actually sucks... it is pretty, has some tight controls, but that is pretty much it. This is a $60 or more boss rush game. There is literally nothing to do but barrel straight down a hallway on rails, fighting boss after boss. How this got an 'overwhelmingly positive' rating I'll never know. Chinese bot rating dumps? All I know is that if you like walking down a hallway fighting souls-like boss after souls-like boss with nothing to do in between besides walk in a straight line, this is the game for you. It like a hardmode Dynasty Warriors game or chewing Fruit Stripe Gum. Initially slightly thrilling with some flavor, but the flavor doesn't last beyond one or two chews."
Negative,"I recommend the game if u like difficult games like souls style, Game graphics are great but u need to change the difficult some players play the game just to enjoy the history, we dont care about the dificult of the game, if it is more easy is better."
Negative,"Dont let the sales numbers fool you, game is only bought bc of background story.Game is clearly made by mobile developers. Combat is not fluid, map boundaries are terribly made and the progression so far has been boring. They throw a bunch of random things together and attempt to make a knock off ""God of War"" game, but dishonor the story ""Journey to the West"" ... Game needs a major update first to it's combat then probably to it's price. NOT WORTH FULL PRICEEDIT: Played the game for longer and still sh!t. Game is buggy and map development is poor. Tired of running to a corner of the area bc it looks like i can clearly walk down or hop on a path but its got an ""invisible force field wall"". Poor development there.Combat still is not fluid nor is the lock on reliable(you pretty much need it in this game) so dumb of a game. IDK why its got SO much hype. Also combat is SOOOOOOOOO inconsistent, sometime my hits stun an enemy sometimes NOPE ... and the time it decides NOPE is 90% of the time I'm stuck locked in a longer combo animation, so trading unnecessary hits,"
Negative,I'm a casual gamer that doesn't mind a little bit of a difficulty but this is more than I can handle. I am not a souls like player and never have been i've tried many times with those games and they just never clicked with me. I don't enjoy grinding up the same boss over and over for a long time in dying repetitively that gets really frustrating for me. I was hoping the game was going to be responsive a lot of the review said it was like God of war which I love God of war and had no problem with the difficulty on the lower settings on that game and even some of the more challenging parts I was able to manage. I feel like the combat is very sluggish and slow a lot of the powerful attacks are hidden by a huge charge up which by the time a monster puts in his big area attack it gives you no chance to actually do anything in fact there are bosses that can one shot you from across the battlefield even if you're trying to get away from them it just didn't seem like something I could get into.
Negative,"The graphics are amazing, but the story is just OKThe worst part is a very hallway and rooms kind of game with no derivation from the programmed pathway forward.Trash mobs to level up on, then a boss, followed by a linear pathway with trash mobs leading to a boss.Later it's worse, linear path to a boss, who has a second phase., Fight 40 times finally win and right into another boss, beat that...nope that boss has a second phase.  You just fight over and over until the moves are memorized and ingrained and then...yep new boss fight.A few ""secret"" areas which are pretty darn hard to miss, a few optional bosses which again hard to miss."
Negative,"i did not like the game, just upgrade your abilities and fight with the bosses. nothing else. i found this game overhyped."
Negative,"Not worth $60 USD, maybe pick it up on sale around half price."
Negative,overrated chink souls its basically nioh
Negative,"Sooo yea....here it is.It's taking me hours to beat the 2nd boss. So difficult yea...very. You got lost in attack animations ALL the time. You can dodge at various points in the animation but its hard as hell to figure out. Their is no blocking which does slightly simplify things. The attacks themselves are really simplistic. Hit a button do an entire combo sometimes but it leaves twirling the staff and feeling skilled kinda underwhelming. Gets you trapped in your attack and you get blown away.Anyone with bad gaming skills is NOT beating this game. 2nd boss has nearly 6 different attacks BUT since they can mix up their attacks so randomly, it might as well be 15 attack variations. Try to find the pattern in the enemies? Sometimes you can forget that too! They will switch up their attacks right in the middle of what you thought was an attack combo you can dodge. Jumping in air during an attack combo will Sometimes get you killed by a ground Stomp on ......and sometimes not. The bosses will 2 shot you and their abilities are too overpowered. I can see how to beat 2nd boss, but the random locking me into an attack animation and the bosses having no rhyme or reason is beyond me. I never played Dark Souls or I think id fair a little better in this game. I am NOT a patient fighter and I hate playing to win by exploiting obvious tactics such as using a super power and just dodging until it comes back. Boring! Freeze the enemy and go behind his back! Smart! Does it work...sometimes...he will hit you from there too...Did you just dodge an attack! Great job! He will hit you at the end of his attack sequence anyways.The game is beautiful for sure and the voiceovers are good. I'm losing the immersion on this boss fight though. The difficulty level is stupid high. They spoon feed you overpowered super abilities you can use. You DO However get accumulative EXP. So if you die to the boss fight and killed some henchmen on your way to it, you will get to keep that. Since this fight is taking hours...im likely over leveled for the area. So thank GOD for the XP stacking even if you die.Their is SO FAR very little freedom of movement by the 2nd boss. The area is has a force fed path for you. Boring! Hopefully that changes. I wanted open world.I'd leave even more feedback but I'm still stuck in the first hour of the game."
Negative,"Way too laggy, and god awful input lag and choppy audio."
Negative,"Constant stutter, lag despite meeting requirements."
Negative,good if you like having high blood pressure
Negative,"I am very tired of games releasing and I am unable to play them. This game looks amazing, and probably is. However I am unable to play.It gets to the shaders section, but crashes after it gets to about 3%. If I skip it, it just crashes. I have jumped through as many hoops as was asked out of me, but it shouldn't be this way regardless. The game should just work, and yet it doesn't. I will change my review once an official fix has been made."
Negative,"has good graphics but worst game play i ever seen, really stupid of themnot to put different  skill level . big waste of money game that only one level of gamercan play.worst manics on a game i ever played. half the time you hit a button while in combatit don't work  straight  garbage. they really thought it through on this game. not"
Negative,"Honestly this game is over hyped. Don't get me wrong, the graphics are great. the performance could definitely be better. The combat however is repetitive. The game is also listed as a souls game and in my opinion this would be a poor example. It is not as challenging as i hoped and i experienced a ton of lag."
Negative,"FUCK this game wont stop crashing. I have the highest end AMD card you can buy in 2024 and a cpu to match. Im not running it in full cinematic either. Its medium to high at 4K 60fps and this shit has crashed 3-4 times. I had to change it to low 30 fps just to get past the opening cinematic. This game is great very quality 60$ is a decent price for this game but god damn can we have some fucking balance updates so my shit doesn't keep crashing??? For reference I play D4, elden ring, COD, Witcher 3, and all other kinds of games no problem."
Negative,"i guess everyone is blinded by the good graphics otherwise i can't explain the many positive reviews. the game is beautiful but otherwise a total failure. the story is absolute crap and told in a shitty way, the combat mechanics all feel off and the boss designs are a disaster. none of the bosses gave me the feeling of having a difficult fight ahead of me and were just annoying. the tubular levels have nothing interesting to offer and lead in a straight line from one boring boss with annoying design decisions to the next. wukong itself unfortunately controls incredibly inconsistently and has no interesting moves whatsoever. DO NOT BUY - get the benchmark and you will have experienced everything this game has to offer."
Negative,Do not be fooled by the Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. This game runs like complete shit if you're a general gaming consumer like I am. This is the first game ever that I've had to return strictly off performance issues.The audio was constantly 2-3 seconds behind the visualsThere were multi-second freezes constantlyAlmost everything looked VERY fuzzy on the edges making the game just look awful when it wasn't freezingScreen tearing the likes I've never seen before.Save your money and go buy something you will actually be ABLE to enjoy.
Negative,CANT PASS SECOND BOSS
Negative,"The game crashed 3 times in 30 minutes, I cant get pass the prologue because of the crashes.CPU 5800x3d and GPU 6650xt, 32 gb RAM"
Negative,"This game has not earned the ""souls-like"" tag, its a boring one dimensional, linear shit show thats as repetitive as it is boring.Not worth it if you're expecting a true souls-like experience"
Negative,retarded game with same repetitive combos very very boring
Negative,Game constantly crashes on a higher end PC even on lower settings. Unplayable
Negative,Overrated boring af game with smash and slash mechanics ppl are jerking off on this types of games
Negative,"The game is good, but it has terrible terrible visual and performance bugs. The game looks like you're on a trip, the more you play the worse it becomes and so you have to restart it all the time to reset the issues. Colors are flashing all over the place and weird lights are coming at you, it's just terrible. Performance is also terrible.I recommend you avoid this game for the next 6 months, let them fix it, or get it on a bug sale. It's not worth its price at its current technical state.  Intel 12th GenRTX4080Windows 11All drivers and BIOS are updated"
Negative,"Garbage programming / optimization and way, way too difficult. Constantly stutters for multiple seconds at a time on a w7-3465x w/ 4080s -- unplayable. Boss characters are insanely difficult to beat and there is no difficulty setting. Worst game I have ever played."
Negative,"WAY over-hyped, overpriced, and is nothing more than Wo Long for dummies. - Visuals at 4K max and RT max was underwhelming. Compare it to a game like Ghost Of Tsushima and this suddenly doesn't feel like a $60 game anymore. I expected more texture details when it came to the main character, weapons, etc. It has certain moments for certain things to look really good while everything else doesn't. For example, they show a peach in a cut scene and you can see the fuzz on it. DLSS with motion blur causes significant aliasing. All anti-aliasing options, while beneficial, all come with it's own unique draw backs. - Performance was overall Excellent with or without frame generation using 4080 Super. I noticed you can get rid of the aliasing mentioned earlier by using FSR however it also has other drawbacks. For instance character face details look worse than it does on DLSS. - Gameplay - The map layout is very similar to Wo long but with a coat of paint and interactive vegetation. The combos and move feel great to execute but then it starts to feel like I'm playing the witcher. Dodge hit hit hit. Dodge hit hit hit,Overall the game feels like its faking its way to being a souls game while giving you the martial arts feel of Wo Long. The visuals also look like its faking its way in trying to look current gen but it's really not. I do appreciate the dev's stance to not let consulting agencies change their vision. Unfortunately, I feel like this generated a lot of hype the game did not deserve."
Negative,Still crashes on the tutorial with an AMD GPU
Negative,"POV: You are level 15 and just getting into the mechanics of this game.  The graphics are amazing and you are really getting the hang of beating bad guys over the head and getting XP.  All of the sudden your progression is hindered by a level 999 half snake wizard wielding a glaive who hates you despite the fact that you are just chillin and have never seen this dude.  He murders you over and over and after your 100th death you finally realize he must be the final boss somehow.  The whole game is about 2 hours of basic mobs culminating in a game ending massively overpowered snake man murdering you, THE END,  PS if you love dying and hate fun you will love this game.. also you should seek counseling because you are a psychopath."
Negative,"Wow. Just wow. This game is way too much of a failure to even describe. Simply put, it is an action game that left all thought of actual fighting mechanics in the garbage and focused solely on hype. You gain multiple advancements but barely feel any difference at all. You have precious little in the way of health recovery (four heals that never recover unless you reset all enemies or level up enough to get a small recovery after expending special attack charge which, you guessed it, is charged by attacking which basically makes it the unwanted cousin to life steal upon hit). Worse, your basic attack feels like a bad kung fu movie full of overly theatric telegraphed attacks and leaves you feeling like your character is a lead weight trapped in a martial arts game instead of the visual story that apparently was all that the developers actually cared about.They really should have taken this game back to the drawing board and maybe played a lot more Devil May Cry to actually understand how dynamic a fighting game needs to be.The only reason to buy this game is if you have money burning a hole in your wallet and you are looking to gift someone a bad game as a prank. If all of the enemies were removed from the game and it was nothing but an immersive adventure story THEN it would be worth something. However, in its current form, it would be a waste to even spend $5 on it."
Negative,"I tried to play this game and it was doing fine until I clicked the New Journey. The cut-scene was running fine until a few seconds later it froze. So I closed the game and opened it again. I hit continue. It froze again on a loading screen. I tried to do every method possible to try and be able to play this game. Nothing works and it keeps on freezing on the loading screen or even at the start of the Tutorial for combat. I lowered Graphics, I restarted my PC, I tried verifying the files, I tried running it as administrator, I even tried the scary updating BIOS. Nothing worked. Not sure if my ASUS PRIME B560-PLUS AC-HES motherboard is the problem that it would optimize it but I am doubtful it is the problem."
Negative,"Okay game with absolute horseshit level design that detracts from most of its qualities. Boring to get through and it would have been way better as a ""boss rush"" like most people assumed it was going to be."
Negative,"Completely broken for AMD systems, which is a shame as looks like an awesome game."
Negative,"If you have never played a souls game or don't like souls games, don't buy this. Way too hard for a beginner, unless you have time to spend your whole days learning boss move sets to beat them. Just watch a play through if you're interested in the play through."
Negative,"Amazing game.Sadly, the developers are dogshit and promote ""women being different and please women don't play our game"", hence the negative review. Couldn't care less about ""inclusive"" inside the game though, issue purely related to how they behave IRL. (Funnily enough, most women in the game are either Spider/Snakes/Foxes who betray you or someone else)."
Negative,Do NOT play this game with an AMD 6950 XT until they patch the game to optimize it and update drivers. This China Monkey tried to kill my graphics card within first 5 mins of game running. Couldn't even get to the opening video.
Negative,"I had a lot of expectation for this game. First of all I love the story of Sun Wukong. Journey to the west is one of the literary masterpieces of China. One that has been told in many formats, including animated series, action movies and so forth. Thus I was thrilled and very excited for the game. Without hesitation I spend the entire money on it. Graphics are really amazing. Character design is also truly beautiful. Besides that I think, at least from my perspective that there are a lot of basic things left out. 1) There is no way of difficulty level, so you cannot change the difficulty. Well...this has been there since the dawn of games. 2) No map, but then again why would you need a map if there's actually nothing to explore. The world is extremely limited. 3) They overdid it with the graphics. It takes a lot of GPUs to process all those hair textures. Too many hair textures, no many things to process graphically. I think even best GPUs could struggle a little bit with this.4) Fight system is good but not the best. Only evading, no way to block or even counter. This is also basic in fighting games and sadly not present here. 5) No story...At least so far I haven't seen enough story content and cinematics. The kind I would expect from such a big title. 6) There are issues with graphics and due to high GPU requirements performance is affected resulting in lags.I mean is Sun Wukong the monkey king!!! I feel they should've made this game for all audiences. Children and adults. A pleasent and ejoyable game for the family. But instead it is focus in a very specific game play based on difficult boss fights. Gets boring really quick. Basically if you cannot beat the boss you cannot advance. Boss after Boss. To beat each boss you probably have to die several times until you figure how to evade the attacks and the right strategy to kill them. When I say strategy I mean mainly memorizing the bosses attacks, cause you cannot use strategy actually. Something like fight a fire boss with water is not here. Entirely mechanical and there are issues with the mechanics.  This gets boring, frustrating and is not for everyone. I am disapointed, Sun Wukong is my hero!"
Negative,all this game is is boss battle after boss boss battle with  no armour or weapon upgrades to help you.  bosses are stupid hard good story but shitty play style.  if you are looking for a good hack and slash this aint it.
Negative,This game is one of a kind.  I do not think there is anything like this.
Negative,"yi fen qian yi fen huo, sui bian ba"
Negative,"another dark souls clone that makes dodging its main mechanic. yet the mechanic doesnt even work consistently cant decide if i dodge right before or after an attack to get a ""perfect dodge"" because its done both but not consistently. constantly getting enemies stuck on top of terrain because you hit them. some mechanics were clearly made to prioritize looks instead of functionality. honestly just wait for a sale not worth full price."
Negative,"This game is hard.  Imagine playing a combo game where you need to know when and where to play the counter combo. That's all this game is.  Without a super machine the graphics look like PS3 graphics. You walk down a wooden boardwalk and there's an upright post the game will literally shove you left or right to pass it.  It takes me right out the moment.  The game tactics force you to keep your distance and some of the graphics on the far away views are nice but it gets tiring really the combo counter combo.  Overall this game is way too difficult. Im middle age and dont have time to play games to grind.  I wanna drop difficulty and progress fast. This game is grind, grind, grind.  The power ups arent very intuitive.  The armour is slow but overall its just WAY TOO DIFFICULT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Negative,"This game is much, MUCH, more difficult then any of the souls games, including Sekiro. I was expecting a more relaxing and enjoyable game, instead i got a game that requires you to ""learn"" the boss over and over which i do not enjoy the way they implemented it in this game. There is very little you can do to strengthen your character, other then switching around your skills and using potions. The technical performance of the game is also not that great. Hitboxes are not always clear either. The major stutter and low frame rate also played a big part in ruining the game. I played it on a 4070 super.On a positive note the game does look decent enough and if you like boss run games (redo the same boss over and over and over until you ""learn"" it's moves) this could be for you.If the game had the ability to make the player character stronger by leveling or getting armors or whatever it would have been better, for me.I guess i no longer have the desire or patience to redo a boss over and over again without any way to make your character stronger. There is no sense of progression."
Negative,"Graphics/Display is trash. Game is extremely grainy and over-sharpened, and no amount of adjustment makes any difference. Wasted more time dicking around with graphics and raging than enjoying the gameplay. Advice is to wait two years and then consider purchasing the title."
Negative,"I wanted to recommend for player who has high rate of graphic card to buy this game, but not recommend for players who has low rate of graphic card as during the loading progress, the game could crash any time, as such sometimes I need to beat the same boss again before proceed to next stage, therefore I give 3 stars out of 10 for this game though it's fun and challenging."
Negative,Too hard - makes it not fun
Negative,bit on the boring side ...gamplay loop is the same and bosses are uninteresting. the staff hits like a wet noodle during combat which is unsastifying
Negative,Ridiculously hard. Too old for that shit
Negative,Bad optimization. Annoying Dark Souls BS. Horrific story telling. But I love these beautiful scenes and the game is free of disgusting America politics.
Negative,You can't pause during cutscenes.
Negative,"I can't express how terrible this game is. Sure, the graphics are amazing but it's just insane boss fight after boss fight. I would say i'm an avarage gamer but this ist just 30+tries per boss who appear every 15 min of gameplay. It's absolutely mental and ridicilous, lacking storyline, no puzzles, just pure fighting mechanics. I was never more wrong in following the hype. waste of 60 bugs"
Negative,"It looks astounding. The level of presentation is top-tier.However, I didn't find it fun. I couldn't ""gel"" with the combat. You get locked into animations and it feels stulted and delayed.  The strong attack is simply weird and long. I'd prefer a simpler and more understandable system (like dark souls) rather than this focus point thing.The amount of invisible walls in the level is just poor and lazy design. You realise that there's not much ""to"" levels. Jumping doesn't allow you to scale levels and find attack opportunities (like sekiro).I was disappointed by the levels being so sparse and short and then it's another boss and rinse and repeat. I wasn't expecting a boss rush game, but more of a souls-like experience with branching paths.I really would appreciate difficulty options so I can breeze through and see all the locales. As it stands, with a large number of bosses, I am just not interested in beating my head against a wall endlessly to get through this. I'm just not bothered. Please add difficulty options to these games. Some of us aren't interested in punishment simulator!"
Negative,"Way too hard. Unless you want to sweat endlessly than don't bother. There is no way to adjust the difficulty either. I just want the experience, not the challenge. Having that option would change everything. The other irritating part is the store runs out of material. So when I am fighting of poison, I don't have potions to take it away. And it just slowly kills you. No more potions just made it that much less enjoyable. I don't have the time or patience to try the same thing 100 times before getting to moving on. I feel like i wasted my money!! If you just want to experience the game I suggest watching a pro stream it!"
Negative,"From what I have seen it's a very linear game with no exploration, no particular depth and also is full of invisible walls. In my opinion it doesn't deserve the hype it has. Combat and graphics are really well done but it is not a 60 bucks game."
Negative,Does nothing but crash.....
Negative,please decrease attack duration to 0.2 seconds lowda game
Negative,i no no wanna :(
Negative,"The game is so amazing but its so frustrated for not give the player an option to choose difficulty I spent my whole game experience trying to beat the first boss, why?"
Negative,"Doesn't even run on a computer with one of the most expensive 4090's on the market and continues to crash because it ""cant allocate video memory"" during start up, if you have this issue just refund it and uninstall, i attempted every fix that was recommended by the developers and not one worked, as a matter of fact we should not even have to do this in order for the game to just run, horrible."
Negative,"$90 game and I can't bind to my side mouse buttons? - Don't believe the hype its a beautiful game but aren't they all these days - it's dark souls monkey magic - Light attack, Heavy attack and Dodge, story line is meh I just don't care about it so take away the dazzle of the graphics your left with pretty much light attack dodge game with the illusion of choice cause let's face it light attack and dodge is all we are really using The Stances are just crap - having to change stance to MAYBE use one that you don't end up using because the animations get you killed sucks and is just a novel idea but its garbage and you just end up respec'ing back after trying them all out to max dodge, stamina, defence so you can dodge light hit your way to victory. - At this point I've personally experienced more frustration than enjoyment dude to limitations in how I'm forced to play and the locking in to a dev's idea of one glove should fit all setup in 2024 which is bizarre. it's unfair not being able to rate this as in the middle Steams Yes or No model sucks but the games OK.  You follow a pretty linear path well a very linear path - its not really crafting there is a button that says crafting but it should be re-labelled upgrading I'm just not seeing where the $90 value is coming in compared to so many other games with tons more to do and replay-ability I'd say a solid $60 would suffice.  Man do I keep falling for the Overwhelmingly Positive Hype.  Shame on me (EDIT) oh yeah forgot to mention one of the most frustrating things - the input delay lag or whatever it is where you press a button (Coughs) ""DODGE"" and it just won't register so that boss fight you would have usually won you lost because yeah input delay or whatever coding shenanigans.  Dodge dodge, dodge, Dod-input-lag-ge - get smashed by boss- recover three light attacks cause don't you dare try finish a combo - more autistic level of dodging again with about 405 more input lag fails - lost fight come again rinse repeat.  The game is OK"
Negative,"Overall a 6.5/10. There's a lot of game here and it's competently put together, but I'm here to tell you the bad stuff. You can read about the good stuff (like the bosses!) everywhere else.The combat:- As long as this game is, somehow there's only one light combo in the entire game. You do get one spear weapon with a slightly different combo as part of a hidden midgame quest, but it gets quickly outclassed even if you do like its combo because it's not upgradable. You also get another spear from the secret true end boss in case you want to put yourself through a NG+. No hold or timing combo variations of any sort. Games from 2005 like God of War and Devil May Cry 3 had more combat variety in the first couple hours than this game has after 50.- In contrast to the lack of light attack variation, you have three stances that all modify the heavy attack. In theory you're supposed to tailor your combat style to the enemy, but in practice all of them take a lot of skill points that are much better put to use buffing up your stats. In addition, they seem fairly useless, as even the basic Smash stance that you get for free is serviceable. Realistically you only really use the heavy attack to 1- or 2-shot basic mobs because the heavy attack is unreliable vs bosses - see the next point.- Enemy hitboxes (the ones where THEY take damage) are OK for the light attack, but completely unreliable for the heavy smash attack - things that look like they connect, frequently and reliably seem to do no damage. And I'm excluding instances where enemies visibly move out of the way or dodge the hit. No issues with your own hitbox - I've never been hit by something that didn't look like it connected.- Basic enemies are extremely uninteresting to fight and tend to die from either a charged attack + 1 light hit, or in one full light combo.- You get a few different spells and transformations to work with, and the game facilitates builds for them. While the transformations are fine, the spells are unfortunately poorly implemented. Your mana doesn't replenish at all except with a couple rare items that restore a very very small amount, which they do at the cost of crippling your healing. This on its own would be fair enough, since that scarcity is something you can balance around. However, the instance you tap the spell button, three things happen: the game puts you in a casting animation, takes your mana, and the spell goes on cooldown. Meaning if you get interrupted at any point before casting is complete, you not only took damage and didn't cast the spell, but you also lost mana that you're not getting back AND the spell is now on cooldown.- Unskippable cutscenes. This includes those at the start of the boss fights, and any boss phase change cutscenes. Suffice to say, the more you struggle with bosses, the more of a problem this will be.The level design:- Each level has pretty much one unchanging colour palette. The green one. The yellow one. The white one. The grey one. And so on. 95% of the environments are one note and uninteresting to look at. Not something you'd notice if you saw some screenshots or just clicked around the progress bar while watching gameplay videos, but the problem starts as soon as the first chapter and doesn't really go away.- The environmental design isn't just artistically bankrupt, it's also functionally bankrupt. The levels, despite looking pretty on a technical level, have no interesting features, and I found myself lost a lot of the time due to how samey everything looks. In many places you can just do a 180 and won't be able to tell that anything's changed. There's very few landmarks to aid navigation, and no map of any sort to help with this problem. - The game won't let you fall off ledges, which I have no particular problem with - until it decides out of nowhere that you're in one of the <1% of areas in the game where ledges are a falling hazard. These instances are only good for a couple surprise deaths and pointless to the extent that I don't see why they're a thing to begin with. The inconsistency is jarring when it happens.- Invisible walls everywhere like they never went out of style. These are ubiquitous and frequently break the immersion. This is further aggravated by the invisible walls massively mismatching the geometry, especially if you have the audacity to want to explore, and are a problem even in some boss arenas whose play spaces don't match the visuals.- Between the above level design issues and the non-boss enemies being uninteresting to fight, the exploration quality is somewhere between mostly boring and aggressively annoying, and on some level I think this game would've been improved by just being a boss rush.This all to say that, aside from the fantastic bosses and the refreshing lack of cringe, preachy or brain-dead writing, the game is mostly amateur hour. Not bad for the developer's first game in this genre, and I look forward to better games from them in the future."
Negative,The real enemy in this game is the horrid camera. Makes bosses a drag; not fun and interactive. You just want to beat the boss and move on. The nuances of the fight is lost to the completely messy camera and lackluster hitboxes.
Negative,it did not work on my computer
Negative,"Not recommended, too addictive."
Negative,"Game just stutters non stop, tried every setting possible but this piece of crap just does not want to run smoothly so dont buy it"
Negative,"If you were to about buy this game, think twice. I going insane while playing this game"
Negative,Perfomance is terrible and unplayable on HDD driveshad to move my game to my SSD which is limited in storage
Negative,"This game is a dark souls re skinned. Very boring and repetitive. I got tricked into buying this game, because i heard the term, ""Original"" I need a physical copy to throw it away."
Negative,"Family sharing doesn't work.  We have family shared for ~4 yrs  from another computer but for the life of us, cant get this one to work.  Any advice welcome.  We are NOT buying a second copy.  The game says it's shareable but we are not figuring that out at this point and the time spent researching this is a PITA, maybe can look into it later.  Seems deceptive.  Game does show up on this device to share but can't get it to be recognized by other device (cant even see it in the library)."
Negative,"It's an ok soulslike game.  It's popular because it's chinese, and there are a ton of chinese people.  Like any chinese product, it's quality is lacking.  Bad framerates and a ton of crashes.  Avoid until patches come, and it's on sale."
Negative,Hundred Eyed Daoist.
Negative,over 9 hours in and i can't get past the load screens a little sad cause it seems like cool game if i could actual get to play it
Negative,Extremely overrated.Imagine if this game isn't the first Chinese triple A title and not storied on nostalgic folklore it wouldn't acquire anywhere as close attention.
Negative,No gore and dismemberment - refunded
Negative,"the first 30 minutes of the game has maybe 5 minutes of gameplay, everything else is a cutscene. Don't care if this changes later, this was a horrendous introductory experience."
Negative,Great game BUTwhat is the point of having a item shop if shit is always sold out -10/10
Negative,Unfair bosses: marathon edition.
Negative,几个问题不解决的话，不推荐:1. 优化2. 过场看画卷那里，不能跳对话3. 按键反馈，不能改建就算了，很多时候，喝药或者技能都放不出来4. 地图；没有小地图或许能强化探索，但是类似场景让人头晕，由于空气墙的存在，很多地方能不能过去完全不知道，加了小地图至少知道那里是边界
Negative,This game is definately not for the casual player.  If you are not a pro type players some of the bosses are unbeatable without hours and hours of grinding levels.  If the were an easy mode for casusal players it would help.
Negative,"Bosses are super repetitive and boring but do look cool same as graphics, the dialogue on the other hand is cheesy and terrible as well as the voices are super annoying. The only thing this game has going for it is the graphics."
Negative,"The buttons dont work. Im not talking about the delays and animation pauses. I mean while standing still you can see on the screen the game reading the input as the icon goes dark, but nothing happens. I feel like i have to hit every single button like 5 times to get things to activate. Not using frame gen. My rig is getting 90fps. When the buttons work, the fights are easier than shit. Pathetically easy. But the buttons most often dont. The hardest part about this game is it doesnt work all the time. Wish I hadnt bought it. After a time its legit just not fun. Youtube videos and reddit back me up on this. Its happening to a ton of people. Its even happening on ps5. The game is dog shit."
Negative,"Very good game, loved it when i wasnt dying. Definitely seems like it will be worth the $50 i paid for it. The progression is kinda scuffed as it never tells you where to go or what to do next and overlooking a single doorway behind you can lead to you being stuck for 20 minutes looking around both large and smaller maps for that one doorway. Bosses can be harder to find than defeat, however (as of chapter 2) the story is great, it feels good to play, and is surprisingly easy for a soulslike (although it isnt easy easy of course). Would not recommend though as gatekeeping is my favorite thing and I want people to see a positive review under a thumbs down"
Negative,crashing non stop! Unplayable.
Negative,"Game is unplayably glitched. Maybe I can try it again later and reassess, but as is, it's embarrassing how non-functional this game is."
Negative,"extremely overrated, its decent but not worth $60"
Negative,"Not diverse enough, not enough rainbows. Considering refunding."
Negative,"Honestly just kind of boring and repetitive, not worth it for the price at all."
Negative,I would ask for a refund if I hadn't gotten it for free. The first bosses are ridiculous. And they claimed it's not a Souls-like game...
Negative,"Game exits to desktop during loading initial game menu. Had to refund quick so I don't lose my money. Shame, I doubt this will ever be fixed for me, because I think it's either something in my hardware or some windows update. Hope I am wrong and some game patch fixes it. They should reaaly be game demos for all  similar games(I'm talking about the graphical quality and the rpice range). OS : Windows 11 64bitCPU : i5-11600kM/B : MSI MPG Z590 GAMING FORCEGPU : Radeon RX 6600RAM : 16GB DDR4 CORSAIR 1600MHz"
Negative,THIS game are more harder and harder when you enter ng++++ we stuck at the progress but enemy become stronger and harder im finish this game 4times but it's a sucks when you do a hundreds combo enemy just need one or two hit to defeat you
Negative,"NOT RECOMMENDED-main character does not talk. (most sad thing in game, gets asked a lot of questions and never replies)-no map. some areas are large circles with corridor to important places.-ocasionaly keys dont register. For example : ''R'' to replenish health-badly balanced bosses. All bosses are medium/fun difficulty except final bosses of chapters. Final Bosses are very difficult-invisible Walls, sometimes bosses use areas where player cant get. Such as Chapter 2 final boss. - many attacks are impossible to block or character gets animation of damage-character can't jump over basic obstacles-unintuitive ideas, such as buying weapon upgrade materials right from the checkpoint shop.For FromSoftware fans and Google Cheese fans its a good game. However to recommend to everyone and friends  is ... optimistic. Game should be suggested as  : Buy at Own RIsk''.It's good , of course. Artwork is very, very detailed. interesting. refreshing, gameplay is fun.Better game to spend 50gbp  is Ghost of Tsushima.EDIT 15/08/2024Black Myth Wukong is like an art book without words to describe impressive pictures or a movie without meaningful voice lines. Another self harm game from Asia which for a very mysterious reason tries to meet FromSoftware standard instead of making its own.6/10"
Negative,"I spent my little over an hour tinkering with the settings and fought two bosses. The praise for this game revolves around it's beauty and technical achievement. I'm not really sure where any of that is coming from. I'm running an RTX 3090ti and played with graphics from the highest settings down to medium. No matter what I did I felt like I was just constantly staring at a mess of artifacts. Artifacts EVERYWHERE! The visual language of this game is confusing as well. Everything looks the same and aside from some floating glowing lights you would never know where to go. The combat was honestly nothing special or even above average, the art direction felt samey and tangled, and the visual clarity was... at best distracting. I don't know if bots are bloating these reviews, but I honestly can't see where the praise is coming from."
Negative,i7 10700F VGA : 4060TI ram : 32 GB Usually crask at medium setting
Negative,"> Benchmark tool: 90FPS> Release Game, same settings: 30FPS> Keeps crashing, making you start over> Zero patches in week 1> Refund the game> Chuck Fina"
Negative,Game is completely unplayable on RX 7900 XT or XTX. If you have either do not buy this game. It will crash on the intro every time.
Negative,10 minute crashes every 10 minutes for me making it unplayable. other than that it seems to be quite good.
Negative,i cant run this game with radeon 7900 XTX? i cant pass the loading screen.
Negative,"Pretty fun if you can look pass the glaring issues, most bosses are decent, main bosses are terrible."
Negative,"Perfect if you like graphics, history(altho Wukongs character is completely different than in the original works), characters, voice acting: 10/10Absolutely trash combat though: -10/10 , so if you like to play well and improve then don't play this game, because to beat the bosses you need to do the opposite"
Negative,"Genuinely great story, graphics and plot but there was not one single boss that I enjoyed fighting. This game has the single worst boss design I've ever seen in my life. Other than that (and bear in mind this is a boss rush game) its bloody brilliant. ALSO IT ONLY LETS YOU SKIP 40% OF THE FLIPPING CUTSCENES"
Negative,game crashing upon first cutscene.should deff be able to run this game would love to play but unfortunately i can not at this point
Negative,Get stuck on an impossible boss with a game so linear you just end up hitting your head against a wall.
Negative,"Died more than 10 times on first boss.  It is ok to build a soul like game, but at least label it so.  I avoid all soul like game, just personal preference."
Negative,fucking shit game
Negative,i do not recommend
Negative,"For a game that's 90% combat, the mechanics are horrific. There's no input buffering, action cancelling, and your attacks / lunges miss way too often due to no error on your own part. Even dodging feels very inconsistent with it's timing. The bosses in acts 2 and 3 have way too many gimmicks and poorly designed hitboxes that make this game feel like a chore. The graphics may be beautiful, and sometimes the combat just works, but most of the time it doesn't."
Negative,"Why am I not recommending this game?  I have no idea.  I don't even know why.  It's just not fun to me.  I do like the God of War games and Souls games, but this interesting mix of the two is just not for me.  Maybe I'll change my mind down the road."
Negative,"Sorry boys, but you can tell it's chinese 😂Got me bored in like 30 mins (15 of which were cutscenes).Don't know if it gets any better after a few chapters or after unlocking some perks in the skill tree, don't care, for me it just didn't click fast enough.It doesn't look stunning, it looks ok, some clipping here and there.There was no lip sync for the English version.The light and heavy attacks had repetitive animations.I bought it just because i saw a huge percentage of positive reviews and i thought i'd give it a try.Good thing you can refund, eh? 😂"
Negative,"The devs of this game have gone through the motions to make sure none of the bosses are fun. It's not even a skill issue. It's just boring.Last time I read Journey To The West I thought Sun Wukong was one of the most overpowered characters ever, so much so that even one of his clones is just as overpowered but playing this game I realised that if a butterfly sneezed his way his attacks, skills and every ability gets cancelled.He must have forgot to take some tenacity pills.Bosses fly or roll out of range, hard to see what is going on, random effects that make it even more annoying like invisible walls. They seem to have no animations or cooldowns for their skill, get stuck at 0 HP does all sorts of mad moves and then cutscene or crashes, grabs happen when you're behind them and about 5 chars away.World exploration is nice if it doesn't lag."
Negative,Pretty bad gaming experience. The cutscenes didnt lag all that bad (but not at all would be better) but the game constantly stuttered while just walking around. Basically anytime I encountered a new enemy. Plus the whole game had this blur to it that I couldnt get rid of no matter what settings I changed that made what should have been a beautiful game look very unappealing to me
Negative,"tiger vanguard is a r3tarded boss, the worst boss in gaming history. actual dogshit boss. i still fw this game heavy tho"
Negative,nope to repetitive and never as fun playing alone needs to be mmo
Negative,super raw and grifics soso also lagging
Negative,can't sex monkey
Negative,not what i expectedi dont know that it should have the souls like tag on it it feels more like if god of war had a baby but slept with sekiro and devil may cry and no one knows who the father is wasnt for me
Negative,"""Fromsoft at home""If there was ever an example of poor boss design and buggy gameplay mechanics this is textbook.This game is so made in china that is crumbles apart the farther you get into it6.5/10 No way a game of the year contender. Buy it on sale"
Negative,"The game looks great, but I cant suggest this to anyone but the most die hard of gamers, the difficulty level right off the get go to is way too high. A lot of it comes from how small the enemy attack queues are, and how unforgiving those attacks are. The game also feels very inconsistent in when my attacks are going to stagger an enemy out of one of theirs, or if they are just gonna swing right through me"
Negative,"its a good game overall, I can maintain around 110 fps in the first play, but after the first play, every time i tried to play after that is laggy af, it's just keep dropping fps for no reason, the sound and the game is separate. Overall the game is not optimized well, the game is not stable, I tried every way that I could, update drivers, write the -dx12, its just not working, the game just keep lagging in every single way, one second 110 fps and one second 1 fps, this game sucks and annoying, it does not worth the money to get this frustration (if u have really good setup ignore this). For ReferenceI have Geforce RTX 4060  CPU: 12X AMD RYZEN 5 5600 6-CORE PROCESSOR"
Negative,"Not Recommended (for now)I feel like I might be in the minority here, judging by all the amazing reviews, but I can’t recommend the game in its current state. There are too many graphical glitches, ray tracing and lighting issues that make the experience frustrating. The hair rendering looks bad, and there’s constant shimmering no matter what settings I try. The game doesn’t seem optimized either—using frame generation introduces noticeable input lag on the controller, which really affects gameplay.Visually, the game feels oversharpened and ugly, I'm sure I'd enjoy the game as I love the genre and the art style looks really cool, but with so many performance and visual issues, it’s hard to enjoy. Hopefully, future updates will fix these problems."
Negative,"the best i can say is its ""OK"", feels like a new team was given near infinite money, it looks fantastic, boss fights are great, but it doesn't flow outside of boss fights like it should. not a bad game by any means, but not worth the money, at least not for strictly the game-play.Again, interesting story seems like a decent adaptation, it does a good job making a spectacle of itself early game. Feel like this is a studio to watch, their next few games I suspect will address all my issues with this one."
Negative,beautiful visuals and atmosphere. unfortunately the difficulty is crazy. i wish it were different but black myth wukong is only for elite gamers without other hobbies/responsibilities.
Negative,Unplayable. Game crashed on title screen. Refunded.PC Specs; -GPU 7900 XTX Driver ver. 24.7.1 | -CPU 7950X3D
Negative,"great game terrible hit boxes on larges bosses, this game needs some serious optimization patches that dont seem like they are coming any time soon, its like the devs abandoned support already"
Negative,"You know what's great about FromSoft games? You get some time between bosses to get better gear and if you're stuck you can try some other places. The first chapter is boss after boss with very little in between and the difficulty is all over the place. I'm stuck at this f**ing black bear, and there's nowhere for me to go, and nothing for me to upgrade. Highly frustrating. And of course, in the grand tradition of ""if you're not good enough f*** you, we already have your money"", there's no difficulty level.The second chapter is much better, with plenty to explore. Plenty of tough fights, but manageable.I'm at the third chapter now and the dragon ""Kang Jin loong"" is just terrible. There's this grab-kill that is does at the start of the fight, no matter if your far away, if you don't perfect dodge you're dead. And the whole fight feels like an unresponsive slow-motion mess. I tried running in potato mode for this fight but it's just slow as hell. And it's at the beginning of the chapter, so f*ck me."
Negative,"might be a decent game for some, but for me it didnt clickgame feels clunky to me and i dont like the combat, to me this game feels like some indie souls-like with UE5 graphics.fighting trash mobs felt like a slog to me, and the few bosses i fought (wasnt many) also did not feel like they are designed anywhere close to the level of fromsoftware bosses, but mass produced, which is expected from a chinese game i guessthis is my subjective perception, whoever has fun with this game feel free to keep having funbut the reviews are highly manipulated by china.this game amassed so many positive reviews in the first day already, it is not only highly unusual, i never saw something like this happen any time before. china before review bombed overwatch 2 on steam into the ground, now they reverse review bombed wukong up like this. chinese propaganda. this alone would be worth a negative review, but i simply dont like the game itself either"
Negative,"The amount of positive reviews for this game can't be real.  Level design is shockingly bad.  Invisible walls are everywhere instead of a well designed set.  The bosses do not react to you in any way, so it's just a frustrating memorization game.  They all have infinite range teleport attacks that you have to dodge before the boss even moves based on a noise or something.  The combat is just uninspired and middling.  There is basically a single move set the whole game and no other weapon choices, so if you don't prefer the staff you are out of luck.  Sorry I bought this one.Just as a side note, the performance is also bad.  I could forgive that if the game itself weren't so bland."
Negative,"Very poor performance on PS5. Low resolution, glitches, frame rate drops are just some of many technical problems. The developer is irresponsible to let it be sold on PS5 with so many problem unsolved. Don't buy it! 就这ps5优化，游科纯纯态度问题，不配好评。steam和PS上各给一个差评。"
Negative,"I imagine that this is good if you like soul like games. I do not. I was told this was more like God of War, I don't see it. I do not have the patience to sit and either watch youtube videos explaining each fight or to do the fight 30 times to figure out EXACTLY when to press the dodge button. Honestly not fun or rewarding after the two first bosses. Unsure if I will continue, if I even figure out which direction to go...."
Negative,"Black Myth: Wukong is an action RPG rooted in Chinese mythology. You shall set out as the Destined One to venture into the challenges and marvels ahead, to uncover the obscured truth beneath the veil of a glorious legend from the past.The story in Black Myth: Wukong can be confusing and difficult to follow if you are not prepared and know the lore. I did not know much, and felt pretty detached from the story. You need to pay close attention to what every NPC says along the way and exhaust all dialogue. The side quests with various NPCs you meet along the way can be very difficult to figure out what you need to do and when to do it without checking a guide on the internet. Sometimes if you progress the game too far without doing certain steps in a side quest, the quest will be forfeited without warning and you have to try again the next playthrough. You have no journal or similar to keep track of your quests either. This can be very annoying, and is a thing that I ""dislike"" with this game and other souls-games for that matter, even if it's a minor thing.The combat in this game is kinda boring and doesn't get much better the further you go in the game. The game is very bad at informing you about how things work too, for example combos or certain items. The combat is very basic and there are not many combos. The combat is basically spam your light attack, until you build up enough focus points to do a heavy attack and dodge every now and then. Rinse and repeat. Very repetitive. I also don't think dodging works well in this game. I don't know how many times I felt like ""that should have been a dodge or perfect dodge"" but the monkey just didn't do what I wanted. Once you start spamming X for your combo, it's like the monkey is stuck in the combo somehow and you can't dodge. The hitbox in this game is also very bad, especially on some bosses. Imagine spamming your combo on a boss and not a single attack can hit it!You also have some spells at your disposal, which don't always work so well. Let's say a spell takes 2 seconds to channel. If you get hit while channeling the spell, you are interrupted and it goes on full cooldown. It doesn't matter if you did 5% of the channeling or 95%. Full cooldown. Very annoying.Transformation spells transform you temporarily into another creature with different attacks. Dodging in these forms was even worse. Most of the Transformations also have a very awkward attack pattern, so I did not use them much.The Talent Tree is very boring if you ask me. I focused mostly on the Foundation part for more defense, health, stamina, etc. After that I was not tempted by much else in the tree. Many of the spell upgrades, additional attacks and other various upgrades felt quite boring and useless. Why is there, for example, a possibilty to upgrade your usual jump, so it consumes less stamina?A lot of what you find in this game feels like pure garbage. Armor sets and Curios' have no fun effects and many feel terribly unnecessary. There aren't many weapons to choose from either. You can craft new upgrades to your weapons, giving you more Critical Hit Chance and Damage, but with each upgrade the weapon gets a new Effect as well. For example, a certain part of your light attack combo receives shock damage. If you like the effect that the new upgrade has, and then upgrade your weapon again to increase your Crit Chance and Damage, the previous effect will disappear and you will gain a new effect. If you want your previous effect, you have to live with much less damage instead, which is idiotic. Let's say upgrade 5 is max. What if you like the effect on the second upgrade of the weapon and want to play with that, but you can't because you will lose too much damage. Just imagine the difference in damage between upgrade 2 and 5. It's so stupidly designed.The enemies in this game are very boring and feel more like a chore to get through. They are very tedious and are not much of a threat to the dumb monkey you are playing as. Many of them also has a lot of health and maybe even a shield. What usually happens is that you use your spells on them, burning your mana before a boss, because you can't be bothered to kill them slowly. You can pick up materials in the form of flowers, mushrooms, etc. Some of these are hidden enemies in the ground. They jump up and you have to kill them to get the material. They could have skipped this because it was very boring and tedious.This game has 107 bosses. 107! The majority of the bosses are very boring and way too easy. Many bosses are poorly designed as well. That in conjunction with the dodge function and the bad hitbox made me very frustrated many times. Out of all 107 bosses, a maximum of 5 of them were fun. I beat almost all the bosses on the first try, some on the second try, and some on a few more tries. A lot of the bosses are flying around in the air and were impossible to hit and just extremely annoying. How fun is it to fight a boss that just goes up in the air that you can't hit, when you have no ranged attacks? Some bosses also have some extremely annoying and stupid attacks where, for example, they make a lot of whirlwinds that are hard to avoid. If you get hit by them, it triggers a 1 second cutscene of you being flung into the air. Why? Some of these things can be avoided IF you have a special item equipped, that you don't know of, because the game does not tell you. Some bosses also have several automatic cutscenes in the middle of the fight when you manage to remove a certain part of the boss's health. In the cutscene, you get pounded by the boss, which is meant to happen, but when the cutscene is over, you've lost a lot of health. Some bosses are also impossible to hit sometimes even if they are on the ground because the hitbox is so bad. Quality over quantity please.The visuals in this game are very beautiful. The environment is varied through the 6 chapters, BUT. This game has a lot of invisible walls, which was extremely annoying. Many times it looks like you can go to a certain place, or jump up on a certain rock, but you can't. Later you come to a very large area with many paths and space to explore. Suddenly you can go to a lot of places. All this space to explore, for basically nothing. A lot of large, unnecessary areas which only made the game longer and more confusing. Then comes chapter 4, where a large part takes place in a very confusing cave with a vertical layout, with more invisible walls. The stupid thing is that there are times in the game when there are no invisible walls. An enemy will appear and knock you over the edge. What? No invisible walls protecting me now? Chapter 5 is more linear and straight forward and it is much clearer where you can and cannot. Chapter 6 is the shortest chapter but also the most open one. Designing the environment and surroundings this way makes the player very confused and has a hard time knowing where the boundaries of the map are. This created a continuous frustration throughout the game for me.This game also suffers from long loading screens. It also suffers from FPS drops and short freeze lag during some boss fights. Very annoying.Honestly, I don't understand how this game can have overwhelmingly 95% positive reviews. It's a beautiful game with an okay story if you know it, but otherwise, it's very mediocre. I've played a lot of other souls-like games like the Dark Souls series, Sekiro, Elden Ring, and more, and if I compare this game to those, then this game is not very good. There is a lot of room for improvement though if they make a sequel or another game. Too easy with too boring combat for my taste."
Negative,Just play Elden Ring
Negative,A lot like lords of the fallen. button masher.
Negative,shit ass game not worth a fuck
Negative,shaders didnt install accurately suffering now from eye cancer
Negative,WAY TOO HARD
Negative,No difficulty or gameplay accessibility options
Negative,SPAM SPAM SPAM CHEAPEST TRICKS FOR BOSSES TO  MAKE THEM HARD NOT EVEN LIKE FUN WAY TO MAKE IT HARD JUST SPAM SPAM SPAM AND OH YEAH SPAM SOME MORE EVERYTHING TAKE MILLION YEARS TO REACT AND IT JUST SPAMMING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN
Negative,"I go this game for free with 40x card. I wish i didn't.Seriously, this game f***** SUCK. WHY DO YOU ONLY HAVE 1 BUTTON !??!?!?!??! YOU SPAM SQUARE NONSTOP AND WHEN YOUR METER IS FILLED YOU PRESS TRIANGLE, HOW CAN PEOPLE THINK THIS IS FUN GAMEPLAY ?!?!?! Animations clip and when you dodge it looks very janky, i run 1440p full ray tracing Cinematic on everything yet i cant find myself play this game more than 5minutes before quitting in frustration due to the incredibly boring combat which consist of only pressing 1 button to fill a meter and then press another button, this gameplay sucks more than Woo long did when it released, i truly can't believe the hype."
Negative,"I wish I had known this was a UE5 game before I bought it. As usual with UE5 titles, Wukong suffers from constant artifacting, excessive sharpening that tries to hide the hideous TAA blurriness (neither of which can be turned off), and fucking terrible frame rates. So, if any of these issues bother you, it’s probably best not to buy this game."
Negative,"Looks good but difficulty is just not right for me. There is some good lore in the game. Dodge button is messy, controls are not precise, there is a bit of a lag input. Too many bosses. Some bosses are unbalance. They have no stamina and can spam moves at will, don't have any knock-back like player does. Bosses also use cheap moves which makes for a frustrating game instead of an enjoyable experience. The game could have been Game of the Year for me only if devs listen to my advise. All games need difficulty options. I do not recommend game at the moment."
Negative,warum ist jeder boss gleich?
Negative,Too hard for reasons that are not skill related.
Negative,i just dont like it
Negative,Game beautiful. Most repetitive tapping 1 button most of the time. Movement is very delayed so is consume items. bosses not has hard has fromsoftware games. imo this game boring gameplay.
Negative,It's really pretty but the game itself is really really boring for the first few hours. Really needed some sauce to hook the players and it doesn't have that until a good way into the game.
Negative,"I really want to have an issue with this game. It would make it all more simple if the game was bad so I could walk away. Unfortunately, the game is really good. It just doesn't run well on my PC. Pick this game up if you have a supercomputer, but I can't run the game well. The combat flows excellently (or would, if I could play it without dropping frames), with some roughness from the apparent lack of an input buffer for some moves."
Negative,"+ very strong artistic direction, magnificent animations and visual effects- difficult for nothing, series of bosses repeatedly, a bit of a light story, some not quite successful environmentsoverall it's a decent epic boss fight game, but it's neither a good ""soullike"" nor a good Rpg. The atmosphere and the D.A of the characters make up for some of the game's flaws. But it's not enough..."
Negative,The game make my whole pc crash and i have to hard restart my pc.First time it happens with a game and i have a great pcHappens for several people apparently...I just beat the guy in the openning and it crashes so can't really give a good reviewRefunded
Negative,I really want to play this game but the optimization is currently terrible. Running a 4070 with an i7-10700 and 16 GB of ram. It played great right when i installed it. I had a couple of frame drops but nothing I couldn't handle. The day after the update I booted up and it just played terribly. Massive frame drops which make it unplayable in its current state even on mixed high/medium settings. I've only made it to the beginning of chapter 2 where the sand area is and I stopped because I can't handle the game freezes every 10 seconds.
Negative,"I have only ever regretted purchasing two games in my life, Starfield (what a terrible mistake that was) and this game here. The combat was simple and easy, bringing to mind certain kinds of mobile games (no surprise, the devs only made mobile games before Black Myth). The enemy and boss designs are well done, so they have that going for them. In conclusion all I have to say is this, this game isn't a soulslike, it's soulless."
Negative,"Just another bland uninspired single player game. It feels like a mixture of the new GOW games and souls games while not being a soulslike but it fails at surpassing the two. Its a linear path with from the 2 hours i played, a pretty lacklustre story which I have heard really doesn't pick up. If there is barely any exploration and barely a story, you'd expect the gameplay to be the star but it also feels pretty generic and already felt old after my measly two hours. If you are interested in this game for its gameplay, just play GOW, it does it far better. If you are interested in its setting and style, while not about Chinese mythology, Sekiro is the game i would recommend.Gaming is so dry nowadays that people settle for whatever. I wouldn't call it a bad game, i can see why people like it but it really doesnt do anything new or interesting that makes me want to play it. Also with only 20,000 reviews being in English, you can tell most of the player base of this game are foreign and they are used to playing LOL, CSGO and other games of that style so any game is probably an upgrade."
Negative,"The lag in this game is crazy! i was stuck on a boss because of the crazy lag in some bosses that you have to beat to progress!After beating the fifth chapter, I realized I missed the NPC hub discovery. It's too late for upgrades! And yet all that effort is useless because the best weapon and armor are locked behind bosses in the last chapter. It makes all the grinding you did useless!The most important NPC quests are well hidden, and you will easily miss them all if you don't watch a YouTube playthrough!I don't know why this game got good reviews! maybe because of the cultural war But it had before release!"
Negative,"I'm super on the fence about Wukong, but I decided that I have more gripes than I do praise for this game. Let me explain.Firstly, let me get the praise out of the way. Visually, this game is astounding. Enemy design is impressive, animation quality is top notch, and those big hits in combat can be so rewarding. There's a ton of bosses with unique movesets, and are easily the best part of this game.But now come the shortcomings. This game is beautiful visually, yes, but it feels horrible to navigate. It's impossible to tell what's traversable and what's littered with invisible walls until you smash your face against it, the camera is equally as unwieldy, and you NEED to explore if you want to find more bosses and useful items.Additionally, in order to charge your heavy attacks, you need to first land light attack combos. You get 3 different stances with their own unique heavy attacks. That's great, a moveset should feel varied! Except the light attacks stay exactly the same. And when you're exploring in this game, 90% of the enemies die to a single light attack combo, making their encounters boring and tedious.In comparison to other games of its genre like Bayonetta, the attack variations in this game can only be described as lacking. When light attacks are such a prominent part of the gameplay loop, I have no understanding of why they made it the least customisable part of your moveset.Now we get to the biggest issue for me. The performance problems. The biggest boss in this game is the framerate. My PC is well within the specs to run this game, but there's some cutscenes and fights where the game literally drops to 0fps when entering into particular boss fights. I've tried turning down my settings, but on low settings, visually important aspects of a fight are near invisible, like the tornado in the yellow wind sage fight. I can run Cyberpunk 2077 on high fidelity with zero issues, yet I can't fight a lady with lightning powers without feeling like my PC is going to explode.This game is VERY unoptimised, as evident by the 120GB size and inconsistent quality, and that's what tips this game over to a negative review for me. I can't recommend this game until it's better optimised. Great concept, but it needs more time to cook."
Negative,"spent like 40 minutes troubleshooting it but could not get it to run well. It has a weird issue with the lighting where my screen literally flickers, on top of inconsistent performance and contant framerate stutters"
Negative,"Was really hyped for this game, but was disappointed. Looks good, but the combat just doesn't do it for me. Feels clunky compared to other action games I've played recently such as GoW and Stellar Blade. I only got to about lvl 7, but didn't feel like committing $60 to it. I'll come back to it when the price drops. Maybe."
Negative,"Sadly I have to give this game a negative review. After just finishing it in about 40 hours and doing almost everything there is, the game left me disappointed in what I felt was underwhelming ending to an okay-ish story. Nobody can deny that Black Myth: Wukong is a piece of art in of itself and that lots of love was given to it. I was especially blown away by the artworks between chapters aswell as the animated stories that introduce each chapter. Whilst I was never bored I definitely kept hoping that the game would come around and really pick up the game. First and foremost I had different expectations from what I had seen online. I was thinking that this game was a soulslike game that was difficult to get into and hard to master. Whilst there are some elements of a soulslike this is not a game I would personally put in that category. This is an adventure that is way to easy most of the time. I streamed the whole game to a friend and we both agreed that most of the enemies were too easy to see through and that their health pool was freakishly low. If you die in this game (which will not happen that often) you don't get that aspiration to become better, you just think that the next try will become better. It is, or at least it is in my opinion, not necessary to learn the moveset of the bosses since bruteforcing your way to the game is just too easy. Pick this up at a huge discount or just leave it be."
Negative,"Well, to be perfectly honest, and in my humble opinion, without intending to offend anyone who might hold a different perspective, while also considering this matter from various angles, and without condemning anyone’s views but rather aiming for objectivity, and taking into account every valid opinion, I honestly believe I have nothing to say."
Negative,"Recieved it for free along with my newly purchased GPU, fter playing for about two hours and kind of just struggling through every encounter and dying dozens of times, I can't really recommend the game to someone new to the genre, especially with the lack of any sort of difficulty setting or explanation to combos."
Negative,"I'm going to give this game a 0/10i give every game like this such a scoreyou are interested in having people enjoy your game rightwell stop making every major block buster for people who gain satification from getting their asses kicked for 6 hoursand then dodging so much they got luckydon't put all that animation if you going to make it so difficult i hate itso no i'm not going to play youthere's an easy way around thisadd a difficulty settingsee it's that easyeasy, normal hardbut noyou want people to share their experiences onlineand have a sense of statuswell good on youi am never touching another one of your games eversince you cannot have the common senseeto make the experience managablegood bye"
Negative,Not really a fan of this 'learn the bosses timing by dying over and over again' style of game. I much prefer click on heads shooters.
Negative,O bucata de cacat de joaca cu un boss de cacat de mcgregor ebanii
Negative,Game does not take skill. Just a lot of luck and randomness. It claims to be difficult but that is just if you are unlucky and keep getting bad die rolls.
Negative,unreal engine 5 doesn't work properly with 13th and 14th generation intel processorsl o l0/10
Negative,needs 32:9 support
Negative,Combat is mid as hell and my ass is lagging with frames and input error. combat = spam light attack and dodge until cooldowns are up
Negative,The dynamic global illumination is broken. Areas are too bright or too dark. Sunny areas hurt  my eyes.
Negative,"This game sucks. What an overhyped piece of garbage. It’s basically Devil May Cry with some monk (not monkey) moves. Protagonist is silent. There is very little story. Gameplay is you running from boss to boss in pretty barren environments. The boss fights are good but there’s nothing else driving you or the game forward. It’s worth $25 tops, not $60. Final Fantasy 16 has comparable gameplay and it’s $20 cheaper with a more engaging story."
Negative,65 dollar waste of money game is very repetitive a lot of invisible walls graphics are stunning but that all it has going for it seems like a very good looking game from the early 2000s. it should not be more than 20 dollars
Negative,too disrespectful to the player
Negative,"Boring,slow,weird,eng dub for wukong was so bad .... no coop? not worth"
Negative,It's Knockoff Elden Ring
Negative,the game pulls your info of your device don't bye it . it even has you agree to allow them to sell or use it however they wont.
Negative,"Not advertised as a souls game, but it definitely is.  It's even worse.  dodge does not dodge most of the time, etc.  If the combat was more tight, it might be enjoyableAlso, be aware that the EULA gives them the rights to your local and global IP, etc. even though it's a single player game."
Negative,"This game absolutely does not deserve the hype!First off, it’s a massive failure not making this game open-world. How can a modern game be released without a map? It’s an absolute joke and reeks of amateurism!The spawn points are absurdly placed. Every time I die—and in a game designed to be challenging, I’m forced to run all the way back from a spawn point that seems deliberately placed to waste my time.Now, let’s talk about the atrocious boss fights. At least the Souls games understand how to make bosses difficult but fair. Here, your bosses are just trash! It’s the same tired nonsense: you whittle them down to three-quarters health, and then, no matter what you do, they obliterate you. Where’s the fun in that? It’s frustrating, and takes all the enjoyment out of the game.The only reason this game is so highly rated is because a billion happy Chinese players are just thrilled to see one of their stories being told. But let’s be real—the gameplay is mid at best!"
Negative,"I do not understand how this game has overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam. I was enjoying this game up until chapter 3. Kang-Jin Loong is the worst designed boss in any video game I have ever played. Beating him is then followed by escaping some sort of prison? This part of the game is so frustrating, it made me quit. Would it hurt to add a map to this game!? I spent the whole of chapter 2 figuring out where to go. Lastly, can people stop denying this is a Soulslike? It is clearly a Soulslike, it would stop people who are not into Soulslike games getting tricked into buying this if we just accept that this is a Soulslike game."
Negative,"Something is definitely up with all these positive reviews with so little completion time!I've played for around 42 minutes and know the gameplay is going to be repetitive and boring, so I've requested a refund.I'm going to get a lot of hate from the army of bots or whatever is happening here on Steam."
Negative,"do not buy this game if you do not like elden ring / soul games. the reason why people call this ""souls like"" has nothing to do with souls. Its because just like elden ring, its a boss fight simulator where the boss 2-3 taps you at best. If you like boss fight simulators like elden ring, please buy this. If you were on the pause menu too long and now you can't refund it, you are me."
Negative,"Notice how online reviews of the game mainly talk about how beautiful it is?It's true, it's a really great looking game. It shows off the merits of UE5 well however, if you look past the beauty, there are some glaring cracks.The game sits in the action-RPG genre, but to me, it feels more in the vein of a souls-like.The minions are extremely easy, but some of the mid-level and end-level bosses are quite challenging early on.You'll die a lot. I expected to die in this game, but not this much. Why? Because ""Journey to the West"" is an adventure.As such, I expected to be taken on an adventure of sorts. Instead, I'm on a repetitive, albeit beautiful grind.This is a problem, because going nowhere and continually dying is not fun. It's not an adventure. It's just boring.My main problem is that combat seems to come down to a lot of luck. One attempt, I can get a boss down to 20% health, then the next attempt I'm dead before barely getting a hit in. Maybe I'm just bad at this game. I know it's an unpopular opinion, but I think it should have a difficulty slider. This would help for the people (like me) who want to go on the adventure and not grind through it.Also, the controls sometimes feel really weird and very hit-and-miss. For example, sometimes the heavy attack doesn't engage. If I press it in during some animation or if the character happens to jump on something (that I don't want), it seems to cancel the action. It can be frustrating. Also, having to hold 'Y' to charge the heavy attack, RB to run, and having to click the right-stick to lock-on and lock-off an enemy can be cumbersome in the heat of combat. Granted, for most enemies you probably don't want to break lock, but for some I found this was the only way to dodge some cheap ranged attacks.I'll finish by saying the character design is really amazing. I think the artists have done an incredible job. My problem with the game comes down to game design and controls. As an adventure, it could have been magical. As a souls-like grind, it's just boring."
Negative,kacke game please
Negative,"This a rare occasion when I really disliked one of the souls-lites/likes. Invisible walls drove me nuts, dunno."
Negative,Does not support 32:9 aspect ratio.Please fix it! This good graphic should be on the best screen.
Negative,"Garbage. Save your money and just buy Elden Ring.UPDATE: Gave it a second chance, still absolute t r a s h"
Negative,Game runs like shit. beat the boss before you notice there mechanic actually all play like shit. wukong has ZERO trickster abilitys and the bosses act more like him then him sadly
Negative,"After 75+ tries of killing Whiteclad Noble - obligatory boss at one of the early areas - and STILL failing, I don't think this game is fun and worth buying. It's just not fun when it becomes a masochistic game. This game needs strong rebalancing and respect of people's time."
Negative,Frequent crashing on AMD. Wait for a patchEDIT:As recommended on Black Myth's website. Downgrade your drivers to 24.5.1 this has solved the crashing for me until a patch is released.#https://www.heishenhua.com/support/detail?id=83
Negative,"This game feels like any generic action game you’d get with a demo disc bundled with a magazine. The level and environment design is terrible, full with invisible walls.“Looks like there’s something over there, let me check it out.”(Runs into an invisible wall again)The game eating abilities randomly, also the input lag is so terrible it is not even funny!The combat is slightly above average, that's about it. It has a lame ass story and terrible exploration.It is not even close to  Souls like games,  it's generally just a action RPG like Assassins Creed or God of War."
Negative,"(Honest Review Based on Day 1 Release With Just Over 2 Hours Of Play)Playing On: i9-13900K, 4090 RTX, 96GB RAM 6400As a rule I generally do not pre-order games and have only broken that rule for about 4 titles over the last 5 or so years, Black Myth Wukong was one of those times. Before I leave feedback on the game itself I think it's important that IF you are going to pre-order ANY game during our modern time of video game creation that you do so only on the day before it is set to be released (or perhaps a week on the rare occasions that early access is offered as a perk). The reason I'm saying this is that time after time games are released to the public with major bugs, glitches, and crashes. Black Myth Wukong is unfortunately one of those games.  I know I am not the only one who has experienced these issues and I'm sure the developer is going to address them with patches (if they haven't already) but the freezes and choppy game-play does seem to impact many based on early and day 1 reviews. I can handle and overlook slight freezes and choppy game-play but when it comes to consistent crashes that's when I check out. I had to play the opening sequence 3 times which were all a result of the game crashing after beating the first boss and going into the following chapter.  GRAPHICS: The game is visually stunning but linear, and I went into it knowing that so that didn't bother me. For those looking for a true open world please keep this in mind. COMBAT The combat was a real mixed bag for me, at times it seemed so-so but overall kind of unresponsive too? It's hard to say for certain what's going on here but I'm sure the developer will improve on this with future patches.WHAT THIS GAME IS: This is a boss simulator and as soon as you finish one boss another is right around the corner, so if this is your type of game then you're going to love it. I don't mind games challenging me but at the same time I am no longer a teenager with endless hours to burn on video games so finding that balance in everyday life is really important. There is no option to change the difficulty in this game but I'm sure either a mod will be released (if it hasn't already) or the developers will eventually make it available down the road. I really wanted to enjoy this experience but between the lagging, choppy play, crashes, and no option to change the difficulty I decided to return it. Perhaps I'll revisit in a year or so from now, and doing that just seems like the smart thing to do for any gamer these days regardless with this title being another example of that. Not only do you get the game patched up later on down the road but you also get it discounted too. Hope you enjoy the title if you decide to purchase it but just keep all of the above in mind prior to doing so."
Negative,"A mediocre game popularized by SBI controversy and Chinese patriotism, nothing more."
Negative,ive never reviewed a game but this game fucking sucks the game has good graphics but it takes place in a swap so it still looks like shit
Negative,can play the game after the prologue that was ass on your part
Negative,Was going to give this a game 10/10 but there was a femoid in chapter 4. Ruined my immersion completely.
Negative,game requires me to use dlss. can't even run game at native resolution or the fps tanks on a 3080 ti. The industry is a joke. i cannot believe this game got so many positive reviews with the state that the game is in. Games should not require dlss to run .
Negative,I do not understand the hype... This game is garbage tho.... Cant be real with the overwhelming reviews....Almost feels like it was spam positive reviews by a certain country.  I had my group of friends try the game too and they also think there's nothing special about this game. It's just a copycat/reskin devil may cry and a bit of God of War.  Don't.... even get me started with the English Dub. The Chinese Dub also sounds bad but not as much as the English Dub. I wouldn't even recommend this game on sale—just T it.
Negative,"You can't defeat this boss?Oh, you need an item that negates him the whole second phase so you can trishot him, you just need to backtrack to a secret npc, talk to him 9 times, backtrack again and find that npc, cast a spell without telling you anything, backtracking again and fight a super secret boss in a secret area you find before.Obviously using a guide, nobody tells you anything.The gameplay is really good tho."
Negative,"I don't know that I can consider recommending this game personally. I'm probably gonna get the barrage of ""git gud"" reactions to my post but after playing this game for ~16 hours I can honesty say I've never seen a an action game with a more inconsistent balance of difficulty across levels/boss fights. All of this culminates to a fight where Game Science does something I've never seen, mid-boss fight, unskippable cutscenese which DEAL DAMAGE. You can die from a cutscene...Its egregious. I wish this fight would've occurred within the first ~2 hours of the game as then I'd have been able to refund but oh well."
Negative,"Repetitive, no map, tons of missable bosses.  Sure it starts strong but quickly gets tedious with only pretty graphics.  Nice starting point for their studio but this is a far, far cry from GOTY."
Negative,"Good！good！good！good！good！Foreign friends may not know who Yang Li really is. Yang Li, who supports extreme female boxing in China, is LGBT to your foreign friends.In this group in China, we male groups and normal women hate them.This game when it plays the anti-LGBT and anti-extremist female boxing banner. Some of the biggest players on the Internet in our country even personally spent money to support it, to help it remove negative public opinion and support it.And on November 11th, it and Yang Li linkage！！！Yes, it and that extreme female boxing supporters, your LGBT linkage, it makes Yang Li become the spokesperson of the game！！！It betrayed us！！！I am furious！！！You may not believe it, but at first the story of the game didn't actually fit the image of Sun Wukong that I used for it. It is my favorite hero Sun WuKong shape can not get my approval. But because it is the first 3a single in China, plus his anti-LGBT anti-extreme female boxing. I was kind enough to give it a good review. Now I'm going to change it from good to bad！！！"
Negative,"Whilst the game has amazing graphics and animations it severely lacks story and proper world building, most of the game is just empty landscapes with a building here and there with fodder enemies spread across and an occasional boss with no story attached whatsoever.The amount of mana the MC has is severely lacking and makes every boss fight feel boring and like a chore in the last 50% of it, on top of all of that there are a lot of animation and hit box inconsistencies with example the pole fighting style which doesn't hit 50% of the time even if the staff goes right through the body of the boss.Whilst this game is a disappointment in my eyes from the expectation, any future games they make could be game of the year contenders if they stick with the level of graphics this game offers and take more time to make a story rather then a boss fighting simulator."
Negative,"Wow this game is 90% hate, resentment and frustration.It's not that it's hard. I could deal with that. It's that it's bloody unfair. Just about every enemy can attack through a staggering hit but your combos get interrupted by just about anything and the dude just stands there like he's rooted.You also cannot abort anything. A jump or roll often does nothing for you.Oh yeah, and many of the enemies will adjust their trajectory mid-air if you do not roll at the exact right moment. No matter them being airborne for a whole second, no matter if you're already physically outside the impact zone, you're gonna get smashed.This game is work not fun."
Negative,just another souls game
Negative,For some reason my GPU keeps overclocking and i cant play the game even on low graphics...
Negative,"A painfully mediocre Souls-like in a boring empty world with no content other than the bosses, and why have mana if you can't restore it? Im 5 hours into the game and cannot restore my mana; I'd much rather that over a few healing potions. For me, this game is about a 5/10; it's playable but not really enjoyable. I have no idea what the hype is about. I mean, the setting is unique, but that isn't going to make me love it."
Negative,"The game is just too hard, I cant even kill the first level bosses and it's just a frustrating experience.I should have know this was going to be just like Dark Souls III, which I also hated.After 4 hours and still on first level I can see there is very little exploring, just killing bosses, fine if you enjoy that kind of thing, a bit too one dimensional for me.Utterly boring repetitive experience.May be an idea but next time put 3 - 5 difficulty settings. Not everyone who plays these games needs this level of difficulty, I won't be bothering to continue on the quest, so £50 wasted all because of making the game stupidly hard. What has made me quit now is if the bosses are this hard in level one, what is the point of carrying on knowing later it is just going to be worse.Amazing graphics, but I did not pay this kind of money for eye candy, otherwise I can't think why there this game is so highly rated.Not even average, don't buy before doing a lot of research and understand what you are getting for your £"
Negative,"I will be honest I did enjoy the art direction of this game and the secret boss was incredible but I don't think the gameplay is super polished. I've played a fair share of souls likes, hack and slashes, and difficult rpgs but no game has made me reach the level of frustration that some wukong bosses have made me feel. While people could argue that certain bosses are skippable and you're not forced to fight most bosses in the game the experience in chapter 1 of the game with wandering wight just disappearing made me feel as if I had to knock my head into a wall and defeat a boss as soon as i encountered it or risk losing some important drop. Also the bosses i had the hardest time with were not hard because their attack patterns were particularly difficult but because they had awful hitboxes, or the arena was small and cluttered, or because they had minutes of invulnerability that did not have an obvious counter. If the studio made a wukong themed animated series or tv show I think their talents may be better used because the most redeeming part of this game was the incredible art style and unique interpretation of the journey to the west characters."
Negative,dont buy it full of crush
Negative,Wait some more if you want to play this. Hopefully they will patch it to perform better.Too many crashes and graphical glitches on my 3070. Truly an eye sore.The 10 minutes I was able to endure felt a bit like Nioh.
Negative,"No HDR, No 32:9 monitor support,  refunded"
Negative,"The graphics are incredibly grainy, which makes the visuals less enjoyable. On top of that, the game suffers from severe FPS issues, making it almost unplayable at times. Due to these problems, I can't recommend this game."
Negative,downvoting simply because of captain wise-voice. easily the worst boss in gaming history
Negative,"Unreal Engine 5. For what is Unreal Engine ridiculous famous nowadays? Stutter, a lot of stutters... Other than that there is also no option for subtitle size and the standard size is way to small. The subtitles are especially bad to read in the intro sequence, white subtitles on white clouds is not the brightest idea..."
Negative,"PUNISHMENT, PUNISHMENT, PUNISHMENT. That's all there is in this act of sadism dressed in the guise of a game. A pox on the developers of this despicable trash. I am joyful when I imagine a future free from their influence and all they inspire.DELETE FOREVER"
Negative,"gameplay loop isnt exactly great, at least its not something I personally enjoy. Almost all the bosses ive fought have had some bullshit moves to deal with, making the fights way less fun then I would have liked. Otherwise the game could have been great."
Negative,It is NOT as amazing as everyone says.
Negative,the game has waaay too many drop frames ( even tho my pc is more than enough to play the game) and sometimes even crashes also has trouble saving sometimes restarts in a point or boss i already finished hope ypu fix this
Negative,"Just started the game, but so far it's really not deserving of overwhelmingly positive.This isn't as awe inspiring as Elden Ring was in its first few parts."
Negative,"Was expecting super fun spinning murder monkey beyblade, instead got boring souls like tickle touch twirly stick weak soy monkey.I was reading reviews and opinions of the game, about if this game was like dark souls combat, or more like god of war combat, and almost everyone was saying it's more like god of war. This is wholly and entirely incorrect, this is just dark souls but monkey, which, if you're into that, go for it. As someone who finds dark souls to be some of, if not,the worst games in all of gaming, akin to beating my head in with a board of perpetual repetitive boredom, I don't particularly find pressing the same one button over and over again on the same one enemy for 5 hours to do the same combo over and over again, only to briefly take a brake from that to spam dodge to avoid the enemy attack, to be particularly interesting, much less fun, as such, that being the only thing this game does, I don't find this game particularly interesting, much less fun."
Negative,"Refund requested. I looked up to playing this game and even pre-purchased after I heard they told dei companies to eat dirt, but after launch can't even play it, I have a 4070 ti super with i9 and 32 ram, yet after validating files, reinstalling, all other applications closed, plenty of resources and following some troubleshooting found on the internet and trying some of my own I just couldn't. I wasted a whole morning and refuse to go any further troubleshooting with something that should easily run on my pc. I was looking forward to this game because it looks fun and beautiful but I'm terribly disappointed I will be missing the opportunity enjoy this adventure."
Negative,The combat is absolute dogshit if you are to tell me this is a 10/10 game.
Negative,"Recommends use of controller, says dualsense is compatible. Its not. it runs extremely poorly."
Negative,Combat feels extremely outdated with it's animation locks. Hit feedback is basically non existent.
Negative,"The fighting mechanics is really bad, a game design is bring people joy and happiness not getting better keyboard and controller, the fight is not based on techniques but just on chances. hell no. and the in game delay on skills and dodges is pretty several compared to this hypekeep playing it for a while but thats it. Yeah, it's a soul game but, to make it to this level will kill the hype very soon. last 14 days of hype"
Negative,"Just wanted to let anyone interested in this game know , if your buying it for the purpose of having a game to explore and see the beautiful landscapes with moderate difficulty... you will be dissapointed because the level of difficulty is verry extreme. I put 19 hours in this game, am at the end boss of chapter 2. Honestly i lost intrest after the tiger boss i find no pleasure in this game, just saying....."
Negative,its hard for a 50 yr old gamer
Negative,The combat feels bad and the graphics look bad unless you have a good computer.
Negative,"优化很垃圾，地图指引和地图根本就没有，对着攻略和地图都找不到。打怪时间占五分，打小怪占两分，找地图占三分，猴孝子搞zzzq和对立有一套的。真是儒家文化熏陶下的好大儿，跪着站不起来了。动作系统也没有特色，数值上也没有提升的变化，难度是j型曲线提升的，剧情是喂屎中二，瞎jb编的，美术确实是有一把刷子的，照理说国产第一部3A应该是支持，可是这种饭圈引导下的结果还是劣币淘汰良币。希望下一部作品能真正跳出局限 ，做出一部优秀的作品，这部作品客观来说也就能达到80分水平，没有主观吹的那么好，而且现在国内饭圈/水军/无脑键盘侠都过于无理智吹捧，会让国内游戏厂商更加的堕落，并不是好事。The game optimization is poor, there is no map guidance or maps at all, and even looking at the game strategy and maps still cannot solve the problem of getting lost. The time spent searching for directions in the game even accounts for 30% of the game time.Brainless fanatic fans are engaged in political correctness and opposition. They are truly a product of the outdated Confucian culture, and their legs can only kneel and cannot stand. As long as rational players point out the shortcomings of the game, they will be criticized and insulted by the brainless and fanatical fans of the game.The action system of the game has no distinctive features. The difficulty difference between the first two chapters of the game is too large. The game plot is childish and illogical. Art design is good. In theory, as the first domestically produced 3A game in China, players should try their best to support it, but the result of this fan culture guidance is still the elimination of good coins by bad ones.I hope the next work can truly break free from limitations and create an excellent work. Objectively speaking, this game can reach a score of 80. Mindless fans in China are excessively praising without reason for now, which will further corrupt domestic game developers and is not a good thing."
Negative,No HDRNo ultrawide supportOversharpened imageOtherwise good tho.
Negative,"as of 20 Aug, 2024 don't buy this game because i personally can't get past the tutorial cutscene before the game crashes and i tried about 7 times so at least at the current version its to buggy don't even try"
Negative,"The game is okay. I assume the overwhelmingly positive reviews come from the over 90% Chinese playerbase getting their social credit. Mostly just looks nice, but is lacking in style. Runs pretty good on my PC, 7950X & 2080 Ti. But my main criticism is the level design and combat. The combat is meh, it lacks good impact or flow to it, it's a lot of just meter build up and dumping, while using a couple long CD abilities. The meter dumps are not ""cool"", they're just the only real way you're dealing damage. The skill tree is incredibly bloated with over a hundred nodes, that give very minor upgrades and many which should have been baseline. The perfect dodge only rewards meter not any sort of punish opportunity which feels bad imo.There are a LOT of boss fights, I faced around 15 in my 6 hours of play. None are memorable, the game is pretty easy, there were at least a few very slightly off the main path which was nice. But that leads to the my other major criticism, the level design, it's very much a look don't touch sort of design, the game is pretty and very much a technical showcase, but there is not thing interesting in the playable terrain layout, it is very much a path, into an open space for a fight, then path. That's it.The story is obviously based on Journey to the West, I didn't think I would have as much trouble following it as I did, but the dialogue is super obtuse, imagine everyone just speaks in Chinese Proverbs. I'm not gonna like, I have very little idea what is going on, besides I'm monkey trying to challenge the gods like Wukong did in the past. The voice acting is not great in both English or Chinese, I played mostly in Chinese and it sounds like soap opera level acting.If you're just looking to showcase your PC and want to button mash through a large density of forgettable bosses, then the game might be for you, otherwise there's just so many amazing games available, with Elden Ring's DLC out and Stellar Blade is coming to PC very soon. Stellar Blade was incredible, I Platinumed it on PS5 and think it's a much better action game inspired by Souls and character action games."
Negative,Everything bad about elden ring condensed into one chinese mobile developer boss rush
Negative,"Man i didn't play much, but as far as it stands, gameplay is ruined by stagger and knock down duration, jesus this is terrible."
Negative,"Probably a great game, but I cannot reccommend it at this point. Im running a RTX4080 with 14th gen intel i9, and ive spent 1 hour restarting the game because it either crashed during shader compilation (due to ""Not enough memory"" which is BS) or straight after the first fight (which happend twice, and i had to play the whole fight twice). Fuck this game at this moment. Ill get it on PS5."
Negative,"I am a souls/ring fan. A simplified review: this is a linear (go straight) game, when you fight bosses from time to time, with almost no weapons, no armor diversion, with plenty of skills to choose from.I do not recommend this game to souls fans."
Negative,this game is actually fucking trash.
Negative,Until the game becomes actually playable without crashing on an intel processor I cannot recommend it as it is quite literally unplayable
Negative,very hard game
Negative,yellow wind sage is the biggest piece of dogshit ever created you could piss in my mouth and put shit back up my ass the wipe dried cum on my face and that would be more enjoyable than this dogshitNvm i just beat him
Negative,while the game is good. It lacks difficulty setting. Ppl just say level up. well im level 30 in first act and it still too hard to get pass bosses. 30hrs in and its to the point of not even playing it anymore. you finally beat 1 boss go threw about 10 basic emenies and you at another boss. no time to level up. This was fun at fisrt but now its just pointless. To the developers why is it so hard for you to make a game with difficulty settings.
Negative,complete trash if u want a game with better combat play wulong fallen dynasty i played this on my stream here is my full review after beating the game
Negative,"So i had no intentions of playing the game but i got caught up on the hype and the vast amount of positive reviews.The game at this stage is not enjoyable. The graphics are just atrocious, poorly optimized and i don't have a bad pc not at all (PC runs triple A games at a steady 140-180 fps if left uncapped/ 240 hz with max raytraced etc.) There is no full screen option. it says it is running at 120 fps, ''4k'' but it looks like it is 1080 lmao. i Spent a good minute playing with the settings more than i played the game and it just looks like shit. I will return it and let it cook to buy later for cheaper, since i also want to enjoy the story with nice visuals. Not this filth . Save your money and let it cook, it has potential."
Negative,"I'll probably change this to a positive review later on, as the game is actually good and clearly made with a lot of passion, but as it stands, I feel that there are too many people hyping this up as ""10/10, best game ever, GOTY,"" without any sense of objectivity, that mislead others as to what the game is actually like. Therefore, I'm posting this as a negative review at least at first, so as to counter all the rampant favoritism that I feel is being spread around here.Black Myth: Wukong is a Soulslike game, pure and simple. A very decent, graphically stunning Soulslike game, but also a very typical one in its gameplay, which mostly consists of the well-familiar ""dodge roll, dodge roll, dodge roll, left click, dodge roll, dodge roll, dodge roll, left click..."" cycle, again and again, with almost no change for the entire 50-60 hours of the game's duration. You have spells and transformations that you use from time to time, drink a potion if you need to, charge your attack when the boss stops for a breather, and then you dodge roll again. And again, and again...Now, if you are a Soulslike fan in general, and have no problem with what I just described, then this game is absolutely for you. The challenge is there, the bosses are many, they're all unique, and they all possess great visual style.If, however, you are looking for something more in the spirit of God of War, with epic clashes, powers, combos and godly action, THIS IS NOT IT. You won't find that here. It's not like Sifu either. No, this is a slow, methodical and very punishing game, with clunky movement, where 2-3 direct attacks can end you at any given time. A rather questionable choice of gameplay for the Monkey King, who is one of the most overpowered beings in Chinese mythology, but I digress...As Soulslike games are made with the goal of being challenging first and foremost, you will spend a lot of your time in this one alternating between torture and boredom, as you either get your butt kicked by the same boss 10 times in a row until you learn its attack patterns perfectly, or you are exploring a very barren (though admittedly beautiful) world full of invisible walls while looking for the next boss that will torture you, as a silent protagonist with a very unclear backstory. Yes, you read that right, you are a silent protagonist and you won't hear Wukong speak for most of the game past the intro! There are also invisible walls in games in 2024, and A LOT of them too. Why? I don't know, but at this point we might as well move on to the story... (no spoilers)The story here is actually very interesting on a conceptual level! Unfortunately, however, you won't understand a single thing that's going on by simply playing the game, unless you are already familiar with Chinese mythology, Buddhism and the Journey to the West novel, which the game is heavily inspired by. If you have a working knowledge of these topics, or happen to be Chinese yourself, then there really is a lot to appreciate here. If not, then it will just seem like random things happening at random moments, with characters who come and go with no explanation of their intentions or origin. Not a bad thing per se, given that the game is made primarily for an Asian audience who will understand said references, but best be prepared to do a lot of outside research if you want to get even a basic idea of what's going on, as an outsider of that culture.So, there you have it...TLDR: Good game, but not great, made specifically for a target audience that's looking for a challenge at the cost of enjoyment. Somewhat overhyped because of graphics, but with fairly typical/average gameplay for a Soulslike (And invisible walls in 2024, for some reason?). Story is meant to be understood by Chinese people, but is much more inaccessible to others. Play if you like Souls games, avoid if you just want to have fun."
Negative,"If you are not familiar with Chinese legendary tales or the story about journey to the west, do not buy this game.The gameplay is like a low version of Elden ring and there are many bugs in it, For instance I got stuck twice in some  corner and drag out of map but not dying. And there are too many useless air walls, it is dump that when you try to cross between two trees and there is a air wall to prevent you doing that.For the story telling, the English translation is really bad. I'm from China so I know what it is telling. But for those who are not, there is a huge possibility that they will not fully understand what the game is telling. Like many critical parts are not translated to English correctly. So if you are not a big fan of Chinese legendary tales, it is not worth buying. Better get you something good to eat using these 60 bucks.Updated 22/08/2024After gond through the whole game. I felt like I got cheated by Gamescience. There are 6 chapters in total. The first four chapters are fine. But the last two are completely garbage. The map is small and no side quests, no NPCs, no items. You can sense that the developer put in less effort in the last two chapter. It is like you are playing some unfinished scenes.For the ending, there are only two endings(has been verified by unpacking the game files). Those two endings are also trash. Nothing has been solved, you will become the next Wukong and wait for next generation. And you cannot believe that this ending was completed on 09/08/2024, only 11 days before release. You can imagine how bad this ending is. What kind of game will have ending completed just before release. It is like a rush work which is typical in Chinese games. It is clear that even the developers did not have a good understanding on the story telling.And the price for this game is same as Elden ring which has a much much longer game play, epic story telling, perfect maps. 30 bucks would be decent  for this game not 60.Also if you have a lower version of hardware, you cannot fully enjoy this game. I can play elden ring with no problems. However, I got multiple crashs and losing FPS while playing this game."
Negative,"Atrocious boss design, inaccessible story to outsiders, Every single boss has (almost exclusively) delayed attacks, at least one boss deals GUARANTEED Damage in Cutscenes. I frankly just do not understand the good reviews this game is getting, the bosses are so uniquely bad, it baffles me, I will edit this critique and elaborate further on what I hate about them so much, for now I just wanted to diffuse some of the frustration, I have never written a review but the absolute nonsense they put into these bosses fascinated me and if someone comments skill issue: well I have played almost every major souls game and never complained about the bosses except for prime radahn pre-patch and also every ""skill issue guy"" is a loser and has nothing to contribute to on how bosses should be designed thanks for coming to my ted talk.Elaboration on boss design: (occasinal spoilers be warned)First off, the issue is not difficulty, the time I spent on the average boss in bmw is miniscule compared to the average time a fromsoft boss takes. The issues are: 1. Way too many Attacks are delayed, the bosses often contort their bodies in such a comical fashion (yaksha best example), so that they manage the heroic feat of baiting the player into an early dodge to get hit, it is cheap design and worse yet, whenever this happens it completely pulls me out of the experience, it breaks immersion every time, because no mythical creature, no enemy in any possible world would attack like this, the attacks were optimized to fool the player and getting got like that for the millionth time as every souls game nowadays does this is just frustrating. Lies of P had a lot of delayed attacks and some of those attacks were also very frustrating, but on average they took the time to craft the movements of the bosses in such a way, that it seemed plausible for them to move like that, the robotic theme lended itself perfectly to that. In bmw, for most bosses no such effort was made, the bosses stands still, they charge an attack, (with no movement however) and then release, and the exact timing of this release has to be memorized, if you don't want to receive damage, it feels like repairing a power generator in dead by daylight with no visual indicator on when to press the button.2. Defensive play is encouraged, for some bosses I found that the best strategy on how to play, was not to play, as in run around charge your heavy attack button, release, repeat. The final boss of chapter 3 is fought like that and if feels like cheesing, but it also feels like the intended way to beat this boss, as light attacks are almost pointless during his golden phase. Some bosses spam aoe attacks like stone monkey, a lot of bosses have this weird charge back and forth kind of charge-attack that can go on for 30 seconds, where the player can't do anything but watch, wait and dodge and it's more watch and wait than dodge. If you are unlucky, here you just kind of watch and wait, occasionally press a button, it feels like the most boring quick time event, this can go on for, like even a minute, during phases like this, the game feels like you are watching a (shitty) movie with how little you interact with the enemy. These attack patterns force the player into a tedious passitivity. Many attacks, when you get hit do actually trigger a cutscene, during such a scene there is legit nothing to do but hold your no longer erect penis in your hand, wait for it be over, I don't know if it's adhd that makes me hate these scenes, but it completely interrupts the flow of combat. 3. The third phase if often more difficult than the first 2 to a ridiculous degree. The final boss of chapter 4 for example just reduces your stamina to an absolute minimum in his final phase because they had no creative, sensible idea on how to make the 3rd phase more difficult, so they panicked, because they want to desperately compete with fromsoftware difficulty-wise and they occassionally manage such a feat by (almost always) lazily restricting movement, suddenly fire is everywhere, a giant tornado that follows you everywhere triggers a minicutscene when one hair of the chosen monkey get sucked in (thank god he does not have a cape) or 1 monkey not difficult, what can we do? Expand his moveset to include more attacks? No, bcs no time, bcs we literally need 100 bosses in this game so 2 monkeys it is. This particular difficulty feels forced, artificial and has no purpose other than frustrating the player, creating an allure of souls-like bcs these games are in trend and it is a meme, but games, using difficulty, insist upon themselves. The ""skill issue"" criticisism has never made sense because the bloodborne dlc bosses, to this day are one of the hardest bosses in rpg gaming and no one has ever complained, bcs despite being more difficult than some newer bosses they were mechanically thought through, fair and fun, it took me several times longer to beat ludwig, maria, orphan, lawrence than any of the most difficult bosses here, but I love the bloodborne dlc and hate this game the issue is how the difficulty is achieved. In bmw the difficulty is often extremely unevenly distributed and lies only within the third phase due to an explosive spike in bullshit, and so, it often occured that I struggled for my life but then beat the boss with, like 5 gourds left bcs there was only one attack or one thing that made the fight difficult and when the boss just did not frequently use his nonsense ""I win"" button the fight was easy, so the difficulty becomes arbitrary. Difficulty in souls games, especially the older ones meant something, depressed people report an alleviation of their symptoms as these games had this wholesame underlying message of: ""don't give up, don't go hollow, you can do this"" and as the player tried again and again, they succeeded and this was the point of the difficulty, here it's just... idk, bcs the other games do this so we do too I guess.But wait there's more:4. Lack of creativity in regards to boss design: After playing for a while, the attack patterns begin to rinse and repeat, flying enemies which spam projectiles, 30 scnd long attacks in which the boss runs across the arena, attacks with miniscule telegraphing, etc. They all us the same cheap gimmicks to get you, it becomes so old so fast to see the same thing for the millionth time. The deer boss in chapter 6 is literally a copy of elden ring's deer boss, for this the devs should be ashamed of themselves. They should amend the law somehow, so that stealing like that becomes illegal, I am not even joking.story:1. the story was completely meaningless to me as I haven't read journey to the west. I also haven't read anything in regards to pinocchio but lies of p's story still clicked with me, because they fixated on those philosophical themes, those themes run through the dialogue, but also through the overall design of the game, which creates an overall great atmosphere and the player could actually get to an understanding of what pinocchio was about. I was invested in ""becoming a real boy"" I'm not interested in whatever happens here, the story could be amazing for all intents but I'm not gonna read a book for a game that I don't even like. 2. it is also just boring for him to not talk, I was invested in the story for the first cutscene where he talked mad shit against the celestial court, but then he just stops, you can argue it makes sense bcs he is not wukong but the destined one, I argue it's boring and another braindead copy of souls-formula.Positive Caveats:The Tiger-Vanguard in the blood-pool and broken shell (endboss) are one of the best bosses in gaming, made me realize I was not crazy and good boss design is actually possible. The many different ways you can counter attacks in this game is unbelievable, so the core gameplay mechanics are great, they are just encased within absolutely horrible boss designs."
Negative,"I guess the game looks pretty, but that's about it."
Negative,This game is too easy
Negative,I love the world buidling and the style from the game. Sadly the game lags and makes my pc chrash. I would be happy if the game alows you to regain mana for balance will fighting a boss.
Negative,what the fuck is this optimization
Negative,boss are to hard
Negative,"Writing and voice acting is pretty bad.Visually looks amazing, but microstutters are present since its built on UE5. Also some optimisation issues in a few locations where my FPS dropped significantly.Combat is alright, though not as meaty as a Fromsoft game."
Negative,"The lore is engaging and graphics are beautiful indeed. But the fighting mechanics is artificially and pointlessly hard, which makes it hard to enjoy the game. You have to get your dodges timed correctly down to the milliseconds to survive and kill some of the bosses. Fighting the boss becomes purely a memory and time counting game with at least 40 attempts. In each attempt you try to memorize each of the boss move and get your timing down. Some of the moves are impossible to react in time to, which is annoying and stupid. Leveling up the skill tree also doesn't gain you much advantage. It still all boils down to your basic attack and dodges, so there is nothing much to look forward to for your grinding. After a while, you ask yourself: Where is the fun? It's probably more fun to play with a stopwatch instead.Update:I installed a mod that allows you to dodge anytime, and the game is more enjoyable now. Previously, your can't dodge in the middle of your light attack animation."
Negative,"Game is ok. Has cool story, interesting bosses but the overall scaling of your character is boring and upgrades in the game feel meaningless. Armor looks good but none of the pieces offer any advantage of the next. Combat is cool if you enjoy watching a monkey spin in circles while spamming light attacks."
Negative,"Beautiful graphics, interesting story. Unfortunately it's too hard, controls are glitchy and sometimes don't respond. And it's definitely not an RPG. It's a souls-like boss run game. Can't recommend for casual players in it's current state. I also find it off-putting the number of bot reviews that are inflating the positive score for this game.And forr the ""git gud"" crowd out there, I'll just say: get a life."
Negative,fix resolute counterflow
Negative,Do not listen to the other reviews. This game is shit. The boar is a terrible boss design. I hope the studio gets hacked and tanks.
Negative,"absolute dogshit, had to be fucked in the head by a ramming camel to play this"
Negative,this trash game is good for jerking-off
Negative,stupid fucking game
Negative,第一章到第五章的游戏体验是递减的，其中第三章的boss设计和地图设计体验下滑最严重，具体问题其他差评都有很详细的分析就不再说了。第四第五章明显可以看出游科对于boss设计确实非常差劲，要么数值爆炸，要么交互无聊，魂不魂战不战的（战指战神）最终章的体验反而有所回升，尤其是可以使用筋斗云。最终和大圣残骸的boss战我觉得反而很精彩。可惜的是，想要吃到这块糖，前面得灌不少粪。至于剧情...我觉得主创不配说自己是尊重原著的，或者他指的原著是吴闲云等人写的无聊阴谋论。Shame on GS
Negative,"I gave it a chance and lost my window of opportunity for refund. I'm not someone who is impressed by visuals. Yea, the game is pretty but it's boring. I don't know how to articulate what I don't like about it but ill try. I don't like the confined spaces, the bosses, the lack of enemies between bosses, the story, the crafting, the abilities, or the leveling system. It feels like a mindless walk thru a story book. Challenge level is for the ""challenged."""
Negative,"TLDR: im playing on a good laptop and the game has crashed 28 times within 2 hours but would be a good game if i could play itI am playing this game on a $1500 gaming laptop that is the newest gen meaning I have a good computer and ive done the benchmark test, I can run this game at 120 fps and the game recommends that I play it on the high graphics quality because my computer can handle it, so naturally it took me 9 attempts to beat the first tutorial boss like in the clouds in front of the giants the very first guy you fight took 9 attempts not because it was difficult but it was because my game crashed 9 times and i had to start over so i thought the game read my computer wrong and lowered all the settings down to the minimum so it can run the easiest and my game still crashes within walking 10 feet of the starting area, any loading screen or cut-scene or any intensive thing like combat will crash my game i have over an hour and a half in the game and i haven't even gotten past the first incense because of how much the game is crashing, its absurd and its pissing me off and im not bashing the game and its idea cause I know if this game actually worked and wasn't made by wet paper it would actually be a fun game with good combat and amazing visuals but somehow my laptop that isnt weak cant run the game on the lowest settings, either the game has way too high requirements or is just a buggy mess and until i get an answer and the game gets fixed id say hold off and save your money for the devs to fix the issue of it constantly crashing.Edit: I did uninstall and reinstall it and it changed nothing"
Negative,"I tried for a refund, they wouldnt..Too Hard for casual gamer, you will advance but at the cost of time(alot).The game is mostly Bosses, thats cool but I would like to enjoy the game without having to you tube how to beat bosses, Needs a difficulty setting.Dad with a job and a family(I actually love), I have a 2-6 hours a week.   Give me a refund or a difficulty setting..."
Negative,"Game looks gorgeous, but those invisible walls are fucking annoying. I hope the devs can at least add a minimap to show the boundaries of the stages and avoid trying to go checking all the damn invisible walls which in some cases doesn't even make sense to be there.The game is basically a boss rush game with the environment just being there with the only purpose to tax the performance. This is the first game I see with so much work on the environment but with zero interaction with it, it's just there not letting players to explore it, not letting players to jump on rocks and discover things, not letting players to fall from cliffs. The environment is just there to bait players. Just a wasted effort poorly implemented in the gameplay. Performance even using all the Nvidia tricks (DLSS performance and Frame Generation) on a RTX 4090 is not guaranteed to have constant 60fps. Devs need to address this performance issue as well as the input latency.Games need to be focused on gameplay and ensure good performance to allow players to actually enjoy it. If you want to make a game that looks the best but runs like shit, better make a CGI movie."
Negative,Forced upscale is bad just want TAA not dumb FRS or whatever tf game looks really off even with all the settings turned up and i blame it all on the forced upscale FRS crap not happy playing the game a bit more i find that without ray trace on the lights just go out and places just look black and white if not in sun light sorry this is a no go for me the game play looks ok the intro was good but  i will have to refund if it ever gets proper lighting (with out RTX settings) and some real AA and no upscaleing i might re buy the game but i cant play what could be a really good game in black and white and FRS no hate on the game play just the PC settings if i had  PS5 or something im sure it would have been lot better for me
Negative,I started from looking forward and enjoying the game to now getting bored and giving up the game. The game is way too hard and it doesn’t have difficulty levels to choose. I’m 40+ with challenging works and family to take care of. I only have 30 to 40 minutes a day as my personal time at the end of the day. But I have not been able to proceed as I couldn’t beat up the Buddha with big head in chapter 1 and I used up all my personal time these few days. Please allows us to refund for those who played for 10 hours but still stucked at the first or second bosses. Otherwise please add the difficulty levels for gamers like me to choose to.
Negative,"So what developers are starting to do, Is starting to make the first 2 hours of the game. As slow and drawn out as possible. Steams 2 hour refund policy has literally created this.... Stigma in gaming. That if you dont like something in two hours you can return it. Well, The way this game is designed. They made the first dozen or so bosses nice and easy enough to breeze through. But. Every single boss after the 2-3 hour mark turns into a Malenia level of fight. You do not design a game around Elden Rings hardest fight by a mile. And these ""developers"" did that. I knew this was going to be bad in 2017 when I seen the original gameplay test released to the public. I gave it the benefit of the doubt. And was 100% Mistaken. I should not of given this the benefit of the doubt. Just for giggles I loaded up elden ring and beat tree senti in 3 attempts naked. But I cant for the life of me after an hour of attempts kill a boss in a game designed by a studio the size my family gathering? Theres a reason you dont see ANYONE talk about this game. It was a One DAY wonder. It really really sucks I cant get my 93 bucks back."
Negative,Boring between boss fights that are dissatisfying.
Negative,"Ok so, you may like this type of gameplay but it aint for me. Its boss after boss after boss, you are fighting a boss around 5 min after the last boss"
Negative,"This game is a Souls like game, except that the bosses are extremely poor designed. Some of them are even broken. If you feel like playing a boss 50 plus times to beat it, you'll like this game. You're not even trying to beat the boss though - you're trying to beat the poor design choices by the developers. Trying to game the system. You have to work around poor move sets and poor developer choices. It's honestly not worth the time."
Negative,"Yay! It has got to be an amazing game, everyone loves it!  Nope... first it is meh.... then it is a true chore to play.The game not what I wanted out of it. I played for only 4 hours and it came to the point where I just was not entertained.  Maybe if it was modded to fix the controls and basic mechanics it would be playable to me.  In its current state, so much of the game makes no sense design-wise and seems just overly hyped when it is missing the core functionality that makes difficult action games fun to play.  Score: 3/10.  So here is why I refunded it:   Game is pretty    No forced organ harvesting     No Uighur concentration camps     No depiction of Falun Gong oppression and detention     No direct ads for the CCP    4 hours into the game and it was mainly just kill really weak mobs, find boss, kill boss, talk to random npc about things I don't understand or care about, advance to next area that barely looks any different, and repeat the process.    Voice acting was off  the English dubs don't use a consistent accent (some are American, some British) and the dialogue just sounds weak.  I tried the Chinese audio, but it was not enjoyable. Tonal languages are not pleasant to me.   No way to block or parry attacks.  It seems like an obvious feature you'd reasonably expect to see, but instead you have an ability on a cooldown that turns you into stone for a second.  Dumb.  Much of the fun of Sekiro was parrying attacks.   Dodging is the only way to avoid attacks but its pretty unresponsive.  There were many times I got chain attacked from like 80% health to dead just because my character would not respond to any inputs.  I was completely locked out of doing anything even though the character did not appear to be in any active animation.  Incredibly frustrating.   Normal mobs are too easy and just stand around waiting for you to casually walk up to them and one-hit them.     Exploration is boring.  In actual soul-like games, there are traps and tricks in the environment that make exploration so much more enjoyable and risky.  This game has none of that.   There are random boss-like enemies found in some areas that deal absurd amounts of damage more than the actual bosses.  I would understand that if this game was an actual soul-like and had multiple different ways of winning, but you only have one style here, wack the enemy with stick, dodge, repeat.   The early bosses are pretty easy, until I reached this water snake-man boss.  I couldn't understand why he suddenly was so much harder than the other bosses.  It really made it seem like my dodge animations were just super slow to activate.  I'd press dodge, and an eternity later the darn monkey would move his butt... or not and get hit.  And no I did not and do not want to look up walkthroughs and guides because I wanted to play the game as is, not have someone else play it for me.   Crafting items is not available in the start of the game, yet my character's inventory is full of components?  What the hell...  You could craft right away in Elden Ring.   Only part of an attack swing actually does damage even though both ends of your staff will collide with the target.  This makes it look like you are doing some crazy cool moves, but...deal no damage.   A dedicated button for drinking from the gourd?  Why?  What a waste of an input and stupid design decision.     The controller button mapping is weird and many times pressed the wrong button because I am so used to other games with more sensible button mappings.   A dedicated sprint button?  No no no... its supposed to be hold the dodge button.   Randomly turned into a golden cicada only to find that there are no stealth mechanics in the game and that most of the mobs can be completely ignored?  Huh?   No map and everything looks the same... it took me a while to get my bearings."
Negative,"Honestly, when it comes to video games Im really not picky. Im usually the kind of person who will love a video game and then later on find out it got less-than-great reviews and i was just too easily pleased and too much of a layman to notice all the flaws.. but with this game im left utterly baffled by the wealth of stellar reviews and enormous praise.. Like im really, genuinely confused. I bought this game knowing little-to-nothing about it because, well, surely a game receiving this sort of praise must be worth checking out. ill never make that mistake again. Sure, the graphics are good (i guess) but everything else about it is... Boring. Its shallow and repetitive and just: linear segment with invisible walls everywhere, then a boss, and then linear segment with invisible walls, and then another boss, and it just rinses and repeats this basic a** formula and calls it a video game worth $59.99. The combat looks kinda cool at times but its just... off somehow, and instead of feeling natural and intuitive it just feels like sandpaper. Im a HUGE fan of Fromsoftware titles. Saying this is a souls-like game is probably one of the most offensive things you could ever say about the souls games"
Negative,"Unsure what the hype about the graphics are, game looks incredibly average with oversharpening applied."
Negative,this game has an identity crisis
Negative,Its mid - dont buy it
Negative,"This game is extremely overrated. It's a glorified boss rush with fancy graphics and THE most unresponsive combat I have ever experienced. Every single attack/dodge feels like it comes 2 seconds after you click and no matter how many times I spam dodge on certain bosses, nothing happens."
Negative,"hello. my name Rubla.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                        THE  ROCK BOSSi love wukong nibba myth but there is this one boss who keep eating my bum, its a really long runback and the boss is very unnecessarly tanky. so it make me very mad and it take 30min to walk back. so i vote for the removal of this boss.Rubla xoxo"
Negative,"For a father who doesn't have time to grind in the games anymore, this is really bad.I want to enjoy the game and not to spend 4hours to defeat one boss.Really disappointed with this game and honestly would ask for my money back if possible.And yes I know it is skill issue, but I want to enjoy the game not to be mad because I cant get pass certain boss."
Negative,"The game is EXTREMELY hard! There is no difficulty settings to change! Ive rage quit about 30 times cause it is literally impossible to beat these bosses. Theres also no gps, no map to tell you where to go. Game dwvs please add difficulty settings a map and a gps to tell ne where tf to go cause this is ridiculous! Its turned me off the game i was ao excited to play"
Negative,"Game is crap, Nothing but Boss after Boss after Boss after Boss, nothing in between besides grinding opportunities on maybe 3-4 small mobs. if all you want to do is chain boss fights with no exploration options this is the game for you"
Negative,"Having just about beat this, I can finally say I would not reccomend this irritating unfinished game!It is SO close to being a masterpiece, the design is flawless the graphics stunning, and when the combat works, it feels amazing! Sadly this game is let down on so many levels... Without going into the tedious chapter design and at times totally boring zones. This game is mostly let down by infuriating boss mechanics and poor button mapping and button delays. I cannot explain how many fights i've lost because a command didn't register on my controller, shameful hit boxes in enemies favor, lock on being cancelled because of some cheap enemy off screen vanish. I cant explain how many times I've CLEARLY seen an attack land and not register. This whole game is built around spamming one attack and hoping for a heavy which are almost impossible to land because enemies literally don't stop... I will beat this game to prove a point and I hate leaving things unfinished but the ride has been more stress than fun in my opinion. Shame as they nearly had a masterpiece here."
Negative,Floaty controlsCombat feels like there is no weight behind your attacksBoring/repetitive game play Just running back the same attacks on copy paste enemies Beautiful graphics had some load time issues but very visually appealing Good enough story to keep you occupiedThe game play took away from everything feels like DMC or NieR but slower nothing new was brought to the table  Overall very underwhelming
Negative,"if you have bought, please refund it in 2 hours, thank you"
Negative,"This game too hard for casual player like me, I just want to enjoy the world and watch graphics, it is too hard"
Negative,Map guild is very bad. Game can not change difficult.
Negative,DOH SHIT GAME NOT FUN DONT BUY THIS DOG SHIUT GAME
Negative,just play elden ring
Negative,Game is nice but the bosses Very hard!
Negative,"Worst designed bosses i've ever see. you always do so little damage to boss's no matter how levelled up you are, meanwhile every boss can two shot you. its not balanced at all. this game makes dark souls/sekiro/bloodborne a walk in the park. even some of the regular enemies do stupid amounts of damage to you. its bs"
Negative,"Game is fun but the lighting is so unbelievably bad I can't give a positive reviewI've tried every combination of RT on/off, global illumination, etc. Lots of complaints about this if you google ""Black Myth Wukong Too Bright/Dark"" basically the light sources are way too strong so in bright scenes you are blinded and the shadows are close to pitch blackAnd no I am not on an AMD GPU with the known issue on older drivers"
Negative,"Although a beautiful game, and the gameplay is fun. I cannot recommend this game for their use of Denuvo. I will never again buy a game that uses Denuvo. Even with a high end system, this game suffers from stuttering and poorly optimized performance. It has been shown and proven, games that implement Denuvo run about 10% or more worse than before/without it's addition. Until that shittastic DRM bs is removed, I cannot in good faith recommend this game, sadly."
Negative,"I feel like an insane person seeing this game with an overwhelmingly positive rating, this easily the most disappointed I've been with a game this year."
Negative,game runs like trash even on the lowest settings
Negative,This game's combat system and boss mechanic are so bad
Negative,"Refunded as the terrible camera implementation gave me motion sickness, not something I've experienced anywhere other than in specific VR games.The graphics and monster models are good, but nothing else about was even slightly inspiring. The writing felt like a badly subtitled kung fu movie, but not in a so-bad-it's-good way. The combat felt flat and uninspired. I imagine some will find something to like in it, but nothing about it made me interested enough to play past the intro areas."
Negative,"Pros:1. This game has some great mechanics concepts (resolute counterflow, tactical retreat, etc), and when they click it's incredibly satisfying.2. Respeccing your skills and stats is free and unlimited. Wish more games did this.3. Graphics are amazing, despite generative BS.Cons:1. The mechanics usually do not click, at all. There are very specific frames where you are allowed to dodge/parry, and if those don't happen to align with the attack the enemy suddenly started, then welp too bad. And I still have no clue how staggering or heavy attack tracking work in this game. It's just all over the place.2. The vast majority of skills/stats don't seem to have a noticeable impact on the game.3. Unless you are already intimately familiar with Journey to the West, you will have absolutely no clue who the heck these characters are what their role in the story is. From start to finish.There were some good moments but overall it was not worth the time and money."
Negative,a really cool and fun game in concept but runs really bad no matter what setting you have or change. lags and freezes every five second and crashes consistently. almost impossible to play and have seen a lot of other people with the same issue.
Negative,"Horrible Game. Impressive Visuals and that's about it.The Level-Design is horrible, the Combat is inconsistent (especially the input-buffer is sometimes just fucked), there are way too many cutscenes and lots of useless, lets call them ""scripted (attack-)moves"", that unnecessarily disrupt the flow of the game (especially within Bossfights).None of the Bosses (of which there are a stupidly gigantic amount of in the game) are very difficult, but they are all super annoying, tedious, frustrating or all 3 of those things.The game is just not fun at all.Dont't buy it, especially not at this price."
Negative,"This game is a massive open world without a map or compass.You just don’t know where to go and you will leave all the pickable items and quests. I bought this game after reading people say that is “better than Elden ring” , this is a joke.I don’t feel is fun to play this game and I regret the money I spent on it."
Negative,"I really tried to like this game.   The combat is clunky, generic, boring, and lacks variety.  Almost all of the bosses share the same move sets and have massive health bars.  Meanwhile your attacks do a miniscule amount of damage.  Every fight is just extremely unfun and tedious.  Just because you enjoy Souls-Likes does not mean you will enjoy this game.  In my opinion you should watch videos of the combat before buying because it's really lame sauce."
Negative,"Not a good game. Don't understand what the hype is. There is zero story line. Don't compare it to God of War. Being Asian I thought I would really like this game, but it just doesn't do it for me."
Negative,best game i've played in a minute
Negative,Unplayable rn for me. Will wait for better optimization. Can barely play this on low setting. While elden ring runs good for me on max settings.
Negative,boring game with a shit combat system and boring enemies and bosses
Negative,"Worst game in Video game history, The Marsh of White Mist Boss shouldn't have a 2nd phase that's just completely stupid. This game will never get game of the year. Lies of P is better than this trash. Don't recommend to anyone"
Negative,"Not enjoying really. Graphics are very good on a top PC but not great on lower specs. Feels like a boss fighting simulator with not much between each fight, still waiting for the game to open up. No consistency in the dodge mechanic or the combat in general which can make the boss wins feel a bit like luck rather than getting better at the game."
Negative,"After having the entire game trough I can not with clear conscience recommend this game to anybody except those psychopaths who enjoy games like dark souls.The Chinese hopped up on opium in the 16th century didnt make this character seem that op as he seems in his second phase boss fight at the end. Technically 4th phase. Its still a good and fun game but I can not and will not recommend anybody spend their hard earned money on a product that will make their limited free time a more stressful experience than work itself.You WILL start balding ,even if you are as young as 15."
Negative,"I loved the starting point being absolutely peak, but one thing that turned this to a major downer was the gameplay feels far too inspired to play like its dark souls or Elden ring. Too much hype for a game that will end up becoming like elden ring (Play it once then never again). Those who loved putting 15 gameplays into elden ring, go for it. If you wanted combat to feel smoother and easier/relaxing, don't get it"
Negative,"clunky control, bad camera, weird targeting"
Negative,This games difficulty makes no sense. It is so frustrating. we do have a life other than constantly grinding away at the screen all day .....
Negative,"Overrated game. Shitty combat's repetitive as hell. Boring story, and wack ass script, it's like a hollywood marvel kid made the script/lines. 1/10."
Negative,you just move through straight lines and fight bosses every 10 minutes. There's almost no variety in how you fight. The graphics are all it has going for it. All style and no substance
Negative,smoke and mirrors
Negative,"so much fucking annoying things about this game i dont know even when to start.repetetive combat, lack of enemis, areas fucking confusing you can go in circles for hours, giant skill tree for no reason, not much variety in move list.basically feels like Aliexpress version of god of war and fromsoft game with unoptimized unreal engine 5 that kills high-end pc's"

Negative,soo many hidden items and no clues that you need to find them. most of the great bosses are hidden and if u miss these items you can't even fight them // the more hidden content that i miss due to lack of information makes me like the game less and less.
Negative,"Pros:- Decent enemy and boss design- Jaw-dropping graphics and environments (only sometimes for the latter)- Abilities and transformations are fun to use- Animations are great- Authenticity to the source material is spot on- Cutscenes are kino af- Fairly satisfying character progressionCons:- The worst performance in a game I have ever played (yes I have played modded ARK survival before, this game is worse for it, even on a 4060)- Silent protagonist. I wanted the goofy voice at the start to be my monkey's voice for the whole thing. What a tease- Player light attack combo is way too short for the long and frequent attack windows. Way too repetitive- Every boss gets fought the exact same way- Next to no worthwhile build diversity- The worst level design I've seen in a game- 130GB (need I say more?)- £50 (need I say more?)- Ruined my sleep schedule with nightly gooning sessions to the goth spider lady's r34On a serious note. Unless a game is full on GOTY material or offers hundreds of hours of replayability, or a truly iconic story that you just have to experience, then I can't recommend anything for this price with this big of an file size. The game is just too spectacularly mid. Money doesn't grow on trees, and its even harder to come by in this economy. On top of that, as you get to midgame, the fights get boring and the level design becomes terrible, especially since there's no maps or markers. This game will probably get game of the year for a reason I cannot at all understand, it wont get my vote, none of this years games probably will (maybe S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2)Is it a good game? Sure.Is it optimised? Not at all.Is it worth the price? Not even half the price, I've seen 10 times better for half the price.Cons outweigh the pros, only buy this game if its ever 80% off. Certainly a waste of my money."
Negative,I called this game mid in a discord call and the CCP missile striked my dog
Negative,DO NOT buy this game if you dont have patience boss fights around every corner EXTREMELY HARD game very repetitive game play
Negative,the controls feel slow and a lot of the skills are kinda pointless
Negative,The game is too difficult to level up your powers.

Negative,"Souls-like game with too many flaws.Maybe the technical issue will be fixed, but for now the skill issue does not motivate me to reach the ending."
Negative,For a game that people have been hyping up like crazy and for so long... WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT.Combat - CLUNKYGraphics - Great but seem undercooked in many waysCamera - Are you kidding me? GARBAGE CAMERA which is weird because this type of thing shouldn't be an issue in games these days.Story - WonderfulIdk - I can't get over the fact that the player character can execute these super quick flurries of light attacks but then heavy's take a year to wind up and throw out. Idk... Overall not for me.Refund requested and uninstalled. I'm honestly surprised I didn't like it.
Negative,"On release absolutely bugged game where you freeze, audio stops working at random moments, you fall out of bounds, all textures look like they were chewed up on max graphics. If you want a soulslike experience, just buy nioh instead, for it is actually a decent game. This one's made by chinese people only to be bought in china for its og legend."
Negative,"So this plays as an action rpg till you get to the bosses then it becomes a souls like to the point and 2x to 3x faster then all the mobs you fight to that point. it's just stupid. Im to the final boss of the first area and all along the way there is lots of bosses with abilities to either one hit you if you dont perfectly dodge or chain stun lock you to death. The final boss of the first area ill use for example he has a rush attack that does over 100 dmg a hit during this time you have to not only dodge him but fire and he can not be harmed. He has a few other attacks that do 150-200 dmg If you get health up iem and max out the max health perk you only have 420 health.  otherwise the base is 300 health. im in the best armor and such avaiable while i enjoy the story so far and the fighting outside of boss fights. I would have never bought this game personally but got it free with my new computer i got during prime day. Btw these is a giant stone baby like boss as one of the first side bosses roaming alike who has an attack that if you hit does 250 dmg and he also does a chain move which stun locks you for 125 dmg each hit and he hits you 4 times so your dead. Outside of the dum boss mechanics ive found the story to be really good and the characters interesting ive met so far. The enviroment is beautiful and fighting regular mobs and everything is enjoyable with gathering. This game does serously need a map or minimap at least but thats not an option, and some difficulty options for the bosses. Its rather hard to find your way arround and i get turned arround a lot which has led to me finding a few more resources but overall its more time wasting.I also noticed performance wise i ran the benchmark and let the game auto set its settings and at times just randomly ill be running arround may not even be fighting and while on ultra settings with an fps of average of 80 will suddenly drop to 20-40 fps and has happened during boss fights too. i tried lowering the settings and it still happens checking my resource manager on my computer its not on my end at all the game just lags badly randomly the only way i have found to fix it is to FULLY back out and exit the game then reload back in. The game hasnt crashed thankfully which is a big plus. But i have also rolled into walls a few times here and there.So to conclude: This is an action rpg game that turns dark souls like only for boss fights. It has some bugs that need to be fixed and some performance issues and im running a very powerful gaming laptop. It's beautiful and the story has been interesting so far but like most games its not worth the price tag i would say its worth 20-30 bucks but thats it ad wait for a few updates before playing it if they bother to fix. Sadly a lot of developers dont and this one makes me leery cause this is thier second game and thier interview about the game to me came across that they only care about money not the game."
Negative,Frustrating game to play-atleast Elden Ring was open world with a lot of build options. This one is linear and very punishing. look beyond the hype and avoid.
Negative,Great game up until hundred eyed daoist. Terrible boss design.
Negative,dog shit tbh
Negative,"it looks gorgeous, but very narrow corridor, no story segments and repetitive combat with bosses I know nothing about prevents me from recommending it"
Negative,"It feels like a poor man's Sekiro.Controls were not as sharp as Sekiro.It has great graphical fidelity. It looks absolutely gorgeous.I would say its on par difficulty wise with Nioh 1. But, it feels weak on controls.I may just be getting too old to play these fast action games, that require multiple split second precision timing controls. But, I would also like to point out that I noticed button press delays on actions, attacks, and dodges."
Negative,"Monkey game is good. Monkey makes me happy, but monkey can't fix it's own poorly optimized game. I had fun for like 7 hours before having to spend 3 trying to get the game to be slightly playable. 7900XTX and a 7700X with 64 gigs of DDR5 playing on a SSD."
Negative,"I'm going to preface this by saying BMW is hands down the Game of the Year. It's a complete and coherent product in a way very few games have achieved this year or even this decade. It manages to write a sequel to Journey to the West while reworking the original that possible rivals or even surpasses the original story and the classic TV series. However, as a GAME, I cannot recommend it to most people unless you know what you are getting yourself into.If you like Souls-like game, this MAY be for you. But I'm going to break down why you may not enjoy BMW. The TLDR is that it's a very ""defensive"" Souls-like that is missing some ""modern features"".1. There is no move cancel. Meaning once you commit to an attack move, you are committed. You can dodge out of it. So you have to be VERY selective when you attack and how many times you press the attack button. Combined with the loooooong attack animations, you're ask to get hit if you do long combos on bosses that do not have breaks in their combos. This is the biggest thing that turns me off.2. There is no dodge buffer. One modern game design feature is a dodge buffer. What is it? It's when a game allows your dodge to go through even if you are very slightly late on the dodge. This is the difference between a game letting you know that you messed up versus you calling it BS. And you will constantly be calling BS, because you saw the tell from a mile away and you pressed dodge, but the attack still hits because you were slightly late. You can mitigate this somewhat by favouring pre-dodging than always going for perfect dodges. Which you should, as a perfect dodge does not offer much reward.3. Inconsistent attack timing/dodge window. The attack animations in this game versus their dodge window is inconsistent. There are attacks where the hit registers once you see it visually, and there are some that are ""late"", meaning the hit only registers much later after the attack animation. So you're constantly relearning the dodge timing of each and every attack. Combined with 2., it makes a very frustrating experience even within Souls-like.4. You can be stun locked. There are many attacks in the game with rapid combos, but you can't dodge out of the stagger from the attacks. Meaning if you get hit, you're eating the ENTIRE combo's damage. Combined with the previous points, it makes it even worse.This game has VERY high production values, and everything about it is 10/10. But I would give the combat 5/10. The story, writing, and production are the ONLY things that kept me from refunding this game and the rewards are worth the punishment. But stay away if you're someone only interested in games for the gameplay."
Negative,"DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT PAY for the deluxe edition that includes different armor as your first upgrade comes after the 2nd or 3rd save point therefore wasting your hard earned money.... Such a fucking scam!Other aspects I HATE. Healing is often unresponsive and will get you killed often.No difficulty settings.Save points that are too spread out instead of being able to save whenever I need to.Cut scenes cannot be skipped. If I wanted to watch a fucking movie, I would. I just want to play a goddamn game! Literally cannot stop the scene if I had to unless I exit the fucking program completely. ESC doesn't do shit!Only pro. Beautiful graphics. Max settings and I'm pulling 180~FPS and it's wonderful. No other game I've played comes anywhere near the visuals this gives you. 7800x3d and Asrock Taichi 7900xtx if you're wondering."
Negative,"I need more invisible wall!!! It might seem like nitpicking and minor flaw, but it completely ruins my immersion and makes me uninterested in exploring to the point that I cant play this mobile bs! Maybe, one day, when im bored beyond measure, ill get over it and give it one more try, but so far I lost all interest."
Negative,"Game is meh, you are punished for dying yet no instructions on how to do anything in the game. By giving you nothing you can easily feel overwhelmed and that makes the game not fun. Wouldn't recommend.Plus no one has any idea wtf is going on in the game"
Negative,"The game is horribly optimized and is full of bloat, developers need to stop being so lazy!"
Negative,"Black Myth: Wukong presents itself as a visually stunning epic, but for me, it felt like gilded repetition. It looks great—until it doesn’t—and the gameplay loop quickly wore thin. There’s definitely an audience for this, but I’ll revisit it only when it's discounted and, ideally, optimized. As it stands, it feels less like a thrilling myth and more like a chore list with expensive lighting.Gameplay: A Beautiful Hamster WheelFrom what I played, the gameplay boiled down to predictable patterns: follow the path, fight some uninspired enemies, and reach a boss who at least tries to make things interesting. Lather, rinse, repeat. It reminded me of an old-school Nintendo game—only with a thousand extra pixels and double the frustration. You’re given no real reason for why everything must die, just the sense that existence itself is an offense. See monster. Kill monster. Move on. If you’re into strict patterns and linear progression, you’ll feel right at home. I was hoping for more creativity, but instead, it’s monkey see, monkey slay.Graphics: When Pretty Becomes PainfulThere’s no denying the visual ambition, but ambition alone doesn’t cut it. Running this game with an RTX 3080 felt like trying to run a marathon in dress shoes. Even on the lowest settings, it was plagued with artifacts and tearing, which made the whole experience disorienting. A shame, really—what I could see was beautiful, but I was too distracted by the glitches to appreciate it. It’s the kind of beauty that demands perfection, and when perfection falters, it crumbles quickly.Sound & Voice: A Mixed Bag of StaticThe voice work? Well, it’s there. Some performances were fine, but the protagonist’s voice wore on me faster than I expected—imagine a celestial being with the soul of a whiny intern. I get that it’s supposed to add character, but instead, it added an itch I couldn’t quite scratch. It wasn’t unplayable, but it certainly didn’t help keep me invested.Final ThoughtsI can see why some people love Black Myth: Wukong, but it’s not for me. It’s like a museum exhibit you can’t wait to leave—impressive on the surface, but exhausting when you stay too long. If it hits the $20 mark and gets some performance fixes, I might give it another try. Until then, I’ll leave the Monkey King to his existential crisis and hope he finds peace—preferably without me."
Negative,онени амига сделай такие обосанные препятсвтия
Negative,"Meh. I dont get the hype, This game realy isn't that amazing. Granted ive only just started and gotten through a few bosses. Ill definitely change this if i feel different. Only good things are: graphics, boss fights and the theme (how it connects to the cultural side).MOVEMENT: traversal feels ok, but nothing to write home on. Very basic and hardly any ""monky-like"" Movement, which i think they massively missed out on. (Should have taken a page from any Prince of Persia game)FIGHTING: disapointed in the fight styles, though i suspect my opinion might change later in the game once i unlock more, though so far pretty meh. boss fights are pretty difficult, though some are extremely easy, with your special powers. For atack combos, i expected a bit more out of to make it skill bassed, but you end up just waiting out most of your enemy attacks for an opening.SKILLS: some skills are ok. But could do with better explaination/translation, because they could mean many things.ENEMIES: bosses are sufficiently difficult, but non-boss enemies were a huge letdown. Many are pushovers, but they dont get staggered after your first hit, so you need to wait to attack again, and i guess they dont always do alot of damage. This would be ok if there was a better quantity of enemies. I feel like the start they are so scattered and too few, i might just be comparing it to other Souls likes but, in other games, getting to the boss room felt more like an accomplishment in its own right, where in this it feels too easy. Some of the larger enemies are basically bosses too.CONCLUSION: rather get Nioh 2. More difficult, more weapons, more enemies, more variation. Games this could learn from: Nioh (enemy diversity, weapon diversity, fighting styles, difficultygetting through an area), Prince of Persia worrior within (traversal, fight styles),  mortal shell (achievement of getting though an area), Eldenring (open world), lords of the fallen 2014 (weapons, enemy diversity)"
Negative,It's Elden Ring for anime weirdos except way more basic.
Negative,"Unfun difficulty, too linear"
Negative,"Overrated game. DarkSouls-like game with a taste of God of War, and i hate games that look like Dark Souls... You do 1 or 2 mistakes, you die, you have to start over and you spawn miles away from the boss and all the mobs respawn as well.... Definitely not GOTY. That's a disgrace to goated games like God of War and GTA5... You can say it's a mid game.Graphics: 9/10Story: 10/10Performance: 3/10Guidance: 5/10Gameplay: 7/10-Overall: 6.8/10It has many performance issues it drove me crazy while playing this game. It lagged a lot during fights. I could dodge perfectly and still die on boss mech because of stuttering and delays...It lagged A LOOOOOOOOOT during cutscenes... My pc was literally freezing there, and there was desync on dialogues and pictures which made it look even worse... I couldn't even enjoy the story...it lagged a lot while changing locations.First time, i had to set everything ""Medium to High"" on graphics for a game on my pc, and this game still had some serious performance issues that was insane... If you are not a streamer or a content creator that invested a lot on your pc, definitely not worth spending that much for this game.Yes, it has great game content, and nice story mode with decent gameplay but the game performance is very poorly designed and sometimes you just do infinite circles on the map, because there is literally no guidance from the game itself and you can easily get lost... like a maze...I would suggest to buy it when there is a discount on this game or if you can get it free would be even better.If you don't like games like Dark Souls, don't buy it. Also, if you don't have a very strong pc with great specs, don't buy it... It consumes a lot of ram and gpu.Specs:Windows 11 Pro 64-bitAMD Ryzen 9 3900X4095MB NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (MSI)16,0GB Single-Channel DDR4 @ 1064MHz"
Negative,"Just to counter balance all the reviews that makes this game sound like the new grail of action games: the game has all the elements to be great, but it's a 6/10 for me.- Combat is very repetitive. You will see the same combo from the beginning to the end.- Stances (the main mechanic to change your combo) barely add anything, with the basic one being disproportionately superior.Chapter 3 has some of the most awful enemy and level design. I stopped the game at that point as there was no longer any fun playing. And I am extremely easy to please when it comes to action games.A large number of enemies at that point are long range fighters... in a game where you don't really have any long range attack/movement (except some abilities that you can only use a limited number of times). It's just downright frustrating to play against, and not even satisfying once you beat them.Really sad this was not the game I had hoped it would be."
Negative,I SHOULD HAVE REFUNDED IT WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE
Negative,No reason to be so hard. Unenjoyable. Games should be fun
Negative,"Game keeps freezing, literally unplayable even with overspec PC. 0/10 getting a refund"
Negative,Why the fuck did I buy this game but not playing
Negative,Final boss drains all the fun out of the game.
Negative,"Performance is trash, upscaling looks like crap. Game is a 5/10. The most over rated and over hyped game ever released. Only reason it works is because there is not another dark souls game to play at the moment."
Negative,"When the game is working it is fun but I can barley play the game now as my monitor keeps blacking out, my gpu is disabled, and I have to re-enable and reinstall the GPU driver . As the game is progressing I have noticed more screen tearing around the character and along the edges of the screen.I am also no longer eligible for a refund be it that I've passed the two hour game play mark. however I would bet I have around 1.5 hours of game play about about 3-4 hours of troubleshooting this problem. I hope the game developers or AMD have some tips on how to fix this."
Negative,"Black Myth: Wukong is a visually stunning game, but beyond its polished exterior, it struggles with frustrating design choices, especially when it comes to boss fights and overall gameplay.First off, the bosses are a complete disaster. Nearly every one of them relies on spammy, overpowered AoE (Area of Effect) abilities that feel more like cheap shots than challenging mechanics. It doesn't matter how skilled you are; if you're within range, you're getting hit. The lack of counterplay is frustrating, and it often feels like the game punishes players unfairly, especially with abilities that stun you endlessly. This leaves you helpless for long stretches of time, completely ruining any sense of rhythm in the combat.The worst offender is one particular boss that actually shrinks your stamina bar to its bare minimum. This makes dodging, attacking, and defending almost impossible. It's not a clever challenge—it's just unfair and makes the encounter feel more like a slog than an achievement when you finally manage to scrape by.The story is another letdown. It’s shallow and nonsensical, with little to no coherence. The characters feel underdeveloped, and the plot seems thrown together, lacking any emotional depth or motivation. At times, it’s hard to even understand what’s happening or why you should care. There's nothing that keeps you engaged or invested in the world, making the experience feel hollow."
Negative,"Gameplay 1/10, Just watch the game on youtube. The mechanics of the combat is shallow, and many QoL and advancement of the action combat system is not followed, and it plays like its a game from the early 2000s, similar to Fable. Even DarkSouls 1 plays better."
Negative,"Actually the most poorly optimized game I have ever played, my specs are exactly what the devs recommend (i7 9700 and rtx 2060) yet this game takes around 10 minutes to load then another 5 minutes of constant screen freezing whenever I go into a slightly different part of the map, just to be forced to play at 30 fps all of this while playing on the lowest settings possible. Out of the 7 hours I have logged into the game I have only actually been able to play for about 4 of them just so you get an idea of how bad it is.I find the gameplay to be really enjoyable but I simply cannot leave a positive review after being forced to look at a black screen for hours."
Negative,"As someone hoping for a more soulsy kinda game, it's not. Performance wasn't either."
Negative,bland and boring not to mention crashes constantly. wanted to like it but cant.
Negative,"Erlang makes no sense, it's not fun or skill-based, is just bad game design."
Negative,"I absolutely hate souls like games.  I heard this wasnt really a souls like so I gave it a shot.  The graphics are excellent.  The story is extremely well told, and engaging.  The gameplay on the other hand is exactly like dark souls.  The attacks are very difficult to dodge, and it doesnt take many hits to die.  The restore health mechanic is so slow, that you often die before it even takes effect.  The skills are pretty cool.  You get a stun that is extremely effective and fun to mix into combat.  There are also several transforms to use to change combat up a lot.  Even with these things, I just didnt find the combat engaging.  They also put an optional boss right in the main path about 20 minutes into the game.  The guy is nearly impossible at that early stage of the game.  There is no reason anyone would think they could just skip him, but you can.  I wanted to like the game, and I played through acts 1 and 2, but it just doesnt get much better (for me).  Like all other souls likes they combat is clunky and movement is haphazard.  The attacks are at least quick, but trying to avoid arrows, when running out of stamina is annoying.  The staff spin mechanic that blocks arrows is super annoying to use, as you move like a snail during it, and have no control over where you go.  I wouldnt recommend this to anyone who doesnt like souls games.  If you do however this game is for you.  I play most games I on hard, or above, so I am familiar with difficult games, so it isnt really a difficulty thing.  I personally prefer a more responsive dodge mechanic like Gotham Knights, Horizon, or maybe the Darksiders series.  Also stamina is a stupid mechanic in all games imo."
Negative,Three things I hate about this game.1 - No Map2 - No Difficulty Setting3 - Bull$hit Bosses (Boss Phases)But the game is beautiful.
Negative,LAG IS CRAZY
Negative,"Honestly, I just got really sick of it after Chapter 3. You'll know when you fight the most frustrating boss you've ever seen (frustrating, not difficult), because it has floaty, buggy hit boxes and your tickle stick needs 100 hits to kill it. Absolute nightmare, which again, isn't even hard to kill, just awful to interact with and fight.Then the game isn't happy about it and sends you to the worst level I've ever experienced in a video game. You need to run through this area because it sucks (it's suddenly a bad platformer) and the area boss is... a sponge with insane AoE attacks. It's not even hard, you can dodge its attacks easy - it's just frustrating with bad camera work, bad hitboxes, bad everything - and it takes FOREVER to kill.I gave up. It's not worth it, I wish I could get my money back."
Negative,This game is not for me. It keeps trying to kill boss. There is not much story or fun.
Negative,"After 14 hours of taking my time, at the completion of the third chapter, i've come to the realisation that I don't have the desire to see this game through to the end. When this game shines, it really shines, but unfortunately some questionable, persistent game design choices/flaws mar the entire experience."
Negative,Never even saw the main menu because the game has a known issue for throwing VRAM errors and crashing while it still compiles shaders.   I'm glad to see thats ignored in reviews though.
Negative,I kept losing to the camera and invisible walls. It hurts my brain to play.
Negative,It was cool in the beginning it was great but the story lost me I was everywhere I got lost with there Simi open world and its extremely hard no choices for difficultly lost me in total add new game plus with choice with difficulty and ill play
Negative,This game is good but has serious game play issues. I can't even count on two hands how many times I have been mid rolled. Bosses will go from doing a chunk of damage on a hit and next time u take it it does all damage even at full health. it seems like they where worried about it being to easy and messed up the damage of some bosses
Negative,"Its a no go for me. I have played it for 8hours. in the 8th hour I wanted to destroy my computer with axe and use flamethrower. The game is 3/10 for me. Its a SOULS game  and it should have this lable on it. I dont like souls games where you need to kill the boss to advance in the game and if you want to kill the boss you need to kill 100x enemies in small level???? This is incredibly annoying and stupid. Boss fights are nervous unbalanced.  3 points this game has for graphics and storytelling, gameplay sucks!!! My 60 EUROS are gone, I cant refund it because I played it 8hours but I had permanently deleted this game from my account. I DONT WANT NEVER SEE THIS GAME AGAIN,"
Negative,"Not worth the $60 in my opinion. I've got a lot of time clocked in to all souls and souls-like and I understand this is not one of those games but it doesn't do adventure well, does not do combat well and pretty much any category of game is does not do well. adventuring is limited, no open areas, just different alley ways for you to go down and never really learn the area. combat is light attack and that's it. People will argue it has heavy attacks in there, but bosses are designed to dodge them or prevent charging so it's never really reliable. No metrics or UI elements to help you understand how your skill points are actually helping, just says moderately or slightly increases attribute. Bosses are by far the worth thing of the game. ""git gud, git gud"". For me on all my souls experiences getting good was enjoyable. I could get different weapons, I could spec entirely differently, I could learn attack patterns, etc. This game is not fun to get good at. No I-frames for dodging, getting hit likely leads to more getting hit, the attacks of (a lot) of bosses are just ridiculous, the amount of screen breaking moves are crazy, and they are so damn tanky. Each run takes about 10 minutes, so if you get stuck on a boss you'll be there an hour. For what they do well. Cut scenes, character design, graphics, frequency of incense holders. That's about it, but those things are flawless, but for a game genre I typically find incredibly enjoyable I have been frustrated more time in the 19 hours of this game then the collection 100 hrs I have in Elden Ring. In all fairness I don't understand why this is getting such good reviews and without understanding their perspective I feel I can't truly rate the game, but for now I'd give it a 3/10."
Negative,"Edit:I posted the review at 38.4 hours, not at 11 hours. I dont know why steam chose to lie like that.This is 100% a Souls-like game. It is a GREAT game, with a few considerable shortfalls. First, it is as much an action game as Elden Ring. Moving faster does NOT make the game an action game. It is, at best, a real-time  strategy combat game where you should be prepared to die a LOT. Resting resets all enemies outside of bosses, and bosses are the only enemies really worth fighting. The game is NOT artificially difficult, unlike most modern games. The bosses are creative and distinct, there are upgrades and technically branching story paths.Every boss fight requires planning and several deaths. You will have to completely fill out your characters skills sheet several times, as where one boss may be easy to beat with pillar stance the next boss may be particularly effective against it, requiring you to reset all your points and rebuilding your skill tree to a style better suited to that boss. Regardless of how you may play yourself. Oh, and lastly, your attacks cant be cancelled to dodge. Many bosses will wait for you to be attacking before starting a devastating combo, at which point you are stun-locked and can easily be killed in one hit this way. There are ways to get around this, supposedly, but it requires you to understand poor localization and translation issues or otherwise look up a guide to get a better understanding of how these things work together. In short, GREAT game. DONT buy it if you have issues with anything ive stated above."
Negative,"Horrible game. Extremely laggy and crashed all the time. When i tried to return it, they said i couldn't because i had ""played for more than 2 hours"". It took that long to get through the intro due to how many times it crashed. Don't waste your money!"
Negative,this game needs a whole hitbox rework i will not touch this game tiull they fix it im fighing yaoguai king yellowbrow i did a combo finish with an arial slam he swings left to right as im IN THE AIR ABOVE HIS ATTACK he still hits me this game has so many bugs until theres a fix i recommend waiting to buy unless you want to ruin your whole mood getting killed to cheep bugs when fighting bosses
Negative,I give this game 5 stars up until you get to the last boss in the desert map then i give it 1 star that boss is nearly impossible to kill I ran thru 3 ps4 controllers throwing them against the wall due to the complete bullshit you go thru fighting this boss his moves he pulls this random moved out his ass that you dont see from the last 20 playthrus and then when you hit the dodge button the monkey just stands there with his dick in his hands and takes the blow a game shouldnt be this hard i play for entertainment not to sweat
Negative,"Not my thing. Weird timing, hit boxes, and hyper armor. Makes some basic enemies more frustrating that the actual bosses.Just my opinion."
Negative,Fix the chapter 4 final boss hitbox u damn monkeys.
Negative,NOT A BAD GAME BUT VERY OVERHYPED
Negative,Some bosses don't take hits and are undogable for the majority of their movesets
Negative,Please put in easy difficulty setting. I would like to continue but get stuck at white marsh boss for days. Not everyone are good gamers.
Negative,bosses are difficult to kill
Negative,"Clunky combat, no poise, heavy attack charge-up as long as a day of fasting and hits that have no impact whatsoever behind them."
Negative,"Imagine if a souls game was boiled down to one boring type of combat. Graphics and cinematics are nice, but the game is so damn boring to play it hurts. Just buy Elden Ring."
Negative,"missing the ""masterpiece"" tag. performance wise, it runs like ass, lots of stuttering with recommended spec. If you have a powerful rig, do pick this up. Once in a decade type of game.Has denuvo."
Negative,"Beautiful game, but these boss fights are awful. More work went into the theatrics than the actual game play."
Negative,No custom controller binds is pitiful in 2024. An option that should be there by default. So important that I consider a game unfinished without it.
Negative,"1.Constant grinding on memorizing every single move of every opponent in order to be able to dodge their attacks. Coming from someone who truly enjoyed ""Returnal"" like me, that says a lot.. It doesn't seem to use an accurate collision system like Returnal, but rather checks whether you dodged inside a specific time window or not. A failed RPG Tekken that serves only as an anger management tool...2.Characters are soulless with no depth.3.The exploration is laughable at the beginning, and becomes a little better as you move on.4.The graphics are over-rated. “Control” and “Alan Wake II” were much more impressive than this (I’m a 4090 owner). Textures and polygon count are mid-level at best.I tried to refund it in the beginning, but failed.Now I play it just because of the 60 euros I paid for this crap.. 100% burnt money……."
Negative,"I don't like the game, no map, no guidance, keep dying with no help. No fun here"
Negative,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY FIRST MISSION AFTER INTRO IS STUPID HARD FOR NO DAMN REASON
Negative,"Combat is fun, bosses look incredible, and the the little stories at the end of the chapters are cool. While the world looks gorgeous it's also lifeless and boring. Content is sparse and anything outside of the boss fights and cutscenes feels pointless. Interesting progression systems, but honestly it's a bit wasted on a game like this."
Negative,"I dislike the fighting system. Pales in comparison with God of War, Souls etc. The monkey apparently can't climb, can't block and half the world is just invisible walls.The game is beautiful to look at, but the story is so poorly made that I am still unsure why I am going places. Not sure I can find energy to convince myself to finish it"
Negative,Absolutely over hyped game that literally only has visuals going for it... more games will have this soon enough with UE5.Janky camera that causes nausea and frustration.Linear in map design that's easy to get lost in and accompanied with NO in-game map.Combat is apparently fun??? Button mash and dodge with zero remap of controls.Clearly the 2.5mil players with overwhelmingly high praises for the game are simpletons located in mainland China.Gameplay is generic with abit of spit and polish...
Negative,"Wukong the geriatric monkey who had osmium bones and lead instead of blood.why the fuck the monkey is so heavy.is not a gampley or lore choice... is just bad desing you get lock into the animations, thats why it feels so fucking ""hard"", and thats the game choice to be... fun-ish as getting into a cinematic each time you die"
Negative,"I dont think the game deserve that much love, sure its good, although objectively speaking there are a lot of buts1. the game mostly runs solid 60FPS for me on high setting, but at some point in some area, the fps could randomly go stutter for half a minute (especially fighting the boss in chapter 2), it went even to < 10 fps once, on lowest setting for 10 - 20 seconds and my screen looked really bad, with all the pixelated graphics.2. So far it has crashed for me twice, for no absolute reason, restarted my pc once.3. The terrain, the whole map is basically just a random generated terrain, it confuses you to navigate the area, given there is no map.4. The game gives a really weird sense of being very slow, im not sure whats happening, its mostly 60FPS, but it doesnt look like 60FPS, its weirdly kind of in slower motion, and also giving a sense of delayed input.5. i dont know why the game keeps getting back to XBOX controller layout, so everytime i go into the game, i have to change the controller layout back to PS layout.The cinematic fight is pretty good i'll give you that, but otherwise, its just mediocre at best, wrapped by the UE level of graphics and alloohh maybe the story, its goodThey should continue optimizing the game to remove those random stutters, then maybe i will change the recommendationdefinitely nothing really special, but what makes the game sells really good, and played by a lot of people, is the fact the the game is played by many chinese, and given their populationit makes fkn sense.also im pretty sure there are a lot of bias reviews."
Negative,"to many frame rate issues, keeps freezing, literally have fallen through the map twice for no reason. the sound is not synced properly so nothing works right."
Negative,I just want to enjoy the fucking Game. The beauty of the LORE not a fucking sweat and trying to remember each of the boss attack pattern. Literally stupid the way this game is designed.
Negative,NOT WORTH when u have to deal with one boss for 3 hrs and u are already tired of ur fk life
Negative,It's too hard might as well buy Elding Ring because this isn't even a good story mode game it's just a game fighting hard bosses that take up to 3 hours or more this is a terribly horrible game
Negative,Worst fucking game i've ever played in my entire fucking life
Negative,"Gameplay is passable, crashing on loading screen consistently when heading to and after beating chapter 1s bonus bell boss. Wait a year or two then grab on sale and hope it actually works as intended then."
Negative,"This game may not be suitable for casual players. If you have significant commitments outside of gaming, this title may not be the best fit, as it can require constant grinding or retrying to overcome challenging boss encounters that may hinder overall enjoyment. Additionally, there appears to be an issue with the auto-targeting feature, where disabling the relevant setting has no effect.In time, future updates may address these concerns. However, as the game currently stands, it may not be the most accessible option for individuals with demanding work, family, or other responsibilities."
Negative,"I don't care about how many (9 million users) are playing this game it SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RELEASED UNTIL IT PLAYS SEAMLESSLY ON ALL SYSTEMS PERIOD! Frame rate issues up the Wazzoo! stuttering and terrible lag time all the while running a 3080 RTX and Rizen 9-12 core processor. INEXCUSABLE! People please stop settling for these types of releases because you are so desperate for anything that resembles quality in a game title! You should not have to buy a damn 4090 GPU to play ANY GAME (optimally) PERIOD! For anyone that has not purchased this game WAIT for at lease another six or seven months for more software updates to me installed it's poor optimization period! Also there is something weird about the image quality even with DLSS turned on it looks overly sharp and even with a RTX 3080 I still can't add ray tracing! because it effects the frame rate! look to be honest this is a God of War clone structured around a mythical monkey.After playing GOD of WAR series this just can't compare and the only reason I bring this up is that people have been comparing this game to the God of War franchise ""sorry can't compare especially in story line category  I'm not saying this is not a decent game it is that it just shouldn't have been released yet in the  state that it is in."
Negative,awful gameplay that feels clunky and unresponsive awful story that feels like siting in a coffin and letting worms eat your brainawful level design that will constantly make you feel like you are supposed to explore but is just linearawful overly complex progression systemDO NOT BUY DO NOT PLAY
Negative,this game has me on the verge of suicide on pc. it looks terrible compared to console. please unrelease and refund everyone and release when you actually have the game ready for pc 3/100 if im being honest.
Negative,Imagine you getting a 2000 dollar gpu to scrape 60fps on 1080p ultra lmao
Negative,"Stuttering and performance issues. (and horrible voice acting) Good game altogether though, I'll change it to positive once they fix the issues. The optimization needs to be a lot better."
Negative,They kept calling me a monkey :(
Negative,really bad performance on steam deck
Negative,"The whole game is full of bugs and issues, poor control design over the character. No maps, keep walking like in a maze, the road is poorly designed and you don't know where to go. Not recommended at this stage."
Negative,"I'm about halfway through the game and I'm pretty sure I have a good handle on what this game has to offer. In short, the game looks great and runs pretty well on my machine on high graphics settings, but everything else feels shallow and poorly designed.This game might as well be a boss rush. The levels don't offer much more than pretty scenery on the way to the next boss fight. There are of course enemies on the way but it feels like the devs just peppered them throughout the levels without much thought. Most of them get staggered so easily that they can't fight back, and the ones that don't only have one or two combos with little variation. These kinds of simple enemies might work if the devs designed interesting encounters with different combinations of enemies, but most of the time you're fighting one enemy at a time. On occasion there will be one enemy in your face while another one shoots an arrow at you every few seconds. It just ends up feeling like rote filler with no real sense of danger. All of that might be forgiven if the bosses were fun and memorable, but sadly that's not the case. Most bosses are total pushovers that I one-shot, including the wolf and dragon bosses featured in the gameplay reveal. I even decided to not upgrade my healing flask and forgo all spells except the first to artificially increase the difficulty. Some of the bosses are also have extremely glaring design flaws. For example, some of the larger bosses focus their attacks near the part that serves as the lock-on point. If you unlock your camera to attack a different point, which is common practice against some bosses in other games, the boss doesn't really have any attacks that can reach you and you can just wale away on them. Another boss in chapter 2 goes into long 10+ second ground attack combos that you can completely avoid by just jumping one one of the several rocks in his arena. Thankfully there are some exceptions that I found challenging enough and fun, including the tiger boss also featured in the gameplay reveal.The combat I found frustrating at first since a lot of the weapon skills are based around ""varied combos"" where you mix in a heavy attack into your combo to parry an enemy attack. Your light attacks have long animations that can't be cancelled and the heavy attack parry has to follow a light attack. If you get lucky, your light attack finishes right as the enemy starts to attack allowing you to begin the heavy attack parry. But most of the time you don't get lucky and you need to wait a bit after your light attack finishes to time the parry correctly. But if the enemy takes too long to attack and too much time has passed since your last light attack finished, the heavy attack button will instead put you into the normal heavy attack animation and you get pummeled and lose your built-up focus points. After I gave up on using varied combos and just stuck to dodges, light combos, and a basic heavy attack to dump focus points combat felt a lot more fluid, but also less interesting.The gear system is really poorly designed. At certain points in the game you unlock new armor sets and weapon upgrades. Each armor set and weapon has unique bonuses that compliment certain playstyles. This all seems fine and reminiscent of God of War's gear system right? The catch is that each new unlock comes with higher base stats and you can't upgrade older gear to bring them up to the level of newer gear. The unique bonuses pale in comparison to higher attack/defense stats and so you end up picking the highest damage weapon and armor from the highest unlocked tier.Story-wise, the game starts off with an effective opener -- A big spectacular showdown between Wukong and the big bad Erlang that gives both characters personality and leaves you wanting to learn about the context of what you're seeing and what happens next. Unfortunately all of that gets thrown out as soon as chapter one starts. You wake up in a new location with no context, fight until you find the chapter's boss, and then defeat him for his shiny relic or whatever, then repeat for the next chapter. How did you get there? Why does everyone want to fight you? What are these relics and why do you want them? Who knows -- the game doesn't tell you anything. At least it hasn't yet for over half the game. Each chapter also throws a bunch of new characters at you with absolutely no context. I get the feeling that the devs expect you to know who these characters are and heavily lean on that as a crutch to avoid having to properly write them into the story. Maybe this works for a Chinese audience that is familiar with Journey to the West, but for anyone else it feels bewildering, with new characters coming into deliver a of dialogue and then never showing up again."
Negative,"Played for a bit over 100min, just below refund window. No complaints on the game design, but significant complaints over it's optimization. Ryzen 2600, RX580, 16gb RAM, my rig matches minimal requirements, and I set the graphics settings under the recommendations. Firstly, Immediately in the prologue, which includes a lot of particles due to being set in the clouds and generally reflecting like an endgame experience, the fps tanked to around 30. After prologue, when things calmed down I thought I was out of the woods and performance has been generally stable... Until the 2nd main boss, who uses flaming weapon. Those flames once again, put the fps in the gutter. Seeing as this is only the beginning of the game, I expect the amount of special effects to only increase as the game progresses, and having fps halved because an enemy with elemental particles on weapon appeared on screen doesn't sound fun to me. Special effects are on low as is, it can't get lower on my end. This part needs optimizing.Secondly: fog, water, vegetation - all small moving particles experience major artifacting on any setting. It's a familiar issue from Darktide, and it's something that did get fixed by developers over time. It's not an issue of low graphic settings, it's an issue of bad optimization for AMD gpu.Thirdly, mouse camera controls are laggy. Similar to how original version of DS1 for PC was, and DS2 is to this day. It honestly somehow makes me dizzy. I don't get dizzy from games usually, but this one is rather uncomfortable.Finally, it's the damn Denuvo. No respect for developer who doesn't treat paying customers on lower-end PCs with the same respect. Whatever pennies you gain in profit from would be pirates by overpaying for this shit DRM is not worth the performance loss the honest customer suffers for it. No good game failed because of piracy, this one wouldn't either.With all those issues combined my hype for whatever great gameplay and story is hidden beyond first impressions is kinda deflated. I have a deep backlog to play until developers figure out these issues, and I hope to see a better version of this game added to GOG some time down the line, DRM-less. Then I'd gladly re-purchase."
Negative,"A bit mediocre, looks better then it plays.Gets boring pretty fast to be honest. Not much to explore, basic enemies are pretty weak, lots of bosses but it gets boring after a while. Alot of down time on bosses to, where you just gotta spam dodge while you wait before you can finally attack.Way to overhyped imo"
Negative,fuck this make a fucking difficulty setting i have been stuck on that fuckin bitch white snake for 3 hours bro fuck this. the game is fucking dope but this boss sucks ass bro fuck that i swear if they dont fix it do not buy the game
Negative,"Nah (so far). Slow inputs I've played, on a modern game HS it's really bad in the sixth chapter"
Negative,Trash game. Wanna be elden ring
Negative,"this could be a mobile game it's so simple-there's no story or guideline of what you're doing, just standard superhero you're the chosen one-there's literally 2 buttons you use, attack and dodge-game runs like garbage, infested with TAA and supersampling blurfest crap-random crashes-being outside the line of fire doesn't really matter, just the stupid be in dodge animation at the right moment-assets are duped after a while-all you do in this game is literally walk from boss to bossyou could remove the wukong branding and insert any generic character+theme over this game and it would be the same thing. there is nothing unique or interesting herei wish i could refund but i'm over the 2 hour limit"
Negative,Triple A game - GraphicsB game - mechanics
Negative,Nice to look at but you can get lost in 30 minutes of what to do or were to go .Or who to fight.
Negative,Not for me and i enjoy Dark Souls
Negative,"Solid 7/10 game, the art is decent but the game play is shit. There isn't much to do other than boss fight. Unlike other souls-like. The build system almost doesn't exist, skill-tree almost doesn't exist. Basically everyone fight bosses the exact same way, which gets you bored very quickly.===40 hours in, it's 8/10, some level design is quite good. The battle is still very bad."
Negative,"""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a visual masterpiece, but that's where the praise ends. The combat is clunky and unresponsive, with frustrating glitches and poor camera angles that ruin the experience. The story is shallow and lacks any emotional depth. The game is riddled with technical issues, from frame rate drops to crashes, making it feel rushed and unfinished. Overall, it’s a disappointing experience that fails to live up to the hype, overhyped by chinese."
Negative,"Before I begin, I should state that I was looking forward to this game and pretty hyped for it, and even though I would not recommend this game, I don't think that it is a bad game overall. I have several hours in at this point and I will be playing it to the end and trying to get all the achievements. However, I am disappointed with the game as of now.This game is absolutely beautiful, truly a next gen game, however that can also be a hindrance at times. At times it gets hard to figure out where you need to go because the lighting and shadows can obfuscate the path. Add in all the invisible walls and sometimes it may seem like you should be able to get to certain places, or that the game wants you to go in a certain direction, but that area is just inaccessible. The invisible walls are not a big issue most of the time, the only time they have annoyed me so far has been in boss arenas when they trap you in without a visual indicator that you cant leave, and especially in the black loong fight. He does a shockwave like move that I'm sure you can jump/dodge out of the way from, but it seemed like the game wanted you to jump on the rocks around the arena to avoid it. The problem is that sloped areas that look like safe spots were just walled off.The combat is very repetitive. At my current level I seem to be doing the same light attack combo over and over and over again. There are a few spells and transformations that break that up, but the core of the combat for me so far has been light combos and dodging. The skill tree is pretty large and seems like it would take several playthroughs to unlock everything, so maybe the combat opens up later on and I just haven't gotten to it yet.This game is far from a bad game, but it was not the game I was hoping for. In most cases, my complaints are little more than minor gripes, but for me they added up. I would not recommend this game to someone, however, I could see why someone would. This is a little side note, I was hoping for a full exploration of Journey to the West, and I could be wrong, but I feel like the game strays very far from the original story. The opening of the game seems to be the ending of of part 1 of journey to the west, but then it goes in a different direction. Maybe I'm missing something but I was a bit disappointed in that, won't get into too many details here to avoid spoilers."
Negative,"The only thing I will remember about this game is being 80% of the time in animation lock and input not registering.Yo Game Science, if I press B, the f-ing monkey MUST dodge, ok? Whatever is happening in the meantime. The world might explode, Trump could win, Putin could invade italy, But IF I PRESS LB, monke heals. I don't care about input queue, just skip all those bs animations. Thanks."
Negative,"Instantly refunded due to developer inablility to know what the customer wants and or needs.  Yet another game that you cant rebind ALL KEYBOARD KEYS because they dont know, care or are just goddman lazy butts."
Negative,Souls game with extra chromosome ...
Negative,overrated ahh game.
Negative,"Crash after first battle, bad graphic"
Negative,"Frustrating multiple phase boss fights with cutscenes, sooo many bugs and performance issues months after release. Stopped after chapter 4. Did not enjoy this game at all."
Negative,"Run around, defeat WAY too easy enemies. Find a boss. Die. Rinse, repeat."
Negative,This game is really fun for the first two chapters before the enemies begin to feel cheap and ceaselessly annoying just to fabricate some difficulty. $60 for a game that's only good for ~10 hours is not worth it
Negative,"Not recommended, this game depicts the Monkey King as an asshole who killed his lover three times for fame and fortune, and he betrayed his friends. And we totally play as a toolman, so if that's the kind of Monkey King we're trying to awaken, I think we might as well let him die. Many Chinese people told me he was a hero, which he clearly wasn't. There are also a ton of plot contrivances and holes in the plot."
Negative,"I remember first watching the first teaser for Black Myth: Wu Kong all those years ago and was immediately onboard. A high production value single player game coming from China based on Journey to the West? China's talent pool is so underutilized they were finally going to make an actual game? Sign me up (Genshin Impact released some time later but gacha games aren't real)! Then once the gameplay trailer rolled out I was convinced this was going to be the game of the year for all years. Absolutely unparalleled visuals, action-oriented soulslike combat, awesome presentation of a buddhist setting, it was in the bag.And yes, when the game came out it delivered. I'd be hard pressed to name a better looking game, the intro Erlang (Wei WuXian!??) with the four heavenly gods fight was epic, Wukong's quips immediately reminiscent of his voice from the 80s TV drama (I played with the Chinese voiceover). I was ready for a special one-of-a-kind gaming experience.Turns out you're not playing the actual Sun Wukong, but a silent protagonist monkey that looks just like him. Which is fine, but whatever. Also prior to the game's release, everyone including the developers themselves were saying Black Myth; Wukong wasn't a soulslike. Totally fine by me, I know how much China loves DMC, I wouldn't be opposed to that at all! Well, what do ya know, this game is 100% a soulslike. Do not believe anyone who says this isn't a soulslike. Dodge roll being 95% of your defensive options? Only two attacks (light + heavy)? Checkpoints you interact with to heal, change spells, fast travel? Annoying runbacks to bosses for no reason? NPCs you have to interact with multiple times to exhaust dialogue to proceed with their quests? Gratuitous chest opening animations? I could go on, but good thing I love soulslikes!So for the first two chapters of this game, I was pretty onboard. The gameplay itself was a little underwhelming (only one weapon with a crappy moveset) initially, but the skill tree was opening up some fun stuff like new moves, parries, and spells so I could work with it. The zones for all their beauty of the setpieces, a little samey with winding paths littered with a couple of the same 3ish inconsequential enemies. Again, fine, the meat of the game to my understanding was the frequent boss fights which were quite fun and of decent difficulty (single digit deaths, couple one-bangs). The end boss of chapter 2 was a sign of things to come. While not difficult, his command grab, tornado summons, and sudden switch to a keepaway zoner in the last phase where you're just chasing him were some bs man. I feel like the developers made the command grabs hard to avoid because they made the animations awesome and wanted to show everyone. I figured that'd be an anomaly and moved onto chapter 3.Chapter 3 man. That's where the tedium begins. All of a sudden, the game makes a heel turn. You have to scale a winding pagoda up and up and up. The enemies become much harder to deal with. Placement begins to become sadistic with ranged enemies shooting you while crossing a balance beam, enemies divebombing you from around the corner to knock you off, winding caverns and rooms start looking the same, a mechanic that lowers your max health and puts a dark filter on your game (it's like the brain of mensis that doesn't kill you but you can't avoid it), enemies start to swarm you with beefy elites (for a staff that can extend and retract, it is garbage at fighting multiple enemies), there's almost always one last enemy encounter before a checkpoint as a final ""fuck you!"".I'm a player that almost always full clears an area in soulslikes. I take every path, search every nook and cranny for secrets and items, and kill all the enemies. After getting frenzied (don't even think that mechanic has a name) and knocked down a cliff by a divebombing fat demon guy, it was over. I was checked out. The level was just going on and on, and felt like I was trapped in the worst Dark Souls 2 locations. The craziest part is that feeling persisted past ascending the pagoda and into chapter 4 (it's like going through DS2's black gulch but.. forever... for the whole fucking chapter). I was just gonna blitz through the levels without a thought to sidequests, items, or anything. To add insult to injury, chapters 3 and 4 were by far the longest chapters making the majority of the game being the worst areas. It was just not fun at all.Soulslikes live and die by locations imo. If everything works but the game has bad levels it's over. They're simply not fun anymore. It's almost a waste considering the rest of the game especially the set pieces are so gorgeous and inspired. The buddhist imagery in the monster designs and architecture, the decapitated sanxian player's songs, the ending animations that play after each chapter (these are absolutely gorgeous, and Zhu Bajie's video was almost worth chapter 4). It's such a shame everything else in this game is amazing except for what makes a game a game: the gameplay.The enemy placements just get more annoying, bosses get more tankier with fewer windows, seemingly every other major boss has a last phase where they just run away and spam long range attacks, culminating in the final boss (I can't muster the energy to unlock Erlang) being a slow death by a hundred cuts as I dodge roll long attack chains and retaliate with a light attack or two (the same ones I've been using all game) until I get enough focus to cash out with a heavy and probably trade hits. I get the game wants you to vary your playstyle with three different stances and the whole focus mechanic to cash out with heavy attacks but the stances are barely stances, they just have different heavy attacks. None change the light attacks so you're spamming that all day (light attack 4 is so cheeks), pillar stance is completely useless (it doesn't even avoid slams the one use case you would think it's for), and smash + thrust kind of serve the same purpose (heavy attack in the middle of light attack to iframe something). I was thinking stances would completely modify your moveset and playstyle. Imagine monkey man with actual stances that change the fundamentals like Trick/Sword/Royal Guard. I ended up playing mostly with thrust since some bosses had wonky hitboxes where smash would miss (and they keep running so thrust it is). The mythological Sun WuKong has 72 transformations/forms each with different abilities he can utilize, but here our silent monkey can only equip one at a time and due to long meter build are typically only used once or twice a fight. I wouldn't even say the later encounters are hard exactly, but again, they are tedious. The final boss took me 12 tries but I wanted to die by the 3rd attempt because that fucker has a grab where he dings you and chugs your gourd. That animation I s2g is 15 seconds and he can do it multiple times in a fight. Just kill me dude.Playing Black Myth: Wukong is like going to a fine dining place and leaving fully disappointed. The presentation was great, the service amazing, but the taste was no better than the fast casual place down the street from your house. Expectations were sky high, so the disappointment is equally matched."
Negative,collision box > hitbox which makes boss fights disastrous.
Negative,Wish I researched more. Not as advertised. Little to no real RPG elements. Boss after Boss with nonsense in between. Looks great - Plays great. 0 Depth.. Not for me.
Negative,Game keep on crashing unable to play
Negative,lowkey hella mad when i wrote my other review game is lit besides dodging and healing can get really bugged at times. Also some bosses mad hard literally had to download mods to beat yellow wind sage I tried to beat  him for 3 hours didnt get him half.
Negative,"The game is filled with invisible walls. You are rewarded for exploring, but exploring this game world is literally just looking for invisible walls. Even the bosses turn into invisible walls when they do certain moves, like some lazy way of making them immune."
Negative,"Is hilarious. if i pay 70 for a game it better let me play on mouse an keyboard however tf i want. Never touched a controller in my life, not even for fifa. The F is this that i cant key bind my controls...lmao. 30 min in and already worth 1* for me. If you dont plan to make it work on M&K just keep it for console"
Negative,"It may work for other but I sat in my sweaty chair room hot as hell and my kid screaming at me. The game kept giving me an error about how my graphics card kept running out of space or something on that line, atleast I got 60$ back in my pocket to spend of a new fan for my hot room."
Negative,I'll preface with saying I have a brand new Alienware Aurora R16 w/ a 4090 in it. It is a fun game but the constant lagging is so annoying. It takes minimum 5-10 mins to load into my save. And then if I want to travel to another area/location I have to wait another 5 mins for the game to load in again. The audio lags and will be behind the lagging cinematic. I can also clip into some rocks and not see my character sometimes. And there are so many invisible walls for areas that look like you can clearly explore them. It really discourages you from wanting to explore for secrets. And usually you can't fall off anything in the game except for one area where you can fall off of everything around you. Also just interacting w/ items or shrines is buggy and I'll have to spin around in a circle like a dog going to bed before I can interact w/ it.
Negative,"I am beyond pissed. Newer big games always have issues but this is stupid. I have troubleshooted EVERYTHING, and the game continues to run like trash and crashes after the prologue. The game has been out for a week with no fix. I have yet to play the game passed the prologue and have tried MODS, Running as admin, PC updates, graphics card updates, you name it. Done it all and this game is still unplayable. Its an embarrassment that this game is this popular with this many issues already. Not only is there audio delay, but the graphics are terrible on the (High) setting, and its choppy. Not to even begin on the crashing issues.  I have a $1300 High-end PC capable of running every single game I have ever downloaded, but this is stupid. I have since requested a refund and will not be purchasing this game again, regardless if the issues are fixed or not. Just shows a lack of game testing before release and care to even drop an update to fix these issues after selling 5 MILLION COPIES."
Negative,I dont recommend this game. I want to play it in the few short moments I have free time on my computer but the game wont let me start it without updating. Now I waited to download a 1GB patsh on my slow internet and it now started patching 70 GB. So when it ends I can go to bed and sleep. It was much easier and faster when I wanted to play a game when I was younger.
Negative,Didn't like the game. Unfinished product without any storyline.
Negative,"I mean, it looks ok. kinda jank tho"
Negative,Too hard for players who are not good at games like Dark Souls. Don't recommend.
Negative,Decent game. 7/10. Combat could be way better.
Negative,"I really love the game, everything is done with high quality and effort but the game crashes all the time. It went from 1 crash an hour to 30min and now I can't even play the game in chapter 4 because the game crashes after 30 secounds. I advise you to wait for it to get fixed, Don't buy it right now and your experience will be much better."
Negative,"Disappointed game.I had constant staggers, game crashes, screen tearing through out  most of my game play, which was insanely annoying.The game has beautiful views, great soundtrack, but with all those performance issues along with poorly designed levels, controller config, I would say it's just a game blow average."
Negative,"It's cool at first I guess, but it's very repetitive. You fight 4 super easy regular guys, then a mini boss, then 4 easy guys, mini boss, etc etc. Extremely linear. Bosses are really boring and forgettable. The combat is really boring: smash light attack until the animation ends then heavy attack. It's pretty, but that's about it. The voice acting and whatever the story is is really forgettable. I left it running while at work and had my refund denied. Now it's just gonna rot in my library."
Negative,"The ""30 minutes"" of ""play time"" i have on my account is the cumulative total amount of time I have spent trying to get the DRM to verify it, only for it to keep crashing on launch due to said garbage DRM verification company not doing the one thing they are there for correctly. the audacity of a company selling a product through a verified and highly trusted retailer such as Steam to have an ""DRM/anticheat"" software built in that cant even properly verify said purchase done through said store is absurd. I paid for the product, i downloaded the product, and now I cant even use the product because of some arbitrary nonsense. Why is this allowed?What is even the point in buying it through a verified retailer if they can just gatekeep the products you paid for? making it impossible for a paying consumer to access what they pay for just so you can weed out the bad apples who aren't isn't the answer.Yet another half baked launch which has become the norm in this industry... unacceptable behavior towards a paying customer. I applied for a refund."
Negative,"For people my age and my skill, that absolutely hates the soullike kind of games - this is bull shlt. Only candy-eye graphics and no option to set the difficulty, nothing to do the whole game (i got to 5th boss and stopped becuase it`s crap). I do not understand the frenzy nowdays to play this kind of games that kills your mood and shit. Well, somehow it`s sad that they do not care about people like me. I would never recommend this game to any of my friends just becuase they are not enjoyable at all."
Negative,"THis stupid tiger... i cantI beat the tiget, but now theres this fkn annoying electric guy with 2 hammes AADKWAOP][KDAJIOF WHBJKAHIOP[WFGKAWF"
Negative,I'm so tired of soulslikes.
Negative,"what are you doing here? looking for some negative review??? nah, go to positive page, nothing to do here"
Negative,kinda mid ngl
Negative,this game is so cheesy egg
Negative,"Good Graphics for sure, but this is not a hard game. It is quite boring. It is a mobile game in need of a desktop graphics card. Buy it for 15 dont pay 40 like me."
Negative,44.9 hours in and I still can't get past the white clad noble
Negative,"I have no idea why this game is getting an Overwhelmingly Positive score,  seems like that score is somehow artificially elevated.  The combat is floaty,  no weight to it and I question the artificial depth of it.  It an ok game,  thats it. 7/10"
Negative,"i knew this would be hard but jesus fucking christ why is chapter 1 a boss rush that doesn't know how to pump the brakes?2/10 ""i know you want it hard but for fucks sake 9 bosses in the tutorial act is too many""graphics nice tho"
Negative,It starts out easy enough. Then the game starts using cheap tactics. i.e enemies that use 12 step combos leaving only enough room for you to get 1 hit at a time in before the enemy goes into the next 12 step combo. Enemies that use hit and run tactics that keep you at a distance. There is no way for you to close said distance quickly enough before the next combo begins. There is no way for current players to parry or consistently stagger a enemy. All the large enemies seem to not have hitboxes per body part. A lot of the big enemies seem to be missing hit boxes in places entirely. End game is devoid of any joy and is mostly unplayable because of the cheap tactics. There is a huge difficulty uptick per chapter. It starts out as cool monsters with challenging combos to yet another big monster with crazy hit box placment and unending combos that you pray you have enough stamina and coordination to perfect dodge. Sooner or later every battle boss or not becomes a chore. I don't know if this is intended or just glitchy but I would not buy this game as is.
Negative,"I Have been looking forward to this game since the first trailer 5 years ago, The game managed to stay pretty faithful to what has been shown in terms of graphics and gameplay but I honestly feel a bit disappointed with the content of the game I think there was a lot of opportunities to add more the world of the game. I really hate that the protagonist is a mute considering that what makes Wukong appealing is his charismatic behavior, I still think It's a solid game but I expected a lot more."
Negative,Rien n’est bon à part les graphismes
Negative,did not even load up
Negative,Way to difficult and monotone for a casual gamer. You have one basic combo. Wish I could get a refund. This was my first boss rush game so I guess I learned my lesson.
Negative,Too easy + luck-based achievements that require grinding + bad map design = boring
Negative,I don't understand why or how. Game keeps crashing. Luckily I was within refund time limit. I have a powerful PC and it still crashed on the lowest settings
Negative,The way this game handles difficulty and your damage you deal isn't like your typical souls-like. This game ends up feeling more like a chore on some fights due to the hit boxes from your weapon and the hit box of the bosses themselves are just awful. Story is great but gameplay wise I'd suggest Lies of P way before this game.
Negative,"The game takes a very long time to compile shaders which cuts into your two hours of refund eligibility. On top of that, this game is a souls like despite what the developers say. Don't let anyone fool you, this is nothing like a hack and slash it is just another souls like only the developers are trying to have you believe otherwise."
Negative,"Although Black Myth: Wukong's visuals are breathtaking, the gameplay is a little underwhelming. The combat mechanism in the game is unimaginative and feels like an infinite loop of boss bouts. There is little variation and repetition in the levels. The overall experience is quite boring, even with the amazing graphics,It's like a salami sandwich: okay, but there are better ones! :) I returned the game to steam, thx."
Negative,"1) The story is not engaging in the slightest. What's more, the only time I decided to check the codex was to learn what the hell those lantern creeps were about and the page about was just random fairytale... Naturally, I didn't look at the codex ever again after that.2) The exploration aspires to make the game seem like a ""journey"", but in actuality comes off as an obscene time waste devolving to poking around the same corners repeatedly to see the one passage you've missed. Even using guides on the Internet was not straightforward. The locations don't have any stand out features to navigate or anything interesting to see, really, apart from some high fidelity graphics. Nevertheless, the graphics are wasted on some of the worst level design I've ever seen.3) The game does not have difficulty setting, which means that the devs thought through the encounters and the battle system, right? Wrong, because the spells are so damn powerful, even while having handicaps in both mana and cooldowns, no boss in this game except the very last secret one can hope to live more than a couple uses, which completely ignore their attacks, by the way. In the end, the game is so piss easy while trying to look or work like a challenge, it devolves into a chore with the hope to see whether the devs can muster the courage to make an actual fight. And they did it just once.Overall this game was a massive disappointment, I upgraded my PC specifically to play this and was hopeful right up to the end, but the game never bothered to be good enough. I am very sorry if this is your game of the year, because it says more about the other games you've played than this one."
Negative,"There is no animation cancel despite the very fast combat of the game. Which makes perfect dodge and perfect parry extremely unreliable. Also grab moves in general are horribly designed, with little to no warning and often hitbox that's completely disjointed from animation.Too many problems with the combat, especially when down to the details. Looks good on the outside, but not very good deep down. 所有动作锁动画，攻击动画看完前啥都干不了，导致完美闪避和弹反非常的不靠谱。而且所有抓取攻击的设计都是依托答辩，前兆不清晰，hitbox和动画不相连。看的好看，不过各种战斗系统问题太多了。金玉其外，败絮其中。"
Negative,honestly dont buy
Negative,"It runs like bull crap on AMD cards, I would've loved to try it but there are too many games out there for me to have this level of unnecessary patience."
Negative,game is dogshii i would not recommmed buying this
Negative,This game clearly show that designers needs to somehow pass a competence test before being legally allowed in the games industry. The incompetence and complete lack of even the most basic design conceptes such as difficulty curves is baffling to say the least. Some bosses are just unfair on a disgusting and sadistic level. It's not hard. It's fundamentally broken. The game also has severe technical issue ranging from unresponsive input and severe performance issues even on the best hardware. This studio clearly took on a project for which the didn't have the competence to manage. Do yourself  a favor and save your money.
Negative,Go and get Nioh 2 or wait for it to go on sale instead.  Visually beautiful but so what if you can't reach it.  Can't stand the invisible walls. 3 different stances but light attack is all the same????
Negative,too hard :-(
Negative,Simply because yellow brow exists you shouldnt play this game
Negative,"Clunky combat, poor performance, and an overall boring and confusing plot line/story. Feels like a knock off souls game with combat animations that lock you in place and an even worse target lock."
Negative,It's way too difficult for no reason. I'm not looking to spend three hours on a boss baby upon installation.
Negative,"Worst game I ever spent money on, do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money."
Negative,"This is a very beautifulk game but to play it correctly and without any problems you need a very high end pc, a shame for the people that cannot afford those types, beside the point, a beautiful game"
Negative,Wont Run on my ChimeraOS due to the DRM: Recommend to wait till it gets removed (Wait Till No DRM)also seems to ok on steamdeck but frames are to low for it to be playable for me
Negative,The game stutters so bad its basically unplayable.I know its not my pc because i have a good one and have played many games like elden ring with amazing fps and no stutters. I know im also not the only one having problems with stuttering so either they need to fix it or dont even bother wasting money on this game.Edit: the game doesnt lag as hard any more but still lags when loading new areas and cutscenes. still wouldnt buy it if you dont have the cash to spare
Negative,"dont get me wrong game is alright, but the level design is horrible for chapter 3-4, and they are really long chapters. an easy fix would be to have minimap or even a map. but for whatever reason there isn't any. which is why i cannot recommend this game now."
Negative,"Mid at best.Typical Chinese story tropesGod awful audio syncingSpam X to fight, Dodge when enemy attacks at the speed of molasses Sometimes press Y.Absolutely overhyped.Wait for a sale.only positive is that 4 hours of gameplay is only tracked as 30 minutes, which allows for refunds.80% of reviews are by chinese players.Careful not to mention anything bad china did!!!"
Negative,"This game really does suck. It doesn't... look good? Despite all the hype surrounding its visuals. Not sure if it's an antialiasing problem or what. Frankly, I'd rather a game be stylised rather than aiming for photoreality, so this might be down to personal taste. But that hot take asides, everything else is super average to outright terrible - the game feel and dialogue of the first hour of the game suck. Even the tutorial/opening sequence, where presumably you have all of the powers the MC unlocks, felt bad asides from a cool dodge. If this hadn't been complementary with my graphics card, I would have waited to try it in a sale, and then likely refunded within the 2hr window."
Negative,fuck this game
Negative,Unpolished. Game is decent but definitely not deserving of an ''Overwhelmingly Positive''
Negative,This is god damn freaking souls like! Why did they lie to us?Don't buy this game if you aren't a fan of this genre.
Negative,black bear guai lags my game so badly i cannot play.
Negative,This game isnt it.
Negative,"Feels like cheap chinesse knockoff of some other good game. Overall bad game design. Weird controls. It does not feel good to run around, to do combat, to use items..  ONLY defense action is roll. (and bad one at that) No parry, no block, no riposte.No iframes, BUT ENEMIES HAVE THEM. Combat is tied to LONG DELAYED ANIMATIONS, DODGE WILL NOT CANCEL YOUR ATTACKS.Enemies have delayed attacks too, so you never really know when they will attack you, unless you die to them few times. Then you can kinda tell. Game heavily relies on your active skills (which have cooldowns ffs), not on your reflexes or intuition.Bad target lock, weird FOV, hitboxes sometimes wtf.Technical issues. Bad performance in relation what the game is trying to do. Stutters no matter your system with RT enabled. Game looks bad. No visual clarity. You cant see what is on your screen most of the time. Visual clutter everywhere, bad exposure. Looks more like a movie than a game, and in a very bad way.REGRETING BUYING THIS. I dont even know if I can finish this. Worse then any high profile souls game.Idk why its popular and sincerely hope these people will NEVER make any other game. Waste of money, bandwidth, disk drive space and most importantly your time. Worth less than 5$. 2.5/10"
Negative,Lacklustre control scheme
Negative,chapter 3 is the biggest piece of trash
Negative,Hit register problems when attacking and a shit ton more bugs when fighting a boss
Negative,Great graphics and having a lot of fun playing the game... when it works. I have a high end PC and this game freezes or crashes after playing for a few minutes. I've never had an issue running any other game. I can't recommend this game until this is fixed.
Negative,I couldn't even play the game because it keeps crashing just loading in.
Negative,no way to defend your self this is lame
Negative,"Dodging is super unreliable, hitting the light attack button followed up by a dodge only works about 60% of the time, when playing against a a decently strong boss you really notice how bad it is because you either tap the dodge button and your character does nothing causing you to get hit or you tap the dodge button twice to try count for the delay and your character ends up dodging twice throwing you off"
Negative,"Didn't realise a controller is recommended to play this game and the there is no option to use key arrows, I'm left handed and prefer using those, although I have set the movement to U, H, J, K. It's ridiculously difficult (maybe easier if you've got a controller?) and you can't play on an easier mode.  Is it just one boss after another?Is there a story? - hard to know as I can't beat the first big boss...... sigh"

Negative,"Catastrophically mid. Inferior to all of it's influences. Doesn't do anything heinously wrong, but doesn't exceed in any way. The thing that annoys me most is it's insistence on being ""not a soulslike"" despite the blatant implementation of numerous highly soulsy mechanics, thus making this game another one of the thousands that don't understand what made those mechanics good, or even work.Having commital, non cancelable attack animations is not compatible with fast, reactive combat, it has the opposite effect, it incentivises cowardice, and makes the snappy jerky animations feel clunky and unresponsive.The skill tree doesn't meaningfully expand on the combat, the stance system is underutilised, the transformations are glorified ""spells"". It's just boring. And so the price is unjustifiable.Elden Ring truly got me spoiled, and this doesn't scratch the DMC or ninja gaiden itch."
Negative,"Great game! Had real fun playing it.So why I won't recommend it?Because of Denuvo. Denuvo punishes people that purchase games proper way.It locks you out of playing on steamdeck. Meanwhile, crackers got game working in I believe were 18 hours after official release. That's just dumb...."
Negative,Not recommending this game purely for the anti-women these developers have been and their sheer hatred of anyone outside of China. Combat also has flaws (as of current). Front halves of bosses almost do not count half the time. (the bosses are 99% legs in this game anyways)Beautiful Graphics and story. But that's the only compliment I am giving this game.
Negative,"i cant even hear the people speaking in any of the cut scenes, the whole point of the game is to hear the story. I cant hear anything anyone says and there's no subtitles the game just mutes every cut scene and in places where u control the character but there's supposed to be a voice guiding you there's no voice there either maybe you can forward this info to the developers i would love to play this game the way it was meant to be played and i will re purchase when you guys fix"
Negative,Why the fuck do you have to kill people in a certain order to get something. Really just makes no sense. NOW if i want it i have to restart or beat the game without it and get it in new game plus. SO dumb.
Negative,The game visually looks amazing but I'm constantly getting frame drops and the optimization is very poor. Until they fix this I cant recommend this game.
Negative,Combat boring Low fpsNot worth it
Negative,too many boss fights
Negative,"Game stutters constantly, vertical bars during cutscenes, graphics look pixelated, grainy and blurry on High, lips don't sync with the voices. Refunded. Maybe in a few years I can afford to spend thousands of dollars to upgrade my PC to  be worthy of this game. Why can't games just have Sekiro Era graphics?"
Negative,"I 100% the game, but I still would not recommend it.Pros;- Looks good- Combat is responsive- Some fun bosses- Free respeccing to try everything- Interesting customization on the healing gourdsCons;- Loading assets during cut-scenes so choppy audio and video- Inconsistent difficulty- Some really tedious bosses, I don't want to watch you fly around the arena for 30 seconds and do nothing but dodge, wait until your 18 attacks combo is done and then throw 2 or 3 hits in before the cycle repeats- THE INVISIBLE WALLS- No meaningful decisions for character progression, everything feels samey / borderline useless- Boring crafting and equipment- Most modifiers are qualitative instead of quantitative. Ex; Slightly boosts attack after a perfect dodge. Moderately reduces damage from poison. Just tell me the exact numbers so I can judge if I want to wear / use it or not- NG+ is easier than the first playthrough- The story was told through poems and was super confusing to me. I get that we are collecting relics to revive Wukong, but why is everyone trying to stop us? Who are all those bosses? Why are we teleporting to new areas every chapter? *shrug*- Combat gets quite repetitive, but I guess that's to be expected with these types of games- I personally thought the music was either uninteresting or even annoying at times- The camera has no transparency; so if you stand in front of the tree, you'll see the tree, not the boss you're fighting- Some bosses will straight up be invincible with auto-lock because your monkey brain cannot target legs, just chests and heads...TLDR; Don't listen to all the fanboys, it's not GOTY. Look up some videos about the game and make your own decision to see if this one is for you. It's not bad, but it's definitely not even in my top 5 this year. There are just too many little annoyances that add up for me to call it a great game."
Negative,"So, let me spill the tea about Black Myth: Wukong. Everyone was hyped up about this game because of its killer graphics and cool tie-ins to Chinese mythology. But honestly, after playing it, I’m feeling pretty let down.First off, the visuals are straight-up fire, no doubt. But the gameplay? It's boring as hell. The combat's super basic, and before you know it, you’re just stuck in a loop of same-old, same-old fights. There are different enemies, sure, but taking them on quickly turns into a snooze fest.And the pacing? Ugh, don’t get me started. There are way too many long cutscenes that cut into the action. It’s like, can we just get to the good stuff? When you finally jump back into the game, the story feels all over the place – hard to keep up with anything.Oh, and the enemy AI? Total joke. Most of them have these predictable attack patterns, which makes battles way too easy and not fun at all. You should feel like you’re facing a challenge in an action RPG, but here, you can pretty much just spam your attacks and come out on top.Plus, there are some annoying tech issues – like frame rate drops and glitches that totally kill the vibe. For a game that’s all about looking amazing, these hiccups are super frustrating."
Negative,"Beautiful but terribly boring because its difficult and repetitive. Poor translation to English. I wanted to like this so much, but it leaves so little to grasp on to. If the story were better or understandable, I would get it, but right now I am just a monkey I can't relate to and and can't get past the first few bosses without tons of repetition to to build along the skill tree. I have a life to live and I don't want to spend it repeating boring levels just to advance. I am sure some people will like this for the reasons I hate it but I uninstalling this ASAP."
Negative,"I will start with that this is an absolutely beautiful game. However, there is no reason for it to be as difficult as it is. Some of us just want to be able to enjoy the game and we are not looking to have to perfectly execute every dodge and attack to complete the game. Many of the boss battles have been extremely frustrating. The developers decided not to put in a difficulty setting that allows us to easily progress and enjoy the beauty of the game. I  cannot recommend this game to any players that are looking for a game that they can play through and enjoy, this game requires extensive grinding and many frustrating hours."
Negative,"Level design 0\10Storytelling 0\10Gameplay 0\10China hypegenerating 10\10It's not possible to understand how to beat big sand rat when you just got clones but they are useless. Probably i got to him to early (thanks for level design, everytime trying to choose correct path). Second stage of boss was just completaly broken i used every potion every nerve cell, but i am pretty sure that it's because level design and i will get something super powerful to beat him without an issue. (all previous bosses and megabosses was 1-8 try) That's so great... and genious"
Negative,Way too hard. Not enjoyable at all. Needs a story mode ASAP.
Negative,"if you enjoy dying to a boss over and over, this game is for you. If you do not, then it is not for you."
Negative,"this game is seriously too difficult, developers pls upate a patch to nerf the bosses"
Negative,"Was really excited for this one, but sadly it sucks. There's no block or parry. Like, at all. Only dodging. This lack of core combat mechanics is a real deal breaker for me personally. Only dodging when engaging with enemies is boring as hell. I requested a refund. Thumbs down for me.Update: Decided to give it another try. Played several hours so far. I still think this game is bad. Its certainly NOT worth all the hype. The combat and movement is not tight or precise. The game looks like its gonna be like a more acrobatic Sekiro, but it doesn't play like that at all. It actually feels really clumsy. Also the enemy hit boxes are very inconsistent. This makes the game especially frustrating because you also have no block to rely on. Games like this need precise and responsive player movement, standard mechanics like block and parry, and consistent hit boxes. Unfortunately this game completely misses the mark on all these issues. There are no game changing skills or abilities that make it better, no loot or weapons either. Also, there's no map, so you just wander around getting lost and eventually stumble into a horrible boss fight that isn't any fun because of all the reasons I previously mentioned. I seriously don't get why this game is so popular. I'm actually mad that I gave it a second chance and now cant get a refund.New Update: This game actually completely sucks. The more I play it the more I hate it. The boss fights are complete trash. Way too many teleport away type attacks that ambush you from completely off screen. Too many attacks that come out WAY too fast to react to in time. All this in combination with the completely janky player movement, input lag, and lack of a block makes the gameplay laughably bad. This game totally sucks. I'm almost done with the game and I just want it to be over already. The entire gameplay experience is basically a constant struggle against the bad design. You never get used to it. It never clicks. This game is like trying to play basketball in cowboy boots. That's what it feels like.Final Update: I quit this game yesterday. I couldn't bring myself to play it anymore. I was gonna finish it, but once I got to that massive zone where you have to fly around on a cloud without a map (OR A COMPASS!) I just couldn't take it anymore. The zone is massive and you have no way to know where you are supposed to go, and it looks like there's stuff to find or do, so you fly all over the map only to find absolutely nothing! I wasted ten minutes flying around finding nothing at all, only a couple crap mini boss fights that were pointless. This game has a lot of big areas with absolutely nothing in them, but you don't have a map or compass to guide you so you end up wasting so much time wandering around only to find nothing or run into an invisible wall. Its infuriating. It was the last straw for me. I realized that there was nothing enjoyable about this game, so I quit and uninstalled it. Buy this game if you like janky unpolished combat, terrible bosses, getting lost, exploring giant zones for no rewards or loot(or even any enemies), only having one playstyle/weapon, and playing without basic mechanics like block or parry or ANY ranged options."
Negative,"Leaving a negative review just to balance out the blind hype. Game is a mixed bag and a typical 6-7/10.Graphics and boss design is as great as everybody says. The game around it tho is very boring if you don't force yourself to overlook it.Normal enemies are a joke, every level is doable by just mashing the attack button and there's a total of 2 ( TWO ) combos you can do. You can spam light attack, or spam light attack and end with a heavy.Unfortunately the game also copies all the worst ingredients from Elden Ring like quest design that includes random backtracking and cryptic, unrelatable story-telling.It's completely possible to miss out on most NPCs or even basic game features like being able to upgrade your armor because you didn't progress a quest the correct way.There might also be a great story behind this game but you won't understand a thing from what you're presented within the game. Which is even more ridiculous when you see the amount of effort that went into the various cutscenes.It looks nice tho.Welcome to the age of incompetent UE 5 beauties."
Negative,so hard to play making me angry alot so bad
Negative,"好端端的一个英雄人物被改得一塌糊涂，孙悟空竟然和白骨精谈恋爱，还搞什么杀妻证道？？！！不改剧情就不改差评A hero character who was originally good in the original book was changed into a mess by the production team, and in the game plot, Sun Wukong actually fell in love with the white bone spirit and killed her for personal gain??!! As long as the production team doesn't change the plot, I never change the bad reviews"
Negative,"I want to like this game, but it's grossly unbalanced when it comes to boss fights, where difficulty levels ratchet up incredibly unevenly. It makes getting past certain points an obnoxious chore, especially if your life isn't just button mashing all day. There should be difficulty settings, better balance between enemy types, a more linear leveling system and a much better approach to explaining character attributes and stats. That this game is being lauded by certain players and reviewers is real indictment of how bad the gaming scene is right now, because in 2018 this wouldn't been seen as a particularly great game. It might be beautiful, with fabulous aesthetics, with some core game play that could be pretty great with tweaking but, as is, it's grossly overrated."
Negative,"Good looking game but forced to play on low graphic settings even on my 4070 Ti Super because of terrible performance (with updated nvidia drivers ofcourse), lots of stuttering, Elder Jinchi fight was near unplayable with how low the framerate was. Story is very generic, not that interesting, no stakes.Gameplay is basically just Sekiro but more forgiving, not as satisfying, and a bit clunkier, although the perfect dodges feel really good. Boss fights are very cinematic, but pretty easy to beat in 1-2 tries so far (note I've only played chapter 1/5 so far). Basic enemies are not interesting to fight even though their visual designs/concepts are pretty cool. Some minor bugs with camera and enemy AI"
Negative,"just makes me want to replay NieR.lots of invisible walls and the game cant decide if it wants to be a soulslike or a hack n slash. i think this is an decent game that came out in a time where new good games are rarer than they should be, thus making this game look much better than it really is. the overhype is real for this one.this game should be worth $40 additional note: skill trees are the most boring and dated progression system **IMO**"
Negative,"Already bored. Although it's probably too early for me to write an honest review.- Voice over in english was weird. It doesn't feel like it fits what's going on in the game.- Intro was kinda bad. Everything just felt dull.- Graphics are bad. I'm not impressed.- Exploration sucks because of all the invisible walls.- Not sure what the point is of enemys, they all die in 1 hit.- Interaction when fighting feels off. It feels like a cheap copy of dark souls / elden ring so far."
Negative,"The game suffers from obscure and difficult-to-understand dialogue and descriptions, compounded by inaccurate translations. The storyline is lacking in engagement, with little to no coherent narrative. The gameplay primarily consists of running around and battling monsters, without any difficulty settings to tailor the experience."
Negative,"Edit: I have requested a refund. I can't kill any of the first area's bosses because of it being so overtuned. This game is NOT non-souls like player friendly, and it should definitely state that it is a souls-like game.Difficulty is easily a 20 out of 10. Don't get me wrong; the game looks amazing, feels good; but they don't specify its souls like so the overtuned difficulty makes the game not fun unless you want that genre.The entry level difficulty in this game is way too overtuned. If you like souls-like games, and extremely difficult boss fights then this game is for you.I'm at the Wandering Wight fight, and I never come close. No difficulty slider that I can see."
Negative,"All the positive reviews on this game has to be bots, there is no way an actual human tried this game, and came to the conclusion that it was good in any way other than its graphics. Super boring and easy combat, very uninspiring. Tons of invisible walls, extremely bad VA when using English setting. Chinese VA was a lot better, but it's still a negative. All in all, don't bother with this game. You're better of spending your money elsewhere."
Negative,"Right now I wouldn't recommend this. It is a great game, short for the price. finish in two days just left the true ending cuz the boss is very difficult for me. I think its the contrast or the shadow settings for me, really hard to see in-game. Im running on i7 16gbRam gtx 1660ti, five years old laptop. Tried to put the shadow setting on High, made it a little easier on the eyes for me. I think if I play it longer than I did, I would went blind or smth, this game is really hard on the eyes."
Negative,"I bought into all the hype thinking this would be a great game to play. Well, it wasn't, it was just another mindless linear grinder. I was truly underwhelmed and disappointed. In my opinion there are better games out there, it's too bad this isn't one of them. It was a fairly expensive lesson I will try not to do again."
Negative,"This game is too boring, half the game you don't understand who you are fighting with. This combat is not bad, I`d like it, but it is just a souls like game. You are constantly walking along the corridor forward and sometimes between bosses you see easy mobs. Why did they do it this way? In fact, you are just walking through bosses, with turns for 5-10 mobs and cutscenes for 5 seconds. They hid things like in souls like games as well. This is Elden Ring on minimum."
Negative,"Got to chapter 3 and was very bored with it, I really don't get the hype at all, its extremely repetitive and lifeless, full of invisible walls. The only game where I wish I could get my money back.Nice soundtrack though."
Negative,"Do I love the game so far? Yes.Would I buy it on PC again? No. - I'd buy it on PS5 instead. (I have a great PC, think it's just the port of the game this time around)Cool game, definitely a souls like where it's just hard boss after hard boss. The harder you try, the more likely you'll lose haha.Would be great if the game didn't crash, atleast 5x fights now where I've struggled, then almost gotten the boss dead on the 10th go, then crashed with boss HP at 10%. Very frustrating, but still worth it."
Negative,"Looks great, but right at the beginning you get 3 separate encounters that are a bit too hard for someone who’s not that into souls likes. I get that some people love it but for those that prefer not to spend hours on learning then it’s too tough. And to be honest I have 100+ hours in Monster Hunter so it’s not like it’s impossible to make a game for both types of gamers at the same time."
Negative,lacking in inclusivity and diversity
Negative,"honestly overated, there is little to no build variety/customization, and as an rpg, it should have some aspect of build cstomiztion"
Negative,god of war 3 and elden ring had a cheaper baby
Negative,Looks good in low bitrate streams and screenshots. That's the only positive I can come up with unfortunately. Super mid game in every way. Would not recommend.
Negative,"Game is frustratingly hard, too many bosses without basically anything to do in between them (for leveling up). Healing is slow and clunky, invisible walls are terrible."
Negative,Mad long nd borin
Negative,"I am sorry, I am not maybe made for such kind of games, where game punishes u even if u miss a single dodge, and attacks turn 360 to hit you.I cant play 10 times just to learn enemies every combo and then defeat him. There is no difficulty level as well.I only love dynamic games , where you understand the moves in 1 or 2 gos, and most imp fast dodges.Game is great though.For people who enjoy getting smashed and then beat."
Negative,"For a game in 2024 to feel like a game from 1999 on the ps1 is SADGE..Couldn't get past the many weaksauces on display but each to their own.. Will defo look to buy in future when keys are cheaper, not worth £50 imo..Currently waitin on refund so I can buy summat else lmao..."
Negative,fix your control options no reason i shouldn't be able to bind keys to my mouse button in 2024. il change my review once they change the control.edit: you cant even change the keybindings on your controller you have the choice of type (A)ssand type (B)itch wtf is this shit and why arent more people calling this shit out
Negative,"it's a souls game with a monkey guy. if enjoy fighting every boss 30 times before you kill it then this game is for you! ""git gud"""
Negative,not for me
Negative,Bosses to RNG with their attack patterns and unfair
Negative,"Really want to like this game, I've pushed as far as I can but the stuttering and bad frame rate on even the lowest settings is making it impossible to play. Hopefully gets an update to fix this"
Negative,It's definitely made in China.
Negative,was expecting a normal game you cant change the difficulty and game is so hard looks great just impossible to play not for me personally unless your into soul like games or elden ring which is also impossible to play
Negative,Stop using other languages to pretend that you are not Chinese!
Negative,"Dont buy into the hype!The game is overly difficult and not in a good way. Timing ducking away a blow from an enemy is very hard and it way to often just feels like complete random if you end up getting hit or manage to evade the attack. Bosses have way to long and many combos making it near impossible to memorize their patterns and beat them.The whole game is just an unsatisfying, repetetive boss rush. Save your money for something more fun"
Negative,it's a souls like. everyone is lying if they say otherwise.
Negative,"Not a bad game, but it's souls-like. RIP casual gamers that bought this game."
Negative,"I liked the game, but i have to return this, way too hard for me."
Negative,"Free With GPU. Sadly there is nothing more to this game than the exceptionally pretty graphics and one miserable combat after another.  Not even the environments for as beautiful as they are are interesting to explore, no storytelling to be found even in the level design. I guess that if you enjoy dying over and over and over again and think that's rewarding or something then you might enjoy the game."
Negative,"Recommending no to provide a contrarian point of view.There is a lot to like about Black Myth Wukong, but 10 hours in I am quitting the game. The combat and abilities are sublime, I just wish they could be executed with more consistency (ala Final Fantasy XVI). As a ""soulsbourne veteran"", they have gotten the bosses all wrong. The difficulty is far from linear, with random absurd spikes present throughout. Case in point, I one-shot one boss, then take twenty tries on the next, then one-shot a boss, then take thirty tries on the next. Not only are there random difficulty spikes, but the cameras on some of the bosses are horrendous, thus why I am quitting on one particular boss after one try at the 10 hour mark ... it just isn't fun. Other issues are present, such as invisible walls everywhere, even where it doesn't seem like there should be some and technical issues. In the snow biome (Act 3), I had some severe technical problems with crazy pop-in of ""white walls"" in the level. The first five hours or so were GOTY quality, and all the issues started popping up after that. I would personally wait for a sale before I jumped in. Odds are you will enjoy the first part of the game so much that you won't be able to refund."
Negative,"this game is hard but not in a good way. bosses have no patterns the basic enemys feel so boring elden ring is so much better , the fact that its not an open world game but you make basic enemys way too hard does not make sense at all. game feels like a chore and as a souls veteran the dodging is super horribly wonky, you have to wait for your attack to finish before you can dodge lol not to mention how trash the camera in this game is wow what a waste of money."
Negative,"Honestly, this is a decent game that suffered from being grossly over hyped.The combat is okay but way too simple to be engaging long term. New weapons are acquired in a really bland way and exist purely as a linear numerical damage increase while the skill trees don't really give you a lot of interesting growth to your character, aside from obtaining new spells.The boss design is very frustrating because animations are janky and move pools are purely randomly plucked from a pool of moves. The fights really aren't that hard to beat, but the damage is very high and moves aren't often telegraphed in a meaningful way, so it's usually just trial and error to figure out what moves a boss has and hoping they don't spam the annoying ones. Visually this game is an absolute masterpiece but even that can come at the cost of performance, depending on your set up. I am running it on a 3090 and still experience stuttering at times without reducing settings, this appears to be common, so I assume it's just a bad port. There is also absolutely zero exploration in this game and you are constantly on the rails and surrounded by invisible walls. They gave you a jump button, but then put invisible walls around anything you could possibly jump on like a small boulder or platform. It really makes no sense and feels super dated aside from the graphics.People need to stop calling this a Souls like, though. Aside from having a dodge button, there is virtually zero similarities to any souls game. There is no unique loot, the level design is extremely linear, there are virtually only bosses in the game, You cannot customize your stats or build in any meaningful way, The combat does not have a lot of depth or variance, You are not rewarded for paying attention or exploring, Combat is generally a trial and error experience rather than an expression of skill. It feels like an early 2000's action game with the invisible walls and super limited, linear gameplay, just with Unreal 5 Graphics.All in all, not a bad game, wish I could leave a ""mixed"" review. But I'll finish it and move on, I think."
Negative,"Great, i guess. Love the story and art. Hate fighting bosses in areas with invisible walls."
Negative,"More open world and less invisible walls, please. No map, no block, no fun, refund."
Negative,"Don't buy this game.Bosses are ramped up too hard.Most won't get past chapter 1.It's a waste of money, you won't see most of the game."
Negative,"Has Denuvo, nuff said"
Negative,The game is too hard for me. I lost much of my reflex skill over the years. I only bought the game because I wanted to enjoy the story and marvel at its graphics (and test my 4090 GPU). Please add difficulty adjustment in the next update. I must admit I was very close to install trainer for god mode but decided to grind through level 30 before defeating the wandering wight.
Negative,"Definitely going against the grain here, but this game was all hype and no substance. I lost all interest very quickly in the game.  The mechanics are repetative and clunky. Its a poor performing game but it looks pretty. The epitome of lipstick on a pig."
Negative,"I love stories about the monkey king and was very excited but had no idea this was ""souls-like"".  Pointless maps with overly difficult bosses scattered. I bought from 3rd party to save $10 and now I can't refund.  Avoid if you hate being pointlessly stressed!!"
Negative,its too hard to play
Negative,"A typical Chinese slasher (a parody of dark souls) with a bunch of ridiculous effects, illogical locations, and bugs.  (some like nioh/wo long but with better graphics)"
Negative,This game doesn't support 16:10 resolution and will leave black bars on your screen. I don't think that's acceptable in this day and age.I wanted to enjoy this game but it will be an instant refund for me.
Negative,"its a Call of Duty with blades and melee combat, nothing is special about this game over hyped just like Call of Duty"
Negative,A game that tries too hard to be memorable. Sometimes the devs have to remember: just because something in life is hard and wastes a lot of time doesn't mean it's valuable. I hope they find something meaningful outside of their job.
Negative,Going against the mainstream here but for me this game suffered with the Unreal Engine Stutters and massive drops in FPS which were not just areas of loading because I could hang around sections for 10 minutes and the FPS were as low as 5 which was consistant even when dropping settings to Low with RT off.I have a 4090 + i9 3900k + 64gb and when not in those areas my FPS was 100 in 4k with res scaling on 90 and all settings cinematic except for AA which was on high. Refunded.
Negative,"Ehhh :/ The level design is bad and the gameplay is mediocre.I bought the game since the hype and Steam reviews looked very good. However, it is not a game that deserves all this hype and praise. Personally from the first moment, I thought that it had a specific clunky feeling to it and told myself it would go away with more level-ups and more tools in combat. After 7 hours this did not change."
Negative,"Copy and Paste Dark Souls game. I saw people comparing this to God of War (2018) and I just want to elaborate that it's NOTHING like that GoW. This is a Souls game. Not saying it's bad but I just don't care for this style of gameplay (dodge roll, attack, dodge roll, attack)"
Negative,"The funny monkey game becomes drastically unfun after the 2nd Chapter. The combat system is frustrating at best. Your attacks whiff on most bosses from Chapter 3 onwards. The actual depth of combat is really only puddle deep and poorly implemented. Boss design is overall BAD. I have found very few satisfying bosses and the overwhelming majority of bosses are just annoying. I beat every boss within 5 attempts up until I stopped playing about 3/4 of the way through Chapter 4. I do not think the bosses are hard, and are only made difficult and frustrating by the sloppy combat system.The dev team proves they are new at developing action games as the flaws are blatant once you pull back the drama surrounding the game's release. The two areas the game excels in are the art direction/graphics and the world building. Good god are the visuals painfully beautiful. I had less frustration beating Ninja Gaiden 2 on the Xbox 360 compared to this game, and that game was far more unforgiving. I have beaten all Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, and Elden Ring bosses, and the only bosses that frustrated me more than the bosses in this game were Orphan, Malenia, PC Radahn, and Demon of Hatred. I would not suggest spending your money on this game unless you are rather patient and of an above average skill level with games similar to the above listed along with titles like DMC, Bayonetta, God Hand, etc."
Negative,Madarchod Scorpion boss
Negative,horrible laggy as fuck
Negative,"The bosses are too broken, they are not fun at all"
Negative,lost 11 hours worth of game time for no reason game didnt saveother then that 10/10 to bad im never playing again
Negative,This is a great first attempt with a lot of promise for the studio.  That said after about 7 hours in I'm tremendously bored and putting it down.Its novelty wears off quickly.
Negative,rác phẩm 2024
Negative,this is a really good game but who ever created the scorpionlord  boss has to die immidiately like right now!  that boss is the worst thing i have ever seen 2 shots you the arena has low fps and as i said cancer to who ever created scorpionlord i dont care !
Negative,"Souls-like game, not recomended to gamers with little time to play, bosses are to hard for casual players. Despite few reviews comparing to GOW it's not simillar, this game is only for souls-like lovers."
Negative,"I gave it a chance. Some of the fights are enjoyable. Other, not so much. All the invisible walls were a huge buzzkill. There's plenty of lighting and performance issues (even on a pretty solid machine). The level design is okay for the first two chapters, but after that, it takes a hard plunge. The prison sequence in Chapter 3 (with pits that kills you – I guess we don't need invisible walls for this part) was not fun. Cutscene damage several times during a boss fight that takes you to half your health? I probably haven't seen a more stupid gameplay decision in a long time. Well, maybe apart from the fact that this game doesn't have even the simplest of maps. Plus, the story is very hard to follow and at times nonsensical. And there's no pausing during cutscenes because I guess life never gets in the way, right? All in all, this game is fun until it isn't. So if you feel like you can overlook the issues, feel free to try. I couldn't."
Negative,"So I don't like Souls likes but I'm a fan of Action games such as DMC. I heard this was closer to DMC versus Dark Souls so decided to try it out. If you're a fan of the souls games and like the visual splendour those games have, you'll probably enjoy this. For me, the story and the gameplay didn't click. It's a beautiful game but It's not for me. I don't like the punishing difficulty. I don't like playing bosses over and over and learning frames of animations for attacks. I just want to jump in and enjoy the game even if it requires some quick reflexes. Something like the new POP is amazing. This game just isn't it for me."
Negative,I was really looking forward to this game.It looks fantastic. Everything is smooth. Amazing!But it's exactly like every other souls like when it comes to gameplay.I'm getting really tired of nothing but souls like games coming out.Amazing graphics! Amazing gameplay! But no you can't bind anything to your extra mouse buttons.There is so much to collect! But no you can't track your progress.There is so much to explore! But no there is no map.You can't retry a boss fight. You have to clear your way all the way back there to try again.I couldn't even make it through the first chapter because everything was so needlessly difficult and no matter how many times I tried I couldn't make progress.I'd really like to experience this world and story but can't because it's just too difficult.So disappointing.
Negative,"First of all there is for sure many things to praise the game for, and clearly a lot of work and passion went into it when it comes to animations, sound design, vistas, the combat is pretty fun although it got repetitive fast for me after like 20 hours. I will definitely finish it at some point, just did not get so hooked as I'd hoped. The single most frustrating thing for me was the invisible walls which are often placed in spots which really seem reachable. Combine that with not having any kind of map, and a bit boring level design and it makes navigation more frustrating than it has to be. You can go through the linear path relatively easily but the game has a bunch of secrets which makes you want to check every corner, which will often result in you bumping into invisible walls. You're playing as a shapeshifting monkey but can't even traverse over simple objects, it would have been nice if the barriers of the level were more obvious, or at least there was a map of some kind.For me that just lead to me not looking forward to exploring the next area, and that's why I did not finish it yet.Also keep in mind if you don't have the most powerful PC, it can look pretty bad on lower graphical settings, which can kind of diminish the appeal (as there are a lot of beautiful sights to be seen, which for sure can still look decent on lower graphics). It looks really good if you can handle the raytracing though."
Negative,"It was too difficult. Other than that, it was spectacular."
Negative,It's just not as good as people say it is.
Negative,"I have never felt so under powered in a game, no matter what level you are facing a boss you will still get punished."
Negative,"Everywhere I looked on reviews of this game everyone said it wasn't JUST ANOTHER SOULS-LIKE. So I purchased thinking it wasn't going to be JUST ANOTHER SOULS-LIKE. Played the opening section which didn't feel like JUST ANOTHER SOULS-LIKE. But then the game tried to add story to the gameplay and everything fell into the ""JUST ANOTHER SOULS-LIKE"" category.I thought this was going to be an epic battle game based on the Chinese mythology, something along the lines of Asura's Wrath. And the opening section does have that kind of feel. But the moment the opening sequence is over the game is a souls-like cookie cutter, just like all the other souls-like rip-offs.I requested a refund previously. That refund was submitted as soon as I realized the game wasn't going to reclaim the feeling of the opening sequences. It was denied, so I tried to mitigate the souls-like aspects by using third party cheats, but not only did those cheats end up exposing my computer to security risks, it didn't eliminate the boring souls-like aspects of the game because the souls-like aspects are all the game has to offer outside the opening sequence.I have made a concerted effort to find enjoyment in the game outside the opening two hours, and it just isn't there. This game feels specifically designed to trick people into thinking it isn't JUST ANOTHER SOULS-LIKE. But the fact of the matter is this game is no different from ANY of the souls-like titles.I DID NOT WANT TO BUY ANOTHER SOULS-LIKE GAME WHERE ALL YOU DO IS ROLL AROUND BOSSES AND DRINK HEALTH POTIONS. PLEASE REFUND MY MONEY WASTED DUE TO FALSE ADVERTIZING."
Negative,"its realy quite sad how i wasted my money on this game only to be the one to add the ""SoulsLike"" Tag...Note for this i simply dont like and play souls like"
Negative,"the most incosistent combat system and generic story that is, the voice over is terrible (english) and the translation makes no sense"
Negative,If you are a casual person don't even touch this shet .It's full souls with a pinch of RPG 👎🏼👎🏼
Negative,"combat is boring, not reactive. Heavy attacks take years and jumping barely works."
Negative,Best game ever.  This one is not for noobs
Negative,"An absolute piece of shit, bosses are shit, combat is even shittier, lore means absolutely nothing to anyone who hasn't read the book, the game is a bunch of chinese propoganda"
Negative,Was really looking forward to black myth still am but I do not recommend buying this until it gets an optimisation patch or amd release a new driver specific for it. 7900xtx here and I couldnt even get past the intro cinematic or first fight after skipping it. Game continuously crashed and even crashed my pc at once point. I'll wait out until this is fixed for another few days if not I'll be refunding for certain.
Negative,"Extremely hard in some boss's fights that you are thinking to uninstall it. And unfortunately refund is not possible if you play the game more than 2 hours. Even if you ask the next day for it.Beautiful graphics, story."
Negative,"This is the most immediately disinterested I've been by a game of this style. Eats SSD space and delivers a strangely unsatisfying combat experience in the very early game with an unrewarding skill tree to start with as well. Can only speak for the very early game experience but it was just extremely boring basic enemies that fall over like paper, not especially responsive attack chaining, no interesting combos, no parry, mediocre stamina system, extremely clunky heavy attack buffering. Also the game looked like it had forced motion blur with no setting to turn it off. Didn't like any of the characters in it at all either. The voice acting was painful and I'm just not very hooked aesthetically or mechanically or otherwise."
Negative,"Don`t know what is so exciting in this game, except grinding towards level where you will eventually go through a boss you meet. Don`t mind walking in a tunnel like in a God of War but here it`s a really confined space, if you have claustrophobia, you can get one. The game is not remotely close to games like Elden Ring, or Souls like, where you can figure out how to beat boss. Here you will be beaten - reborn in a place allowing getting few exp points  - beaten and reborn until you get level high enough to plow through the boss. Utterly stupid mechanic which implies that you go through the game if you sacrifice enough time to grind through the areas. I`m a bit drunk but that is the feeling I get atm."
Negative,"Tthis is nothing but a boss rush game. you kill some small ones, then a big one, get a couple of seconds story, save at the shrine and do the whole thing all over again. You change your skill set based on the boss hoping that you dont have to grind but after defeating this odd fella with the little annoying snakes, you get a gain to kill 3 little ones get a little story (< 1 min) and then you face off with the next boss that has even 2 phases... I never played this kind of game before. its literally a boss rush nothing else. if you cant beat the boss after changing your skill set 100x you better start grinding like an idiot.... im very disappointed of this game and hope i can return it"
Negative,"The concept and creative execution of this game are excellent, but are catastrophically held back by the fact that it runs terribly. The first two chapters of the story were fine, running at a comfortable 70fps plus on very high settings, only occasional stuttering or fps drops. After hitting a certain snowy area in the third chapter of the story, however, the performance dropped off a cliff. Notwithstanding the fact that I am no longer able to push past 50-60fps average even on medium settings, the game now stutters and drops frames so frequently and drastically that it is practically unplayable when fighting bosses. I have tried everything I could find on forums from updating drivers to verifying game files and even tweaking BIOS, to no avail. Other modern games (such as Helldivers 2, Baldur's Gate and CP2077) still run perfectly fine at high settings on my PC, so the issue is not a hardware malfunction, nor would I have expected it to be one of severely outdated or insufficient specs - and yet here I am, completely unable to run the game and wishing the performance issues had turned up sooner so I could have refunded within the time window."
Negative,hasn't grabbed me as i hoped it might.. wish i haddnt purchased it.
Negative,"Great graphics, great myth, get The Surge 1 & 2 for better combat."
Negative,"A souls like designed by someone who has never played a souls game, combat is unfun and unbalanced"
Negative,"This game is so black, it is a myth im wukoun"
Negative,Nerf Whiteclad Noble.
Negative,The game is shit. The bosses are a walk in the park ive beat all within 5 attempts or less most on the first and the optimization on pc is beyond dogshit. I have a 4070ti with a i7-11700 and my game constantly stutters and drops frames on the lowest possible settings. The paths to the bosses are more of a challenge than the boss itself as im getting immobilized and gang stalked by an absurd amount of shit npcs around the map. Also doesnt even need to be said... but no map???
Negative,if you newbie dont buy this so freaking hard-
Negative,"Too hard, lvling don't mean much"
Negative,Looks pretty. Plays poorly.
Negative,"Black Myth: Wukong does indeed feel like a watershed moment for the Chinese game industry. They have finally shaken the double-A cheapness that has long plagued their visual presentation. This game can stands proudly as one of the most graphically impressive games ever made. But its beauty is only observable from a technological perspective.There is no heart, no thought, no humanity within this. There is technical fidelity, but no actual art direction. It is a game made to sell copies and do nothing more. If the people behind this game could've found an AI to chug away for a year or two and spit out something similar to Black Myth: Wukong, they would've done it in a heartbeat. It is a confusing, messy boss rush with particle effect laden, functional combat. Combat that is surpassed in each of its aspects by literally hundreds of games. It is a pot-luck of every character action game released in the past 20 years, taking all the most recognisable elements and constructing a Frankenstein's monster without any afterthought beyond how it will look in the trailer. It is this stagnant, noniterative approach to design that offends me most about Black Myth: Wukong. In between Wukong’s formidable super-foes lay more open explorable areas. These areas are among the worst designed sections of any game that I have ever played. If the elegant mazes and puzzle boxes of Elden Ring are the videogame equivalent of literary masterworks, then these sections present here are the incoherent ramblings of a madman. You will forget where you came from. You will go down a winding, alluring path and find no reward at the bottom. You will get hit by ranged enemies from inconceivable distances. There is not an ounce of clairvoyance present. The fact I managed to stumble across any of the main bosses is a miracle. These sections take up a huge portion of the game, and their quality is pathetic.As this emergent sector of the industry takes a huge computational leap, they are still decades behind as game designers, and as artists. Black Myth: Wukong is a mechanical and joyless product that only gained the attention it has by becoming the idol of an incel-lead culture war. I received this game for free with my graphics card. Do not buy it; this game is stinkier than the monkey doo doo they throw at poor little Wukong.Also, this is a good read:https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west"
Negative,"I didn't know anything about this game and decided to give it a go from the hype, it is so boring dont waste ur time it is so so so so boringggggggg and yeah im gonna be picky there are no cute girl costemtics and seriously for that price wow . i would rather go play runescape than waste my time for it . so bad please if you see this stay away. all the monkeys dont make sense anyways and the start doesnt make sense either it all just seems boring and waste of time and waste of money, i could of spent this money on other things like buying alot of coffee or an electric tooth brush"
Negative,"Received the game as an NVidia Gift. Started playing it, it was a movie not a game. Hated the first fight in the cloud and stopped playing. Decided to go back again a week later, pushed through the first fight in the cloud, another VERY LONG and boring movie. Random enemies sitting here and there in a linear path without apparent reason to which you destroy them in 2-3 hits and they can't even fight back.There are invisible walls literally everywhere. You move from a boss to another boss.Hate the combat, it's boring, press button and dash out of attacks. TBH i think I just hate this genre of games. It's slow and painful, you have no choice but move linear. Un-installing and will most likely never play again. Everything is so slow x.x Character movement to animations to excessive cut-scenes.If I wanted to watch a movie, I'd simply hop on Netflix."
Negative,"I had a crash right after opening Chapter 1 black screen.running benchmark after the crash, in game.Low graphics - 25 fpsmedium  - 13-22 fpshigh - 12-22fpsinterchanging the super resolution settings to everything, and lowering/raising that other super resoultion bar did nothing. geforce graphics card."
Negative,"In jedem Fall ein Grafisches Meisterwerk, tolle Handlung und Charaktereleider lässt sich die Steuerung für Maus und Tastatur nicht frei anpassen (Tastenbelegung Logi Maus G502 )ist halt mehr auf Controller ausgelegt, mal wieder.Auch der nicht frei wählbare Schwierigkeitsgrad nervt, zu mindest Gelegenheits Zocker wie mich ;) das ständige wiederholen der selben Passagen (nach dem Bosse dich mit 3 Hieben weggeputzt haben ) ist echt öde.sonst klasse Game."
Negative,"If you're coming from elden ring, don't bother. This is truly dull. Boring linear areas, leading to a boss that stun locks you until you grind enough of the usually under populated area preceding it to be able to mash buttons quickly enough to beat them...then move onto the next one. Really wish I hadn't spent 50 quid on this! I hoped it would get better, it hasn't. Too late to refund."
Negative,"Spend my last money on selling my old rig, buying a better used one, upgrading it with a somewhat decent 4060 from prime day. Played some time. Looked forward to black myth. Had a lot of fun the second day. Ran smooth so far. Worst crash happened after the black yoguai fight scene video on the hill with a lot of noise - screeched like hell - pc did not respond whatsoever, all peripherals disconnected by themselves had to hard reset. Doesn't post anymore... even though everything seems to still run? Weirdest failure I have ever encountered... thankfully nothing seems to be damaged. I had to reseat the RAM and the GPU several times and do a CMOS reset. First it posted again with just one stick of memory, now it runs again on both. Not quite sure if I want to have that again..."
Negative,"A decent blend of souls like and action game held back by a lack of build diversity, hit things with stick fast or slow but more powerful is not exactly innovative and most enemies pose no threat or pound you into a fine paste there is no gradual progression here.One thing it is not short on is visuals from every mountainside spring to each crumbling ruin the whole world feels very alive, i can't speak to its cultural or mythological accuracy but its breathtaking to look at nonetheless.If this game is your thing it will scratch that itch but for me personally i don't feel compelled to keep playing mostly because of its reliance on a horde of small enemies who are about as threatening as a pack of wild kittens who seem to be guarding the god of destruction and chaos."
Negative,Not for me.
Negative,X - X -X - X - X - Y - B - B. +2 social credit.
Negative,Over hyped and overpriced indivisible wall generator.
Negative,"Eh, it's pretty fun. Not a big fan of the same old ""3 or 4 skills with separate cooldowns"" that seems to be all over these games recently. The combat feels a little stiff, but not too terrible. Looks beautiful. Overall though, it's just kinda... eh. I probably wouldn't pick it up unless it's on a sale."
Negative,"This game is literally just Genshin Impact. EVERY SINGLE weapon has the same fucking moveset! Instead of giving you the sick ass weapon the boss you just killed had, they give you a 10 second mode ability where you turn into the boss because they didn't want to make more animations for the stupid ape. Of course it has a skill tree instead of literally anything else because investing stat points is too complicated for the tiktok brained lobotomites that this game is intended for. There is absolutely no customization and you are forced to listen to this same stupid monkey in the same stupid armor wielding the same stupid staff as everyone else. This also means that there is no alternate way to fight a boss. You can't equip a different weapon type or try different spells because there are only like 20 weapons in the entire game and they're all identical anyways, so you HAVE to brute force every boss until you remember its entire moveset. Dodging is clunky as shit because for some reason nobody can recreate the same tightness that souls rolling has. It's like Fromsoft is the Krusty Krab and all these games keep trying to recreate the Krabby Patty without the secret formula which ends up with you watching this moronic primate flail around while the boss continues his 30 second combo that ends with him jumping backwards across the entire arena. Craft all of your weapons and armor because apparently chests containing actual gear and not 1 time use consumables and 100 gold is a thing of the past. There is one thing about this game that reminds me of my favorite game of all time (Bloodborne) and that's the fact that it can't go over 30 fps. But that's not because SONY insists on holding onto it, it's because this game is ONLY as popular as it is because it ""looks good"" in the tiktok phonk edits of the opening sequence, but when you actually load the damn game up it looks like shit because you don't have the best possible pc on the market. This game is not fun do not buy it I'm dead fucking serious."
Negative,"I'm sorry, I know it's early in the game, and I'm positive I will adapt, but the combat system is trash. It just is. The dodge is the main culprit. I've gamed since Frogger and Asteroids days, and I can tell you this is not a product should have been released until the combat system was flawless. It makes the game extremely unfun. Whatever Doom 2016 and God of War and Uncharted is for fun combat, this is the opposite. I understand when I overcome it I will ""enjoy"" the game. But it has to be said. The hype is too much. For a $70 game I expect PERFECTION. And it isn't."
Negative,"Dark Souls with a monkey.Good morning, 2-3 bosses that you can't kill. The game offers nothing but nice graphics. I got the game from MSI, if I had spent the money I would have thrown it away and regretted it. The combat system is weak but bearable. I have no idea what people were waiting for. This is just a very average game. Don't buy it, wait for torrents"
Negative,"Sadly, its a little boring. Invisible walls everywhere and very linear.  Moves are very limited and fights are repetitive. Nioh 1&2 are better and they are linear, and have multiple weapons and specialisations.  Its a pleasant enough distraction, but the hype is too much."
Negative,So hard i want refund
Negative,Overpriced and runs like second phase Consort Radhan pre-nerf in whatever settings on my amd setup.

Negative,this game is way to fucking hard
Negative,Nice GraphicsInteresting at firstMemorize a bunch of difficult patterns to feel good about memorizing patterns and kill boss
Negative,"Looks really good, but I didn't like it"
Negative,I couldn't even get the damn game to open because my processor is too good.
Negative,"Graphically, this game looks amazing on cinematic quality and does so without a problem. Gameplay-wise, it feels like a lesser version of elden ring on semi-rails. Not a lot of options in terms of exploring, few paths to take, etc. Not that there's anything wrong with that per se but it feels like a step back from elden ring while trying to *be* elden ring in new clothes.With that said, if you enjoy souls games this can fill some of that void and give you that satisfaction when you win a hard fight.TL;DR: I wish there were a 'mixed' rating I could give"
Negative,"Extremely difficult, first two ""bosses"" and I already died three times, the difficulty combined with over-sharped image made me leave the game after 30 minutes of gameplay."
Negative,"wukong is actually a ripped off from an Indian demi-god Hanuman, so this game is essentially poor man's Hanuman game"
Negative,so many issues good game when sorted.
Negative,"The game is fun. I love watching people play it on Youtube. Ya know, since it crashes every 5 minutes when I try to play it myself."
Negative,"Extremely hard to beat boss at around 13 hours of gameplay and the next area see a huge performance drop, about 20-30 fps....A lot of gamers are giving up at that specific boss because of its difficulty."
Negative,"Elden ring, LIes of P, all run fine.  Wukong is unplayable for some reason.  Load time is almost 10 mins!!"
Negative,long playtime due to leaving games open. At chapter 5most boring combat I have ever experienced. terrible level design. pretty good looking though. First game in my life I genuinely wasnt able to convince myself to finish.not worf
Negative,"I'd like to start this by saying it's extremely rare for me to write a negative review for a game, because I accept that it might just not be my type; but I have to address the other reviews here and add some sort of balance:Bought this game because of all the ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews. Well, lesson learned: Steam reviews are a joke. Either everyone has collective amnesia, or bots are padding those numbers because, let me tell you, Black Myth: Wukong is absolute trash—technical disaster and storytelling failure wrapped in shiny graphics.Technical Issues Galore: For a game hyped up to be a ""next-level experience,"" Black Myth: Wukong has more bugs than a swamp in summer. There are consistent reports of serious performance issues on PC despite multiple patches. We're talking random crashes, frame rate stutters, shader loading issues, and a bug preventing players from even achieving 100% completion until a recent patch tried to fix it​. So much for ""polished,"" huh?Combat Feels Like a Bad FlashbackThey talk up the combat as if it’s some revolutionary experience, but honestly, it's as stale as combat from a 20-year-old action RPG. They slap on some flashy effects to distract you, but once that novelty wears off, you’re left mashing a few buttons, cycling the same boring abilities with zero real strategy. I didn’t expect much from a studio making its first major game, but it’s baffling to me that this somehow gets praise while other titles from bigger studios get roasted for far less.Story—If You Can Even Call It ThatNow, let’s talk about the story, or lack thereof. If you like your narratives to be random encounters strung together with no rhyme or reason, congratulations, this is the game for you. They expect you to be familiar with ""Journey to the West"" and fill in the gaps for yourself because the story provides zero help. No context, no character depth, just cutscenes trying hard to be ""epic"" while the plot makes as much sense as a fever dream. There are no stakes, no emotional connection to Wukong or any character for that matter. It’s just an incoherent mess of scenes thrown together.You know how some games pull you in, make you care about the protagonist’s journey, and make every fight feel like it matters? Yeah, Black Myth: Wukong skipped that memo entirely. Instead, I’m here slogging through what feels like an AI-generated sequence of events without any emotional weight. It’s all spectacle and zero substance.No, wait, I literally made the comment to my mate sitting with me that they should have just run the entire dialogue through GPT 4o and gone with whatever the hell came out. AI would do much better, this game demonstrates the failure of humanity.""Beautiful Graphics"" Are a Cover-UpPeople keep mentioning how ""beautiful"" this game looks. Yeah, graphics are fine, but I’m not spending $100 for a glorified screensaver. It’s like the developers decided, ""Hey, if we make the visuals really nice, maybe people won’t notice that the rest of the game is hollow."" Visuals are about the only thing it has going for it, but even those are bogged down by all the performance issues—frame drops, and stuttering when loading shaders. I shouldn't need a beast of a GPU just to get a playable frame rate. I'm lucky to have an RTX 4090, but most people aren't. I can only imagine how poorly this runs on regular rigs.Refunding and Moving OnI fell for the hype, but I won't fall twice. Overwhelmingly positive reviews, my ass. This game is getting refunded, and I hope others aren't fooled into thinking ""pretty graphics"" equals a good game. There's no heart here, just wasted potential and technical issues that feel like a slap in the face to players who expected something actually worth playing.Bottom Line: An Overhyped, Half-Baked MessYou know what's funny? We, as a gaming community, collectively shredded AAA games like Cyberpunk 2077 when it had issues. But Black Myth: Wukong? For some reason, people are willing to turn a blind eye, as if the studio deserves a pass for launching a game that barely functions right for many. Guess what, they don’t. This isn’t some indie darling struggling against all odds; they had the resources to make something decent, and instead delivered a glorified tech demo wrapped in pseudo-philosophical nonsense.The sad truth is, Black Myth: Wukong is nothing more than style over substance, wrapped up with a shiny bow to trick people into thinking it's something special. It’s all flash and no fire. And you know what? Maybe that works for some people who are easily fooled by pretty particle effects and fancy lighting, but if you value actual gameplay, a cohesive narrative, or anything resembling a finished product, steer clear.I was tempted to tough it out, to see if the game might have a redeeming arc, some hidden depth. But no. Every minute I played felt like another wasted opportunity by the developers to give this game a soul. No, thank you. I’m done.Refunding. Moving on. And I won’t be looking back. If you’re still on the fence, let me be clear—don’t fall for the hype."
Negative,"GAMES GREAT, 100% WAS RUSHED BY DEVS AND COULD'VE MADE COMBAT FEEL 10X BETTER!My explanation...The game's overall graphics and scenery are a 10/10.. but not being able to have an open world is kind of very disappointing considering the beauty and excitement all around this game on social media. The gameplay itself when in combat feels very delayed on pc with the controller to computer the dodging and the quick attacks just aren't when you want or intend them to be.There are random enemies in spots where you can't even damage them so they just continue to shoot you or hit you over and over until you move or run in circles... VERY ANNOYING ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT!!!Half of the first bosses are stupid in difficulty for people seeking a game it advertises to be.. that tiger that these game devs have created is smarter than any AI I have ever seen in any game. it is impossible to beat for casual players. some people don't have the time nor the WHOLE DAY to learn each and every single move and hit this tiger does. it's completely way too hard I have 7 hours played and I'm still not past this part.... I have tried over 70+ times and have read 70+ comments and reviews on how badly this boss was made and how it was designed, he constantly spams you with attacks and as soon as you use your abilities he just either finds a way to counter all your attacks and deal half of your health bar gone before you can even TRY TO DODGE IT!!! Then half the time my character isn't even getting physically hit and is still taking damage from nothing. his sword is just the worst thing to ever imagine in a video game like this, he spams 6 hits back to back, and if you don't dodge fast enough or in the EXACT moment you are dead... I've made plenty of potions and grinded all the way to level 30 and I still cannot beat him, and this is the beginning of CHAPTER 2.. that's just a little bit unbelievable to me. this game disgusts me now and I don't think I'm ever going to touch this again if they don't update this damn boss. DISGUSTINGanother few minor bugs such as honestly the hair could've looked 10x better and what's up with the armor still going into my chest and my back? thought we could've fixed this kind of issue in Unreal Engine 5 but I guess like every other developer for this type of game it's just all about the $$$ and not taking the time to make a good game."
Negative,After 1 hour of playing the game is found it to be extremely boring story wise. While the graphics look 'good' they are not cutting edge - too much hype was built around this but it does have its moments of Glory in this department. Combat is great when it works: dodging will fail at times and becomes a button mashing event based on luck. Charging does not always initiate the way intended. Also the Engine is too demanding. Might give it a miss and pick it up again when optimised and price drops.
Negative,DOG SHIT GAME
Negative,"Quite unenjoyable. Story is mostly boring, or until you manage to get through all the unnecessary sheer amount of bosses you forget it. More bosses than anything else. Useless grind with no reward. 60$ spent for nothing."
Negative,Fuck your game. It's shit.
Negative,"Shit game, I cant pass chapter 2. just fighting. Cant enjoy the story ffs."
Negative,worst game ever made
Negative,"Disappointing game experience. Bad map design, boring combat system, cringing translation, what else is there to be excited about? Its crazy fanbase? If you play this game carefully, you will know that there is really nothing to prove its excellence. Traditional Chinese culture? The arts may be good, but the story has almost no relevance to the original JTW novel. Overrated."
Negative,"This game is NOT what I thought it was going to be. The Area is small, and, ELDEN RING done it better! I don't know what the H3LL the dev's was thinking! AND ANYONE that has played Elden Ring, know this is shit compare to this game! I'm not HAPPY with this purchases  whats SO EVER! I even bought this game for 3 Other People, now I REGRET IT! Wow, WHAT a fucking waste of money! You will see my face on the day of Judgement! I will not have pity on you what so ever, because you KNOW what kind of game you developed! Even the game Ghost Of Tsushima Director Cut was better than this Peace of Sh!t Wow, you need to hook up with them! Learn something FROM THEM!"
Negative,"Paper thin, boring, monotonous, unsatisfying and repetitive combat with surface level basic foundation with basic 6 hit combo, piss poor damage even after staff upgrades, heavy reliance on dodges as the only option to defend yourself against enemy attacks, only one pathetic weapon with pointless and needless animations, extremely long heavy animations and moves which can be interupted and will miss the target easily more of that than you can imagine, bs and cheap bosses that interrupt your heavy attacks and spells by just making a body contact, terrible hit boxes, extremely small range of the staff and upgrades to range make no difference. There's literally nothing I like in this game when it comes to combat and it is the main thing in the game you'll be doing 99% of the time. Oh and as if that's not bad enough, deflection is in the game, but guess how it works.... it's a stupid af two botton spell with a cooldown! Anyway, they did everything they could to ruin this game and completely failed at making complex, varied and satisfying and rewarding combat system, which is super important in a game where all you do is fighting enemies and bosses.Absolutely cannot recommend it to any Souls and Souls-like fan. You are better off playing the much better Lords of the Fallen (not to mention Elden Ring and its expansion) which has a much better and varied combat system and runes, which can completely change how you can play the game. There's no such enemy variety like in Wukong, but it doesn't really matter if combat is a paper thin in your game and basic fundamentals are trash and surface level at best."
Negative,"Really cool bosses! However, move set is super limited and hard to tell if there is a secret area or just a dead end wall. The graphics are really good and the as well as the cut sense. The bigger bosses you fight are hard to follow if you are locked on. Honestly the real battle is fighting the camera. The magic users you fight spam so many spells its hard to tell what you are looking at. Overall i'd give it a solid 6/10, great graphics but not enough freedom to make different builds that stand out."
Negative,"While the game isn't bad, I just can't see myself giving it a positive rating.Do you want boss battle after boss battle? If no, this game really wont be the right fit for you."
Negative,"The game is just boss fighting simulator. It's just one boss right into another. I mean if you're into that, then cool. But it's marketed as a deep story and there just isn't any."
Negative,Very hard to play
Negative,"Although I like games with a challenge, I found this game to be even harder than the Souls games. Unlike souls games though, there is no option to summon someone to help you with the fight, nor are there any other  summoning options. Also, there is no block or parry- just dodge-roll.  For me, by the time I got to the first real boss (which isnt very far into the game) I found myself unable to consistently get out of the way of oncoming attacks. It seemed way to early in the game to have several VERY tough bosses to face off against, and there is no difficulty setting in the game to make things any easier. For this reason I would advise against buying this game unless you are very confident in your skills. I thought I would be able to find a way past theses bosses as I do in all of the Souls series, but I guess my skill is lacking. I wouldve really enjoyed seeing the rest of the game as it looks really fun, and is a beautiful and smooth game."
Negative,"pick up on sale.game has a very limited combat style that doesn't really change based off of your decisions.game was really fun for the first hour than got repetitive.visuals are good, game runs great and there's no store transactions which really scores points.if i picked it up for $30 it would be a positive review and i could overlook my general frustrations with the combat. with the combat you get dead locked into long annimations for abilities and special attacks. if u get hit during these times it consumes the ability and resets your timer without triggering.also you cant skip mid fight cut scenes which for anyone whos cut down melania blade of miquella know that skipping a cut scene can save hours."
Negative,"This is a pretty looking hack and slash game. There's minimal effort involved, and the most difficult enemy in the game is the invisible walls. I'm not quite sure how this game made it past play-testing, however, the invisible walls honestly ruin the game. While they strip away the immersion during the exploration parts of the map, the invisible walls during certain boss fights (omitted due to potential spoilers) make the game non-enjoyable to play.Bosses should not be able to attack you from outside the map where they cannot be hit by the player.I cannot recommend the game in it's current state. It looks great and the concept is fun enough. However, the game is unrefined for a $59.99 game."
Negative,"In this review I go into details in why this game is bad and how it is a good example of everything that is wrong with the Souls-like genre.I also take the time to criticize the whole genre and how it has completely devolved in the cheap difficulty galore this games have become.If you dislike the narrative surrounding this game: ""It's good because is not woke"" you will like the video because you and me know this game doesn't deserve the praises this game is receiving.Also I explain how this genre has become a genre for streamers and how this games are not made for gamers anymore they are made in a way that is atractive for people to watch but not to play, thats also the reason why they make them more and more hard because it produces sales whenever peopel go and watch their favorite streamer die over and over again.It has become a completely toxic and a travesty of what it was."
Negative,Black Myth Wukong is the Worst Game I Had seen EVER.
Negative,"After having thought about this game and how it was designed, I cannot recommend it.  It was fun through the first couple chapters albeit the story was hard to follow.  The game quickly becomes a frustrating experience with boss mechanics, boss design, and level design.  This game has a lot of praise for its graphics and combat that does feel good but does not deserve as much as it got.  Graphics for me have become a point of no concern because of games like this.  I have finished the game but do not plan on getting the true ending because of how frustrating the game is.  If this game gets game of the year, I am very worried about our standards for gaming and the future for it.  For a reference, I completed the game with no transformations and no active spirit skills on bosses because they felt boring.Some bosses are designed so that a specific item is required to make it easier and less frustrating but having to backtrack through secret areas and side quests in the game.  It was a painful experience learning that one spirit skill is required to unlock one or two areas in the game and that is it with no hints this is possible.  Once I learned secret areas existed, I searched many maps finding invisible walls to areas that look like they could be explored getting frustrated.  The lake in Chapter 3 was the worst believing there could be secrets out there to learn I ran around its perimeter in over 30 minutes for nothing.  There are also many areas in the game with only Will the currency or chests with low grade upgrade materials that make exploring less inticing than finding the area boss.  A couple of my many gripes with level design in this game.  The world was nice to look at but horrible to explore.Back to the boss mechanics and design, there are a few annoying boss designs that make them very annoying.  Some hit boxes on bosses are aligned to their models like their legs allowing your attacks to whiff.  Giants allow you to lock onto their legs but smaller bosses or enemies do not making your charged attack in smash stance you had for that annoying combo you were going to punish the boss for stunning them useless.  This might be more skill issue being lazy to put points into Pillar or Thrust stances but I still found it annoying attacks fell flat annoyingly often on these bosses.  I found smash stance varied combos to be the most inviting stance that felt great.  Also grab attacks bosses begin to do.  Once the grab has been seen once, it is easy to dodge out of its way when you expect it... until a the bosses later on can have up to 4 grab attacks with one being in a combo chain and another boss has a scripted grab that cannot miss on its phasing taking half your health.  Not to mention if you do not find the item to make the boss easier either.  It is a pain without them but possible.  Blinding lethal tornadoes to incredibly limited stamina and stamina regeneration to boss armor.  Having to go back for secrets for hours after being stuck on one boss and later only works its particular function well on a couple more bosses while also in particular not being hinted that these items even exist is bad design.This game is definitely not worth full price where I bought it at $60.  At most, this horrible experience is worth half at $30.  Better yet, play better titles like Dark Souls than this.  More intriguing story although less cut scenes, more polished gameplay, fun level design that gives hints on how to do secrets, has multiplayer, and even has better music."
Negative,you litterly do no damage

Negative,literally the only good thing about this game is the art.
Negative,unplayable garbage refunded
Negative,Does not support steam family.
Negative,the boses in this game are boring to fight
Negative,"Take all worst features of the Dark Souls, throw away all best features of the Dark Souls = Wukong."
Negative,"so many technical issues with AMD gpu's.. not worth touching unless you are only going to play this, and don't expect to use ray tracing, HDR, high refresh rates or high textures. it's also optimised heavily for controller.. so if you are a mouse and keyboard enjoyer, be ready for more issues."
Negative,"Took forever to load, of all my 0.4hrs in game 0.3 in loadings.The sound refuse to sync. Unreal. And is overall buggy.Combat seemed diverse, point for that.Items of different resolution used in the same frame.  Stands out, and knock out the immersion.Doesnt seemed like a fully polished product.Friend provided the free product.Love, friend."
Negative,"WARNING: The game keep crashing. The game will run for good 4 hours up to the point where bear fight boss. Each time I beat the boss, it went STRAIGHT to shutting game down and shutting my computer off! My PC meet all it requirement, nothing wrong with it, still new. I had played Elden Ring, Baldur Gate, Arma, computer strong enough to work with 49 inches monitor. Wait until they fix the bugs."
Negative,This game crashes on my gaming laptop (just a year old). No saves. Crashed twice in a row at different points in the first fight. Unplayable
Negative,Cant even get past the first fight.  Crashing every time.Radeon RX 7900XTXI7-12700K32GB RAM
Negative,FUN COMBAT BUT NEEDS A MAP I'M TIRED OF BEING LOST
Negative,Too hard to make any progress. No difficulty setting to learn the game.
Negative,"just 30 seconds at the beginning of the game then click delete game. because there is no movie skip button. This is a game, not a bedtime story. Why is it so difficult to create a skip button?"
Negative,I'm using rx7900xt and my game keeps stuttering which is affecting my combat despite using 1080p with all low settings. People say the game is optimized but I don't think so. The stutter is so bad that I need to take a break from my headache.
Negative,This is basically GoW wanting to be Dark Souls but it took away the difficulty settings. The first half of this game and even parts of the late game are fantastic but the final 1/3 of the game had a boss designer that thinks needing to perfect dodge 15 times in a row so you can get two hits in is fun. Have I had fun with the game? Yes. Will i purchase future games from this studio if this is their boss design philosophy? NO.
Negative,"It's not a bad game. Maybe I'm just getting old, but I just don't have the effort for these games where it's just trying to roll at the right time when the boss moves very slow then instantly, but oh that wasn't actually the attack. Then they move really slowly then instantly again, but oh that actually wasn't the attack either. Then they look like they're not going to attack anymore then attack instantly. Let's stop pretending a bait and switch combat is actually engaging."
Negative,"There is no difficulty that fits my skill level. In fact there are no difficulty settings at all. I don't know why, it was invented like 30-40 years ago.Just wanted to have a good time but nooooo, I need to be stressed to a point where I'm not having fun anymore.This game is a beautifully crafted paperweight."
Negative,"This is even more condensed than Dark Souls. Walk 15 feet, encounter a new boss that has an entirely different moveset and can kill you in 1-2 hits, rinse and repeat. It's 100% back to back bosses, each of which will need to be memorized to defeat. It's frustrating because the game looks great and plays well, but there are already enough Souls games and Souls clones out there that this really did not need to follow that formula. Honestly if this had an easy or casual mode where I didn't have to retry every single boss encounter dozens of times, I might continue playing this. The first 1-2 hours were awesome, and now its just slamming my face against a wall.Please developers, there are so many of us out there that want to enjoy your content. After working a long day, I don't want my video game experience to be more work. Give us an easy or casual mode and let gamers choose to increase the difficulty."
Negative,wo pani wala bhut chutiye
Negative,I do not like it
Negative,not fun didn't meet the hype
Negative,Such a good game but… it’s difficult to stay engaged when you have to start from the beginning of a level after some over powered boss. May request a refund
Negative,"It has the foundation for GOTY: No Micros, no political agenda.  Mass appeal and stunning visuals.  The game play felt really clunky. even when you're over powered in the beginning.  the Iframes didn't feel right and the combat was off.  I might try it again after a few updates.  right now it's nice from a far, but far from nice."
Negative,"This game might look sick, but it feels dead inside. The story’s a total snooze fest, and instead of letting you roam free, it keeps you locked on rails. You’re just wandering around with no clear goal, moving from one checkpoint to another without any real motivation. I was hoping for some juicy lore or backstory to sink my teeth into, but nah, it’s just not there.Gameplay? It gets stale fast. Sure, the tutorial tells you the basics—press this for a light attack, that for heavy—but the combat is brain-dead simple. You’re just mashing the same buttons over and over, farming loot, and finding obvious chests and resources. The enemies are dumb as rocks, barely reacting to anything you throw at them. Even the boss fights are a joke; they might stagger, but good luck figuring out when or why. Honestly, it feels like the game was made for kids. I’m just not getting that challenge I crave, and what’s up with having a store in the resting place menu? At least throw in some NPCs to interact with or something.Yeah, the graphics are dope, but the performance is straight-up disappointing. The game doesn’t even support native resolution, relying on DLSS to keep things running. And get this—despite rocking a beastly rig with an i9-13900 and a 4090, the game still struggles to hit 60 fps. It dips to 40, even 30 during fights, all while stuttering like crazy at 4K with max settings and high ray tracing. There’s nothing complex going on to justify these performance issues, which just makes it all the more frustrating.Honestly, after playing something as lit as ""Shadow of the Erd Tree,"" this game just doesn’t cut it. The simple mechanics and easy gameplay don’t scratch that itch anymore. Maybe this game just isn’t my vibe, but I was expecting a lot more. Even with all the eye candy, the lack of depth and the performance hiccups kill the experience for me."
Negative,"Please dont buy this game if you are a casual player. This is the worst game due to many reasons1. No controller change options2. No easy mode3. Very buggy when consuming consumables or using abilities4. No map, no hint"
Negative,"I get the hype, cinematics are gorgeous, combat flow is fun but something about the game feels cheap and the lack of freedom really drags the game down. There’s a lot of great ideas and we’ve seen them done exactly the same before. It’s more forgiving than a souls game in the sense you won’t lose currency upon death, but I don’t feel like this game is worth the full price. Definitely try to get on sale."
Negative,"This game isn't fun. This is the first souls-like game I have ever played and I just do not like this genre. At all. Dying 20 times in a row to the same boss over and over is not fun. I am currently stuck on White Clad Noble (who is only the 2nd ""king"" level boss so far) and I think I am going to give up. This was a waste of fifty bucks."
Negative,"This is not an action rpg, this is a boss fighting game, pretty much a boss rush... and it is the easiest boss fighting game I have every played by far, this alone is its sole issue, nothing else."
Negative,"1.奇差无比的优化2.缝合的游戏3.狗屎的地图设计4.可有可无的剧情5.疯狗一样的恶心人水军和营销除了美术 其他内容只会恶心人Support him is the Chinese government, please do not buy"

Negative,"terrible game, terrible optimization, constant crashes,"
Negative,Game seems amazing. I love jtw but unfortunately i can't make it past the first scene after fighting the gods(tried multiple times). i hope this is fixed but i can't recommend it until its playable.Specs:Cpu: Ryzen 7 5800xGpu: Rtx 3060Installed on ssd
Negative,"I do not recommend this game to anyone that isn't using cheats. To play this game normal you have to have the ability of quick silver but even then you won't be able to see everything to come. Elden ring, Dark souls all those games I have completed easy. This was something else they do not warn you about. The bosses are unfair and as soon as you're winning they will ether spam you, take health off you in thin air or just start regenerating health. As a hack and slash I was enjoying it but it is insanely hard and you do not find this out until 2hours have passed to avoid you from refunding.Before people comment silly things like ""Git gud"" I want you to know without a difficulty warning from the store page this is a completely unfair purchase."
Negative,"Game is dog shit. Linear as all fuck. Basically a straight line from the beginning to the end, with zero explorability. Can't walk within the sides of the map without getting glitched to go straight. Have to grow roots into your chair to be able to beat the 2nd boss. Game is cheeks."
Negative,"the least challenging game in existence, on literally every level. a snoozefest of the highest degree.it is so deliberately palatable to everyone and eschews any kind of element that could be considered divisive, in- and outside the gameit's boring, no kinder way to put it. for all the visual spectacle and beauty and the beautiful chinese voice acting, black myth: wukong offers no depth at all. it is a shallow pool with beautiful reflections that invites you to go through it like a theme park ride. decidedly artless, apolitical, lacking substance. i regret my purchase."
Negative,"From a straight out flat review this game is a solid 7/10.The only reason I say that is because many of the problems are in fact that this game is Chinese? I mean that in the same way Indians treat their media. It is over dramatized and has a lot of moments that never make sense. Lemme splainMany bosses in the game have a kind of an ""uh oh"" button. Some are a neat attack or some AoE sweep combo that chases you a bit. After the ""uh oh"" button wears off the boss will usually flop or stop to breath a little bit longer than usual. Earlier in the game these attacks are cool but as you get later into the game these attacks get cheesy or cheap all together. Almost every boss has some kind of grapple move going chapter 4 forwardA more specific example of the ""uh oh"" attack is in chapter 3, where a certain boss has 3 cutscene attacks that cannot be dodged and will cut your hp down to a quarter. These attacks cannot be countered, even going as far to artificially stun you with some buddha magic or some crap. The only way I was able to avoid one of them was by somehow glitching the boss on the edge of the arena, which made him teleport to the middle and swing at the air (Couldn't replicate :[    )This is more of an annoying bug than anything, but the staff spin turns you a good 20 degrees right. It is advertised as being able to stop projectiles and it can. BUT; When you go to areas with fall hazards and bow enemies you tend to die deflecting arrows and just flying off the beam you are on.In all honesty this game is nice and has good combat and flow, but the bosses feel a little undercooked until the boss goes ""uh oh"" then does a crazy high damage attack then fizzles out shortly after. It leaves a bunch of fights feeling like there is a health bar to chip down until the real fight starts, then a timer for 20 - 30 second timer as it flails about then stops and reverts back to normal. This leaves many fights feeling less rewarding and more of a chore.TLDR is bosses are sponges till a last hoorah phase. After phase is done it loops to sponge mode again and usually the fight ends there and it feels pretty unrewarding and staleedit one, the game only gets worse as it goes on and bosses just have more bs under there belt.Got to final chapter and just started getting mythic gear cause... yeah. all of the farming i did to upgrade my gear and get a good weapon invalidated. this game easily shot down to a 4/10 by the end of the game, too bad people are meatriding this too hard to see a problem with crappy/ lazy game designtldr 2 chinese games always find a way to invalidate all the work you do cause chinesium powerscaling"
Negative,"really bad performance don't recommend rn, on a 7800x3d and 7900xt and the fsr artifacting is atrocious as well as performance, wait for a couple patches."
Negative,"Too difficult, and the story line seems like an after thought. Game mechanics are bad too."
Negative,"Game crashes to desktop on benchmark test and after intro cinematic. No error messages, just closes instantly"
Negative,Needs a lot of patching to fix bugs and other annoyances
Negative,i cant run this game above 40 fps on a really good pc for no reason
Negative,"Can't actually play.  Initially loaded up and I was dialing in my settings, but then CTD and then CTD non-stop.7800x3d7900xtx64gb v-color ddr5 6200AMD driver 24.7.1 - waiting for 24.8.1 to see if it fixes the CTD.*reverted back to October 2023 drivers and now I can play.  Running high settings between 70-150 FPS.  Wildly inconsistent.  Hopefully no more crashes."
Negative,"5/10 - Average.I'm playing this right after 100%ing Elden Ring so this game feels like a chore at this point rather than being a novel enjoyable experience. ""Attemps Boss 'B', X-amount of times in order to learn patterns and progress"". Souls-like at this point is not a skill game but just endurance... Idk why am I even playing this tbh, nor why people rate this game so high. But I will try to finish it and maybe I chance my opinion about it,"
Negative,"A very bleak clone of a souls game. I did not vibe with this game at all, from the streamlined progression to the overtuned bosses of which some feel like they are made difficult for the sake of it. When trying to overcome badly designed bosses (either huge cheesy delayed attacks doubled by slow motion effects or incredibly fast attacks) any victory results in minimal satisfaction. The one thing I was hoping for was a story/cinematic pleasing game such as is hinted at the beginning of the game but unfortunately 15 hours in and that intro was the most thrilling thing I got out of this game, by far. This is not a 60 euro game...I honestly do not understand how this game is reviewed as overwhelmingly positive. Sorry for the harsh review, I just regret buying it after reading comments that were praising the game. It cannot hold a candle to From Software releases, unfortunately."
Negative,"Honestly it's an amazing game but only 8 hours in and struggling to use heal and medicine items during what are very quick paced and often times very precise fights is frustrating in the extreme. I've had too many times that I was trying to heal or use a medicine that would cure poison or fire or shock but the game would just not register what I did and the enemy would just beat on me while I spam the buttons to get the item use. I press heal 3 times and I heal once, but sometimes you get hit hard and need to double heal and then you have to restart the entire animation over again to get the second heal because the 3 taps before only gave you one heal? If the ""animation canceling"" is fixed to allow healing and whatnot to end the dodge or attack animation just a *bit* earlier, that would be great. Maybe I'm just not getting the ""rhythm"" of the game but I feel like something as basic as healing in combat shouldn't be such a chore when the game is based around being very dynamic and quick paced with its fighting. Please, play the game. Try it out. It's really beautiful and I want to play more but this issue is just a massive downside to me personally and I hope future patches will ""tighten up"" the flow of button inputs and combat."
Negative,"Too many issues for this game to be considered good. It's playable/acceptable, but not good.Problems:- Level design is frustratingly bad. Worse I've ever seen in a game- Many bosses have weird hit boxes - Story is extremely shallow and boring- No HDR- Runs terribly- Constantly crashes- Some bosses have buggy mechanics, or get stuck outside the area- Invisible walls while in some boss fights- Extremely annoying NPCs, even some that can one hit you"
Negative,"Its stupidly too hard, to the point that its not fun. Using Keyboard/Mouse and the game only tells you after you buy it that it recommends controller."
Negative,pretty meh. over hyped.
Negative,"Most people who bought this game will never finish it. So think twice or better 10 times before buying. I think watching other people suffer while playing this game will be way more fun than actually playing it. For most people anyway.Bosses will insta reach you from almost anywhere. Any attack takes only a couple of animation frames so again, no time to react. You pretty much have to know what's about to happen, how long it'll take the boss to prepare the attack... and then time it right if you wanna dodge... So despite of what the guide tells you, you have to start your dodge before they attack, not when the attack is about to land...Throughout the game you collect some stupid relics just so the final boss can take them leaving you without their aid. Fun, right? To me that makes the whole game progress pointless. but why stop there? Let's make the boss also take my gear, reset my stats to zero and just insta kill me. According to dev's logic that should be infinitely more fun!My attacks deal minimal damage to the final boss. Why? Again that makes the game super fun! Fun all around!!! Oh, and the boss loves spamming you with his attacks. Because again: that's so much fun!Mid fight animations are unskippable (some of them are partially skippable). So enjoy the stupid animations like the one where the boss takes your gourd (when you're trying to heal yourself) and heals himself instead. And that animation lasts forever it seems. A little hint to the devs: that works if the boss can be beat in a couple tries. But you made that fight extremely challenging (boring actually, because I feel powerless, like a flee scratching a mammoth). So the unskippable animation DOESN'T work!Also, enough with the multi-phase bosses! Can you remind me what you're making your games for? I thought games were supposed to be fun. Where's the fun in beating the first phase of a fight over and over again?! What happens if you let me skip it? You will lose sleep, you will dishonor your ancestors? I just don't get it...The 6th chapter structure just doesn't belong in this game. A failed attempt to do Elden Ring: vast area with nothing to do there. I was having hard time to find bosses to fight...Anyway, the last part of the game feels like developers just ran out of steam... So instead of epic I got just a lot of frustration and disappointment. In that this game actually leveled with Elden Ring: defeating the final boss there left me drained and exhausted. I didn't experience any positive emotions, just a sad realization of how much time I've wasted on it."
Negative,Another dark souls cloneif you want to play another dark souls clone then go for it.
Negative,this game is man ass
Negative,"Luckily I got it for free included with a purchase. Graphics are cool and the story looks interesting. If you are an experienced souls player, this is probably for you. If not, then be prepared to either invest a ton of time in learning move sets/dying or be disappointed. I'm just not into a game that you have to waste hours of free time dying just to get lucky and progress the story even a little bit. Good luck!"
Negative,"Honestly one of the worse games I have played, mechanics are clunky, bosses have 0 rhythm and overall it was beyond boring being on the first boss for an hour and 30 minutes just because he has no full combo chains and can just throw attacks at you out of the blue. oh and lets bring up the fact its 128G for this total crap shoot of a game and its 60 dollars! not at all worth the price, storage space or time I put in and again i gave it an hour and 30 to impress me, it also runs like dog crapPLUS crappy dev team for saying fk Xbox so yea neg review hope this game burns"
Negative,"I honestly don't really get the positive reviews here.  At least not the OVERWHELMINGLY positive part...I mean, it's a cool game.It's got great graphics and it's pretty.  The combat is pretty tight, albeit easy (at least to the point I played).However, WTH is going on?  This guy is a monkey?  Uhh..  ok?  Why?  Clearly there are humans or humanoids in the world... so... why a monkey?Right about the time the tutorial ends is really where it need to start.  Far too much isn't explained... like how to make things, crafting, leveling up, what the various menus are for, what  your options are for at the campfires... oh, sorry ""shrines"", how to capture spirits since you can't do that without ""guidance"", but that isn't explained where you're supposed to GET guidance or even what that is.It looks pretty, but at its core it feels like yet-another Dark Souls knockoff except I'm talking ORIGINAL Dark Souls where nothing was open and everything was very linear with the ILLUSION of it being open.  but it's basically just a couple intertwining paths for the most part with only a couple real options and just enemy after enemy waiting in rooms.And... this guy shoves a pole in his ear which make absolutely no sense... and uses his hair as incense... because, monkey hair really tops the charts on fragrance I guess.There's just a lot about this that doesn't make any sense.Plus the fact that it's ENTIRELY DUBBED... and not even slightly well.They do weird things like send you into an area as an animal to ""scout"", but you end up becoming you again shortly afterwards and you don't see anything you wouldn't see normally anyway... so what was the point?Just so much of this game makes no sense at all...  I'm presuming you have to know the myths behind it for it to make sense or something.  Like.. you become a hair when you die?  Weird stuff like that with absolutely no explanation or backstory.I guess you're looking for a decent beat-em-up and aren't into storylines or lore making any sense whatsoever and are up for a 10 minute intro where you fight someone with no idea how your skills work or what to do... this may be the game for you.I'll pick it back up on sale... a very deep sale."
Negative,"BMW is very far from being GOTY... Perhaps if the game was 30 I would reccomend it, but 70 bucks for this mediocer game is too much. To give you an example, before starting playing BMW I just finished Elder Ring (That's what the GOTY should be), the details, scaling, are just worlds apart. To be fair to BMW - It get way better after the 1st chapter (Which is so bad, I've asked for reimboursement because I could not believe how bad it is). Level desing, invisible walls absolutely everywhere. Personally at that time I would give a solid 4/10 However later on the game improves a lot, the story about Destined one is getting clearer, the fights are improving and we are reaching a solid 6.8/10.Last final boss was actually super cool, with lots of cool ideas. Yet, it is simply outrageous how they left the most critical part (1st chapter) of the game in such a shitty state. I am glad I've continued playing, but its also because they would not reimbourse the game haha"
Negative,DO NOT believe what you read online.   This is EXACTLY like a Souls games.Depending on who you believe there are between 80-112 bosses.The game should be called BLACK METH: BOSS FIGHT.  Just terrible.
Negative,For the PC with keyboard the game is not good! The dodge is not very responsive. It could seem like a small issue but it is not.
Negative,"Honestly have no clue how this game is so highly rated. 6/10, don't buy at full price."
Negative,"I love this game, absolutely love it, i just wanna be a contrarian."
Negative,"The boss design after chapter 3 is fucking disgusting, completely destroys the whole game experienceWhat fuck is these air block wall, even ON BOSSES? You can never hit the god dam piece of shit, just fucking airThe scorpion boss on chapter 4 secret level is a utter disaster. Why you design a OP BOSS with endless attack desire and give it the damage to kill the play in GOD DAM TWO HIT???The rest part of this game is gorgeous but they did fucking design these dog shit bosses with the unreservedly untested way to ruin your gaming experience"
Negative,"It's mid.Level design is boring. Combat doesn't promote using multiple stances as some are objectively better than others. The combat also feels like you're using a pool noodle to hit everything.Unless you care about Journey to the West, you're better off picking another game from the myriad of other souls-like games out there.Has 21:9 support at least, but apparently doesn't have 32:9 support."
Negative,"People recommend this game just because ""Good graphics & monkey! :D"" While this game is just another Soulslike rip-off that barely act like a God of War.1 Animation for a combo during all the game, abilities & skill tree wont change thismost of enemies wont attack if you attack first & most importantly, They wont 2vs1 you, always one by one Game is badly optimised as hell and requierd DLSS or anything else like this to run ""smoothly""Game audio bug / interruptionGame FreezeGame CrashGame Corrupted Files after loaded after crash, had to reset save.Facial Expression of the main character look like Grand Blue FantasiaPlay Elden Ring and not this."
Negative,"I will refund for the moment because this seems kinda overhyped.I bought it because people compared it with God of War or Jedi Survivor but in my opinion its an insult to these games.Visually it looks great with decent performance excpet for some really small areas where FPS tanks to 30, cutscenes have chinese charm and thats not a bad thing.The gameplay so far made me consider refunding until a sale arrives.You can't even block or parry and the dodge roll doesn't feel great. Why is the heavy attack so fucking delayed? Why is there no posture gauge? It seems staggering bosses is kinda random, I know I have to do it with focus points and heavy attack but still feels random. Why are bosses so hard to read at first and feels more like trial and error? Why is the english dub so bad and has almost no lipsync?  Why do I use my stamina out of battle while running?I get it, as a chinese player I would be proud too but this game is nowhere near a 10/10 rating like IGN in China rated it.Its maybe a solid 7 but I will wait for the discount"
Negative,don't like the endings
Negative,"Terrible boss design and coloring, you literally can't see shit sometimes."
Negative,"Combat is chunky, dodging feels bad. Fights are very samey. Very linear."
Negative,"always crashing at the first cutcene, every driver updated etc. shame"
Negative,NOT GOOD FUCK U
Negative,"There is no block or at least a parry???The bosses just rape you, you can't even level up enough to take a couple hits from a boss. The graphic are good but I really wish it was open world."
Negative,"This game is utterly unfair. I love chinese culture and I hoped black myth was not an endless hell of bosses. After three days trying to beat yellowbrow I realized this game is really not for me. I don't understand why they didn't let players choose at least one more forgiven difficulty option. I have recently played StellarBlade and in my opinion that was a challenging game, but at least when it drove me mad I could decrease the difficulty level. Therefore I really pissed off because I knew that the game would have been a pain in the ass and I can't ask for a refund anymore!!"
Negative,this game is hard as heck for no real reason other than to make you mad its not fun in my opinion sorry not for me. it was waste of my money its a shame the drew me in with the story and I like an idiot fell for it difficulty should be an option and my choice
Negative,"Bad fight designs, no visual on the attack area. u stay behind the boss and hi is still hitting you even if he is charging far away. no skill required to win, just need to learn the timings of the boss, and is boring in this manner. another over-hyped game because of the visuals."
Negative,"Graphics are gorgeous, combat is fun.This game is like a chinese God of War with a hint of Elden Ring. Exploration is rewarding. They made it, record player count!I could write a wall of text elaborating what is this game like......just look at my playtime and you see how much experience I have!I wanted to gather some information on the Steam forums (possible bugs, how it runs, etc...), but I haven't found any.75% of posts were in asian writing, so I made an (english) post: ""Can the discussions be regional?""Fifteen minutes later my post is deleted and I get a Warning from some forum mod, cause: ""off-topic or spam"". Hmmm...maybe asian players complained too much about having regional discussions?Don't know, still I don't understand any of the asian writings.At least I know censorship is strong with this game! By the way I got a feeling they delete negative reviews, too. Just like Suicide Squad.I cannot believe 28,251. ppl, 94% positive. Or, it is a Helldivers situation, hypetrain gets ppl, the game's shortcomings revealed later.Give me a like, if you are censored, too on their Steam forums!Or, if you are not one of the thousands of braindead gamers, who clicks ""helpful-yes"" to long text reviews with 1 hour played."
Negative,shit game design
Negative,F*CK the developer for creating this frustrating pile of shit
Negative,如此之多的闪退和不正常的卡顿 如同一个半成品 这种优化和游戏性这么差的游戏是对其他同价位游戏的侮辱
Negative,"I really don't get the hype for this game. Sure the graphics are great and the bosses look cool, but the game is boring and tedius, it's basically:- Walk down a path and press x to kill some weak enemies- Get to a boss, die 25 times while slowly learning how to time the dodges for his animation- Beat him, walk down another path and repeat.The combat isn't really fun, there isn't really any exploration, the story is meh... Why are people saying this is a 10/10 masterpiece? It's more like a 6/10 at best and not worth the full price with how many other better games are available."
Negative,"I find this game to be severely frustrating in the fact that they give you a massive skill tree, but punish you if you don't level the right skills. Boss difficulties are WIDELY inconsistent, with some being pushover bosses and others just being down right ridiculous. Ch. 3 final boss has unavoidable damage cut-scenes as WELL as a gold phase that makes him immune to damage, and AoE attacks that also have a follow-up of a delayed AoE that can kill you really quickly. Jumping is useless. Ch. 4 final boss has the WORST hitbox that I've ever seen (not sure if it was fully patched, as I slogged through it) ch. 5 was a decent chapter. From that, going into a Deer that slows you with chill, takes off half health whenever it feels like it, can summon tornadoes that can easily restrict your movement and kill you. I wanted to like this game, but it seems like another 2014 Lords of the Fallen, and it's pretty trash. I feel like trying to beat it is more-so a chore than fun at this point. I was gifted this game, so I (Thankfully) didn't spend any money on it, but I still feel like I need a refund."
Negative,"Smite borrows its characters from seven different religions, and developer Hi-Rez does a wonderful job incorporating their familiar mythological backgrounds straight into tactical MOBA roles – the Greek demigod Hercules is a burly melee character, while Zeus flings lightning at his enemies. I was pleased with the huge variety between the 51 available Gods, and their impressively detailed models. Some flashier abilities, like Norse god Thor’s Ultimate, Anvil of Dawn, work especially well with the third-person camera because they launch you up into the sky. They’re thrilling to execute, and it’s neat to see the map from another perspective."
Negative,"From an audiovisual standpoint this is one of the more impressive games I've ever played. The sense of scale, lighting, animation, cinematography, sound design and music are all some of the best in class. Unfortunately, games have gameplay and that's were I feel this game falls flat on its face. First, the level design is severely undercut by the level of detail in the world leading to uncountable false affordances and leading the player directly into invisible walls. In such a linear game where the designer has nearly full control over what perspective the player will approach and view events from, this feels really under-baked. Second, progression. I feel like the game completely blew it's entire progression load in the first third of the game leaving the latter 60% to languish in menial stat buffs with no real gameplay alterations. I wish there had been more gating to some of the more mechanically complex options to make me feel like I was actually improving, but since I had settled into a playstyle all my skill points went to health, mana, attack and defense upgrades which were not satisfying to unlock.Third, narrative. The opening cutscene is by far the best moment in the entire game. After that point you are reduced to a silent protagonist in a character driven story where you have absolutely no character. Everyone surrounding the Destined One is a selfish asshole and it feels like the game expects you to have a preexisting understanding of the myth of Sun Wukong since, through the entire game, I had no idea who anyone was, why there was so much beef between literally everyone or why that mattered to the Destined One. Bajie is the absolute worst offender since he never shuts up, is a complete prick to everyone, and I still have no idea why I was supposed to be listening to him. And I never felt like the game gave a enough of a shit to tell me. Maybe it's a translation issue, but it had a major impact on my ability to relate or sympathize with anyone and I came away from it disliking almost everyone we interacted with along the way.And lastly, and most importantly, combat and enemy design. The sheer volume of enemy variety and animations are a detriment to the gameplay experience due to the sheer lack of familiarity you have with every new set of enemies. Other games let the player measure their progression by putting familiar enemies with knowable health and attacks as a gauge of the player's progress, but since every single new area of the game just throws a brand new suite of enemies at you you never get that measuring stick. It's just constantly learning new attacks and timings. Pair that with the latter half of the game having a severe drop in the quality of the animation tells for the player to react to, flaily and unreadable attack combos that go on for what feel like minutes with not enough time to react, attack or heal, a huge number of instant-damage AOE attacks and player attack cancellation windows and spell cast time that make Dark Souls 1's ultra greatswords feel responsive, the whole second half of this game just felt like an absolute slog to get through.If it had had player facing difficulty options, maybe that would have shifted how I felt about it, but as is this is an absolute visual masterpiece with about 30% of the game being fun and interesting and then pulling teeth for the last two thirds. If you make it to the snowy forest, you've already seen the best the game has to offer. But given how poorly designed and short the last two areas are, I think the game knows that. Buy it for $20 max and play it with mods if you want to have fun. I genuinely regret playing this myself and not watching the cutscenes on YouTube. Those are by far the best part of the game and your expirence will be better having not suffered the game itself."
Negative,20 min shader compilation every time u launch game
Negative,too hard reminds me of dark souls
Negative,"This game is not fun for me at all.  Unfortunately I have played for over 2 hours and I cannot get my money refunded.  The game itself is visually amazing.  I was hoping for a fun single player RPG , but the game play is just frustrating boss fights and invisible walls.  I'm already stuck on the second boss fight and after repeatedly dying over and over I gave up.  There is no difficulty selection and the small boosts you can get from the shop do not replenish.  Once you buy the potions and use them there is no way to replenish them.  Can't beat the boss with power ups?  Well now you have to beat the boss you couldn't beat with power ups, without power ups.  I should have done more research before buying this game.  Hopefully this will keep at least one person from wasting their money like I did."
Negative,"wow... VERY linear. feels like im playing onimusha from early 2000s. so basic. and of course! super duper and frustratingly hard! dont worry though, there's a dry story you sometimes kind of get told! otherwise, its a soul-less souls-like game. they drop you in, you fight monster. suffice to say, i am not impressed. THIS is what everyone has been raving about? games should be fun, and not too hard. thats why they have testers and people work on them to get them just right. what is wrong with all the testers nowadays? why is this a normal trend? i will be refunding probably. had like 3 rage-quit sessions. you cant jump on, or go many places. the game feels very basic on that level. combat is mid. its pretty. but even with my 3070rtx the characters look and move like a ps3 game."
Negative,"NO HDR? Are you freaking kidding me?! Why would you make a game with amazing textures, Ray-Tracing with new mapping technology and then take a big steaming dump on it after? Absolute madness!!!I can't even get this game looking half decent on my LG C1 OLED TV! It's a grey mess even in Standard Dynamic Range!The Contrast in SDR is shocking as well! Peak Brightness terrible! It doesn't look higher than 300 nits.The Black Level is raised even in SDR! Was this not tested on modern TV's or Monitor's?It's Starfield all over again!We shouldn't have to spend hours modding our game to fix something so basic as Contrast in a Triple A game in 2024 that isn't even in HDR! So disappointing..."
Negative,"Optimization 3/10 : This game has a lot of problems!! Shimmering, ghosting, over sharpening, flickering of shadows and reflections on high settings, the shadows are updated constantly under my feet when I walk, the vegetation is a mess of pixels and depth of field and vignette cant be disabled. The image is clear and stable only on very high settings, no DLSS and enabling ray tracing, but unfortunately I dont have a 5090. I will think twice before buying again an Unreal game.Level Design 5/10 : it's just a sequence of boss fightsStory 6/10 : it's just a sequence of boss fightsGraphics 6.5/10 : Terrible shadows but amazing particle effects, it's an 8 with Ray tracing enabled.With Ray Tracing disabled looks good only on a screenshot.Gameplay 9/10 : Love itVariety of enemies 10/10 : Love it"
Negative,"Not AAA-Game, its ERG - Early Rice Grain.Ling-Ling, patch' deinen Scheiß. Winnie-Puh dankt."
Negative,"Pros:- You play as a monkey.- Setting looks interesting.- Graphics are nice.- Art is good, in general.Cons:- Bad level design.- Bad combat system.I guess this is a perfect example of the situation where graphics and overall good artwork cannot save the bad-to-mediocre core mechanics."
Negative,Gets old quick. Too much boss fight not enough exploration. Beat it but and probably never play again.
Negative,Just another souls-like.
Negative,Devs spent a lot on flashy stuffs.
Negative,"game did not optimize properly for amd gpus... I have a 7900XT and the game runs at 40FPS without raytracing on, FSR super resolution at 75% still after over a month after release."
Negative,"A bad attempt at copying Dark Souls and Sekiro. Those games only work because inputs are registered properly and timing matters. Hitting a dodge or parry in DS and Sekiro right on the attack can save you. In Black Myth, your dodge doesn't register if it happens at the same time as the attack, inputs are also delayed, some inputs are not read. This makes it very frustrating to play."
Negative,"Asked for a refund, hopefully I get it.  Makes Elden ring look like a walk in the park in comparison but without any of the exploration, variety or fun of that game.  Don't bother.  It wasn't advertised as this sort of game.  Could be good with difficulty settings, otherwise it's only for the ultra hardcore."
Negative,"I hated this game so much. I've played plenty of RPG style games from Skyrim to Elden Ring in terms of difficulty. Based upon all that I read and reviews that I watched, I expected this game to be somewhere in the middle or on the easier end. It turned out to be the most difficult and clunky game I've ever tried to play which is disappointing because I was greatly looking forward to the story. To me it was even more difficult than Elden Ring which I was very shocked to see. There is no difficulty setting so you're stuck with it how it is. I would not recommend this game if your someone that wants to chill and experience a story. Prepare to stress and grind."
Negative,"No es un soulslike. El juego es un accion aventura machaca botones, los combates no me aportan ninguna satisfaccion y la historia no queda nada clara, a pesar de continuas conversaciones y videos animados. La exploracion es pasaillra y llena de barreras invisibles (muy tediosas). Las misiones secundarias son importantes y muy dificiles de hacer sin guia. Pues pasar por alto mecanicas basicas para el juego (el medico, el herrero, etc). A toda la gente que habeis comprado este juego en vez del Nine Sols, os habeis perdido el juego chino del año.PD: Los graficos son un espectaculo."
Negative,"there is absolutely no story, other than randomly wander in the scenario, kill everything that moves (for no particular reason), get to some guys that are a  toughter than the rest and have some special moves - repeat 50 times.the randomly wander part, is specially true, as there is no map, the visuals of the map are not ""real"" (e.g. visually there is a passage in the scenario, but the character is stuck against an invisible wall)."
Negative,Don't get this game if what you are looking for is a casual experience This is nothing like God of War there is no difficulty options.
Negative,this game owe's me money for how much i have broken
Negative,Bosses do the same moves ass
Negative,Purely luck based game.
Negative,"just not open world, no map. skill tree feels wonky and unhelpful. kinda bit wuwa with the echoes thing lol. but the gameplay just feels clunky, inputs feel terrible. kinda just doing the same thing, in this boss rush game. doing it hard with the enemies isn't worth it when the gameplay doesn't feel tight. feels stupidly unfair and not like elden ring's which is always telling that it's generally pure skill issue"
Negative,"The game is good, but the game has so many problems that ruin the experience. For example:-1) Not having a map, the game has so many paths so while exploring you may lost or not find the right path.2) The game is not optimized so many frame drops while playing and during cutscenes.3) Combat having some problems first character does not have any poise so he stunlock with a small arrow hit and the combo atk system.4) Exploration is not that much rewarding.5) The story is good but having so many bosses after one and two save points the new boss is waiting.If you are not from Souls Games player maybe this game will be fun for you but for me, the game is not that much good.My final rating is 5.4/10"
Negative,"I rarely leave reviews, but felt the need here. I was able to beat the first true boss and minibosses, I played a fair bit here. Game would be great if the combat had more variety. You are relegated to using one button as your input for 90% of combat. Variety comes from a heavy finisher that always finishes the same way. After 4hrs I was entirely sick of the same combo. Hope for new weapons was quickly snuffed out-- you receive power-ups that you can activate that grant a new weapon, but only for a short time before it is taken away again. Fighting low level enemies is reduced to a menial affair. They perish with the same mashing of light attack, just a bit quicker. Sometimes one of their buddies will attack you at the same time.Had high hopes. Disappointed this was passed on as an excellent game where you only mostly mash square."
Negative,"1. Overall Score- 5/102. Recommended- No3. Game ScoringA. Graphics- 10/10 Obscene amounts of effort went into stage design, graphical fidelity, and photo realism in this game. Small details abound in every texture and the game is generous with its capabilities. This is Unreal Engine on display.B. Setting- 9/10 As an avid fan of the Journey to the West story, and Wukong specifically, I loved the idea of playing the titular Monkey King in a game that did more to capture him in his traditional sense. Though the story makes little sense, as apparently Wukong being defeated and killed is practically impossible, it was an interesting idea to relive his life in an alternate style. His precocious nature shines through in everything you do.C. Mechanics- 3/10 This is where the game instantly begins to falter heavily. The story and graphics alone cannot hold this game up, no matter how amazing they are. The game seems to function more like a challenging boss adventure RPG lite. The mechanics usually seen in most Souls games are generally missing, and sorely missed here, with a lack of endless level and customization, wide variety of combat styles/weapons, and a fair amount of missing progression, the game feels less like a souls like and more like a Hack and Slash.D. Combat- 2/10 The combat is just one of the major issues in the game. I am torn, due to the fact that, as the Monkey King, you seem to fight as if he might, twirling your staff for epic strikes, interlacing magical spells and abilities while striking quickly, and getting buzzed to heal himself. The issue is, with no real defensive measures, your dodge is the only thing you have, and its iframe window is rather small, considering most bosses either stall attacks, or have difficult to predict, very lengthy combos. Also, its not long before you reach a point where you fight a boss that breaks lock on, and becomes ethereal while still doing dmg. NEVER a good design choice.E. Gearing- 2/10 Again, I'm torn. What is the Monkey King without Jingu Bang, the extending iron staff? And true to life, all you get is a staff. Yes, you might have 3 particular stances to fight in, but they are secondary to the basic, same combo you spam against all other enemies. Though you do get 4 armour pieces, with set bonuses galore, and a couple accessory slots, in general, they are usually nothing more than stats and cosmetic. Nothing is farmable, only acquired, much like most action rpgs, by defeating key enemies. So, for a long time, you might be stuck in the same gear, with no real way to improve yourself or the gear.4. ProsA. Sun Wukong. The Monkey King. As a playable character. Not an adaptation, not a inspired by character, the actual Monkey King. That, in and of itself, is a Pro.B. The graphics might actually make you think your watching a live action film that you are somehow controlling. The fidelity is awe inspiring, and the stages themselves are glorious to behold. Fantastical Ancient China brought to life is a spectacle.C. The story, seemingly taking place after Wukong's ascension, becoming the Glorious Fighting Buddha, means its an inspired sequel to the epic Journey to the West, which means you get to meet some of the characters during the game that were escorting Wukong during the Journey. Always a treat to see such care given to the original story.E. A myriad of spells and abilities show off alot of the interesting skills Wukong learned, and was able to utilize to his advantage in every fight he partook in. Many of these abilities are shown in the game as well, and remarkably well done at that.5. ConsA. The actual gameplay, moment to moment is jarring. You go from exploring immaculate scenery with minor enemies that offer little in the way of real combat, to suddenly getting completely wrecked by some wandering boss stuck in a corner thats completely optional, or getting stuck being pummeled by a story boss that is utterly overtuned in multiple ways.B. The lack of any real weapon choices makes the combat boring and repetitive. You use mostly the exact same combo form beginning to end, and not rally gain any semblance of new attacks except on rare occasions when unlocking a new ability in a stance skill tree.C. There isn't really a heavy attack system, as your heavy attack requires focus, which is gathered by doing damage with light attacks. After which, the heavy attack is usually the same, breaks the light attack combo to add a spike of dmg, and can apply some different effects, based on the stance.D. Practically no progression in terms of core stats aside from a few limited skill point unlocks, gearing is your mainstay for increasing your damage, health, defense, and survivability. And since the game is fairly limited in terms of gearing, the progression is painfully linear.E. A massive amount of the bosses combos can chain for an above average amount of hits, striking out at you in large areas 7-10 times. Many of these combos can even set you into a snowball of defeat, as the boss is able to strike you while you are recovering from a previous hit, and unable to move or dodge or defend. Sometimes, a boss can drag you from full health to less than half is you get hit by the first strike, with no way to stop the combo, or avoid it mid sequence.Edit #1. Bosses with Frame skips to enable perfect tracking. How much worse can you design your game?Edit #2. A boss that literally breaks lock on as a feature? Even shouts ""fooled you!"" as he does so? REALLY bad game design, and its 100% purposeful."
Negative,The game wants you to be aggressive with focus point building and parrying but lacks the game design to do so.Light attacks have so many active frames that you can't dodge in the middle of. Pray the timing of your light attacks matches theirs otherwise you're gonna be sitting around waiting.
Negative,"This game crashes ALL THE TIME. The only way to reconcile this is to constantly ""Re-validate the integrity of installed files."" The gameplay is really good, and the visuals and story are great as well. Unfortunately it's just unplayable because of all the constant interruptions and the intrusive ""Re-validate install files"" CONSTANTLY. Fix your travel scenarios and vfx issues that seem to constantly cause this. What a shame. 0/10 if you can't play the game."
Negative,"This is dark souls playstyle, 100%.  If you do not like dark souls or elden ring due to the pointless difficulty then you will not like this game."
Negative,They say it is not a souls like. yet it's even harder........
Negative,Game is supposed to be enjoyable not beating a boss after 10 times of re-spawning graphics are awesome would pirate it no point beating a boss after trying 100 times
Negative,suck my dick
Negative,"I couldn't finish the chapter 6. Unreasonably, all bosses got super strong, and could even one-shot me.If I wanted souls like game, I'd replay Sekiro.The dodging system is worst for me, It's unfair when all you can is dodging, while a boss is beating your ass, and you can't deal any dmg in return.The beginning and middle of the game were fun and challenging, but the end of the game became a nightmare for me.I wish I didn't buy this game at full price."
Negative,What a stupid pointless game. Unbeatable boss at the end of chapter 2. If you enjoy dying endlessly for a boring pointless grind then have at it. I don't have the time or patience to earn a phd to take on every boss just to progress the game. Not for me.
Negative,It is definitely a boss fight simulator as others have mentioned.Boss fights:1. BOSS Loading Screen -- start off immediately with a 30 minute fight2. BOSS Menu Lag3. BOSS Play Button  -- aka insta death half the time + restart your comp
Negative,"The graphics are stunning, and the map looks great. However, the map design itself is a complete mess, cluttered and lacking in distinctiveness. Coupled with the numerous and unreasonable invisible walls, it's hard not to think that this is all just for the sake of the visuals and art—a case of style over substance.The boss design feels uneven. Some monsters are satisfying to fight against, while others are just plain annoying. Either their hit boxes are weird, or the bosses have irritating moves. In soul-like games, they are tough, but you can find tricks and rhythms to gradually conquer them. However, the bosses in this game seem to rely on luck: the hit boxes are terrible, I dodge but somehow still get hit by the boss. There are various unreasonable jumping slashes and attack patterns that feel like they're locked in. Then there's the stitched-together combat system: the protagonist has a mana bar, extremely long cooldowns for skills, a stamina bar, perfect dodge, charge attacks, non-cancellable heavy attacks, very slow light attacks, and no defense... Fighting bosses feels like it's just for the sake of progressing through the game, most of them aren't enjoyable.The mana bar and extremely long cooldowns make it frustrating when you misuse a spell; the stamina bar means you have to rest a bit after a combo when fighting bosses; the very slow basic attacks (both light and heavy, plus the charge bar) don't give you the exhilarating, mindless slashing satisfaction found in games like God of War because there's no defense, and you constantly have to watch out for running out of energy and sudden counterattacks from enemies. The whole combat system feels pieced together and lacks a cohesive system. For example, Sekiro has parrying and deflecting, Dark Souls has weapon choices and dodging to exploit boss weaknesses, and God of War or Devil May Cry offer thrilling slaughter. Although Black Myth: Wukong has two transformation systems, choosing the wrong spell or transformation can be highly frustrating, and using a transformation at the wrong time might just get you comboed by an enemy, leaving you to either dodge or take hits, ending up transforming for nothing. Overall, I find this combat system mediocre at best; it tries to have its own thing but ultimately falls short.Lastly, the storyline. I believe that any player who wants to complete this game will inevitably reach the current Bad Ending, which feels like it's forcibly fed to the players, even if you could argue there are multiple endings and playthroughs. Compared to Sekiro, where even if you choose the Bad Ending, it follows the player's own logic; or like in Cyberpunk 2077, where you're clearly informed before starting a mission that could lead to an irreversible path, allowing players to decide if they want to pursue side quests for a Happy Ending. But in Black Myth, you're bound to get the Bad Ending, which I think is the scriptwriters forcing their ""interesting"" narrative on players. Please, not everyone wants to play a 20-30 hour game, or even longer, just to see this ending, and then be told, ""Play it again with almost the same content, and then you can experience the good ending—yay!"" WTF? Moreover, the content of chapters four and five is already set in stone. The game's PV talks about being adapted from Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West, and the game's title is Wukong, yet most of the time, you're not even playing as Wukong. Not to mention, comparing the PV from a few years ago to now, there's also a slight suspicion of deception.In conclusion, I don't really recommend this game. I think the money could be better spent on other AAA ARPGs or Soul-likes for a better gaming experience."
Negative,just too difficutl for an old man
Negative,Fuck this game and its stupid unfair bosses. Go try beat scorpion boss without cheats or cheese
Negative,"Pre-release was very excited about the game, had the pleasure of going through with the opening sequence had a lot of fun, amazing ambiance fighting etc. Then came the unpleasant surprise of bugs (bosses suddenly stopping moving, straight up ignoring you and keeping on walking around aimlessly even though you are in the boss arena basically hitting it's legs, huge bummer). Okay, it can happen it is early stages of release. Benefit of the doubt, i will just go away and come back later for the game. I finally decide to come back after over a month of release seeing new patches about ""fixing"" stuff. Now the game can not even be launched. 60 dolars for a game that does not improve on it but digresses. If you are working a regular 8-5 job expecting to get home have a gaming session on this, skip ahead. You never know when you need to aimlessly look for ways to fix this, not encounter that, how to improve your frame rates etc. when it is clearly supposed to be handled by the 60 dolar charging devs. Game announced years before release, finally releases and somehow i am still unable to play it having it for 2 months. Thank you for my 3 hour play time with possibly 3 more on wasting how to ""unstuck"" a boss and an extra few on ""how to solve the launch problem on wukong"" with no solution on a users end."
Negative,"While the game is undeniably beautiful, the combat system is among the clunkiest I've ever experienced: Dodging feels unresponsive, and the heavy attacks come with a frustratingly looong wind-up (you have to press the button many seconds before you actually want it to connect, and you can't cancel it once started). Exploration is hindered by an overabundance of invisible walls, making the world feel more like a series of restrictive corridors rather than an open, immersive environment. The lack of a minimap option only adds to the frustration.The basic combo takes a long time to finish and, again, you can't always cancel it by dodging: many times you will see the enemy preparing his attack animation and there will be nothing you can do besides taking the hit.Also, the game rewards failure: you keep the experience points gained between the save point and the boss fights even if you lose. This mechanic takes away the sense of achievement from victory, making success feel less earned and more like it’s handed to you.I will give this game another shot in the future but, overall, I found this game design to be disappointing."
Negative,"Seriously overrated. There is a boss fight every 3 minutes and gets ridiculously hard. I play games to enjoy, not to get frustrated. Story is weak"
Negative,Have not seen a game with worse game design. What a fucking waste.
Negative,you can't even play with a logitech controler this 2$ company is not good enough to make their game compatible with more than 2 different controler
Negative,"Its a very impressive game with great graphics, i just hated the attack moveset of the character, to much flourish that sometimes you cant cancel and you get hit. Also there is no guard/block mechanic only dodge, a semi parry mechanic with the staff that most of the time you get punished while using it and a parry with cooldown. The magics are really great but need some tuning. Too small i-frames when dodging. last thing that i hated was the cadence of bosses, it was like a gauntlet one after the other."
Negative,Trash game just dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge hit dodge dodge dodge dodge hit trash fighting experience do not recommend to buy this trash game. You can't enjoy the story because you repeat the same fight at least 7-8 time AT LEAST
Negative,sh1t boss design sh1t level design
Negative,no easy mode. game too difficult
Negative,"While it's graphically impressive and the action on screen can be cool, the game is just a mindless spam of the attack button with no combos or any thought involved besides a couple abilities.The story is also incomprehensible as it throws names and characters talking about random shit at you all the time. The skill trees are all boring passive stuff.The exploration is a chore since you have no map and some areas are pretty big while all looking the same.The only redeeming part are the bosses which are a lot and they are all pretty unique."
Negative,"This is the hardest game I've ever forced myself to endure. It is a total waste of time. It's linear, you don't make a character, you don't choose a weapon or playstyle, you don't alter the story. (The story doesn't make any sense, either. Everyone is hostile for absolutely no reason and you're literally teleported to random locations with no context.)The bosses are all cheating, all the time. They can turn and hit you in a fraction of a second during their attack animations no matter where you are, they have unlimited stamina, and insane HP bars. Just remember all the worst parts of any souls like game, and you will find it here. The egregious example: You must use light attack combos (cringe) which lock you into a multi hit animation (cringe) and then the boss can suddenly decide to give itself hyper armor AT ANY TIME to ignore your attack (cringe) and then instantly stun lock you with his own attacks (cringe).Elden Ring is far easier and more rewarding."
Negative,"the game sucks besides the graphics NOTHING is really good the world is empty there is no guide where to go what to do, boss kills you 2 shot, combat is bad and clunky, do NOT buy this crap. it wasnt supposed to be a soul like game it was supposed to be a god of war like game but yet its harder than souls and there is no difficulty to adjust i just wasted 60 euros. NEVER buy before you try!"
Negative,"I genuinely do not like this game. I tried to give it a chance.List of things that irritate me:- Terrible camera, Souls games already have bad cameras but Wukong is laughably bad.- Bosses going outside the arena, you can't hit them but the can ranged attack you.- Questionable dodge/I-frames windows- Healing animation is slow- Heavy attack mechanic. Can be stuck in a 2-3 second animation if you don't do it right. Very awkward.- Input queue is awful/broken. In a good souls game, the game will take into account what button you press while performing an action/attack to then perform that action/attack after the current one finishes. In Wukong, this affected me the most when trying to heal. Most of the time it wouldn't heal or it would heal twice from me just trying to actually get the heal to work. This also would affect chaining together combo's. Trying to jump attack after a few normal attacks, it would just drop the input for jumping all together and do nothing.- Fast travel is pretty bad. A good fast travel system will show a recognizable image of the area you are looking for so you know where you want to go. Wukong does not do this. It's just a random picture of bushes, trees or rocks. Monotonous. - Level design is bad and full of invisible walls. Basically 1 or 2 ""rooms/areas"", a few scattered enemies and you're at another boss. Zero effort given.- When hitting enemies with the staff it is very unsatisfying. Feels like running around with a pool noodle.- A lot of useless abilities/perks/traits. Quantity of quality.- Hearing you character yip or whine after getting hit gets annoying. Sounds like a chihuahua. His voice on the whole is grating on the ears.- No idea about the story, after a couple hours I gave up. No interest in it.Might go through Stellar Blade or Lies of P again to cleanse my pallet of this low effort souls-like. I would refund but can't do to my play time. I tried giving it time for it to get better but it turned into a chore and not at all fun to play. I'm taking the L and moving on."
Negative,"Thank you early access gamers for playing the game on release!We've got a whole bunch of features for you:- Ultimate 2024 performance - Ultra realistic hair physics, that's all. Particles from our character models floating all around the area? That's fine. Literally unplayable on SteamDeck. 23FPS and huge input lags. Want to switch to PC? High-end PCs are getting crashes and lags like hell. Somehow I received worse and worse experience with every start-up.- Great experience for re-runs - you've managed to almost beat a pretty nasty boss with first try? Nope, sorry, get a crash, try once more for free. Or you managed to own that mini-boss? Nevermind, he'll fall through textures and we will respawn him fully restored. - Probably the worst level-design through most of the Action-RPG for last 10 years. Welcome to 2004. Invisible walls! We created our levels without no such things as game-design knowledge, visual markers and basic sense of logic. See that rock over there? Can't go there. You see some narrow path down that hill? Nope, not this time. We want you to get the full experience of exploration, well at least that exploration that we didn't limit. But I must admit that boss arenas are gorgeous. Boss patterns are also interesting. - Great UI - our UI\UX designers made sure that you'll endure full journey to the west to Google to translate chinese status effects. But we spared you sometime and just drew few statuses with no explanation elsewhere, what is it? Dunno, try to google it"
Negative,"As of August 25th I can't play the game I purchased. Because of Shader Compilation issues, as soon as I try and travel game boots to desktop. I fought a secret boss Golden Wight, as soon as I beat the boss, the game goes to cutscene and boots me to desktop. I've fought this boss 3X now and each time the samething happened. I am very frustrated I purchased the Deluxe Edition and can't play the game!!!"
Negative,"Listening to the monkey's screams throughout the game is torture. The game felt boring, with its corridor-like locations and lack of world exploration. The graphics didn’t impress me either; in some places, even Skyrim with mods looks better."
Negative,I think this is a bad game in that it doesn't allow changing the difficulty levels. Everyone plays games for different reasons and I want to play these games to experience the story. I don't have the time to keep grounding away at bosses or looking at the optimal ability builds for each boss. This isn't a game for me.
Negative,"my sun-damaged, wrinkled grandmother of 86, who's in a wheelchair, runs and looks better than this game."
Negative,"As some others have mentioned, the game crashes in the opening cutscene on a 7900 XT. I'm sure it's great on an Nvidia GPU."
Negative,It's literally a souls game that is being intentionally marketed as not a souls game. No thanks.
Negative,1. The game is not open world.2. The story telling is very sparse and infrequent.3. The fur on all animals looks weird and unrealistic.
Negative,Way too difficult for players who just want to enjoy the gameplay and the graphics. Really takes the fun out of this game. They should have a difficulty setting
Negative,Truly some of the worst boss battles ever lol do not waste money unless you enjoy wasting hours on a single boss
Negative,Only reccomend this game if you can play 6hrs a day to learn a bosses 30 moves. Some of us have families and cant sit on a video game all day. tHATS WHY dark souls will always be better. At leasy you can  summon. Im just pissed i wasted money on this. Garbage game just like most these days. Luck to find one gaem a year thats good. I will stick to base building games 3/10
Negative,"Well... where to begin.Maybe first of all - if I did not get it for free with my new notebook, I would not buy it.It is beautifl, amazing game - when talking about graphics. Story and gameplay, that is... questionable.So I would give it 4/10 stars. I am sad actually, because it started amazing and more I played, more bored I got."
Negative,"A boss rush game that punishes you for playing dynamically because of its poorly thought combat animations. The kind of boss rush gameplay is very cool, but the level design between each boss fight lacks a lot. A lot of invisible walls are used instead of making the environnement intuitive to the player.The worst point of the game is obviously the poor choice of combat designs. The fact that our character have long/slow attack animations that are, most of the time, not cancelable against quick bosses kills the fun. The game basically punish you for playing well with its timing counters. The timing counters are so slow and some bosses so quick that you take free damages while doing the counter attacks animations (big up to skyfall stryke, an attack supposed to be a very good reward after countering an ennemy attack, but ends up getting canceled by the tiger vanguard boss and is responsible for multiple of my deaths on others)In the end, I stop to struggle and first time bosses when I use a more cowardly play style which I repeat, kills the fun."
Negative,I have skill issues
Negative,Biggest waste of money.
Negative,THIS GAME IS TOO EASY WAY OVER HYPED AND NOT HARD AT ALL JUST GET GOOD YOU ALL SUCK SO BAD AT THIS GAMES ITS CRAZY!!!
Negative,The game has some major flaws in the level design where it wants you to explore but also there are invisible walls everywhere and no minimap.The combat also never evolve beyond your initial combo and the bosses get more and more frustrating to deal with as the chapter go on. I do not recommend this game.
Negative,"So  far hugely dissapointed in the game-play itself, I feel it's crucial at the beginning of the game to know what you're doing, as this is when you decide whether you like it or not, and whether you're going to continue playing it. So far there are no quest markers, and it's constantly unclear what to do and where to go. Another thing is that this is an open world, yet every time i try to move away from the road, there are invisible roadblocks, which I feel is very stupid especially where you can clearly see terrain behind those invisible walls. And lastly, I am literally playing a monkey that just can't jump up pretty much anywhere... It just feels wrong having those invisible walls all around only letting you explore the path the developers intended you to explore. Other than that though the game is truly beautiful, but the above points really make it demotivating. Will try it for another while and see if it changes my mind at some point. Also note that around 90% of the players are chinese people that received the game for free, hence all the glowing reviews :D"
Negative,"The game doesn't run well, I can play most games but this one is super slow and not optimized. Game play got boring pretty fast. I really wanted to like this game but the experience playing it was too buggy and slowdown points, game is also very large and took a while to download. The voice acting is SUPER bad. Like really cringe and annoying. It is like watching a soap opera from the 90's...really hard to get into and distracting. Ultimately I returned the game. 3/10"
Negative,"Well i didnt like the game : and that is my personal opinionIt is just senseless battle without any story progression. Just one boss after another and none of them making any sense. Well i like story rich games so probaly it is my fault that i bought this one without understanding the soul like structure of it It is just too much grinding and just too much battle all the time. Well i know i will be booed, but then this is my personal opinion"
Negative,No difficulty setting. I haven't got time to grind every boss multiple times to work out their sequence so i can beat them. If you pay 50 quid for a game you should get to chose how hard it is for you and not have it imposed on you by the devs.
Negative,"Worst game I've ever played. Buggy bosses, clunky fighting, terrible dev team. Hitboxes are dookie, moves are boring, bosses are cheaters. All positive reviews are from Chinese bots. Feng Li is a rat."
Negative,dont play this monkey game it nothing like gorilla tag
Negative,Boss je velicine kao planina a hitboks kao moje levo jaje. 60 € a vredi 20 € I hope it won't be game of the year. Asian rubbish like other things.
Negative,COVID-19 ISOLATION TAIWAN IS A REAL COUNTRY FEMINISM PROPOGANDA
Negative,its just crashing
Negative,serious concerns about developer morals.

Negative,"Tldr; The story and world are great, the combat is not so much. I won't focus on graphics and stuff outside of gameplay, because it what powered me to get as far as I did, it's 10/10. Aside from wishing it had an in-game encyclopedia for me to understand the story it's inspired by (Journey to the West) without having to close the game and search what some of the words mean. The game doesn't punish you for dying, you can infinitely re-roll skills.To sum up how it feels compared to most souls-likes, if your a souls god and you want a great story, then this really is a game for you. If you kinda push through all the souls games, think DS2 DLC as the whole game.I just can't say that the gameplay is satisfying when the genre it's inspired from feels better. Your character gets staggered from most attacks, while enemies having no reaction to most hits outside of heavy or charged heavy, feels generally unenjoyable. BM:W is a boss rush in many ways, and in the beginning a very fast paced boss run that each boss has unique mechanics that are well crafted. As the game carries on, it becomes more tedium of punishment, with less satisfaction. If you are interrupted during the start of one of your skills/magic, consider it wasted. If you wiff a focus attack, you lose those points If you fail a stagger, it's 50/50 if it keeps that stagger break buildup. That would be ok, but most bosses are basically anime (teleports, backsteps after their heavy, and alot of i-frames) and will ruin alot of punishment windows, making some fights just a frustrating back and forth, and rarely is time on your side in the game. With each attack of theirs a heavy punishment, either health or being staggered, it's a frustrating risk/reward with less reward.There technically is a counter attack, but you are expected to perfect dodge all attacks as your way to build focus to punish, there is no parry system.Your light attacks don't feel like they have weight, and the game incentives charged heavy, which slow it down. What it ultimately becomes, is charged heavy attacks between normal mobs, (slow and unfun) and then throwing your self at bosses. Item discovery is usually not something game changing in BM:W, which makes it feel like you should just pull up a wiki for the good stuff, which is also, not really fun.The level design is basically on rails. You are expected to not really explore that often, and invisible walls are everywhere. Sometimes you can't jump to your death trying to explore, other times you can. The game has normal enemies, but I can't emphasize enough that unlike most souls-likes, exploration is generally far more linear to lead the player to the next boss encounter.Overall, if you had a choice between 3 weapons in the Souls series, and the only reward from bosses was a slight damage boost, and occasionally a small variation to your playstyle, that would be the BM:W experience. For me, it's not enough to push through. If I had more personal time to spend an hour mastering every boss, I would probably feel different, but as it stands it's a 6/10 because of how unfun the gameplay loop breaks down to. Never thought I'd say that a game needs a pinwheel here and there."
Negative,"This game sucks, the register of buttons pressed to actual reaction in the game is garbage.  The enemies you face in the current chapter or previous chapters that you were in are over-powered, regardless of what gear or setup you run.  The dodging, sprinting and range of striking is completely horrendous, you miss 80% of the attacks you make."
Negative,"6/10. Fucking overrated shit!Update:5/10. Stupid level design, invisible wall breaking immersive, confusing road but no map, have no landscape to mark a location, annoy boss design, level and upgrade system use the same currency but auto level up...The amount of ripping off of good ideas but poorly executed in this game is humongous.I have a list of better games: Ninja Gaiden, Onimusha, Niohs, DMCs, GOWs, lies of P, Wolong, Ghost of Tsushima, soulbornes, Darksiders...Literally every fucking decent where devs have a clear concept about what type of game they're making is better. Fucking wasted of monney!Update!4/10Overuse mid combat animation break the flow of the battle and fucking meaningless waste of time!"
Negative,"All Souls games are better tbh, this game is very hard also but in really cheap ways....just so stupid. Genuinely wanted to have more fun from this game, but the way the game is made it's like the developers solely wanted to piss off players than let them have a good time lmao. Will be telling people to just avoid this game LMAO"
Negative,crashes as soon as it launches...tried in compatibility mode same thing
Negative,"Honestly, its just way too hard and the combat diversity in terms of defense just aint it. Dodge. Thats it. Want a sword? too bad. staff. Want a shield? Nah. Dodge instead. I dont see the diversity up front.  People describe this as souls like. Why? because its hard? I dont see it. Kinda bummed as I'd hoped to push on into a new world."
Negative,"good game at the start, mechanics are fresh and solid and overall good gameplay but dropped it at chapter 4 the game has a literally untouchable boss Yellow brow, he can solid himself you cant hit him and he can one tap you and also have a hit that you simply cant dodge and just goes through the cutscene with less health afterHOW THE FUCK THIS IS FAIR ? THIS NOT A HARD BOSS AND IM JUST NAGGING NO THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE"
Negative,"The game isn't entirely bad, but it is lacking polish in various ways. At the time of this writing, I am in the middle of chapter 4 of this game.a) Optimization is pretty bad. Game is very hardware demanding for how it looks.b) Unclear progression at times: for one, the pathways aren't really clear sometimes. Feels like running around aimlessly until you get to the right spot, which is boring and not really engaging. The sidequest in the 2nd chapter was really bad as well with not real indication on where I had to go - had to check a guide for that one. Another thing: I fought a boss called Non-White in chapter 3. During the fight around 50%, I happened to fall off the venue to a lower place which somehow halted the boss fight. When I returned, that battle was kinda skipped. I did find him later on and beat him - it just didn't feel as if this was supposed to happen this way...To put it differently: the game sometimes feels a bit loose.c) Gameplay: you do not have much options in how you approach this game. The only defensive mechanic you do have is dodging. There is no blocking, no real parrying. The lack of options feels quite stifling. Especially given this game being on the harder side of games without any possibility to tone it down a little.I find this game to be much more difficult than any of the Souls games. And if purely dodging isn't your usual cup of tea for this type of genre, this game is gonna suck for you. Compared to Souls games or Stellar Blade, where you are able to guard and parry stuff, as well as dodge stuff, Wukong's gameplay doesn't quite hold up to those games imo. Your offense game is very limited as well. You do not have many options in terms of combos or whatever.d) Story: the intro is amazing. The scenes between chapters are awesome. But during the chapters there is a whole lot of nothing story-wise. The side characters in chapter 3 and 4 so far have been great though. There is also a letdown in the main character: during the intro, Wukong is pretty cool in dialogue and demeanor. When the true game starts though in chapter 1 and onwards, your character is mute, lacking any sort of personality. So the character you're playing is pretty much a blank slate - which is a letdown after that intro.Again, the game is not entirely bad. But it is not quite good enough to just enjoy universal praise. It definitely has its flaws and I'm sure with coming games this studio will be able to do better. It's good to have another possible source out there for good games these days. For this one though, do check it out elsewhere before you buy it - the difficulty is relentless and the way you play it is predetermined, lacking any alternative options to get through it. You might not like what you bargained for with this one."
Negative,"Imagine, if you will, that you’ve had a long day. You’ve slogged through meetings, emails, and the general bore that is adulthood. So you get home, crack open a cold one, sit yourself down in front of what should be a beautiful escape—this game—only to find it’s about as relaxing as being slapped in the face with a wet fish while someone screams at you to “git gud.”Now don’t get me wrong, it looks fantastic. Gorgeous, even. And there’s a story here somewhere—probably. But here’s the rub: it’s so f*cking difficult that any chance of actually enjoying it vanishes quicker than a wet fart on a long car ride. There is no option to adjust the difficulty. None. What kind of sadist thought that was a good idea?Now, before you accuse me of being some sort of gaming amateur, let me clarify. I’m not half bad. I can hold my own, I don’t panic-mash buttons like a toddler on Red Bull. I know my way around a Souls-like game. I’ve tangoed with Elden Ring, and yes, I came out the other side—bruised but alive. But this… this is like being dropped into a washing machine set to “violent spin cycle”.Five hours in and I’m stuck at some man-lizard. Yes, you heard that right—a lizard. Some soggy reptilian monstrosity that I’ve been pounding my head against for what feels like days. And when I finally do defeat this oversized garden pest, there’s no rush of victory. No, no. It’s more akin to the feeling of squeezing out a particularly stubborn constipated turd that's been brewing for days after a dodgy curry. You don’t feel triumphant. You just feel relieved that the misery has ended.And then—then—you begin to dread what’s next. What fresh torment awaits just around the corner, ready to batter you senseless while you sit there wondering why you ever thought this was a good idea in the first place. I’m bored, I’m frustrated, and above all, I’m angry. Angry at the developers for not giving us a difficulty slider, and angry at myself for stubbornly sticking with it, thinking “surely, surely the next boss won’t be as bad.”But of course, it is. Of course, it bloody is. This game could’ve been a masterpiece. It could’ve been the perfect hybrid of Elden Ring and God of War—a balance of challenge and enjoyment. Instead, it’s like being repeatedly punched in the face by someone who insists it’s “for your own good.” So here’s my advice: if you, like me, want to unwind with a game that has a bit of challenge but still allows you to sleep soundly at night, don’t touch this. Save yourself, your sanity, and your poor wife’s eardrums. Play something else.EDIT: I beat the stupid lizard. I played for another excruciating three hours, pummelled a few more bosses, and guess what? The experience was as enjoyable as licking a car battery. Eight hours in, and I’ve uninstalled the game. Tonight, I’ll crawl into bed, poorer, angrier, and questioning all my life choices."
Negative,"You know how they say, ""Don't judge a book by its cover""? Well, I did.I bought it, hoping it would fill the void Elden Ring left inside me, but it couldn’t.It's not open-world, the combat feels boring and repetitive, and it's very limited compared to Elden Ring. Whoever compared this to Elden Ring, take that back... or ill kith you"
Negative,"Its okay. If there was a neutral recommendation id give it that. Unfortunately this game wasn't what i hoped it would be. Its boss fight after boss fight after boss fight, very little in between combat or exploring. Wish there was abit more open world aspect to it like Elden Ring if there's going to be this much bossing and not ""follow this heavily restricted path"". Graphics are amazing, the story telling is great, unfortunately the game does get repetitive quickly."
Negative,"I am not much of a twitch gamer. I have played Eldon Ring. This game is by far the hardest game I have ever played. Beautiful game, just difficult. I have ran out of talent. I have fought the white clad noble a 100 times. I have better things to do than fight something I can not beat so $60 down the drain........I won't be buying another title from these guys. Good luck if you do purchase."
Negative,does not support PS5 Controller
Negative,Game keep crashing after prologue even after setting lowest graphics and frame rate
Negative,I don't like this game.
Negative,Camera during Kang Jin-Loong fight is completely dogshit.
Negative,chinese knock off of elden ring. save your money
Negative,"No maps. No quests. Hard to know what to do. Gets better in Chapter 3, but finished in 20 hours. Not worth the $60."
Negative,Can someone help me understand what's there to like about this game?
Negative,"All those 100k reviews musta been chinese bots or something. cant run the game without frame generation, even if its on it looks like dookie and runs at 50 with a AMD RX 6660 at lowestofc the game stutters too all the timelooks the same as elden ring or pretty much anyother game when its set to medium, and i cant go above medium and have decent fps :/"
Negative,"The game does not support HDR which in 2024 for an AAA title is simply unacceptable. Additionally the black level is off, so everything looks grey and washed out. I would recommend waiting until the game gets a proper HDR10 upgrade before playing."
Negative,This game has NO MAP. Wastes tons of time running g you around in circles. No resource to find npcs.  Hardly any weapons or armor in the beginning. Great getting lost in the woods with a stick simulator. Why is there no map????!!!! I wish i could refund this point it feels like an unfinished game but alas I've played 20 hours trying to like it.
Negative,"I was so hyped for this game and wanted to play it. Unfortunately the ridiculous system requirements for the game, to look even playable are ridiculous. As long as my PC is not ""NASA"" grade, i have to play games mostly on LOW or MEDIUM graphic settings. If you cant ""ULTRA"" this game, it look like game from 1994, everything is bricked, the surounding look super bad, models are ugly and it is simply not worth to play. Not even talk about crashing after tutorial while in loading screen just to realize, you have to repeat the tutorial, coz there is not skip button for it... This game might be great, but i still choose Elden Ring anytime, since even if you play that game on LOW or MEDIUM, the game still looks great... You cant say that about this game. Just keep it in mind before buying."
Negative,Pros:-Looks beautiful a lot of detail into the environment.-Enemies seem fairly unique and diverse.Cons:-Actual gameplay is subpar at best.-Advertised as a souls like game but is absolutely not one.-0 thought put into boss mechanics 80% are braindead and will just stand there and get beat to death the other 20% whip around the tiny boss arena to the point the camera can't keep up. Half there movesets will be off screen so there is no ability to read and react to the move.-No mechanics to alter the way you fight other than beat bad guy with stick in the exact same 5 move combo which it gets boring quick not to mention provides no versatility to the way you can play.Overall it is a beautiful game but making beautiful turd is still a turd.
Negative,mobile game looking ahh
Negative,Never liked this genre game. Also not this one. Always get lured in by graphics and design.Gonna finish the darn game anyway.
Negative,Elden ring better
Negative,gameplay and visuals were terrible.
Negative,"The game is too hard. Graphics are indeed beautiful but the game story is very weak. It's all about fighting and it's not the kind of game that i am looking for. The main gameplay of this game is old fashioned fighting and is too tired to play for casual players. Not everyone wanna spend two hours on one single boss and it's ridiculous that there is not a difficulty setting. Some might say it's already been a 'easy' game of this type, but not for average human."
Negative,Huge performance issues and it doesn't even look that great.  Lots of fuzzy looking stuff despite having everything set to cinematic.   The game keeps crashing without a reason.  Maybe if it goes on sale in the next year I will pick it up.  Just can't see paying $60 for a game that crashes so often.
Negative,"Game was great, awesome mechanics, challenging but not undoable. However, I took a trip and came back and seems as though they've changed the mechanics of some of the items, and while it may not be an issue most of the time, its changed how the game is played, and its not the game that I originally bought. I might play it again if they switch things back.BRING BACK TURTLE TEAR TRUE POWER"
Negative,"it's ok, maybe on sale."
Negative,"worst game ever, still farming level 43 chapter one, can't beat Whiteclad noble"
Negative,it is too hard not for me there should be difficent level where we can pick our level
Negative,Never quit a game before only after a few hoursYou cant even enjoy the game after dying so many times!
Negative,I HAD FUN UNTIL I ENCOUNTERED SHITTY BOSSESS THAT RUINED THE GAME AND BECAME MORE LIKE SOULSLIKE GAME A MUD BATTLEFIELD????? WHO IS THE DUMB THAT THOUGHT OF THAT IDEA!!
Negative,"SHIT GAME, REFUNDED!"
Negative,"Pros:- Looks great from a technical point of view- Solid combat systemCons:- Incredibly repetitive, what's the point of having that many bosses if they all feel the same?- no story- bored after 15h, I feel like this game can't give me anything original"
Negative,"The traditional architecture in the game is incredibly accurate and beautiful. I also love the variety of monster designs. However, the storyline is quite disappointing and illogical. For anyone interested in the game and hoping to learn a bit about Chinese mythology, this is unfortunately one of the weakest plots I’ve encountered. The character of Wukong is portrayed as someone who seeks his own survival by killing his girlfriend three times and destroying his hometown, only to end up complaining about how the world mistreats him. It's a portrayal that feels far too low for such a legendary figure."
Negative,"there are no difficult option, the game is too hard and it's not open world, which is force you to fight vs HARD bosses and you can't do anything about it, there are no map and i get lost and start walking in cycles , game play is great and fighting , but the bosses are more that normal NPC's for some reason, i love this game but this game trying to mix between God or war and elden ring which is not good and confusing, there are enemy in top of building that you can't reach and the only thing you can't do dodge or fight the npc's in the ground while trying to dodge the bow's enemy"
Negative,"I found this game a hard slog. The trash mobs are beyond easy and more like annoying scenery, briefly cluttering the way from one boss to the next. The journey between bosses is pretty, linear and very very brief. I spent most of this game replaying the short trip to a frustrating boss fight, over and over and over again. The controls are not PC friendly without a lot tinkering and I never got used to the ability lag or the strange way the bosses behave and when I did finally kill some it was on to another frustration-pump of a boss with no real reward. Because I took more time than I should have to move from the first bosses and get a feel for what this is, I could not get a refund, don't make my mistake."
Negative,"I finished the game and more or less enjoyed it. Things I liked was graphics, art and a some of the fighting. Unfortunately I felt like a lot of the content sort of passed me by and perhaps if I grew up with Chinese folklore I would have appreciated the game a lot more.Now the bad.. I really don't like soulslike games I realised. It feels less stressful than Sekiro but nonetheless being penalised for failed attempts is still very much part of the game. You drink a potion and if you still died, you lost it, that's it, face the boss again but in a worse position. Sometimes you have to run for a long time after dying through identical content just to die again at the very end. But if you like the challenge and facing same boss 20 times, maybe it's for you. I do consider myself pretty good at games having played since I was a kid. Good luck to those who are just starting.. And by the way, there is no map, so get ready to run a lot and learn the surroundings."
Negative,"A game that starts off amazing but slowly and increasingly overstays its welcome with obtuse areas and overlong maps that feel like they never end. By the third chapter most of your abilities (even fully upgraded) feel like its a 50/50 chance they actually work against enemies, while the core combat (strong attacks) are completely useless against some of the worst hitboxes I've ever fought against. Maybe I'm playing the game wrong or using a bad build but by the end of chapter three I feel like i'm dragging myself through the rest of the game. Most spectacle fights feel like they're designed to have you running across an arena 50% of the time. Genuinely disappointed."
Negative,black myth pookong
Negative,Anyone else having issues with the shader cashing not downloading completely?
Negative,I was expecting something different since this was so hyped. After 4 hours of gameplay it it seems like a cheap copy of Wo Long : Fallen Dynasty. If you guys played Wo Long will understand what im talking about. Not suggested.
Negative,I swear i fought 3 bosses in 90 minutes gameplay and then the next 2 and a half hours i spent fighting the same damn stupid boss what were they thinking when they made this do they even comprehend what a learning curve is these people made potentially the most ok mid and borderline fine souls like ever concieved
Negative,"Despite looking nice, the mechanics of the game make it difficult in artificial and primitive ways. Bosses have combos you cannot defend against until you unlock skills, which unlock after going through the same area 10 times. You can tell it's copied without original thought."
Negative,"I really wanted to love this, but I just cant recommend it sadly.The presentation is beautiful, and combat feels solid enough (albeit with some rather frustrating input lag here and there).It all just feels so incredibly linear, there is literally zero exploration, it's been pretty much just a straight line so far. I wanted a world to explore and lore to uncover, and this game is rather lacking in both departments, It all feels very ""A to B"". For example, fight a boss in the Bamboo Forest, defeat him, follow the path and within around 5 minutes, and a single mob later, you're fighting another boss.The game is desperately trying to mimic Fromsoft titles like Dark Souls and Elden Ring, but unfortunately, does not measure up to any of them."
Negative,"Great concept, key control very inconsistent. If you would love to see great scenery of china go ahead. Actually fighting mechanism is quite inconsistent. Not fun"
Negative,I am a casual player and the game has no options to toggle difficulty level which itself limits my enjoyment of the game. I just want to enjoy the story line but cannot progress. Shucks.
Negative,"This game has received an overwhelming number of reviews due to the Chinese ""human wave"" tactic. In reality, the game isn't that exceptional. It's not bad, of course, but it's just average."
Negative,"This game is as bland as it can get. Once you get past the eye candy, the game is dull as you do the same combo over and over and over for 40 plus hours, nah I'm all set. Once this is $20 I'll jump back in."
Negative,"Yet another game that seems to impress only with graphics, while the graphics aren't even implemented that well. Furthermore, there is only barely a story to none, and the playable characters are either annoying or not memorable. Overall, the whole game feels somewhat like a soulless clone from Sekiro: Shadows Die Tiwce to me. The combat, however, is much worse in my opinion since it doesn't offer much at its very fundament. Basically, you just spam dodging and light attacks, that's it. You could say a game consists out of story, gameplay, and its graphics, to not go into detail too much. The first two don't feel authentic at all, while the last is definitely not worth the money. There is a saying - ""Life might be a shitty game, but it has the best graphics."". So, instead of wasting money and time on Black Myth: Wukong, rather go outside and touch some grass. Maybe even go on a date with a girl you like. The saved amount should be sufficient to spend a nice time with her."
Negative,"Per usual, Chinese corporations take the innovations of others, and use them to produce something in their own name.  This game has so many copied elements from games like Dark Souls/Elden Ring, Nioh 2, Ghost of Tsushima, and God of War, from the item systems, to the button layout.  Sadly, they don't improve on any of these styles, or even really attribute the other games' philosophies into a product that feels well thought out.  The environments can look great at first glance, but if you keep looking, you'll see some lazy ass work with glaring white lines between the ground textures, along with auto jumping when you sprint up a flight of uniform stairs.  The combat is almost acceptable, in that some of the ideas of magic and transformation is awesome, but then there are the glaring issues of horrible input response, and then having your character able to attack with no stamina, but he can not dodge, meaning you HAVE to keep an eye on the tiny yellow bar in the bottom left corner while trying to fight someone.  Terrible, awful game design choices that don't make much sense in theory or practice.  Unless you're trying to artificially inflate the difficulty of the game, which is how this game IS marketed.  Terribly boring and easy lesser characters, differing difficulties for the bosses.  Designs are cool, voice acting (in English) is awkward sounding, and you'll hear a lot of minions say the same stuff over and over.Game performance is really odd.  Sometimes smooth, but even small adjustments with the UI make the game stutter, and that shouldn't be happening (3090ti, i7-11700, 32gb ram).  I noticed I can cause a stuttering by simply pressing the R2 trigger button repeatedly (the item and spell trigger), which is sad cause it's tied to the magic system in mid-combat.  And then the camera...that's gotta' be the hardest boss in the game.Enemy AI is bad.  You can get enemies ""caught"" behind a log, and have them run indefinitely towards you in place.  Some enemies will just stand there and look at you and let you kill them.  Enemies in this game won't outsmart you, but they will overpower you, which is how they balance the game..Some of the textures in the game look great, and most look awful.  It's jarring seeing a fell tree in a forest and legit mistaking it for a slimy turd, given some things look overly ""wet"", or don't blend with the lighting, looking like an MS paint image applied to a plane as a part of some rocky mountain debris.I'm still going to play through this game, as I do enjoy it.  But I feel let down that something that takes up 130 gigs and can't be bothered to render the ""breathtaking and distinctive landscapes"" in a way that can do this game and story justice.  I feel let down that something that is going to represent a breakthrough in AAA gaming for China is so unpolished.  I've only played for 2 and a half hours and I'm immediately bummed that a game of this ""caliber"" has white bars on the map grounds, making that mountainy forest you're venturing through look like a square, metered subdivision.Something else that bugs me is marketing this as an RPG.  You don't get to build a character, or divvy out minor stat points,  there are no choices you make that set the story in stone.  The closest thing resembling an RPG here is that you can put points into certain skills and abilities, but there's no cap or limit to this.  It's the same thing as Ghost of Tsushima, or Assassins Creed, or any other third-person melee combat game (none of which are an RPG).  Meaning you'll have every spell and skill eventually, so build variety is only while your character levels throughout the game.

Negative,"What is a good game? Elden Ring is truly a good game, with good details, graphics, gameplay, physics, environment, and other aspects. Instead of being extremely perfunctory and cutting corners in terms of design other than graphics, as in Black Myth, which was released many years later than Elden Ring, the physics design of Black Myth is seriously flawed. Look at the weight sensation of fragments splashing after the building jar is broken in Black Myth, which is obviously wrong. Moreover, as an action game, Black Myth does not have any special attack actions, such as backstabbing sneak attacks, executions, or timely blocking counterattacks. It only has a perfunctory skill design to replace counterattacks, and there is no timely calculation of combat scenes like the God of War. There is also no special combat screen that requires timely response and input of special buttons. Black Myth has no special attack actions, which is purely perfunctory. Black Mythology also has various perfunctory manifestations such as air walls and lack of architecture and indoor environment. Simply put, the design essence and concept of Black Mythology are completely focused on perfunctory and cutting corners, using a Unreal Engine 5 and then plagiarizing the action design of other games (such as a certain boss in the game completely plagiarizing the actions of a wolf crazy ape). Other aspects of design are simply done in the direction of cutting corners as much as possible, and even the optimization is too lazy to do well. As long as there is any criticism that exposes the truth about Black Myth, it relies on the navy to create rhythm, confuse right and wrong, and mislead others. In other words, the marketing of Black Myth relies not on game quality, but on the good graphics created by Unreal Engine 5 to cover up game design perfunctory and patriotic hype of the navy, and forcibly conceal the voices of exposing the truth to deceive players into purchasing. There is no other possibility. The key is that if a game is called good only based on good graphics quality without discussing other aspects of design, then all future games will be good games, because the graphics quality of future games will only be better than those of current games. Therefore, measuring the quality of a game solely based on graphics quality is purely ignorant. Furthermore, supporting low-quality games will only worsen the gaming environment, leading to an increasing number of low-quality games and a decreasing number of good games. This is because if a product can win the market solely through factors other than product quality (such as hype, appearance, etc.), who would still put in the effort to improve product quality. So only supporting games with really good quality like Elden Ring will make the gaming environment better.什么叫好游戏，艾尔登法环才叫真的好游戏，从细节到画质到玩法到物理感到环境等等各个方面都不错才叫真的好游戏。而不是像黑神话那样除了画质其他方面的设计都敷衍至极偷工减料，黑神话是一个比艾尔登法环推出时间要晚很多年的游戏，而黑神话的物理感设计居然严重错误，看下黑神话里的建筑坛子打破后碎片飞溅的重量感明显是错误的，还有黑神话作为一个动作游戏居然没有任何特殊攻击动作，没有背刺偷袭，没有处决，也没用及时格挡反击，只有个敷衍的技能设计替代反击，也没有像战神那样的及时演算战斗情景，也没有考验及时反应需要输入特殊按键的特殊战斗画面，黑神话完全没有任何特殊攻击动作纯属敷衍至极。黑神话还有空气墙和缺乏建筑和室内环境等等其他各种敷衍的体现，简单说黑神话的设计本质和理念完全就是只朝着敷衍和偷工减料的方向在设计，使用一个虚幻5然后在把其他游戏的动作设计剽窃些（比如里面某个BOSS就完全是剽窃只狼疯猿的动作），然后其他方面的设计就是怎么能敷衍就怎么做只朝着尽可能偷工减料的方向做，甚至连优化都懒得做好。只要出现任何批评黑神话曝光出真相的内容就靠水军去带节奏混淆是非误导其他人，说白了黑神话的营销靠的不是游戏品质，靠的只是虚幻5制造的好画质假象来掩饰游戏设计敷衍和水军爱国情怀炒作并且强行掩盖曝光真相的声音来忽悠玩家购买没有其他可能性。关键如果只用画质好不用谈其他方面的设计就叫好游戏，那么以后出的游戏就都是好游戏了，因为以后的游戏画质只会比现在的游戏更好，所以只以画质衡量游戏好坏纯属愚昧的体现。还有就是支持劣质游戏只会恶化游戏环境，让劣质游戏越来越多让好游戏越来越少，因为如果商品只需要靠商品质量以外的事物（比如炒作比如外表假象等等）也能赢得市场那么谁还会用心费劲去做好商品质量呢。所以只支持像艾尔登法环这样质量真的好的游戏才会让游戏环境变得更好。"
Negative,"want a button mashing game? with a want to be dark souls, edlen ring and bloodbourne. you found it. game is awful. only have it due to it being free from PC purchase otherwise dont get it. If you enjoy mashing the same attack over and over and over again with nothing happening the game for you."
Negative,"Could be a good game if it stopped crashing after the old monkey finishes his speech at the beginning. I have good specs for the game and even turned things down to medium, but I have had to repeat the same intro fight 3 times and it always crashes at the same spot after the fight is over. Maybe wait until a patch has been released before buying."
Negative,"The combat, boss fights, and graphics are all amazing, but I can't recommend a game that I didn't feel compelled to complete. I think it comes down to being forced to explore a bunch of areas that all look the same without a map, making you waste time retracing your steps constantly. Not all games need a map, but this one definitely did. The lack of an English lip-sync was also kinda weird. Anyone who says this is GOTY material is out of their mind."
Negative,glad i found out the devs were super weird before going over two hours
Negative,"This game is a very mediocre attempt at a souls-like Action RPG. It plays on dodge rolls vs all but comes with none of the blocks and parries available in souls-like. There is barely any equipment to customize your character with. Stats don't matter because you can't upgrade them anyway.The game flows from Boss to Boss in maze-like maps. There is a boss every 10 minutes. They all take over 100-1000 light attacks to defeat and kills the player in less than 5 hits. They can fly, teleport, spin, grab, and block while you can only dodge roll.If you go exploring you will find yourself at a dead end quickly or get turned around like in a maze. Maps are very clunky and small. There is no map radar to help you navigate the clunky mess.There is no story. The player is introduced to a cinematic prologue and is sent on a quest to kill as many bosses as they can. Then, when there are no more bosses left the game ends. Boss Rush simulator."
Negative,"Do not get this game, you wont make it far."
Negative,"racialist game, forces you to be a magic user and doesn't let you play as tarzan, 3/10"
Negative,"Just play a Souls game, they're better in every aspect."
Negative,bosses are too hard to beat
Negative,"Really tried to enjoy it but it's just so boring, repetitive, linear and so difficult. Impossible boss fight after impossible boss fight that really ruin it, this is not for a casual gamer at all. Maybe it gets better if you can actually progress the game but after reading other discussions on Reddit I realise I'm not alone, it just gets harder and harder and harder. I've requested a refund because I just cannot get on with it. Visually it's an absolute marvel but the level of difficulty is just too high and laborious."
Negative,"Unfair shit off screen that you have no chance of dodging. Completely unfair. Not sure why this game is so highly rated.It is no Dark Souls and no Elden Ring. At least when I die in those games, it feels like it's at least partially my fault."
Negative,I wish i could get refund from this garbage game.
Negative,"everyone seems to be highlighting its strong suites i'm going to try and highlight some of its negatives. i recommend it but there are way too many positives to filter out some grievancesso far generally speaking though i really like it. i'm only hitting negative so that if you filter that way you can see some proper criticisms but again its worth buying.  Revising this After around 30 Hours and on chapter 5 i'm deleting most of my first review to now really highlight the major issues i've found with the game at this point and i don't imagine will be fleshed out by the end of it. hit detection can be real hit or miss sometimes, especially when you transform it seems like only one part of the staff hits, however enemies auto target, hone in and follow you even in the air or while spinning on the ground. additionally almost every part of an enemy during an attack is part of the attack, even if their back foot doesn't move you'll probably take damage. enemies can be staggered but they have no indicator for this or tells really, telegraphing across the board could use a couple more passes. some enemies will launch the same attack,  identical animations but one will lock you into a cut scene, one will do chip damage one will take a 4th of your health this is especially prevalent on bosses.- This has been a major upset, some enemies have 3-4 Cutscene 75% damage hits that you just cannot avoid. its a way of circumventing difficulty with guarenteed damage and i dont think this is a good design especially used as often as it is. some you can dodge i think? but sometimes i think that the bug is i could dodge it and not the otherway around. Now Do they look cool? yes for sure but again its the amount of them used that i find the issue with and the telegraphing in general can be rough.  Exploration is very lacking to non existent, it gets better in the second chapter i'm not sure about onward but it defiantly is better there, however the invisible walls in this game are insane i've honestly never see a modern use this egregious. for a group that has designed some truly breathtaking and exciting vistas you are constantly blocked by walls. some areas you aren't, even though you'd think you would be. it makes fully exploring or uncovering secrets not that fun cause you are sorta trained to not look because everything blocks you till it doesn't? - so yes the exploration gets much much better later on, especially chapter 4 is gigantic but the issues with walls is present the entire time, and the lack of a map really combines to be problematic. the game is gorgeous without a doubt i've never seen this many art assets used in a game, some gigantic set pieces for just a statue to look at, no context, no journal entry, no boss just a beautiful piece of art. as an artist i love this but from a design standpoint at times it feels like were missing something. This though i think is more a problem with modern game design and not this game specifically. i cant stress enough this probably the first game Over 100gigs where i go ""yeah that makes sense"" it feels like nothing is reused. even down to the shrines, Each zone has its own version, its crazy they really put the work in here. but the Geography of the zones and the lack of a map do make it so that it can just be confusing and frustraiting, i wanna say the game is doing this intentionally to teach a lesson that wukong also is learning, keeping track of the enviroment, looking around, being aware but again some of the parts are just confusing. i don't want any type of Quest marker or direction, just a simple map with shapes would be totally fine. some kind of layout. but truth told if you were in his postion you probably wouldn't have one. last thing ill touch on is itemization i don't love it, i also don't quite get how its delivered. You have 4 slots. helm, gloves, chest and feet. These all have set bonuses that are for either 2,3,4 pieces so mixing is really not optimal in anyway and it seems designed for full sets. some sets designed for just a specific move. ideally this is fine but when theyre delivered is confusing to say the least. The way theyre set out is similar to like monster hunter, say like you killed a poison type monster, well now you have resistance to poison. here its like i killed a boss and he gave me a set that increases certain stats while standing in mud which the boss itself was also in mud. i have not seen mud again or before that fight, so its like a set of armor designed for a specific fight that you just did and realistically may never do again until a new game plus. i think i new game plus run of this game would be fantastic for a number of reasons but the gear feels like its only designed for a second run and not the current, you also dont get a ton of it to where it seems like you have a ton of options i probably have 7 or so sets and maybe a handful of individual pieces at chapter 5. even down to smaller items, i have a curio that gives +exp gained on kills but i didnt find this till lvl 80 in current area, sorta pointless at that point. or a boss gave a set that does poison to you but you heal from it but you are always taking chip damage the next zone it puts you in is all chip fire damage so not really incentivized to use it. it just feels very tacked on for what it could be. its nice to have and feel the upgrades and see the costume changes but it could be done so much better.again i still love the game, i highly recommend it overall but my original thoughts still stand through out the entire game. i originally said its 75%-80% near a perfect game and it is still true. The Art direction though again is so compelling, its just there really hasn't been anything like it on this scale or with this production value and i cant wait to see more from the developer. id be really curious to know the lead time on this game and if the developers are listening Please for the love of god make an art book for the game i would buy it instantly, this is one of the most inspiring parts of the game and it needs to be championed i just want concept art finished art whatever you have i want to see it."
Negative,Unplayable. Tried playing it twice and the game crashed within 10 minutes.
Negative,"The game is enjoyable for the first two chapters, then it gets tiresome and frustrating. There are a lot of bosses in this game - to the point that I would call it boss rush game. Fighting them is pretty easy, but some of them have unclear mechanics or odd hitboxes which makes the fights annoying. A main boss battle usually goes like this: you hit them for some time, then they become invulnerable while you have to dodge their ranged attacks, repeat this a few times and the boss is dead. I am not a fan of such a design, especially when every fight looks like this. Level design is poor, although the locations look good. I generally love exploring every corner of the map, but here the exploration feels bland. There isn't much of reward for it - mostly you get upgrade materials for things you aren't going to use. Even the key upgrades, like max health are so tiny that it doesn't seem worth picking them, especially given the low difficulty of the game. There are a lot of invisible walls that prevent you from going to certain places even though it may appear that an area is accessible. There is no map in this game, which is a good thing when it works, but here the level design makes it frustrating to navigate the areas, especially the open ones. From what I heard, the story is good, but as I don't know the source material I don't understand anything that happens in the game so I can't enjoy it. There is a lot of cutscenes and many of them you can't even skip.The combat is the only redeeming quality of this game. It's fun and has high skill ceiling. There are many skills you can earn to customize the way you play.I rate this game 6/10. It's a decent game, but definitely overrated."
Negative,"It's good, but it doesn't deserve 'overwhelmingly positive'. Probably won't change much, but that's why giving it a non-recommendation vote. It's technically outstanding, but it's all shine and little depth."
Negative,not enjoyable cant even enjoy the story bc its constant attacks no breaks theres no way to change difficulty and in general its just  annoying to play i rate 1/5 storys nice but thats all it has going for it
Negative,Don't see the hype around this game.
Negative,"Uber beautifull game but, it is to diffult and frustrating for me. The option set difficulty lower would be nice.For now i regret that i have bought the game."
Negative,"Looks nice, but it's mostly about twitch combat. I guess I just suck at this game. But I can't get past the first boss even after grinding for hours (on my PS5 copy) to level up."
Negative,"Desperately needs a difficulty setting, and if you choose not to add one you will just encourage players to mod the game with trainers instead. Graphics and story are very interesting though."
Negative,"trash story, bad graphics"
Negative,"rolling dodge simulator out the ass, boss fights are fucking ridiculous & broken. anyone who says they aren’t are fucking lying and I’d rather spend 60$ on GOW with great graphics & fighting instead of getting raw dogged by every boss, add a difficulty option."
Negative,"The combat system is simplified by abilities and a single combo that involves repeatedly hitting the light attack to fill a meter and unleash a powerful finisher. While this makes the game more accessible to casual players, it diminishes the depth and strategy of having a variety of combos available in such a fast-paced game."
Negative,"there is this game called world of goo 2 and oh my i have to tell you about it World of Goo 2 shines in its innovative approach to puzzle-solving. The game builds on the creative foundation of its predecessor, offering players a more refined and complex experience. It introduces new mechanics, goo types, and environments that stimulate the imagination and challenge the player's problem-solving skills. The game's whimsical art style and unique narrative add to its charm, making each level a fresh and engaging experience.On the other hand, Black Myth: Wukong is visually stunning and offers a rich, narrative-driven action RPG experience, but it follows a more traditional gaming formula. While its combat and graphics are top-notch, it doesn't push the boundaries of gameplay innovation in the same way that World of Goo 2 does.World of Goo 2 shines in its innovative approach to puzzle-solving.

Negative,"Tries too hard to be a souls like, it's not an open world God of War like title at all. Too janky to be souls like anyway, don't buy it."
Negative,the bosses are too hard nerf the bosses.
Negative,"Boring story, bad and boring combat (also feels a bit clunky), but really nice graphics.This game is highly overrated and gameplay wise just not good."
Negative,game sucks ass im going back to dragon ball
Negative,shit dark souls clone
Negative,Far too difficult. Which is not a problem except the developers made it fucking impossible to upgrade your character effectively. Nowhere near enough opportunities to upgrade gear or skills. Don't buy unless you want to waste countless hours fighting the same boss over and over again.
Negative,"hype bought, played it 2 weeks later and i didnt like it. they wont give me a refund. i guess i should be smarter with my money. if you like monster hunter, its probably a fine game. not as good as any souls game imo, not close"
Negative,"I have TRULY learned to f**king HATE this game.It is brutally hard and I suck at complex dodge mechanic-type games but this one takes it to a whole new level. Boss fights are frequent but what I really hate is how LONG the fights are. There is nothing worse than fighting a boss over-and-over again only to get your a** handed to you while your hits do very little damage.  It's no longer FUN - it's just flat out FRUSTRATING!The graphics are amazing and the game play is fluid... But, if you SUCK at difficult souls-like games (like I do) then you will ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS GAME!!The devs need to seriously consider making difficulty levels in the settings.Would I recommend it? Absolutely NOT...I was able to complete Dark Souls 3 even though I am not good at these types of games but not this one. I'm just TIRED of how repetitive it is fighting boss after boss after boss. If VERY PUNISHING games are your thing - you'll absolutely love this. If not, spend your money on something else."
Negative,"dont waste your money, games very repetitive just running around killing the same werid dog things and fighting a boss at every turn also if you like getting lost and have no idea what the hell your doing this is def the game for you kinda just throws you in (i dont have a problem with that) just that the whole entire map looks the exact fucking same i get im in a forest and all but holy shit i have no idea if im going the right way to the story or not. the bosses all do pretty much the same shit, the game is not worth the $70 i paid for it, the combat is really janky and just all around needs sum work done to it, feels like your stiff and cant really do much about it, if you spam the health pot button it will pop like 4 of them even if i just hit the button twice. game overall feels really rushed and needs sum heavy ass work to it. it might be im just not that far into the game but so far for the hours ive played everything feels the exact same havent seen any different mobs just fighting these dogs for hours and then getting slapped into a boss fight. theres also a bunch of random barriers around the map in places that look 100% explorable just kills the emerson of the game feels like your stuck in a tiny little area with no clue where your goingIve played games like elden ring and darksouls so this isnt a skill issue, i fly through the bosses with pretty much ease but they do alot of damage, the bosses are really easy same with the boring dogs you have to fight. respectfully get of my tip :)"
Negative,"This game was advertised as ""not a souls like"", which is a total lie. The game is exactly your typical rage inducing, 1 difficulty setting, bosses that one shot you, whilst having 1 million HP, with BS mechanics where you get stuck in animations because you can't cancel your current attack to dodge making it feel like yet another cumbersome souls like which is the new flavour of the month trend for some reason. There's also more invisible walls than visible walls which further ruins the experience. Unless you enjoy masochistic games like Dark Souls you are unlikely to enjoy this game."
Negative,Garbage Chinese spyware propaganda brought about by a disgusting anti-democratic expression belief harboring nation of communists. Trash.
Negative,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. This game is way too hard. Not fun at all.
Negative,2 hard not fun. The story is confusing
Negative,Me mad Me Rage Me no like
Negative,Don't buy unless you're sweaty on the elden rings like bosses.  I'm not and and the game is more difficult than my patience and time really allows for.  But it's probably great if you're really sweaty.
Negative,i had trouble with one boss so the whole game obviously sucks
Negative,"Beat the first boss.. This game isn't for me.It's not a bad game, but it's also not a great game.Graphics look insane, but it's also got a LOT of visual noise because of it. I would often be running down a path and only notice an enemy based on the sound cue, because they'd just blend into the environment.One MAJOR downfall of the graphics is there's a lot of loading screens.. if you die and respawn, you gotta wait for the game to load and play an animation every. single. time.Combat and control of your character is very stiff. It doesn't feel bad, but it doesn't feel good. You have to come to a complete stop to pick up plants, or your character will get stuck in a long-winded attack animation that prevents you from dodging.The tutorial is also barely existent and doesn't teach you core mechanics to the combat.. but it didn't really need to as the combat is pretty easy to far.I'm not trying to flex or anything, it's just after I unlocked the stun spell, I noticed I could just sorta hang back during boss fights and dodge every now and then while I wait for my spell cooldown. Then stun them and deal mega damage.The game mechanics really reminded me of Nioh or Woo long. You have armor and gear, but you also have transformations as a special move.Overall it's not a bad game. But I just wanted to share my opinion as someone who went into Wukong with no expectations (and as someone who isn't fooled by fancy graphics). The gameplay is what interests me, and Wukong is oddly mediocre, especially if you compare it to games like Dark Souls, Jedi Fallen Order/Survivor or God of War like I'm seeing in other reviews."
Negative,"After 20 hours of pure pain and suffering, I can confidently say that this game is actual shit. 80 percent of the bosses are too easy and lame as hell and when you do encounter a hard boss they aren't even cool. I have felt not a single ounce of joy during my experience and I want a full refund. This shit is so ass it's genuinely concerning. I had to quit the game after first trying 3 bosses in a row. This game is shit. Actually the most boring game ever. The intro got me hooked and I thought that the game was going to be like the intro but I was wrong. WRONG. Im still gonna beat this shitty ass game to get my money's worth.Update: Im at 45 hours playtime and I finally beat the game. This shit was horrendous and not worth getting through 4 chapters of literal horse shit gameplay to finally get to some cool fights. The last two chapters were good and it is what I expected it to be form the start. Unfortunately, this is one of those games where you have to go through the bad to get to the good. Shit ass game 4.5/10, game of the day maybe."
Negative,"Refunded the game after first few hours.Combat appears to be builder/spender. builder meter with lights and spend with heavies.No parry early game, only dodge. You do get a few parry spells later in the game (I didn't get).Key abilities seem to be unlocks and not part of core kit. This makes the early game a slog. NG+ probably shines if you can make it through and enjoy builder/spender combat.Boss Rush game. The game between boss fights was minimal.Feels like Niho 2, but not as insane (or as rich)"
Negative,i cant play anymore... my game keeps crashing and giving me blue screen... anyone knows how to fix this? or has the same problems as i do?i got a i913900k z790 aoros elite ax4080 nvidia
Negative,The worst game I've ever played.  Don't bother.  Beautiful graphics.  Impossible skill level to play... Steam would not refund my money after I put in hours of trying to defeat even the first mini-boss.
Negative,The difficulty has earned a downvote.
Negative,"Beautiful graphics and exceptional sound (playing it in Chinese with subs for the extra immersion)! But the difficulty of the bosses is too high and there is no settings for it (why not? Is this a ""souls"" concept?). If you don't like exhausting/frustrating repetition then this game is definitely not for you. Another frustrating/cheap effect are the ""glass walls"": the level design doesn't really tell where it's possible to pass or not... it's just a hit or miss most of the times. Not worth the full price, imho."
Negative,"Don't waste your money on this game.Game are made to relive you stress not to increase your stress. Sadly this game is to increase your stress.Half the story is good and rest story you will puke on that story.Not properly optimized game. so many bugs and glitches.Then there is no proper guidance on what to do, which mission we are selecting, what quest item we needed and many more is missing. you have to figure it out on your own or watch game videos to get ideaSome bosses are very tough to beat and many people need 100+ attempts to beat those bosses. There is hardly any chapter main boss that you can beat in 1 attempt"
Negative,"Game runs in a very high end PC VERY BAD. 5900X, RTX 4090, NVMe ssd. Constant travel stutters and frame spikes. DO NOT buy it, wait couple months of performance updates.BAD:- HDR not working/cant enabled at the moment (its disabled because Frame gen will get broken).- Invisible walls EVERYWHERE.- Cant disable Vignette (without tweaks).- Cant disable Chromatic Aberration (without tweaks).- Cant disable sharpening (without tweaks).- Horrible performance (stutters and frame spikes).- Lots of Bugs and Crashes.- Some hit boxes are just BAD.- and YES its BOSS rush game.- Only one light attack combo.- Only one type of weapon (stick) and not many armors.GOOD:- Great graphics.- Great character upgrade system.If you dont believe me, check IGN performance ""review"" video. Another trash performance release.At this stage 6/10"
Negative,"Anyone want to buy this AWFUL game, has no warning about not able to adjust difficulty settings. Steam should be having this label for their customers but they do not care about their customers, they just want your MONEY!!!!There was not warning that you cannot adjust difficulty level and to try and fight a boss over and over again to try and beat him is like beating your head in the wall. This game was a total waste of money and ZERO fun and enjoyment. rating on this game 2.  I would never recommend this to anyone. Wish i can get my money back from this JUNK game. Everyone cannot play at the same skill level and this game doesn't allow any adjustment to you skill level, this needs to be pointed out to the public, if i would've known there is no difficulty setting, i wouldn't have wasted my money on this game. All i can do now is DELETE this wasteful game and money. I warn all players to stir away from this game if you need to adjust the difficulty level, YOU CAN'T.... Be warned. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS STUPID GAME"
Negative,"if you are a casual player dont get this game they lied about how easy it is, its actually worse than elden ring because at least in elden ring you can choose to come back to a boss later and level up to make it easier but this game? NOPE you gotta beat whatever crappy designed boss you are on to progress worst purchase of my life and ive spent about 300 dollars on war thunder so that should tell you something you shouldve let someone else make this game science stick to phone games because this isnt it"

Negative,"this game was in my steam profile and i dont remember buying it, i want $1,000 refunded to me"
Negative,utter fucking garbage. Game takes no skill or effort. Spam lights and use a garbage ass dodge that dont work. No other good mechanics in game with boring ass move sets and enemies. Im surprised this game even came out
Negative,You cannot turn off DLSS or other upscaling tech.. and with this thing on there is a lot of shimering. I want to play this game for graphics and cannot do because of DLSS/FSR
Negative,no difficulty setting is really a pity
Negative,"The game is fantastic for cis white males. I belong in the LGBTIQA+ and i don't feel represented at all! No people of color, no transgender, no gay. Sadly this is not a game for us. This game lack of diversity is a serious problem that must be taken into considaration. But thus this is what to be expected from China. Shame, shame, shame..."
Negative,"Crashes 10 mins in with AMD GPU.Have tried compatibility mode, turned to compatibility win 7 , ray tracing off, frame gen off. No matter it crashes with in the tutorial fight. Game looks amazing but if it just crashes then what's the point."
Negative,"CTD the moment the game moves past the intro fight. However, I was already wincing at the budget anime voice acting, and any reason to care about the character I was playing in the intro, and thus any investment in bothering further, was rapidly dying. There is a weird, and erratic, input delay on some inputs, mostly the heavy attack which I guess is part of being a soulslike? I don't know. This is a grotesquely overhyped game that is the current media darling, maybe further in there is something wonderful or unique to find, but with sustained CTD at the same point every attempt to play it means an instant refund request."
Negative,"Whoever said this game is like God Of War made me spend 60 dollars on a game that is just another Souls like except you dont lose your leveling up progress....which is irrelevant in a game with very few mobs anyway. This game plays NOTHING like God Of War and IS EXACTLY LIKE A SOULS LIKE. And I fucking hate Souls like....its basically boss rush Souls mode as well, if that's your cup of tea so be it but I'm burnt out on games trying to be challenging for the sake of it and in this game unlike Elden Ring you don't die quickly and neither do the bosses so it's just a tedious grind where if you eventually die you just have to do it again and these fights take way too long. Id rather die faster and the bosses have less health than deal with this. Also the game has a TON OF BUGS I've had enemies teleport away from me after going away from their spawn point too far, except when they teleport they are restored to maximum health now imagine that with mini boss or boss type enemies that have tons of health and take about 2 minutes of hitting to kill. :)Graphically this game has horrendous performance with full ray tracing on, it is unusable on everything but the 4080 and 4090 @ 4K even with DLSS and Frame Generation on, I have a 4080 and I had to use DLSS Balanced (not Quality ) and Frame Generation to be able to use full ray tracing on very high. I could've used the Medium setting if the setting wasn't absolutely fucking broken and low looks terrible so literally what? A lot of settings seems actually broken in this game too, Render Distance there is NO difference in many if not most objects between High, Very High, and Cinematic as far as I can tell. Basically between High to Cinematic there is very little tweaking so it either looks like dog shit or it looks like next gen dog shit. Because overall this game is just an Unreal Engine environment simulator. Yes there's good stuff in this game but I'm not going to write about that, I'm going to write about THE ABSOLUTE CRINGE FEST of the dialogue and CHINESE BRAINROT that you will see in the first 15 minutes of playing in the game. The opening is a try not to cringe challenge with the dialogue and it pretty much continues through out the game. With tons of cut scenes (another thing that was lied about) that keep taking control out of the players hands which also get tiresome. Lets see...outside of the obvious combat elements that are directly ripped off from Dark Souls you also have these fun engaging mechanics and design that also come from Dark Souls:- Enemies waiting around corners and hiding in areas and are scripted to attack you as part of a trap trigger. - NPCs with dialogue that you have to keep mashing talk on after they finish talking because they weren't really done talking btw and you just messed up the quest line :)- Multiple enemies attacking you at the same time or archers shooting from unreachable locations so  you must reposition constantly. By reposition I mean mash B the whole fucking time where you're just rolling into a wall or wherever to get around....FUN GAME DESIGN!- Input delay and missing your inputs, yea the heal input is completely messed up, you have to mash it for it to work it seems to be getting overwritten by just your running input or something, is this intentional? WHO KNOWS figure it out for yourself!- Mashing the same attack button strings over and over and doing the same fucking thing over and over against bosses but mixing up your dodge roll simulator timings with some delayed attacks (as per the standard now in this genre)I literally just finished Elden Ring, I am so fucking burnt out on this shitty ass overrated genre and I was lied to completely about how this game would play, it is not ""easy"", it is NOTHING like God Of War and IT IS a fucking Souls like in every fucking sense. I am way too burnt out in life and in general to play games that want to crush my spirit and make me feel like shit, LIFE IS HARD ENOUGH FOR ME and I dont need this shit. I want to chill out and just relax, I'mma go play Tomb Raider or fucking anything else that will allow me to just enjoy my life without having to learn boss patterns and repeat boss fights for an hour. Fuck that shit. PS I will come back to this game when I feel better and when this game gets patched to not run like complete dog shit and have tons of graphical glitches (there are tons)Overall 4/10 for me, way worse than Elden Ring and I didn't even like that game."
Negative,input delaystun skills ???locked in animationiframe what?actually ass gamegot stuck in a rock and then crashed games actually made in china
Negative,"Impossible to leave a positive review in current state. The hitboxes are completely fucked up, both for main character and bosses."
Negative,"Great graphics, mediocre game"
Negative,"graphics are cool.game play is clunky. wait-to-spawn enemies you could've killed already.can't make potions.  can only buy a few antidotes.  hope you don't need them...but you do.within hours of ""playing"" you realize this is just a chore.  no one likes to spend money on chores.nor do people find chores fun.  so this ""game"" fails to be fun.next time, I'll ask them to pay me to grind through this."
Negative,"Pros:VisualsStory/loreCharactersZero politics, woke bs, ""modern audience"" influenceGeneral aesthetic, from boss appearance and animations to UI, menus and little touches like the edge-teetering animationChapter 2 singing buddhaCons:Performance - lots of stuttering without dropping some key settings even on high end PCPseudo open world design with tons of invisible wallsSomewhat wasted skill tree as many unique moves are rarely relevant in boss fights (90% of the game)Pacing (boring slop in between bosses, lots of dud bosses, ch 3 drags, etc)Lots of mediocre/useless spirits and other such fluffRandom QoL issues like not being able to upgrade non-set items_____________________________At first boss fight after boss fight is fun, but most bosses play basically the same. Sprint up, sneak in a hit or 3 maybe, dodge string, get in 1-3 hits, dodge string, ad nauseum. Sometimes you get a long enough opening to get a full combo, and possibly stagger for focus point dump, etc. Save immobilize and unique item (LT+R3) for most difficult phases. It was fun and fresh for a chapter and a half. Yes the bosses have great presentation and good animations but the feel of every fight hardly changes and by chapter 3 it's stale.There's a pretty interesting and fleshed out skill tree but most of it isn't used because 90% of the game is boss fights where you are forced to mostly dodge and spam light attacks. When you aren't fighting bosses half the stuff is overkill on regular enemies outside of some niche situations. It's a shame how much is wasted in the skill trees.The world and enemies in between the bosses are visually appealing but not very engaging in terms of gameplay. Way too many invisible walls and useless speed bump enemies, with the random mini-boss or spirit to absorb (most of which are trash and not worth using). The aesthetics overall are great but it's a weird mix of on-rails and open world level design that hinders fun and cheapens the visual appeal.I actually enjoy souls style hard games. Bloodborne was great, I got 100% on Armored Core 6 and consider it the gold standard of this broad genre, easier but similar titles like Ghost of Tsushima are also fun and rate highly with me. But I'm having a hard time pushing myself with the performance issue and tedious boss fights. They don't have the same unique and handcrafted feeling when you're fighting them like in From Soft games. It kills the rewarding feeling of beating them, it's just a little more tedious, rather than fun and new, with each boss.This game does offer a lot of lessons for western devs to see what sells and appeals to actual gamers, not their absurd DEI-obsessed board rooms. Maybe as I get further my opinion will mature and become more positive, but for now this game is just okay. Better performance/optimization and more effort on level design and variety in the feel of boss fights would make this game an easy 9/10. However, it's just a 5 or 6 as it is with some key issues holding it back."
Negative,"Honestly, the level designers are literally as embarassing as can possibly be.  Filled with an egrigious amount of fake walls everywhere?  like just put a rock? its as cringe as it gets for a modern AAA game.  Really makes you appreciate from software that much more.  Souls vet? Very very easy game.  Its nice, its fun. Im near the end game and not excited to launch it anymore and have been feeling this way for half the game.  Meh its alright.  Im on the fence but def wait for a sale and putting neg review to counteract 1000000 chinese fanbois of the story who rated it perfect minute 1 (not sketch at all) ahem bots"
Negative,"[Performance Workaround]Even with an RTX 4090 (nvidia drivers 560.94) and Intel i7 13700k (Intel Microcode BIOS update), major game breaking stutter (slideshow) early on in the game around the 1st large enemy where you get the stun ability and stutter is consistently repeatable just past this enemy through the arch. Settings Cinema/Low, DLSS 50-100%, Frame Gen On/Off and Ray Tracing On/Off makes not difference. After lots of testing, I can get a better experience with the following configuration with RTX 4090 & i7 13700k CPU- Disable Hyper-threading in the BIOS (You can see HT is not used - Zero activity)- Set Monitor Refresh Rate to 60 FPS in Windows Display Settings- Set Nvidia 3d profile for game to Max Frame Rate: 60, Vertical Sync: On & Triple Buttering: On- In-game Settings: Max Frame Rate: Off, vSync: Off, Ray Tracing: Off, DLSS: 80%, Preset: Very HighIt is by no means perfect, but the game is much more playable in this state."
Negative,Unfortunately after hours of fiddling with game file reconfiguring GPU i refunded . a large majority of pc players cant get past the prologue .  i refunded and cant give this game any kind of revue other then the fucking devolper does not even aknowledge its a problem
Negative,"Game is terrible, No story at all"
Negative,"the game-play is boring, and repetitive,  the story is non existent, the boss designs are bad, the world is soulless. This game is extremely overrated IGN WAS RIGHT!!!!"
Negative,"The last Enemies are GARBAGE NO MATTER HOW MUCH I TRIED I CAN'T BEAT THEM, it's almost like computer learns my moves and bends me over every time. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME."
Negative,It's pretty but unforgiving. 1000 times harder than anything I've played from From Software.Wouldn't recommend unless you hate yourself.
Negative,"literaly 5\10 they told its and rpg, but its most hard soul game Ive ever played. Among stupuid bosses the game is good, but becouse of bosses its 5/10, mayne 6/10 maximun and deffinatly not goty"
Negative,too fucking hard man
Negative,i hate souls game. unfair
Negative,Another overrated souls-like.
Negative,chinese bloatware - nice graphics nothing in depth. gameplay is a joke. HF with that ccp propaganda game :D
Negative,"Chapter 1 MehChapter 2 NiceChapter 3 Really fucking badChapter 4 Boring and badChapter 5 Boring and easyChapter 6 Easy, AnnoyingSecret Boss: Cinematic, EasyThe upgrade system is a mess with too many ways to boost Health, Mana, Stamina, etc.The game didn't live up to the hype, barely a 6/10."
Negative,"Overhyped. Tries to be both God of War and Elden Ring, failing at both."
Negative,"Worst game with unkillable bosses. Waste of my time just NEEDING to HEAL! Game saves are terrible and brings you back all the way to the shrine, resetting ALL YOUR TRAVEL PROGRESS. SERIOUSLY DUMB GAME."
Negative,"Stupid game. I am no gamer, i am playing casual. No way to play it casual. I am at Whiteclad for 5 hours of gaming. Idiot game. If you are not a gamer, do not buy it. if you don`t have time to play, learn, do not buy it."
Negative,"bad and boringedit: I don't know how anyone can play this game. The inputs are heavily delayed, the healing is totaly unresponsive, the heavy attacks don't come out when you try to chain them into a quick attack combo and frames drop mid-fight so your dodge gets fucked up.This feels like the bachelor work degree of a student honestly who tried out to prototype a game, no QA was done. The game got so heavily delayed, that it built up such a strong hype everyone screaming GOAT like sheeps who follow the herd. This feels rather like a bad early access release."
Negative,"The game is gorgeous and I wish I could play it, but it's way too difficult. I died like 10 times to the first actual boss of the game with the big fire staff thing. Dodging doesn't work, I dodged his attacks so many times and he would track you and hit you anyways. And if you make a mistake, you don't get hit once, you get hit 3 times. There are no catch up mechanics or anything for when you're struggling, no accessibility/difficulty options for people who aren't pro gamers. Don't play this game if you don't have a reaction speed of 0.000001 ms."
Negative,"the ai is trash legit doesnt move if you dont move. it waits on ur input -edit 54 hours later- beat the game erlang and the monkey, the story is alright but wukong legit beats his meat at you in the last fight and i think they did this cuz no journalist is ever gonna see that, besdies that the game is still trash - edit 92 hours later- 100% complete uhhh the seeds rng is stupid besides that all other trophys are easy"

It is a glorified boss rush, the content between bosses is trivial and can be skipped with ease and you wont feel any weaker. The upgrade system is basic and its impact is not felt, gear has set bonuses but you never feel stronger or weaker with or without them. Its just an artificial number to give you a roadblock on certain bosses/area's (do you have this weapon? then tick the box and kill the next boss). The game appears and wears a disguise giving the impression of it being more open world and exploratory than it actually is; paths, roads and areas are filled with invisible walls and stops to prevent you from finding secrets or fun side content. Combat itself feels clunky and unrewarding. The skill tree itself is basically useless, the best way to fight any boss or enemy is just to tap the light attacks and dodge, the heavy attack is useless and one of the worst to exist and you get punished for using it with no reward to balance it out (the damage it does it less than if you just done a light combo chain). The area's you go through are very boring and uninspired, you can replace any zone with another in the game, mix and match and it wont change the pacing or outcomes, there is no coherency. The only positive points I have would be the graphics, music and audio design, and the story (which is timeless)."
Negative,"Couldn't even make it through 1 hour. The world is nice and unique, game looks great, just nowhere near being a game for me. I can't take a literal monkey serious in cutscenes."
Negative,great game great art but definitely not overwhelmingly positive
Negative,"Meglio comprarlo su altra piattaforma per PC. Il gioco sembra ben fatto, ma giocando su Steam, dopo un crash improvviso ho perso tutti i dati di salvataggio e dovrei ricominciare da capo, dopo tutti gli sforzi fatti fin'ora... Steam oltretutto nega il rimborso nonostante si sia verificato un problema di questa entità, per cui ripeto, visto che è disponibile su un altro store per PC, consiglio di evitare Steam.Better to buy it on another PC platform. The game seems well made, but playing on Steam, after a sudden crash I lost all the save data and I would have to start over, after all the efforts made so far ... Steam also denies the refund despite having occurred a problem of this magnitude, so I repeat, since it is available on another PC store, I recommend avoiding Steam."
Negative,"game is bugged and boring. at the end of chapter 2 now, quickly lost interest past the opening fight before CH 1. Can hardly understand the story/lore without rewatching cutscenes on yt. this is literally Sekiro reimaged. boring/nonexistent gear system. been doing the same combo for 5 hours now because theres only one weapon. tasteless environment, reminds me of the Forspoken map. enemies can shoot/hit through walls, and twice now ive cleared all the way to the boss just to get glued to a wall randomly and get sent back to spawn, mind u almost all enemies respawn once you die. The bosses look cool though, i guess. too bad you get a front row spoiler in the loading screens -_- this wouldve been better as a movie or sum s***"
Negative,just a elden ring knock off to hard to enjoy just wanted to play a nice story game but no cant even enjoy it!
Negative,I honestly don't get the hype for this game lolI tried it for about 1.5 hours before returning it - it's just another generic souls clone...Gameplay is alright and graphics are beautiful - but you're better off watching a playthrough on YouTube or buying it for half-off.
Negative,"*Realistic, no hype train influenced review here because I had never even heard of this game before today and I own 100+ games including Dark Souls titles. (I have a i7 13th gen overclocked w/ a 3080 and 32gb of RAM on an SSD)I dunno man, Its like all UE5 games. Sure, it looks a bit better than UE4 maxed out but the performance hit is CRAZY in return. An example is the game satisfactory. While they were on UE4, I was able to NEVER drop below 200fps on ultra even with the most insanely large factory builds. Now on UE5, yeah it looks marginally better but to even make it have okay fps (like 80-100 fps w/ haven't even tried crazy big builds yet), I have to tone down the settings so much that it doesn't matter and now ive took a 100+fps hit for a small increase in graphic fidelity. People don't want to admit this but UE5 is about as optimized as a dried white dog turd at this point in time. That is just the performance side. The other side is that it truly it just feels like a bland ""oh i hit with staff then i dodge but OH WAIT HERE COMES THE FREEEZEEEE"" kinda soulslike, but the bosses still have crazy move sets. I am already aware as the game progresses the customization of builds is practically no existent and you only upgrade a few ""stances"" instead. Don't let anyone tell you this isn't a soulslike. It 100% is. Its just a very simple soulslike which come to find out is more bad than good. You're 100% better off replaying Elden Ring and buying the DLC for when you get to that point that you need a fresh experience than playing this super liner soulslike that just feels watered down. The change in scenery (to Chinese scenery) was not enough to keep me engaged personally based off of what i played and the very reliable reviews about the story in game after the first chapter practically being non-existent.  I did not feel like the graphics and attack effects were so impressive that I could overlook the simplified game mechanics and non-existent narrative. Its exactly the same reason that Helldivers is dying on PC. Yes, the whole PS online bs was the catalyst, but ultimately the super basic mechanics hidden under the flashy explosions would get old when there are sooo many better options on PC like Deep Rock Galactic. Honestly this is a super surface level review and I am only down voting because I believe this one is being blown way out of proportion as far as how actually good it is. I really wish there was a neutral option for steam reviews but here we are. Is it playable? Absolutely. Is it likely to be your favorite game if you aren't a regular rider of the hype train? Probably not, I can already tell you even with just an hour of playtime that this is not the kinda game you're going to dig your teeth into and experiment and run NG+ for the majority of people.PS - Also everytime I close the game, the game fails to sync. Therefore resetting my playtime. It has not reset my progress yet but whether that will happen or not we will see. Everytime I try to get it to manually sync it just does literally nothing."
Negative,Game industry has died...
Negative,I wouldn't wish playing this game onto my worst enemy.
Negative,If you like running back and forth chasing flying bosses around an arena for 10 minutes at a time you will love this game.
Negative,I guess I don't hate women enough to like this game.
Negative,It is too early but this game is boring and worthless with no story... It only the character running from one place to another and fighting ..
Negative,"The CCP is inflating the player numbers like crazy and their mouth pieces are claiming it's more successful than Elden Ring during it's peak. Sure it is. In other news, Jesus has risen from the dead and gas prices have sunk to an all time low. Can't wait for the Tian'anmen protest DLC and some Xi Jinping inspired skins for our monke!!Oh and the game is mediocre as hell. 5/10 would refund again. Free Tibet."
Negative,It looks lovely but its a Sekerio Shadows die Twice game and i fucking hate these style of games.Its not an action rpg Its a doge roll simulator with ZERO animation skiping.Each Zone is a straight path with a few offside areas they have a few trash mobs and then a boss this is the game.If you enjoy being angry at shity camrea movements and getting ripped buy NPC bosses over and over this is the game for you.After all the Hype once again i feel let down also WHAT THE FUCK WITH THE INVISABLE WALLS EVERY WHERE.graphics 10/10Performance 9/10Gameplay 3/10Story 4/10The World 3/10overall 4/10and at 90$ Australian i requested a refund i want to enjoy my self for that money not get Angry as all fuck
Negative,"Classic souls, that is, a game for perverts. I waited for the game for a very long time and very much, because I liked the advertising. But like all companies in game development are afraid to deviate from the standard norms, here everything is the same, the game does not stand out from the pompous wingspan - this is a classic souls like for perverts. Yes, I like to play those games that deviate from the standards and when the developer puts his soul into them, but here is something completely different - this is just a company that did not bother to bring something new, everything is the same old, well-worn scheme. You are masochists - play as much as you like. How can they not understand that there are different players and I do not like to suffer and go through this nonsense at all. I hoped that according to the logic there should be dynamic difficulty here. For those who pass the boss the first time, the difficulty can be increased a little, if you spend half a day on the boss, then the difficulty can be lowered. Why not do it like that, are YOU complete idiots out of your mind?? Well, is it really that hard to bring something new to the world of souls games so that it could appeal to everyone and not just masochists who like to suffer.I decided to write this comment after I spent half a day struggling with a bear. I'm tired of this blah blah blah. You're idiots... I can tell you a lot about the mechanics, but I'm too lazy, I drank some beer and that's it!PERIOD!P.S.Probably if you want a good game, make it yourself. Because everyone has hands out of their asses"
Negative,"Severe performance issues/bugs. Until they are fixed I can't recommend buying the game. Hopefully within a few days these should get patched out.1. Audio does not work even after trying online fixes. Some audio (like footsteps or rustling) will stay playing, but other audio (like music and ambiance) will non stop stutter in and out of combat.2. Frame rate is very stable even when moving and spinning the camera, but on first loads and in combat the frame rate will begin to stutter very hard making the game unplayable. All drivers are updated and this seems to happen on all graphic settings. I do not have any issues with other games so it does not appear to be a hardware issue."
Negative,boss fights make this game much more hard to explore the story and the environment of the game
Negative,"Overhyped unoptimized ugly garbage.Overrated piece of crap that is not even launching.Stuck at loadscreen, is this the gameplay everyone was waiting for?What a way to start sales."
Negative,It would be better if we had an option to choose the difficulty level.....
Negative,Jesus calm down people
Negative,"Nothing special, bosses are pain in the ass at best..bunch of visual, audio and general glitches"
Negative,"Blah blah blah, get gud...I've played through Elden Ring and there is hard, and then there is just not teaching you how to play and throwing you in. Then limiting potions you can buy (sold out) while you grind the same boss over and over. You look up a strategy guide and a guy is level 30 talking about how he grind for 13 hours to kill the first boss... This game difficulty curve is too much to be fun unless it is something your explicitly want. This game needs a better learning curve."
Negative,"While playing this game on GeForce Now I experienced two crashes. Not a huge problem except... it wipes my progress. I believe it reverts to my last cloud save. The first time I had to fight a boss over, not a huge hurdle but it was disheartening. The second time was like an hour later and two bosses. When I booted it again, it took me straight back to the first crash save. I can tolerate a crash or two, but not progress wiping crashes. Not sure who is at fault for this situation, but if the game was more stable then I wouldn't be refunding the game"
Negative,"This game is way to hard there really need to be a difficulty setting. i love the way the game looks and plays so much but i cant play it because its to difficult to progress, im just wanting to chill and play the game but instead it makes me want to punch a hole in my monitor. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR CHILL GAMEPLAY!!!"
Negative,"I really want to like this, the game looks awesome. But if i could refund i would, i really want to play this for the story and if im being honest im to new to this style game play, i get maybe 2 or 3 hours a week to play, and i just suck. so maybe if they ever make a difficulty setting ill come back to it. but if your up for some pain with the boss fights with some great graphics you are in for a treat."
Negative,The real myth is this game deserving 608k Overwhelmingly Positive reviews.
Negative,Overhyped.Get it on sale.
Negative,"The game didn't crash, it just sucked.The FPS is pretty bad, though."
Negative,Games too hard.
Negative,"Didn't know it was a souls-like game, I was in it for the monkey king story. Add a difficulty slider, I don't have time to learn your game mechanics inside out."
Negative,Games are so bad nowdays that people will go praising any chinese garbage
Negative,game nhu cac
Negative,Really bad game just stick to helldivers the best game in the world. Im using a 3050 can it barely hits 10 fps on max graphics the performance optimization is very bad. Its just a cheap chinese knock of of god of war. -20/10 really bad
Negative,"Love the combat and great graphics, but the fact that the lip animation wasn't synced to the English voices makes it look like a cheap, cheesy anime. Don't buy until they fix this.The game also has NO map and NO mini mapWhat are these devs thinking?!"
Negative,FUCCK THE GOd daMN SAND MMAN HE IS STYUPID AND I HATEE HIM FUCK THHIS MONKEY AsS GAME
Negative,Fix the lag and I'll fix my review. Unplayable right now. Constant freezing.
Negative,"Just like everything else made in China, its bad quality. Rather play DS2 than this garbage"
Negative,DOESN'T FUCKING WORK
Negative,yall have lost your damn minds with this souls like bullshit. yall aint real gamers.
Negative,"Overrated. Overall good game, beautiful art design. However, there exists many issues with the game, terrible map design/ map guidance causing player to walk into ""air wall"" constantly and combat system can be more refined. Some enemy and bosses and just disgusting and too repetitive."
Negative,"if you have no expectations this might be a great game for you, but considering ~500k people reviewed this with a 95% positive review rate, which could be regarded as outstanding for a no name studio, i had slightly high expectations. i ended up disappointed since the game play is very mediocre. the action combat is par for the course, and the exploration is very unrewarding. not much to say about the game negatively, but not much to say positively either."
Negative,The worst souls like in game industry (from ofc AAA group). - Terrible boss design (everyone is rather annoying than just hard). - You can't perform action while you are performing another one (which is solved in e.g Dark Souls) so dodging is very hard while you hitting.- Very big input lag. I can click dodge while just standing and sometimes even after 1s my character doesn't dodge. Very annoing while boss fighting.- Terrible hitboxes- Bad description of skills without training dummy
Negative,"hi  dear  reader.  if you are  new to  this sort of game,  you  may find  this game hard, as there is no difficulty  select  that may be an issue  for you. you need  to learn how to fight each boss ,  each boss battle could start getting into  the 10 or more minutes time frame  per attempt. failing  at the last moment again and again.. is not some thing you enjoy.... then  look  for a different game to brake into the sort of game. when you can play most  game of this sort on hard mode, come  back and enjoy this gem of a game. as for me.. i'll rather enjoy watching some one else play  it ."
Negative,"Can't be asked to play more. Empty. Feels like it's tryna have some exploring but there's no point at all. Find shiny item? Nah it's nothing, just a few soul. At this point just make a straight line game. Ain't a bad game, ain't a good one either. MehThe graphics are really good, while the combat is nice, nothing life changing."
Negative,"In my opinion, the combat is too difficult to enjoy the rest of the story."
Negative,Dog Vomit ANOTHER souls clone and nothing more. Just a boss rush game.
Negative,why my black myth wukong is not working my desktop is 14 gen intel i5 cannot play also have 4060TI
Negative,"First of all, let me say. This is a solid game, a good game even. But I don't dig it. It has some issues.- The difficultyIf you're looking for a chill action RPG, this game is not for you. The first chapter of the game is relativily mild, but starting with the second chapter the difficulty ramps up CONSIDERABLY. You'll be dying a lot on bosses, run against them over and over again.Aside from being quite hard, the game has a few flaws which made me quit it for now.- The invisible walls everywhere. This destroys any kind of immersion.- The linear gameplay with almost no exploration of any kind.- The missing map - I constantly feel lost. Having no map serves no purpose other than being a nuisance.- The performance is okay, but given that it doesn't look that great nor special, it's a bit poor. It's playable with DLSS and especially with frame gen, but that shouldn't be required to run a game. The optimization is poor. At least it doesn't stutter.If you're looking for an action RPG with a very high difficulty (you cannot change this), almost on Sekiro levels, then this game is for. If not, better skip this."
Negative,"Crashes, low fps and not working frame generation."
Negative,用心做游戲 用脚做優化不推薦 但我還是會玩
Negative,"This game forces you to worship 4 Buddha statues to progress, its satanic.It’s also not an action rpg as some would have you believe its a soulslike."
Negative,Game optimization sucks ass
Negative,"Utterly disappointed. This is a Chinese StarWars game and literally nothing new. It is over hyped, over praised junk. The graphics is OK, and the scenery is mediocre. There is no character customization, and only 1 weapon, and after repetitive button smashing and Megaman charge attacks, you realize that the Bosses are heavily dependent on RNG move sets, and will find it super boring. You can see the devs trying so hard to get that souls vibe but failing miserably and it is kind of funny. I can say a thousand more things about why you shouldn't waste your money on this stupid junk game but I don't even feel bothered about it cuz it's so freakin bad it's just a trash game you get my point. There are 1.4 billion chinese in this world, and trust me, 99.9% of the reviews most likely written by them. Don't trust the reviews, play for an hour or so, and if you feel like you are wasting time, the game does NOT get ANY better, so request full refund. Maybe get it later when it goes on sale for 3.99. Freakin waste of money, chinese trash game."
Negative,Game Science chose to collaborate with JD inc (a DEI/LGBTQ company) so here is a negative review for the game.
Negative,"beautiful game with a great story, but way too many brutally hard boss battles. i would have liked an option for easier difficulty, and more variety of things to do."
Negative,Mouth movements dont match english. monkey game no monkeyim not japan man.
Negative,"maybe i am missing the point but i found this game boring i am sorry but i don't see what all the hype is about its just a button bashing repetitive  hack and slash not for me sorry but i refunded it ,don't want the hate but its nothing like elden ring  its boring"
Negative,"Not great. If you just feel like relaxing to a game after school or work. THIS IS NOT THE GAME FOR YOU. If you are not experienced with games, some of the bosses can take hours to beat. Also, every boss is extremely different so don't try and get used to their fighting style. over all its a good looking game but only good for people who don't touch grass"
Negative,"Black Myth: Wukong is, in one word, inaccessible. (Not from running poorly; it ran fine for me)This game got a lot of hype. A ton of it. So much so that it seemed like a game that even casual players would be able to play.  I don't consider myself a super-hardcore gamer, but you can bet your bottom dollar when I play a game, I have the difficulty set to hard. In some games, I have to dial it back to normal. But this game is HARD. It is much harder than it should be for the hype that it has gotten. I am super-glad that this came free with a GPU I bought while upgrading my computer. If it had not, I would have paid full price for this game, which is unusual for me. The last game that I bought from hype alone was Control. Before that, it was Fallout 4. So it's rare that hype for a game is enough for me to get it near its release. For a game with no difficulty setting, and enough hype to tempt even the most casual of gamers, this game is too hard. I know ""souls-likes"" are harder than normal. I don't play a lot of those types of games. I have a couple, and Lies of P is on my wishlist. But this game is for only the most hardcore ""souls-like"" veteran players. And the controls, to me, are unresponsive at times. Pressing RT and LT at the same time is a game of roulette every single time.Don't get me wrong. It is a pretty good game, and it looks great. I think it's not quite AAA, but maybe AA+ due to it's linearity, its story relying on something I've never heard of before reading other reviews, and the constant boss fights with no other enemies that even approach the scale and difficulty of said bosses.Anyhow, I think the game could be a bit easier if leveling up and using your upgrades had any meaningful impact on the outcome of a given boss fight. You can level up all you want. You can upgrade your weapons, spirits, and upgrade the armor that goes on your head, legs, and forearms. It is all for naught. Any boss will send you reeling into an infinite loop of hit-stun until you die. Unless you have the skill and extreme luck that only the most seasoned ""souls-like"" players possess, this will happen to you for hours on each of the bosses.Also, what's the deal with all the hit stun ALL THE TIME? No matter how strong I get, many enemies will take a hit from me and not even flinch. It seems like enemies and bosses take hit stun by random chance, regardless of light or heavy attack. BUT, even the slightest touch from the weakest of enemies causes my character to flop around like a ragdoll being hit by a ton of bricks. The weakest of enemies will cause the same amount of hitstun as the most Supreme Being hits from bosses. That's one of the myriad reasons it's almost impossible to deal with multiple enemies effectively.No ranged weapons makes dealing with archers difficult and a hit from an arrow will send you into a huge hit stun. And if there are enemies around you, you might as well just go ahead and restart from that last checkpoint, because the hitstun will not stop for long enough for you to heal, dodge, or run away. But I guess that's enough of the game's other problems. Overall, again, it's not a hugely problematic game. I just can't recommend it to general audiences because of it's unusually high difficulty. Not that difficult games are bad. Cuphead is hard, but it is hard in an okay way. It's hard, but it's fair. The Surge 2 is also pretty difficult, but I would still recommend that. I can't recommend someone buy this game with any expectation of staying sane due to difficulty within the first few (as in less than three) hours."
Negative,"The game won't make it past the opening fight scene without crashing. Playing on an updated system with the most recent drivers. Won't make it past the first battle without crashing, BSOD or flat out restarting. 7600x with a 4070 ti.."
Negative,"Visuals 10/10Combat 1/10 (delayed slow roll, first boss only burns me)This game does not deserve GOTY"
Negative,"noWanna be souls game but not even close, so why not make it as adventure instead of retarded bosses"
Negative,"horrible game, many glitches"
Negative,Why the hell did you make this game so hard. I'll never get that. Bye forever.
Negative,"way too hard, i don't wanna hear the GiD GuD or SkIlL IsSuE people, not everyone can be a master of timing and dodging and don't have hours to sit on one boss ! its unnecessarily hard ! after awhile its just not fun , i want to play a game to relax and enjoy myself! if i wanted a Souls game or Elden Ring , id just play them , but this is worse than Elden Ring! at least that was fun"
Negative,"DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME AT ALL! IT SUCKS D*** - I'VE PLAYED ELDEN RING AND I ENJOYED THAT BECAUSE IT WAS OPEN WORLD. THIS GAME IS SUPER LINEAR, BOSS AFTER BOSS AFTER BOSS. NOTHING FUN ABOUT IT. 0 CREATIVITY, 0 OPEN WORLD. PLS DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT GET THIS GAME! LET WUKONG STAY A MONKEY FOREVER"
Negative,Not a bad game but EVERYTHING about the Pagoda Realm makes the game worse in every way. Not even past that area yet and i know that i cant recommend this game Solely because of the Pagoda Realm. No matter how much better it gets after it will never feel the same knowing i had to play through that.
Negative,"I tried really hard to like this game but the boss design is absolutely awful and the entire game is just bosses. I'm fine with getting destroyed by a boss for hours who's mechanics work but this game constantly throws bosses at you with broken hit boxes and unfair mechanics because they ran out of ideas for what a challenging boss can do. The whole time I'm playing this I am dreading the final chapters rather than being excited for what's next. Can't understand why people enjoy this game. My game will stutter and lag often even after trying to optimize my game settings. It's not usually game breaking but very annoying. Do NOT get this game at full price, it's not worth it. If you want to try it I'd get it 50% off."
Negative,"So angry and pissed off. I really wanted to play this game and I just can't. I hate the way these games are designed. I don't want to learn patterns. I don't want to get used to dying. I just tried playing again tonight and quit after an hour and a half where I had not progressed at all and felt like I gained nothing. Just anger, anxiety and resentment.  I feel physically ill from this game."
Negative,The game is so poorly optimised. It is constantly having frame rate issues making it unplayable. I'm running it on an rtx2060 omen gaming laptop it struggles anytime an enemy character enters the general area.
Negative,"When it gets updated and optimized I can recommend this game, otherwise expect very poor performance. Still very good game."
Negative,a no just because of yellow wind sage
Negative,"Too difficult, not for common people"
Negative,"Gimmick Dark Souls trying to be difficult but its just poor game design with cheap enemy mechanics and little player variety that's outdated at this point, not game of the year."
Negative,Game is too difficult
Negative,Summary: This is an electronic waste that borrows Chinese classical literature for hype.It is a mediocre work that is quite suitable for the vast majority of Chinese young people.A game shows the aesthetic fate of young people in a country. They are cynical and eager to be recognized. They live in the dream of collectivism of most Chinese people. Actually this is an extremely mediocre semi-finished electronic waste. A group of socialist lackeys without human rights use this waste to make a ridiculous dream of reaching the top of the world.
Negative,very bad game. boss is very difficult especially (Whitecland Noble) he is very difficult and when you kill him he comes back to life with full life. I tried to kill him at least 50 times.i bought the game to have fun not to just get angry and annoyed.do not recommend this game
Negative,"With all of the reviews saying how amazing this game is I thought it would be much... much... more. This game is beautifully designed, with crazy cool characters and enemies. The story is solid and really intriguing. The gameplay, however,  is so linear and simplistic that it might as well have been a side scroller. For a $60 game, this is a disappointment. The lag when fighting seems intentional. I think the game is so short that they want you to learn each boss by fighting them over and over until you can anticipate their moves. Either that or this game is a dodge mechanic nightmare. You either have to constantly dodge or know what the boss is about to do, because by the time you see their ""tell"" your dodge is too late. This game will be great for some, and boring for others. I found it boring and requested a refund. So much effort was put into the beauty and the story that they forgot to make a video game. I would NOT recommend."
Negative,there is no difficulty level its bad too
Negative,"I have a 4090 and get constant stutters and frame-drops. Even on the (mandatory) highest up-scaling quality setting, there are annoying artifacts around the character when you move, which is painful to look at and a poor testament for modern gaming. You get thrown into the game without explanation or anything and collect things that have seemingly no use, until you learn what they are meant for. There is also no tutorial, but thankfully all controls were 1:1 copied from Ghost of Tsushima, same for some cinematics that looked exactly the same. The dude at the beginning talks about how important freedom is, yet you constantly run into invisible walls, which is rather pathetic in a huge title like this. Good game design would rather build an environment that guides you through and has physical walls, when necessary. There is also smaller rocks that are not supposed to walk up to and when you try, you get sort of stuck in them. This is also poor game design and likely due to time constraints during the development.The combat is boring and seems uninspired. Every Sous-Like is like this, or better, so why bother buying this game? Some moves cause your enemies to get out of frame and you get disorientated, which makes the combat unnaturally harder. The graphics feel pale and 2-dimensional. This is the kind of look a lot of recent games have. It feels uninspired and is painful to look at, especially with the up-scaling artifacts. Some say the performance is not that bad, but those people likely forget that some games from 5 years ago looked better and did not need a 40-series GPU to run smoothly. Over 80% of players are from China, which is likely where the good reviews come from. I was really curious about a game that is inspired by Chinese mythology, as it is so underrepresented in games, but was rather disappointed to see a game that feels like any other corporate mess we got in recent years.Edit: The Player-count comes from GameDiscoverCo. At launch 88.1% of players were estimated to be Chinese. And yes, this means that most positive reviews are Chinese, but it is the same for the negative ones. I didn't know you get called a racist on Steam if you don't cite sources you can find with a 3 second Google search."
Negative,It crashes every time I get more than 15 minutes in.
Negative,Cringe chinese crap. Gonna refund.
Negative,This could be a great game if it wasn't so fucking difficult
Negative,"This starts as an easy 9 out of 10 game, but damn does Chapter 3 try hard to convince you it was never that good."
Negative,"The story is incredible, visuals are jaw dropping but the gameplay is fking bullshit 40 hours plus and I have no idea how to dodge properly, elden ring was painful but at least it was consistnent, this gameplay is pure garbage."
Negative,"A frustrating timed save simulation capable of stuttering and FPS drops on a 5k€ configuration with Intel Core i9-13900KS, 64GB DDR5 and RTX 4090 24GB DDR6. I can overcome the frustration of a difficult game but the performance is unacceptable. Refounded after less than 3 hours."
Negative,"Alright let's get into it.First things first: THIS IS A SOULS-LIKE. There will be people lying about this all over the internet but do not be fooled. SOULS-LIKE. As someone who typically doesn't like souls-like, and only dabbled for Jedi: Fallen Order/Survivor (because Star Wars), hearing that this was more akin to God of War (which I love) I thought this would be great for me. If you don't like souls games you will not like this. Take my mistake of trusting the advice of people on the internet as a reason for you to save your money. I can't get mine back, but you can keep yours. This is a souls game and you will not enjoy it if you don't like souls games. Simple. I have no idea why people are lying by saying otherwise - other than they're being precious about their favourite genre and aren't comfortable with a developer, outside FromSoft, planting a flag in it. Now I can't get my money back because of time spent, and you might think 20+ hours is long enough to realise what I was in for - but even being a souls-like I thought I could tough it out. I really didn't find much resistance until Chapter 3. However genuine criticism of the game in this regard; I don't believe the upgrades made, from experience earnt in chapter 1 & 2, were balanced appropriately for Chapter 3. I assume this will only get worse. Basically, despite rpg-like upgrades/skill trees, the difficulty gap continued to increase as the upgrades provided didn't make a big enough impact. I'm not prepared to die hundreds of times to the same boss, or grind for levels which don't really make a big impact anyway, for a video game. I'm not doing this for a living, this is my release. It stressed me more than my job. No thank you.Speaking of preparation for bosses you can obtain special items through side-quests which can have big impacts on your build/play-style. More criticism here, the quests are incredibly difficult to discover, follow, and complete. There's no quest menu, no indication you've started a quest, and generally no real indication on how to complete it. The quests may even require you to go backwards through chapters which just felt like a pretty poor design choice. Quests should move you forward as you progress. It helps with continuity if nothing else. Problem here is it's actually really easy to miss NPCs that would start quests. I found backtracking for one of those NPCs left me with dialogue that didn't make sense considering I had already defeated the boss they spoke of (here's continuity issues coming into play because of poor quest design).As we're kind of touching on story by criticizing the quests, it's important to note the story absolutely stinks. I know there's a wider story here, further reading if you're interested in the mythology, etc - but within the confines of this game the narrative is terrible. Borderline non-existence. It means nothing to me if named characters reference Journey to the West. I haven't read that. I don't know the story. I didn't realise that was a pre-requisite to playing this game. I found myself on YouTube trying to find some answers and creators were proclaiming the story was amazing. If I need to go to your YouTube video to figure out what's happening in the story then the story is hardly any good? At least the way they're communicating the story is poor.I can't really Segway this but in terms of combat I hated a few things. This could just be classic souls-like so I don't really put a lot of weight on these complaints if so. Basically I hate uninterruptable attacks, especially if they're not telegraphed/distinguished as being uninterruptable. I like a game that allows me to be proactive by using a quicker attack to interrupt an enemies slower, heavier, attack. Sometimes enemies will be interrupted, other times not. It's hard to distinguish when it's going to happen, or if a move can be interrupted. You need to play almost entirely reactive, waiting for attacks to dodge them. Eh. I like to run it up mid and build around it. This doesn't offer that. There's also huge delays when using the Gourd (healing) that cannot be interrupted. Didn't have enough time to drink before the next attack? Too bad you cant dodge enjoy getting hit, negating the Gourd charge. It felt super unresponsive, and with a game that relies so heavily on near-perfect dodging I really don't like the inclusion of animations, of the player character, that can't be interrupted by dodge. Your spells can also go on cooldown without activating because they're interrupted. I hate that. Feels like if the animation of a spell doesn't complete then realistically I never actually casted it - but it goes on cooldown immediately anyway. Frustrating stuff. The game even encourages you to use one of the spells in tight windows as it gives benefits if it's cast while an enemy is attacking. It's like that wanted to annoy you.Another poor Segway; navigating the map is a lot of ""is it this way"" or ""is it that way"". It's hard to distinguish what's a side route, and what's the main path. I ended up leaving Chapter 2 early because I found the boss long before I'd explored all other avenues. I tried to mitigate this happening but it ended up with a lot of walking in one direction, thinking it might lead to a major boss, backtracking for another direction only to realise that's probably the main path instead. Rinse and repeat constantly. There's also invisible walls littered throughout the map and that's crazy in 2024. I can't remember the last time a game implemented invisible walls so shamelessly. It's going to be sad when this wins GOTY. I swear if you want a positively received game you just need to make a souls-like. No one even talks about Sekiro but it was a souls-like released in that year. It was average. This is average too.I hate ya'll for lying to me in any case."
Negative,"This game was made for people who can't fully commit to the masochistic game play loop of a souls game. If you want better combat buy Elden Ring, if you want better combat but with a linear world, buy Dark Souls 3."
Negative,bad made me want to do unholy things to my self
Negative,"NGL this game looks really good, but god it is boring. The world and details look incredible but everything feels lifeless and the combat also just feels boring. I know its got a lot of hype right now and its got really good reviews, thats the reason I gave it a shot but I just couldnt get into it. ended up refunding."
Negative,"The reason I refunded this game was because of the blurry resolution, poor upscaling implementation, and lackluster performance.The reason I will never buy this game again, is because of the toxicity I have seen in this review section, from the fans of this game. I haven't seen a bigger group of snowflakes anywhere on the internet, in YEARS.From disabled people with epilepsy, basically being told to end themselves, just because the fans of this game lack those certain chromosomes that just so happen to help regulate emotional response. To fans of soulslikes that have issues with performance, or map design, being told they do not have the right to an opinion and should end their lives. This response from the community will do more damage to this game than any negative review ever will. This looks bad on the community. This looks bad on the developers. And this looks bad on Steam, who still at this moment, has taken no steps to moderate this disgusting behavior. I will keep my comment section open to prove this point. Originally I was planning to wait a few months until the product was more stable. Now I can promise that I will never buy this game again, nor recommend it to anybody, unless there are actions taken, and some kind of public apology given, by either Steam, or the Wukong devs, in relation to their toxic fans."
Negative,"Bought this game yesterday, ran great and the graphics were amazing. 1 day later not only are my graphics and frame rate extremely low, but the game keeps crashing over and over again. The game is great but due to the issues I am experiencing I am not content."
Negative,"Its like Elden Ring with beautiful graphics.Linear. With one wepon. No shield. And bad moveset.With unnaturally attacking enemies, hits coming out of nowhere. Might even be good game if I didn't play above mentioned Elden Ring.Welcome to the hype train.And few hours later -> Uninstalled.Not going for better, so why bother."
Negative,"Basically a boss gauntlet with technical issues. - The boss fights don't feel meaningful since there is a new one at every corner.- Camera and input feels terrible, it seems like there is input delay all the time.- Animations and timing make it hard to land heavy attacks and judge dodge windows. - Invisible walls make exploring a terrible mess. Not fun for me."
Negative,"The Do's and Don'ts of Black Myth: WukongDO' s     •  Refund this awful trash heap of generic gameplay garbage!DON' TS     •  Do NOT forget that China's game industry leaders, policies, opinions, news, etc. censors         and/or punishes anyone speaks out ""negatively"" against them and would rather         suck the dick of their Winnie-the-Pooh looking communist cunt of a leader than         acknowledge the absolute shit show of civil rights violations against its own citizens.      •  Do NOT forget that the Chinese government is attempting to rewrite history by denying         and falsifying factual documentation regarding COVID-19. Including its disastrous         handling of quarantining and isolating those presumed to be affected.     •  Do NOT forget that Game Science, a Chinese company, wants to control the narrative of          its game reviews by censoring content creators from speaking freely about topics and or         issues that may (or may not) be explicitly relevant for fear of instigating negative         discourse. In other words, Game Science is trying to disempower those that would         exercise their human right of free speech.       •  Do NOT forget that Game Science is afraid of offensive language/humor which means         they can FUCK RIGHT OFF YOU FUCKITY FUCK FUCKS.     •  Do NOT forget that Barbra Streisand should have just shut the fuck up and taken a         moment to remember that the world doesn't revolve around her dumb fat ass. And by         Barbra Streisand, I mean Game Science, and by Game Science, I mean China."
Negative,"the most useless and stupid game ever, no difficulty selection, etc DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this shit"
Negative,its not working
Negative,This game is absolute utter dogshit if I'm gonna be honest. After the first 3 chapters the whole thing goes downhill so bad. Like literally I feel like bosses weren't even playtested properly and none of the development team were in any awareness on what state their endgame is in honestly. And by all means please understand that this game is a souls like because after so many people saying that its not I actually believed it and regretted it deeply. I'm honestly just tired of these games. After playing through multiple souls likes this year this one is just the worst by far. I mean it started well but what does it matter if the other half of it is insufferable? But please consider not lying to people about the game's genre because this is the most souls like I've had in non fromsoftware game if I'm gonna be honest. Just don't touch if you're not into that. Just wasn't a good time whatsoever. But it looks pretty c:
Negative,"Monke is gud, game is mid"
Negative,"Black Myth: Wukong had so much potential, but it's 2024 and we’re still dealing with blatant sexism and zero LGBTQIA+ representation? The female characters are hypersexualized and seem to exist only for eye candy, while LGBTQIA+ identities are completely erased. It's disappointing to see such an incredible concept fall into outdated, harmful tropes. The devs missed a crucial opportunity to create something truly inclusive and meaningful. This game could've been great, but instead, it's a reminder that the industry still has a long way to go."
Negative,"Run in a pipe, face a boss, defeat boss, continue in pipe. Nothing more in the game, slight variance made with gear, talent trees and spells. Dialog is pointless and there really is no plot.Basically a mobile game with better graphics. At least there are no microtransactions."
Negative,"very difficult for casual gamers , devlopers forgot casual gamers only hard core gamers can play this game and they forgot to give selecting difficulty level this make the game a nightmare to play and can't complete the 5% also so think twice before buying after that you will regret if you find the game hard"
Negative,"Nice coat of paint over a mostly meh game.  Combat has a weird rhythm and seems very imprecise.  Environment, while initially attractive, gets very repetitive.  Confusing layout w/ little visual waypointing.  Some frustrating early minibosses w/ little indication of optional nature.  Comparison to 2018 God of War is insulting to 2018 God of War."
Negative,"It's embarrassing that the developers are so ashamed of their political beliefs that they opted to ignore all the standards we have in our progressive western society. I do not recommend this game to anyone who has a soul and is a decent person. Of course this game will appeal to racists and Trump voters - they exist. But to the rest of us, the majority, it's just a distasteful attempt at making a Triple A game."

Negative,Horrible playstyle. Solid 5/10
Negative,garbage game asf
Negative,"Everything about this game is breathtaking, the character design, world build, quality, playability - were it not for one little thing: It's WAY too hard. I'm a seasoned old gamer and used to many shenanigans but Wukong is the first game in 40 years that i have to put down and admit i'm just not fit enough to play it. The Wandering Wight and then the White Nobleman in the first chapter completely sucked all the fun out of the game for me and as i'm stuck there due to the linear design this already is the end of my journey to the west. I have nothing against learning bosses moves, rhythms and weaknesses but due to the lack of choosing a game difficulty there's nothing one can do when a difficult boss can't be bested. 60.- for very limited entertainment."
Negative,"If you have RTX 20 series card, better skip this game."
Negative,Played for maybe 30 minutes. Feeled clunky. Uninstalled.
Negative,"nothing but small areas that take a max of 2 minutes to clear between boss fights, very disappointing game."
Negative,optimization is dog sht lots fps drop fighting boss Duplicate Monkeys spell use GG.
Negative,"This game was too overrraaateddddeven sekiro way more better from this stupid chinese dev game10million copy and 90% from china? And want nominated to be GOTY?Keep dreamin 😂😂😂china is one liner eye , not equal with west dev"
Negative,"Such a shame!This game is beautiful, The gameplay is really nice, i'm not personally a huge fan of more bosses than normal enemies but its still fun....BUT.....!!!!!The constant stuttering and freezing issues make this game unplayable, I have tonight spent 5 hours trying every single fix i could find to fix this and nothing works, Until they patch this i wouldnt go near it."
Negative,decent computer and it runs like trash on lowest settings. games dont need to look like movies and only run on super computers.
Negative,I know it says unsupported with steam deck but I have everything on low settings and it’s playing like dog shit. Cut scenes don’t even play smooth.
Negative,"Terrible gameplay, fights, it's just boss after boss, 0 storytelling 0 entertainment"
Negative,just glad its over so I can justify my $60
Negative,Game crashed 3 times in the first 10 minutes.
Negative,"great if your like 7 yrs old & believe in commie fantasy ,,,,,, if it wasnt free for vid card purchase I would've never loaded it . RTX 4070 runs it smoothly on highest [no ray tracing] in my experience"
Negative,"overhyped and overpriced for what the game offers. the only good thing about it is the graphic, the gameplay is boring (no exploration, the game is basically a boss rush). 30/40$ would be the right price imoedit: whoever gave me the jester award needs to get real and stop fangirling over this game. it is good ok, but 60$ for this is too much, carried by the graphics"
Negative,"Very mid, more similar to other boss rush games than souls-like or even GoW games. There's like 3 enemy types and each level consists of your spawn point, a linear area with 2-3 branching areas that ultimately convene into one boss and then repeat endlessly. Was fun at first but got repetitive pretty quickly."
Negative,"this game does not make sense, hitboxes is shit. bosses got 100000000000000000 billion health, and im a stupid monkey with -100000 hp. when i try to dodge hits it wont let me dodge. stupid shit. fck this game. if u want to play this game its better to flush 60€ in the toilet. hate this game."
Negative,"I wanted to share my recent experience with this where I have seen that’s been getting positive reviews. I'm running this on an i7 13th gen, RTX 4080, and 32 gigs RAM, which should be more than capable. However, the game crashes consistently, even before I can get past the intro. Adjusting the graphic settings doesn't help, and it crashes or freezes when starting a new journey.From what I've seen, many reviews suggest under-clocking the CPU/GPU, which seems absurd. Developers should test their games properly before releasing them on platforms like Steam to save us time and money. My expectations were high, but this game falls short like Ubisoft and EA games. Instead of wasting $60 on this, I’d recommend waiting for GOW RAG coming out in two months. Devs, please fix your game before releasing!"
Negative,Please delete the game
Negative,"Not really sure what these purchased reviews are all about. Game runs terribly.1440p, Cinematic, 4090, 32GB Ram, 13900kConstant stutters."
Negative,"Visually great, story is great, but if all you look for in a game is a great story well, quit playing games then. go read a book bud. if you like fighting boss after boss after boss, well then i guess this game is for you. insanely slow progression for virtually nothing. after you beat the 6th boss you finally can gain 10 more damage on your staff. very repetitive thats really why i stopped i seen that the entire game is going to be like the first 10 minutes. Fat L imo"
Negative,"Meh, it's alright, nothing particular stands out.Pretty much overrated. 6/10Sekiro is better.----------------------------------------------------------9/20Storytelling is great, but you only get a story at the end of every chapter. That means you have to go through all the invisible walls and shitty map design to get that little bit of goods.Still 6/10Sekiro is better."
Negative,"simple the game not optimized as it should be. not it became the norm to release a game that is not optimized well enough , so running it on even latest high end gpu+cpu wont be smooth. tons of input lag and popping foliage, i just did a technical run/test. didnt even bother to play it yet and passed the 3 hour mark so i cant even return it sadly"
Negative,"For someone still new to the genre, way too hard.Visually the game is amazing, but in terms of gameplay it's a chain of boss fights with little in between, each of which takes way too many tries to beat - the sense after is not even joy, it's just relief that that crap is over.Some combat mechanics are also really bad, mainly the camera hardly keeping up with fast moving enemies so it's not even possible to see what they are doing, paired with them just not staying in attack range to get damage in.Might come back when games of this type finally introduce a difficulty selector so I can enjoy the story and the visuals instead of having to fight an uphill battle against even the easiest enemies in the game because there is no learning curve other that beating your face into a wall until it crumbles.I have neither the reaction time for the extremely precise and fast reactions required, nor the unwavering focus to make it through arduous boss battles without losing concentration."
Negative,They replaced strong female characters with strong invisible walls.There are no female monkeys in this game but a lot of invisible walls.Only worth on a sale after they added female characters.Refunded.
Negative,"i have been told that this game is not souls like and ended up like one. Clearly unsatisfied. Judge me if you want but, if i want to play a beautiful game with a great senario and big variety of skill set without fighting the same boss 500 times for 4 xp, well its my right."
Negative,Oooo Oooo AAAAH AAAAH stupid fuckin monkey dont even know how told hold a staff
Negative,"trash boss designs and awful performance, overhyped to the maximum"
Negative,the tiger boss makes me depressed
Negative,Too hard Don't play unless you have a game cheat
Negative,Go play roblox boss simulator instead of this garbage
Negative,Horrible hit reg and poorly designed bosses
Negative,"I’ve been counting down the days for Wukong: Black Myth since last year, but this game turned out to be a complete disaster. It crashes every few minutes, throwing me back to the homepage like it’s some kind of joke. This is beyond disappointing—it's infuriating. I’ve never been this frustrated with a game before. If I could, I’d demand a refund immediately because this mess isn’t worth a single cent."
Negative,"The game is 8/10. No death penalty. Stunning environment. Variegated bosses that naturally combined with a nice spell system. The map navigation is flawed and the invisible wall is a pet peeve, but I can live with that.The publisher Hero Game is a -100/10 apparatchik with otherworldly stupidity. Why would you even bring this up while everyone is enjoying the game?‘Game Science’s first major console game, Black Myth: Wukong, is set to be released on Tuesday, and many players are excited for its release. Unfortunately, the game has been embroiled in controversy over the weekend, after a leaked document appeared to show a list of “Do’s & Dont’s” for streamers, asking them not to talk about politics, “feminist propaganda,” and COVID-19. ’This is a fucking suicidal PR move. Why are there so many smart-bottom publishers that are keen to burn up the community by giving them a funny perspective? Helldiver 2 greets you, genius. Go where you belong and do what you should do to yourself."
Negative,"This game needs better optimization. My graphics is 4090 laptop, very high setting, DLAA and 1440P without ray tracing cant remain 60, actually average is only 50-55. And idk why the edge of the character is fuzzy when  i moving the camera that's weird. Only if change to high setting(still DLAA, 1440P without ray tracing), the fps can remain above 60 fps and be stable, approximately average 70fps. BTW i've boosted my laptop at ARMOURY CRATE."
Negative,"Not recommended to purchase for full price, patience for discount price. It basically just a boss rush type game and aren't fun at all.There is theoretically no game level design nor map design at all. The combat system is meh and there are a lot of restriction not allow you to have fluid and smooth battle.Fighting boss one by one make me annoyed and exhausted.The exploration get you almost nothing and there is no map provided as what I say earlier the map design is literally zero. It is such a wasting time to explore because you will often knocked by the invisible wall.As a person who did watch the ""Journey to the West"" I don't really understand what this game, the story trying to tell at all at least from chapter 1 perhaps.This might be GS first time developing a triple AAA game I understand but it still unacceptable with the hype.There could be a chance I change my opinion in future but I am not really recommended for now.The hype disappointed once again."
Negative,Not worth all the hype......very frustrating combat from the start killed it for me............wasnt in the mood for repetitive fighting constantly without the feeling of reward......doubt ill sink another hour into thisedit: played another 30 mins................absolutely awful controls........now not going back to play this until a possible update on combat omg its awful. Have fun starting off pushing a button once to have your monkey man swinging all over the damn place without any feeling of control. almost like QTE events it feels as it just takes over after barely doing commandsedit 2: modded dodge and controls to fix laggy controls....now playable without the feeling of no control over your own character. will update as I progress update: still no enjoyment playing this....I greatly recommend better attack and better dodge mod though if the controls are frustrating you. yes i know kiddies..............get good correct? lolupdate: played even more with some newly added mods. game feels great with them enabled and still recommended
Negative,just another souls game
Negative,As of right now a hard NO. The game is not optimised yet and is very buggy and laggy
Negative,UNREAL ENGINE  IS BROKEN  !  stop making games with it every game that has this engine does this so done with it ! 3 grand pc cant run it yeah right
Negative,Already uninstalled.I won't play this game again before devs adding the map function.
Negative,"Got for free with Nvidia 4000 series (wish I sold it), even with highest settings game just didn't look good. Looks like a game with imported assets of a forest and then sprinkled some characters over the landscape.The first fight scene looks ridiculously bad with white clouds and this game thinks it's a souls game lol.Deleted the game right away as soon as they asked me to  to offer incense at a shrineI don't want any religion in my game!CS:2 go boom!"
Negative,I play games in the little time i have to have fun not play the same boss over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.I will say if you like a difficult game and dont mind pulling your hair out at some points its for you.  just not my cup of tea. Beautiful graphics and it does play pretty smooth.  Just not going to waste my time on something that is going to more irritate me more than give me a little bit of joy in the short time I get to play.
Negative,"Reviewing game after playing to the last boss. I wanted to stop playing well before that, since the game becomes a chore quickly. Not recommending in current state at full price. Might change  my mind if they fix the boss balancing which is my main issue with this game. Considering this game is all about boss fights, this issue is hard to overlook.  Most bosses are too easy but then there are some that are just way too tedious - talking 5 to 10 minutes of near perfect dodging needed. Game goes from too easy to extremely frustrating during these boss fights and this really taints the experience.  I only recall couple of bosses where I thought the difficulty was good. Examples of extremely frustrating bosses that come to mind are twister rat at the end of chapter 2, the Yellow Loong in chapter 4. and the last boss, of course, where the game actually trolls you - what horrible UNFUN experiences! I stopped playing on the last boss because I have seen the whole game at that point and was not having fun figuring out how to tickle his health bar down with my stick excruciatingly slowly while dodging his extra long combos. The developers are clearly lacking in experience with combat design compared to the best in class - like From Software.And fighting with the same staff the whole game gets really boring. Hitting enemies should feel more chunky. Otherwise, combat gets stale quickly.The game has good graphics (would have been great if not for over sharpening and lack of HDR). The art design is not that great - I should be more wowed when my 4080 is maxed. The level design was really lacking (chapter 2 is an exception). I cannot say that exploring levels was fun and exciting - you are just moving through a corridor with a lot of invisible walls and sometime corridors branch out. The game needed a better mix of outdoor and indoor spaces with more exploration and a MAP.The story was hard to follow and the transitions between chapters were weird. The cartoons between chapters were .... strange ... with a weird dichotomy of animation styles. I did not understand how those related to the story. I am not going to read a Journey to the  West to get all of the references and the game did not make me care about any character it presented. Overall a very mixed package with lack of experience from game designers rearing its ugly head pretty often. They should have tested the game play more and did some re-balancing. I am rooting for this game to do well, even thought I wish I did not buy it. We need more single player experiences to do well. But this one is a mixed bad. Get it on sale."
Negative,"Would not recommend the game in it's current state. No map or minimap. Camera is generally pretty bad, some boss abilities seem really unfair / poorly telegraphed. Invisible walls everywhere. Overall gameplay is decent, skill tree is okay.there's a somewhat unintuitive progression blocking interaction that requires an item that may be easily skipped early on, requiring one to go back to a1. a6 is quite odd, why grant so much mobility when there's no real exploration whatsoever. itemization is pretty bland"
Negative,"16 minutes in, still haven't started playing. Performance is completely unplayable. Maybe some other time..."
Negative,"Really pisses me off when these big $100 dollar games cant even get controller remapping right... was super excited to play, ran really well on my 3050 to bad. ill just wait for a sale or a update before i give them my money"
Negative,WORST GAME EVER
Negative,"Actually 0 substance to this game. The zones are 100% linear, like actual straight lines with no secrets, puzzles, lore, etc. Just walk through to fight mini boss/boss rinse and repeat. Same repeated area designs. Basically 99% jungle. The combat=timing+mass X button. Simply in no way shape or form stacks up to the quality of stellar Blades combat. Isn't really a soulsborn game and doesn't have well designed or good enough combat to be a proper action game. No story at all to speak of and some of the industry lows for sound mixing.7/10. Buy cheap later."
Negative,"My personal opinion:Not an open world!!!Game is not interesting. A highly beautiful decorated corridor with the boss at the end. Nothing else. And you are going from one corridor to another and then the next one and next one.I dont like games where there is no progress. Maybe ill buy it later when its discounted. Right now its not worth of its money - its my humble personal opinion.Not even close to Elden Rng but nobody says its something like Elden Ring.Graphics is a +++I'll watch it more on Youtube and may change my mind later. Now I don't want to waste my time on it.PSAnd BTW I didn't find any bugs in game, but when  you want to turn away from the road and getting onto invisible wall - that is lame..."
Negative,"Update: This game is trying to be a super car but they used pizza as wheels. Finished the Game and I defently don't recommend it now, way too easy, bad game and level design and also so much jank. More like the devs name should be game amateurs instead of game science... (They even left on DLSS 3.0 for the credits so you had artifacts in those KEKW).I would prob rate this game a neutral thumb but for the sake of there being WAY too many positive reviews I will give it a negative one since it's on edge. This is mid the game. The combat is mid, the level design is trash, the visuals are great. When not fighting the (so far) easy bosses you are playing more of a walking simulator due to the complete lack of challenge of most normal enemies. If you get this game for anything but sight seeing you should get another game instead. Will update the review once I am done."
Negative,Its only playable on medium settings. I get that it just came out so they are eventually gonna update it(hopefully). I have a 3060rtx and I saw that people with 4090 rtx were having problems too. I hope that it can eventually be playable on higher graphics. But until then i wouldnt recommend buying the game just yet.
Negative,"Okay, changed a few things on the computer and even changed my controllers, let's give it another try. Too bad, it is suffering the same problem than Elden Ring. I have to disconnect everything to ensure the XBox controller to work, and even then, I have input lags and choppiness in the direction, that decides to switch in game from running to walking withjout any reason while the left stick is pushed forward completly. Refunding."
Negative,"Crashong should be called this stupid game. Multiples crash every single time I'm loading it, trying to explore an area or go to boss = crash, load the game = crash. Fuck this. Communist ass lame devs from China fix this shit or give the money back."

Negative,nothing like the book or movie. it should be a monks trying to capture  demons not a monkey killing  bosses. before being coned into releasing the monkey king
Negative,"This game is beautiful but no HDR for a $60, AAA game? really? Also the game in SDR has a horrible black level floor raise so the whole screen is washed out. There are no true blacks in this game. I am on an OLED monitor so it looks really bad. Please fix devs. I even used Lilliums reshade and cant get it to work so far and I have never had an issue using reshade in dx12 games with lilliums hdr fix of course. I cannot recommend this game to anyone that cares about HDR or having good color saturation and true blacks.Edit: When is raytracing getting fixed? The ""medium"" raytracing setting is clearly bugged digital foundry even said they had inquired about the ""medium"" setting and the devs said they were working on a fix."
Negative,"This game while looks very impressive, suffers from a lot of bad game design and game theory decisions. It's clunky combat, easy bosses, terrible level design, and just outright terrible enemy placement makes this game a frustrating experience. None of my deaths felt like I was being bested by the game, but instead cheated. Unlike a Soulslike where most of the time its the player making mistakes, at times there is no room to make any mistakes because the game is programmed to punish your every move making a cheap feeling experience. I one shot 99% of the bosses in this game with ease using a high damage/high crit build and never once even tried to use any other stance. Literally couldn't tell you what they did, I also used the first summon and first transformation throughout the entire game with ease. None of the item progression feels fun or diverse, you just equip the next item that has a green arrow. No thought at all. I also believe that every single boss enters a hyper armor or rage timer when they hit 20% due to how strong they get and how much less they stagger. That's a cheap inflation of difficulty that I don't appreciate in games."
Negative,"Another broken Legacy game that was released before complete optimization : for a game that was marketed to be a souls game that carries a continuation to Chinese legend, this game relies on frame generation! and that's lazy development by Game Science / Tencent that down grades it from souls game to wonky action RPG, don't get me wrong, the ""idea"" of mechanics are great, the lore is grasping my attention, though the base mechanics where this game was release is poor at best. The problem with frame generation is that its unjust and awful for hyper tense gaming, you will always face issues with button registry, where evasion is key skill to get through this game, you'll always get hit before you see it coming, and even win a battle for you see your hit going, and that ruins the experience for me a lot of times. Another major problem with this game is DLSS optimization, I mean DLSS has existed since 2nd gen nVidia cards, and if you want to enjoy your experience hassle free, you'll need a 4090 GPU, I kid you not, I've seen alot of reviews for players with 4070 and 4080 that are struggling to maintain the FPS on solid 60 frames (which am also struggling with) . Now for souls games fan, I don't want the bosses to be nerffed to make the game more playable, Game Science are faced with two options : either invest more into frames optimization and produce a Chinese game the rivals its souls games counter-part, or make heavy nerffs on tough bosses where it ruins this legacy product and becomes playable by children."
Negative,"I don't understand the hype.. it's not for me, man."
Negative,fuck the game fuck the developers fuck wukong fuck ugly lady in ch3 fuck steasm fuck evryone
Negative,"Terrible game. Do not recommend. Its not play its work and I don't get paid to grind. jobless idiots who keep demanding games like this can continue playing. Also riddled with bugs, random freezes and stuttering."
Negative,Its just boss after boss..... Boring!
Negative,"BSOD and ""out of memory"" errors on launch. Bravo"
Negative,"its not that fun, like sekiro lite"
Negative,want to go explore but then the invisible wall god says no with no reason as to why that part of the map is different to the parts that i can explore
Negative,"Just like you, this game is a disappointment."
Negative,As a casual gamer this game just doesn't work. Way too hard if you are not happy to spend an hour learning how to defeat each and every boss (of which there are way too many). Not rewarding to play and just not fun.
Negative,Cheap ass bosses with mechanics built into the fight to be unfair to make it look like a hard boss fight but just turns out to be cheap and annoying as fuck tryin to be Elden RIng-Just beat the game the story and cutscenes are good but late game feels like a chore im glad its over haha GG
Negative,"Gameplay is boring. Cutscenes and graphics are very nice, story seems interesting, but it's not enough to carry the game for me. I could accept having invisible walls and very linear level design if the combat had more ""meat"" to it, but it just doesn't. I'd also probably be a little more accepting of its shortcomings if it didn't have a $60 price tag.This feels like a cinematic AAA game made by an indie studio. Fortunately, it's already successful enough for the devs to go on to make more games. But it's a rough start if you're like me and expected more than a button masher with pretty graphics."
Negative,"Game is too simple and it feels old gen with simple mechanics, comparable to ps3 games, poor enemy AI, physics are crap and there are invisible barriers everywhere ! The storytelling is extreme generic, even the speeches are weak, you can`t feel tension at all.Definitely not worth the price. Wait for gamepass."
Negative,"This game wasn't for me it is a hybrid of game genres and treads the line a little too well for me to like it, too fast for a souls-like too clunky for a classic Action RPG. However I do think this game was built by people who haven't been corrupted by corporate greed so I will give points there since the gaming landscape is ridden with that these days."
Negative,"Game is too hard, no difficulty levels, unless youre a hardcore player, I dont recommend this game"
Negative,This is a boring game.  You wander through the woods fighting easy mobs till you get to another annoying boss fight.  There's not much depth involved.  The crazy characters are neat though.
Negative,And another western game without the capability of fully rebinding keys.
Negative,the more you play this game the worse it gets
Negative,"Game isn't really that fun tbh. The combat is alright but it feels confusing, some bosses have weird timings/no indicators for their attacks. The game looks good but the combat feels all over the place"
Negative,"I mean... it would have been fine if it came out 15 years ago maybe? The combat system isn't very good. It's not precise and demanding like a souls-like, it's not frantic and technical like a Devil May Cry. The standard mobs seem pretty useless, the level design is totally forgettable. Maybe if it was in a Humble Bundle and I was really bored I would play it but it's certainly not worth 60€ so this goes right to refund."
Negative,"Frustratingly difficult and no option to change the difficulty in settings, which is just stupid. It's a beautiful game and I'd like to advance but every boss shouldn't feel like the last boss of a game, especially since there's a million bosses in this game. So many people are complaining about this. I hope the devs take note. There's also no map which seems like a major oversight. I've seen it as a mod but I'm not about that life."
Negative,"Unfortunately, yet another souls clone for souls fans.Already the early bosses in the game are too difficult for an average player. Was it absolutely necessary to make those bosses so difficult? Not even talking about the “wandering wight”, which is not difficult but impossible early in the game – but just story mandatory bosses.It is funny that you claim the game is not a souls clone, but:- still make it similarly difficult - no option to adjust difficulty levelOk the pause menu is there, but if the game still not accessible for most player, what’s the point. Unlike souls games, this one at least has a story. But you can only fully enjoy it if you already familiar with “Journey to the West”. So I guess it is not a copy-past souls clone, but this a game for souls fans, those who find it fun to fight this one boss for 30-50 times in a row, again and again and again and again.If you are looking for a good enjoyable single player, looks elsewhere."
Negative,This is not a souls like with soulslike combat.   You better like dying 20+ times to the same boss.   This was awful.  No fun to be had.
Negative,"Fucking shit game, trash game, waste my money."
Negative,The game runs horrifically on a r7 7800x3d and an rx7900xtx. WITH UPSCALING. Lazy devs can't be bothered optimising their games.
Negative,"fuck this trash ass game, waste of 90 bucks thats for sure. better off buying used condoms"
Negative,Let me change the f****** difficulty.
Negative,"It is a good game, like GOW, but Chinese. And not just a mythology, but everything. Poor level design and unbalanced enemies. Overall the game is great and fun and it's finished, but it's not 96%. more like 80-85, so that's why dislike."
Negative,"YOU SUCK. DO NOT GET THIS GAME UNLESS YOU ARE A NO FRIENDS, NO FAMILY, CURRENTLY-LIVING-IN-YOUR-MOMS-BASEMENT COKE-SNORTING 4CHAN USER. THIS GAME GIVES YOU FUCKING ALIEN-HAND SYNDROME. coming into this game you will 100% get about 3 seizures, might break your pc (they do not pay for damages), this game makes you feel like the protagonist but in REAL LIFE. (except no respawns in real life) playing this game WILL make you have multiple mental disorders (if you dont have them just from buying it) you are basically paying for torture. if you play this game you ARE a masochist. please get yourself checked out. you beat a boss, and dont even have time to feel proud of yourself. you have fucking 29 feet tall bears jumping on you. you do not get a break. only scenario that i would recommend this game for is buying it for someone you hate. (like an in-law) this game is racist to monkeys (PETA SHOULD INVESTIGATE). it makes you have 0 will to live, and WILL ruin whatever braincells you have left. this is self harm in the worst way there is. you should have to sign a life waiver to play it. this game makes me want to have an DNR."
Negative,"The game is decent after playing it. It adheres to the standard 3A quality without any major flaws. However, considering the extreme behavior of some fans: In 2021, I suggested waiting until the game was released before praising it, but I was criticized as being overly positive (OP) and overly enthusiastic. In 2023, I mentioned in a video that the map guidance could be improved, but I was met with backlash claiming that the map guidance was better than that of God of War. It seems that there are very few games with better map guidance worldwide. And that’s where it ended—hundreds of layers of criticism.Regarding the creators’ behavior: They engage in minor hype every few months and major hype every six months. The game has been hyped since four years before its release, surpassing even the hype for Cyberpunk 2077 and Starfield. Additionally, some peculiar statements on Weibo have made people uncomfortable. Not to mention the outrageous blog post from 2013.As a result, discussing this game seems unnecessary; its fans are just another extreme group. The gameplay experience is passable, but severe crashing issues persist, and frame drops are noticeable. I followed all the advice I found online, but the problems persist. Furthermore, the map guidance issue remains, although there have been some improvements. The monster design is mediocre and lacks depth, leaving much to be desired.The combat experience is acceptable, but the mechanics are somewhat chaotic, as even the media has pointed out. In summary:If you want to support a domestic developer using national funds and enjoy a regular dish, I strongly recommend it.If you’re seeking a gourmet experience, you might want to reconsider. After all, God of War 4 wasn’t satisfying, and God of War 5 isn’t either.If you believe this is the company’s hard-earned achievement, think again. The creators themselves admitted they had a smooth path thanks to government funding.Speaking of that, why would one choose to buy dishes from local chefs who use the best ingredients but produce rather ordinary cuisine, when for the same price, they could dine at a foreign Michelin three-star restaurant?After all, if at the same price, foreign cuisine offers a grand feast while domestic dishes are merely a small plate of pickles, insisting on the latter isn’t patriotism; it’s foolishness.游戏玩了玩还可以，标准3A，无功无过，但是考虑到粉丝的逆天行为：我2021年建议等出来大家再好好吹，被打成op和神神；2023年我就在某视频下面提了一嘴说地图引导可以改进，被喷这地图引导比战神好，全世界有几个比这个地图引导好的游戏，然后就没有然后了，反正三百多层吧，全是骂我的。以及主创的逆天行为：几个月一个小炒作，半年一个大炒作，发售前四年开始炒作，比2077和星空还能炒；以及奇葩微博言论，我不说是不是什么歧视，但确实令人感到不适；以及2013年在微博发表的逆天博客。由此，这游戏已经没有讨论的必要了，这游戏的粉丝只是另一个极端罢了。这游戏体验还行，但是闪退问题严重，而且掉帧特明显，不知道是不是优化没做好，我按照网上的建议做了所有的工作，依旧不行。除此之外，地图引导问题依旧存在，不过有所改正，同时，怪物设计一般般，而且比较空洞，感觉不太好。战斗体验还行，但是机制比较混乱，这一点媒体也有提到，这没什么好说的了总的来说，如果是想支持本国厂商，用着国家的钱，做出来一盘普通炒菜的玩家，强烈推荐；如果是想体验到珍馐佳肴的，还是省省吧，毕竟战神4不香了还是战神5不爽了；如果是觉得这是公司自己的努力的成果，那还是算了，这公司主创自己都说了拿了政府的钱一路绿灯才通过的；不过话说回来，同样的价格，能买到国外厂商的米其林三星，为何非要买国内普通厨师，拿着最好的食材做出来的很一般的菜肴呢？毕竟，如果同样的价格，国外做的是满汉全席，国内做的是一小碟咸菜，你还非要吃国内的，那不叫爱国，那叫蠢。"
Negative,if your running AMD dont but the game until its fixed cant get passed opening scene.. pre ordered the game to play the 19th only to find out it you cant play until 10pm couldve waited the few hrs to play the 20th most of these reviews have to be bots
Negative,"Windowed mode is just full screen without borders, can't change the size. I prefer to play in a smaller window rather than cover my entire ultrawide monitor. I'm gonna have to kick this one back for the lack of options. You all can have fun, but this irritates me. Spent my whole time just in the options trying to figure this out."
Negative,why there is no difficult mode....one stage i played for 30 times but still stuck on that same level..i just want enjoy the story...
Negative,"This game desperately needs a story mode. I would love to explore the world and lore, but I simply do not have the time to fight bosses over and over again. Not fun, will not be buying expansions or DLC."
Negative,Overhyped for the herd. UE5 ia the most fucking bugging hyped shit.
Negative,A negative review 'cause I don't want to play it until you give us the option to customize more controls and support for mouse with more that 3 buttons.
Negative,needed more 2 years of cooking in the oven.
Negative,"Mediocre Soulsbourne that would get zero attention if it wasn't from China and supposedly anti ""woke"". And I'm as anti ""woke"" as they come. This is a 6/10 if there ever was one. Avoid unless you want to make a statement."
Negative,"Returned. Thank god it took me less than two hours to realize this game is boring. Souls like.. but worse. Combat is repetitive and the maps are clumsy and dull. Not open world.. just following a jenky path. Honestly just get Elden ring.. and if you already have that, this wont scratch any itch for you,"
Negative,"Update:I don't want to give a negative review, but there's currently a bug with the PS5 controller that I have to let everyone know about. If you're using a PS5 controller and playing on a PC, I suggest setting the speaker output to the PS5 controller (DualSense Controller) in order to fully experience the detailed haptic feedback. If you're using external speakers, you won't be able to get the refined vibration feedback. Additionally, when I connect the controller via Bluetooth, for some reason, I frequently experience input command losses, though I'm not sure if this issue is unique to me."
Negative,"Game is boring af. Another souls game wannabe except without it's charm. Sekiro had satisfying combat, Elden ring had massive open world and a doll waifu. This games story felt like a chore to watch. Cutscenes are extremely long and boring, it felt like they deliberately padded them out so you would moss your refund option. Since the game is chinese i had to play with english dub, and oh boy, ALL THE DIALOGUE in the game sounds like crackheads behind 7/11 fishing for a fight. I legit didn't understand the plot, sounded like ""get your powers back for the sake of getting yor powers back"". The first combats tutorial was just press x for a light attack. That's it.... i dunno, maybe few hours down the road the game will pick up speed, but game about combat with boring combat sounds like a terrible game."
Negative,"Meh, not my thing"
Negative,"nothing good, can't even get pass the shade compliation"
Negative,game is full of invisible walls and it's woke...............Also the graphics are crap
Negative,1- performance issues 2- Overpriced3-Overpriced4-Overpriced
Negative,"too hard, nothing else then fight boss."
Negative,"Nice graphics. The story is pretty weak. The game is just way too hard, I am already stuck after about an hour and I'm done with it."
Negative,"It's really boring and monotonous and you're constantly getting gameplay interrupted with cutscenes of characters saying obvious things. combat is really unresponsive and this game being marketed as a souls like is just a blatant lie, it's nowhere near the same level of polish or intensity or freedom or trust in the player. it's just a basic 3rd person action game. The visual design is pretty good though."
Negative,"-Intriguing prologue, the whole game is a piece of shit-Same monsters and bosses-No story-Characters are empty, they only give quests-Monotonous combat-Why can't parry attacks?-The graphics are good, but the level design sucks. I literally don't understand where I can go and where I can't-The game is very easy, almost all bosses killed from the first time-Why do bosses want to kill us at all?-No secrets, riddles, etc.-You can't choose anything-The game is linear and corridor-Music. Can anyone even hear it?-Most of items are useless garbageCrafting system sucks, upgrading system sucks, leveling is very strange here, no stats or enything, and so on and so forth. The game is very boring, the world is empty. As a soulslike it's on the level of Nioh, Lies of P and Dark Souls 2. If you liked those, I wouldn't be surprised if you like Black Myth: Wukong as well. I wish you luck eating shit"
Negative,"Get it only on discount graphics does not worth it. 96% positives from 99% chineese with gameplay time of 2 hours,probably they get some social credit points for upvoting national product and if not they will probably will go to some reeducation camps AND that is all good just that it don't reflect the truth.Have all the classic flaws of dark souls series like broken camera next to a wall,bosses breaks camera while disappearing or jumping. But the best is this games business card - invisible walls. I am  now fighting a boss which just run thru invisible arena wall and shoots at you his crap from there. Just annoyance of bugs and glitches is too much alone not to give high rating for this game. You remember archers in Sekiro? OH YEAH they have them too here,some on unreachable platforms above the ground. And platforming in this game is just awful.Another UBER annoying thing is no map or other progress tracker. You just go to random places killing random bosses and chapter is finished. Then I googled some sidequest dude for which I could not find some items and VUALIA!!! it seems I missed like 40% map piece just because last chapter boss was in the middle and I had no clue because you must be drawing map yourself I guess. AND btw that side quest gives an item which makes boss battle easier. Can the progression be made even dumber?And even this is well made game,but chineese mythology doesn't grow on me. At least I get the feeling that I don't understand what most NPCs are talking about nor I remember the names of some big enemies like luangxianhu which makes me 0 invested in a story. And your main character says 0 words in whole game with a face like he wants to go to toilet all the time, which is not helping to immerse with a story or atmosphere.In short it's a boss fighting game with it's own flaws and advantages,but all that running and mushroom picking becomes boring.Same with a graphics and well made stones and walls all gets boring very fast because all that you looking is next boss fight.And I did not finished the game yet even with turbo push 1 light attack button joystick. It is just THAT boring."
Negative,"While I would not recommend this game, it is just because I, personally, am not a fan of this type of game.However, after spending a couple hours with it, I can see this game being a hit with the souls-like community. The game is beautiful, runs great (on a 4090 anyways), and the combat feels good. So yeah... +1 to the devs, despite not being a fan myself."
Negative,sizin yapacağınız oyunu sikim
Negative,"game crashed first boss, good to know what im going to expect for the rest of the game. refunded"
Negative,Terrible game. Graphics are mid not sure what everyones saying they are so good for. Runs like crap
Negative,Save your money for Ragnorok which is  next month.
Negative,"I don't leave reviews often, but this is one I'll have to do it for.Don't buy this game.The graphics are abysmal, and it's completely unoptimised at the moment. There's this awful blur around the edges of all the enemies and around Wukong, making it difficult to see what you're doing and what they're doing, leading to some of the most frustrating gameplay I've had in a long time.Wait until they fix it, then get the game on sale. Not worth the ridiculous price tag right now."
Negative,"To mention this game in the same breath as ""The Witcher 3"" and ""God of War"" is a joke and a disgrace to the reviewer. It is nowhere near the quality of those games—it's like their dumb little brother.Many players have already pointed out what's wrong with “Black Myth,” so this may be repetitive, but:☑ There’s no real story. Yes, you have a goal, but every boss fight and NPC encounter feels disconnected, lacking any real connection to the narrative. Why are you even fighting them?☑ No bond with the character. What are his reasons for going on this quest instead of simply sitting back and enjoying life?☑ There’s no real freedom. You’re just led by the hand through a series of corridors.☑ At the same time, there’s no map, which is infuriating.☑ I’m only 4 hours in, and I can already feel the repetitiveness. It’s fight after fight, just mashing buttons without much thought. There’s little to no strategy involved. If you die in a boss fight, all you have to do is memorise their moves, go back, and repeat the mash-dodge combo until you get it right.☑ No real sense of progression. Yes, you add skill points (called Sparks here), but they make so little difference that you barely notice any change.☑ The graphics: yes, they’re okay-ish, but… Maybe it’s because the world of this game feels so tight and small that you don’t have any “wow” moments. There’s not much to appreciate.The popularity of this game and the high ratings it’s receiving are baffling."
Negative,"realised Black Myth Wukong initials are BMW..... developer saving up for  new car? xDtoo much cutscenes, also have read on forum people skipped bosses to find them gone later.....game looks beautifull, but i feel thats more to  UE5 engine, on rails, invisible walls, slow replenishment of mana , feels like they tried to add this so 15 hours playthrough would be 20 hour playthrough .....I have requested a refund for the game."
Negative,"Whiteclad Noble is the most unbalanced boss fight in any game I've ever played in my entire existence on this f'ing planet. There is not one movement frame of his that leaves him vulnerable to a stun lock. Once you start hitting him, he can interrupt any of your moves and do insane damage. His movement animations are so unbelievably impossible to predict. The only chance you seem to have is doing a perfect dodge on a move, hit him once, back away, repeat 1,000x. OH AND HE HAS A SECOND PHASE AND THIS IS JUST THE END OF CHAPTER 1. Seriously, F this game. Dark Souls 2 has less BS than this communist turd."
Negative,Not a good game in my opinion very bad and evil game
Negative,"Bad graphics, horrible dialogue, atrocious character designs. Give this one a pass."
Negative,"First, some triggering words: quarantine, isolation, covid-19, taiwan, Uyghur genocide, tainanmen massacre, winnie the poohwomen>>>men Now that we're done with that, let's proceed to the game.The biggest upside of this game is that it looks nice. However, unless you have supercomputer, you won't be able to enjoy the view outside of screenshots. The reason for that is terrible optimization. I have better specs then recommended, yet it stuttered all the time and crushed after a few minutes. Even people who have rtx 4090 complain about fps drops and crashes, the forums are full of such threads.I am happy for a million or so chinese people currently playing the game that their country finally produced an AAA title, but I have to refund it until they fix it or I get a much, muuuch better pc. (Also, the first thing the game asks you when you turn it on is permission to collect your personal information. What do they need it for?)"
Negative,"Just cant recommend, the timing of the game feels wrong."
Negative,i like the wukong story and this game was really good im saying negative for shit and giggles
Negative,Too many bosses.  but i cant find my boss here.to hard.
Negative,Not accessible to those with bad reflexes. No difficulty options at all. Otherwise the game seemed really good. Great graphics. Ran mostly smooth on my 4090 but with occasional drops. Looks great at gameplay distance. Textures fall apart up close. Story seemed really cool. Gameplay was basically a boss rush with cheaty moves.
Negative,"I received this game with the purchase of a 4070 GPU. Although my profile shows many hours played, I accidentally left the game running, so I've only actually played for about three hours. I've decided to put this game on hold until the developers address some of their past actions and misogynistic posts. There's a lot of debate about whether their intentions were lost in translation, but it's clear from their job postings IMAGES that they intended to attract developers who objectify women.In addition to that, they have tried to suppress political discourse, particularly anything they deem as ""feminism propaganda."" For a studio with a CEO that supposedly gave the middle finger to Mao, it's a very convenient stance to take in a country that still faces significant struggles in the area of women's rights. While I'm not usually someone who takes up social justice causes, as I believe we sometimes overreact in the West, I do think there are places where people don't enjoy the same privileges, and where your race or gender can make life miserable. That's not the kind of world I want for anyone.As for the game itself, while the difficulty is refreshing and could serve as a good introduction to Souls-like games, there is a lot of inconsistency in boss difficulty. One boss took me three hours to beat, while I defeated two others in just a few minutes. The regular enemies are too easy, and unfortunately, the story suffers from mediocre translations (at least in Spanish), making part's of the legend rhymes come across goofy.I was actually drawn to the story and even plan to buy a copy of Journey to the West, as I was happy to see how people connected this game with their childhood memories. I want to understand media that has had such a massive impact on the world. However, as of now, this version of the story doesn't offer anything that I can't find in other games in my library, or in books that actually already considered woman rights in a more forward looking manner 500 years ago."
Negative,"1. No mini map available. So I was trapped in map for hours until I followed the walkthrough,2. The bosses are very hard to kill. I have to use trainer"
Negative,If you want to support a super misogynistic games company then this is the game for you
Negative,if you are a chinese woman with self harm issues: contact me and we can work something out to change this review to positive
Negative,Is chinese mythology really this silly and stupid or did they play it up for this game? Can we get a souls-like based around a better mythology like Norse or Greek.
Negative,The developers are misogynists
Negative,"Averaged 57 fps on Very High with FSR3 on a 7900XTX and 7950X with 64gb of DDR5, game is not optimised for AMD cards can't say I'm surprised, imagine spending a year on ""optimisation"" and it still runs like a horse run over by a Tiger II. Thanks for the clowns guys enjoy your slop!"
Negative,"Yet another dark souls clone, no map or mini-map of any kind, no quests or missions you just run around killing monsters not knowing where to go next and just hoping that you go the right way. without a map you don't know where to go and even if you had a map you still don't have any quests so what is the point of the game ?? just randomly killing monsters and hoping for the best ?? this ""soul's like"" is the worst genre ever."
Negative,While the story and gameplay has been very enjoyable and high quality - the actually game performance itself leaves much to be desired. This is review is roughly 3 months after launch the devs have still decided to not optimize their game for non-NVIDIA machines. I have a 13 gen i7 CPU and XTX7900 GPU. Even capping my frame rate at 60 FPS and setting the graphics to med/low I am unable to play without large drops in FPS (as low as 11 FPS) to the point it is ruining the experience for me. I really hope the devs get their act together and make this game not just a showcase for the latest NVIDIA GPUs.TL;DR: Game would be worth the price if it was actually playable
Negative,"frequent flickering really annoyed me, other games were fine except this game, my pc is powerful enough to run it but maybe this game still not fully optimise. i had do ever ""solution"" but nothing works for me, getting stuck at chapter 2 cause of flickering and the wind attacks were invisible, not really care much cause i had already finish this game 3 times on my ps5, just wantedd to try it on my pc"
Negative,"After 5 hours i still can not like this game. I like the world, the setting, the audio is phantastic, as the graphics, the story. Everything is great besides the combat, especially the bosses. I play soulslike games since Demon's souls. What i love about them is the non-linear approach you can have. Ofc there are some key bosses that you need to kill before continuing the story. But I can always explore the world until you find other stuff, equipment, level up other skills, weapons, armour, spells. If you dont manage to kill a certain boss, go to another area, come back later when you feel strong enough. Wukong has none of that. The levels are tube-like, with nothing to explore. Yes you can find some very few spells on the way. But they dont change the tactics in combat, especially not against bosses. The only thing you can do is dodge. Dodge, wait for a small opening, chip some damage, wait for stun spell, repeat. There are no different approaches but dodging, dodging, dodging. I believe searching the level area makes up 10% of time, while fighting and dodging in bossfights is 90%.Each boss gets more and more spongy. Their movesets have built-in irregularites that make them even less predictable to dodge, overall just annoying (e.g. Fire bear teleportation in second phase when he flies over the battlefield. You hear the indication on 4 of his attacks, but not for the last teleport before he leaves teleportation state).And after defeating the area boss, you most certainly get equipment with benefits against that certain boss you just killed. That just doesn't make any sense at all!I understand why people like it and i would love to like it more. I just can't get warm with it."
Negative,"This thumb-down review is because that the fanbase of this game defends it so fervently that they seem to think only praise is acceptable, leaving little room for criticism. despite its flaws, is still quite enjoyable. The most glaring issue is the lack of a mini-map, which clashes with the actual map design and visual layout.Wukong’s design of having no mini-map conflicts with the actual map design. While the no-map design was introduced during the Half-Life era, its main advantage was to enhance immersion and stimulate the desire to explore, the lack of guidance greatly increases the risk of players getting lost, resulting in frustrating moments—this becomes the most severe negative feedback.The game’s developers did little to remedy this issue, almost as if they were intentionally creating a ""getting lost"" mechanic. Though the map features noticeable landmarks (such as the tornado in Chapter II), the complex map design makes it difficult for players to recognize these landmarks. The map is filled with forests, snowy woodlands, and multi-layered caves, with paths that are intricate, repetitive, symmetric and difficult to navigate due to obstructed views, chaotic lighting, and poorly defined boundaries, which only increases the chances of getting lost. Air walls and inconsistent guidance further disrupt the player’s exploration.Moreover, the map is cluttered with a large number of collectibles, monsters, and side quests, which burdens the player, often leading them into the main boss area while missing side quests. Sometimes players need to reload earlier save files to make up for missed content. Even with torches used as guides, the effectiveness of the torches is intentionally weakened, making it harder for players to find their way. When graphic effects are enhanced, the map becomes darker, vegetation more chaotic, and torch positions are often hard to spot. The design seems intentionally constructed to mislead players off the correct path.For instance, after transforming into a Golden Cicada, the Land Keeper instructs you to ""follow the light."" However, due to the narrow focus, blurred vision, and many paths leading astray, many players miss the key NPC, Guangzhi. The initial promotional video made the path guidance quite obvious, but in the final version, the route is extended, and torch locations are altered, making it easier for players to veer off course.Additionally, changes to the cave entrances leading to the main quests, such as removing earlier guiding elements like the Land Keeper’s tips and light markers, show that the developers have the ability to provide effective guidance but choose not to. This is reminiscent of the design in The Stanley Parable, where players are unknowingly manipulated by the developers.I myself was interrupted by the design of getting lost in Elysium Valley and only managed to pass it using an external mini-map. Even so, later parts of the game still feature new ""discouragement"" tactics. Even with the use of an external mini-map, players still face issues with map design, such as the vast emptiness and monster overpopulation in places like Turtle Island, Elysium Valley, Little Thunder Temple, and Huaguo Mountain, which leads to repetitive grinding and a loss of agency in exploration. Especially for exploration-driven players, the game artificially drags out its pacing, frustrating players and exhausting them.For example, after leaving the prison, the side quests in Elysium Valley and the overly long map design in Little Thunder Temple quickly wear down players’ patience. The long stretches of travel before boss fights often make players feel like they’ve taken the wrong path.In contrast, the designs of latter part of ACT 4 are noticeably better, with optimized map scales, guidance, and visibility. Wukong is a Souls-like game, and its boss fights, due to the lack of unified visual and auditory cues, are highly random in their attack patterns. Sekiro made modifications by including obvious attack indicators like the ""danger"" sign, giving players a chance to react. Dark Souls rewards successful parries and backstabs with high damage. In Wukong, dodging is prioritized above all, and although the ROCK SOLID move can interrupt boss attacks, it still consumes mana and has limited effectiveness. Timing light and heavy attacks for breaks also requires memory as your main tactics. Even if successful, players may still be hit by the boss's follow-up attacks. Many bosses employ aerial attacks or combo moves, forcing players into a passive position. The learning curve is steep, requiring multiple deaths to learn attack patterns.This design is not wrong but reflects a deliberate choice in the game's direction—Wukong's boss fights test not reaction speed or technical ability but players’ patience. With enough persistence and tolerance for damage, players can defeat bosses. Each boss has different attack patterns, ensuring that the fights remain fresh. However, this makes the game's difficulty very high, and only players who persist can succeed.Limited move set: Though the game offers three combat stances, basic attacks remain identical. Switching weapons, such as using spears, doesn’t add much variety to combat moves or depth. The spear’s attacks are fresh at first, but the hitbox issues make them impractical in most situations, so players default to using staff attacks to progress.Spell Binder too strong, and other spells are with low effectiveness: During the fight with the Little Yellow Dragon, other spells, which had been effective before, becomes significantly weaker, and players have to rely on Spell Binder (which disables magic and boosts attack power). Since this boss fight I never used any other spells.Soul and Spirit System: Though the game offers a variety of monster spirits for transformations, many spirits serve similar functions. The cost of upgrading them is high, and in practice, only one or two spirits are typically used to complete the game. The innovation of the ""Non-able"" spirit is an exception but remains a rare instance of deep interaction design.Hidden Crafting System: The equipment system, which first appears in Chapter 3, is effectively hidden. Many players miss the opportunity to upgrade their gear early on due to the lack of guidance, leading them to overlook important systems. The design’s lack of clarity around the crafting system undermines player autonomy and choice. There are severe issues with the game’s guidance design, where critical systems and content are hidden intentionally, leading players to miss important choices like Guangzhi or the Gourd Immortal. Without the access to current information sources, players might never know what they’ve missed. Furthermore, the game’s true ending requirements are tedious, and players who don’t follow guides or check the map are unlikely to experience the full ending. While some players argue that missing out on these elements doesn’t affect progression, the design still restricts the game’s depth and exploration.Overzealous defenders of this design, particularly among the Chinese gaming community, are inadvertently preventing a discussion on how the game could have implemented better systems."
Negative,Add nvidia reflex or something feels like i'm fighting input delay more than the boss
Negative,PLEASE ADD..... MOUSE 4 AND MOUSE 5 !!!!I frequently use it for other games and its a very common thing in today's gaming mouse.
Negative,"I like this game, but I find myself not wanting to come back to it after trying to level up and get better. Hours spent trying to improve but I find, that unlike Elden Ring, I was getting bored running in the same areas just to level up. The mobs are pretty easy also and then the mini bosses / bosses are like 10 times harder so it feels like there's no way to practice on any stronger enemies. I think Id have a better time if there was a verity of challenging enemies and larger areas to explore but its very linear. I only compare this game to Elden Ring because its got the hard part its missing the exploration to keep you interested. I wish I didn't spend so much time on this game or I would have gotten a refund."
Negative,its so good that its actually bad
Negative,"I keep getting ""FAILED SAVE"" errors.AndThis game is INSANELY hard !We should be able to adjust the difficulty level."
Negative,i do not reccomend very buggy
Negative,"The game is beautiful, no doubt, but in playing it I have found where the designers have intentionally stopped you from dodging or parrying, in a timely fashion, during a boss fight. I had plenty of stamina and health, in fact they were both full when trying to dodge. I was curious enough to go back and try 3 different controllers to see if my main one was having issues.  Then I started the game over again 4 times. Maybe it is my computer, but if they have put artificial blocks to retard or block game play, that is chicken sh*t."
Negative,"I really liked the overall of the Game. But a big downside of this hole Game are the bosses, and no I am not complaining about the difficulty, I am someone who loves souls like Games but this one had some very buggy bosses, where sometimes it was just luck based. And what I absolutely hate are programmed definitive hits which you can't dodge or parry but those were for like 2 bosses not more. What I really think destroyed my experience is that at the end they made the player succeed more than 4-5 bosses one after another. At least in souls--like games from Fromsoftware you were nicely awarded by a new region, new weapons, new armor, new playstyle each time you beated a boss but here the ony reward I got was one Skill point and armor and weapons only for World bosses that wouldn't even be usefull in the final chapter and certainly not in the endboss fight. It's like having done all I have done before was useless and without any reason other than farming Skill points which you would get more than the double by just killing some foes.Yes the game has a lot to offer from story to grafik and secrets. I loved it. Even tho I encountered some serious stuttert in the cutscenes of chapter 4 (I have a 4070 Super and a Ryzen 7 7800 3xd)Overall I can only say that my experience wasn't rewarding enough and I feel like having wasted my time other than having experienced a good story but I could of have watched it on youtube instead."
Negative,"This was hard for me to say no about recommending this game. It is a masterpiece in a lot of ways, beautiful, epic cut-scenes and fight scenes, cool enemy and character design, great story. It has everything you could want in a game. The problem is, that in its current state at the time of me writing this review, there is some sort of input bug that causes your buttons to get stuck within your quick menu on controller. For example, you would hold R2 to bring up your quick menu on a PS controller, but as soon as that menu was opening, there would be a button, sometimes even multiple buttons that will be stuck within that menu and automatically press, making you either use the wrong ability, use an ability at an inopportune time, or rendered completely unable to use any abilities or items at all. It was a nuisance that I dealt with for a good portion of the game because I liked the game so much, but ultimately ended up eventually giving up due to the necessity of being able to use items and abilities in some of the later harder battles. If i really buckled down I could probably continue and beat these bosses, but at this point it has just become more frustrating than it is worth and adding literally hours onto fights that would probably be able to be whipped out in 4-5 tries if the abilities would work as intended. I will wait to hear if there is a patch or something that fixes this issue, but until then, a bit upset at paying premium price for a game that has a game breaking bug."
Negative,"on a snake like boss you get stun locked on his light attacks, however you cannot stun lock him he can hit you out of mid air during your heavy attack because the game for some reason still registers your feet hit box on the ground when it is your staff that gets hit. it is inconsistent when it comes getting fucked with no lube to at least getting a reach around. i understand this game is meant to be hard however mario on the n64 was hard but consistent there were no buggy variables like this games random ai move generator that allows sub boss characters to spam boss moves but boss characters to be easy pimp slap around."
Negative,"The videos were more entertaining, cant change some key binds and game gets boring trying to beat the same enemy over and over and over again."
Negative,a waste of money not all gamers are the same this game is fucking hard not enjoyable at all stupid game
Negative,keep on losing
Negative,what if we made darksouls but... not fun
Negative,Crashes a lot and annoyingly difficult
Negative,"chapter four, and suprume inspector those two things made me hate this game"
Negative,"buddah just turn gold and take no damage, first boss fight i've ever had in any game that managed to bore me out of my mind, terrible design"
Negative,"this game had a lot of potential, especially with the combat aspect. the combat mechanics are obviously poorly made and not thought out. its a basic spam the same move type game and mostly relies on abilities to either stun bosses for as long as possible or get as much damage in as you can while they cannot attack you. this is made obvious when fighting the bosses, as every single one was made with a similar idea: be as annoying as possible.first of all, movement. the dodges in this game felt hard to grasp, even after having hundreds of hours in souls-like games. the immunity frame window is small and you can still be hit nearing the end of the roll. movement in general is clunky and makes wandering around the map while having to deal with lesser enemies really frustrating, especially when actually fighting them. its most noticable in boss fights which includes the distance from where wukong engages with attacks and that there are no jump attacks, just a thrust away.speaking of bosses, they are the most infuriating in terms of mechanics. after coming from games like elden ring and dark souls, where enemies usually take their time and wind up their attacks, it took me some time to adjust to the opposite in this game. but it honestly gets out of hand later in the game. bosses have no indicator at all for when they are going to attack which leaves you always uncertain when you should attack or not. if its not a fast attack, its a weird wind-up which is hard to predict when it actually hits, as stated before, it hits instantly. its confusing to play between quickly dodging to waiting to dodge. combos done by bosses have attacks which are horribly spaced out which makes it hard to dodge the whole thing because of the small immunity frames. however, the most annoying part is the amount of times you get stun locked during combat. some heavy attacks from bosses have the ability to completely sweep you off your feet, which forces you into an animation of getting up which takes around 5 seconds and you cannot dodge or jump out of it. in addition, in elden ring for example, even if you are recovering / dodging and you press your flask button, you still drink it when you get out of any animations and are available to do so. in here, you cannot. this left me in many situations where i press the button to heal but it does not do anything and end up dying shortly after. combat also gets very repetitive and boring and stances are very situational. i also often get cancelled out of my heavy attacks because bosses hit me and i stagger, which is very annoying.the world is unpleasant to navigate. its full of invisible walls which make paths harder to spot, especially in chapter 4, where its almost impossible to know where the right way to go is. there is no indicator where to go in most of the game, other than the little smoke trails to the shrines. enemies are spammed throughout the games free world which makes it especially annoying discovering areas or running back to bosses, since in most boss fights the enemies can actually get into the arena and damage you, resulting in a stun lock and death. the game explains the story in a confusing way too, the 'movies' at the end of each chapter are entertaining and well made, but do not speak to me.in conclusion, this game is not balanced at all. i admit that it is a good game for the company, seeing how the only other games they made before this one were for mobile. however, good graphics dont necessarily make a good game. 5/10"
Negative,"To the point=========================A fun but obnoxiously long souls-like that just seemingly decided boss difficulty randomly.Good Stuff=========================- Can't deny that the game looks great and each of the areas in the game are beautiful, perfectly complementing the lore and settings with lots of ways to explore- There is an incredible amount of content and the maps get larger every level culminating in a fantastically huge final level. Personally, this annoyed me by the end but for people that want to hunt for secrets and collect everything there is an amazing value for your money here.- The combat, once you figure out the ebb and flow and usage of focus points/varied combos, becomes very fun with you getting to take full advantage of Wukongs repetoire. This gets enhanced further as you continue to get more and more spells and transformations through out the game.- The music is usually very subdued but I really enjoyed the soundtrack. It seems to really pick up during tense moments in fights as opposed to other souls-likes where you get nonstop latin chanting after going through a fog gate.Bad Stuff=========================- Boss difficulty is all over the place. Some bosses in the final chapters are absolute jokes compared to ones in the earlier zones. I'd be surprised when I got stuck on some optional sub-boss only for the chapter boss to get mowed over.- The 4 banes, this games status effects, are layered on so thick in the back half of the game, it gets incredibly annoying. For instance, on one map, nearly every enemy poisons you and does so in 2-3 hits. On another zone, it's nearly every enemy having hte ability to set you on fire. Don't get me started on the many many bosses that inflict status effects, as most of them seem to inflict you instantly and constantly meaning if you miss a single dodge it completely changes the fight. It would be great if they lift up less aggressively.- A map. Fuck's sake does this game need a map. The aforementioned levels are massive and it's very easy to take a wrong turn and get lost or miss one of the games many obtuse secret areas.- Theres a big amount of invisible walls, which I understand is somewhat of a necessity, but there are a lot of them placed in spots where you'd imagine you'd be able to explore. Without the previously mentioned map, this can make aspects of exploration frustrating.- For those unfamiliar with Journey to the West ( like me) a lot of references are just completely wasted or things make no sense. Vagueness is a staple of a souls-like game's lore so maybe some folks will really like this"
Negative,Its beautiful and not fun at all.
Negative,the game would not even run and now i cant get a refund
Negative,Black Myth Wukong feels incomplete.  Save your hard earned money.  Final Fantasy 16 is a better option.
Negative,Act 3 crashes constantly. Cant even get out of the cave
Negative,Consistently crashes on absolute lowest graphics settings even though I have a 3080
Negative,"It's ight, pacing sucks ass in chapter 3 and 4. Chapter 1 and 2 were pog though"
Negative,Air wall everwhere. get stuck constantly in boss fight
Negative,Maybe this game is not for me. I have got stuff to do besides sit down and attempt to defeat one for hours on end.I would like to enjoy a game and not stress about it so I am uninstalling it. It's a well developed game without a doubt but the dev's seem to have taken pride in creating a game that is deliberately tough to beat. Maybe 10 years ago I'd have enjoyed it.I don't think gamers would have complained if there was an option to play it on less challenging mode as such.
Negative,It started out well enough but I lost interest once I made it to the snowy area.  It became a chore to play like DA:VG.
Negative,the game is not for an casual gamer and i feel like the movement is a little tricky to me when i dodge..is not for me .
Negative,"fix it please, I see everything gray like I'm playing in beta test scenario plus when I get into a dark place, is literally dark, I can't see anything.Worst 60 USD by far."
Negative,"If you like invisible walls, unresponsive controls and a unfun version of dark souls, then this is the game for you!"
Negative,Finished the game final boss was cool game is still bad overall
Negative,"DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. THE ZHU BAIJE BOSS IS UNBEATABLE I HAVE SCREENSHOT PROOF. LOOK AT MY PROFILE AND HEAD TO SCREENSHOTS, I HAVE BEEN DODGING ALL OF HIS ATTACKS BUT I CANT EVEN DO DAMAGE INPUT ON HIM. I HAVE DONE SO MUCH DAMAGE AND STILL NO HIT. THIS IS A SCAM THIS GAME WANTS YOU TO KEEP HAVING MORE TRIES."
Negative,"I played the first chapter and in order to defeat a boss, you need to play it 10-20 times. This is not giving me any pleasure. After a work day I just need to have some fun and be able to adjust the difficulty for my level. I don't plan to compete in tournaments - just to have fun. I don't get why ppl are so enthusiasts about this game. It is boring and with no real exploration. You have a path that you need to follow and that's it. For me it is one of the most disappointing games I played in a long time."
Negative,"it looks good in still frames. the combat feels... clunky, there's something weird going on with input delay that i can't be bothered to really pinpoint but the feel of the game is simply off. the performance is horrible, the game looks good but it's very poorly optimised... the devs clearly relied on frame generation as a crutch to avoid optimising the game properly. the plot will be hard to follow if you don't know the original mythology of sun wukong, and the english voice acting is really bad. the only reason i haven't refunded and the only reason why i might actually finish this game is because i exceeded 2 hours of playtime trying to figure out why my 2080ti was having such a difficult time running this game."
Negative,Just Play sekiro.
Negative,game de qua deo dang choi
Negative,I beat the duskveil and the game crashed during the cutscene… there’s no way for me to advance past that point because it has be back in the boss fight area with no boss.. you guys need to fix these bugs
Negative,64gbs for a update and now there giving me some weird error code when im trying to play like i pirated it mf i paid $60 for the game yall better stop to make it worse im broke and now i cant even play the game i paid for
Negative,Changed my life!!!!!!! so good i literal cried when i got to witness vid eat his father :)
Negative,"Honestly not that good, healing is unresponsive, combat is wonky, bosses arent memorable, areas are terrible, invisible walls everywhere and enemies aren't fun to fight either.However the characters are very likeable.But that's about it, have had this on my wishlist for years, sad to be disappointed.I didn't have high expectations, but they weren't met anyway.Wish i could refund."
Negative,"A work of art.Edit: Still a fun game. But the choice of forcing you to watch the credits before saving your progress after the final boss, is such a stupid and petty decision. Finally beat the final boss, credits start that you are unable to skip, so I Alt-F4 to exit in order to start new game plus. Silly me. The developers demand you acknowledge their effort before your game saves. The final boss is standing there waiting for me to beat him again so I can watch the credits like a good lemming. They actually punish the player for not sitting through the credits. It's so absurd and really left a sour taste in my mouth. Going to uninstall knowing I beat the game even though, according to Game Science, I didn't."
Negative,"Frankly this game is slower than my nan when shes trying to take a fat poo, now obviously i tested the bench tool for this and surprisingly it said i had 60fps. Now its funny that when i bought the game and started chapter 1, the game made my monkey look like it had stage 8 cancer and i couldnt move when i wanted to. The game was actually playable when it got used to the graphics and that was 5 hours later i logged into the game. Obviously right ``oh its your graphics card`` ``oh its my memory (which probably is)`` but a game like this shouldnt destroy my entire pc. This game took 1/3 of my files, and not even that, but it literally made my other games bug. The patches did help somehow but that was little to no more than 15% of my struggles. Game is great but the lag is feckin incredible"
Negative,I feel like there is an issue with unresponsive controls for some people and not for others. Sometimes I don't notice any UI issues and other times I get really bad UI lag and unresponsive controls. It's very frustrating at times when there FPS drop to have no control. Hope there is an update that address this.
Negative,"do you know why you dont give enemies a delays explosion that is larger than the dodge area?its just shit game design. dodge the hit? well, fuck you on a bamboo pole anyway.while i often tote DS3 as being my favorite dark souls game, there is one thing i truly, utterly despise about it.YOU HAVE NOT SEEN MY TRUE FORM YET MORTALblah fucking blah. shut the fuck up and just die when i delete your healthbar.i DESPISE that every cunt and wanker has to have a second form. not because its 'hard', but because its the cheapest way to add 'difficulty'. and what does it cheapen, if its still not ""hard""? the experience, and the boss itself. im not scared when a boss, thats literally fucking dead, gets back up and UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENE MONOLOGS at me. i groan in frustration and just alt-f4 because i seriously fucking dont care.can we just skip the bullshit and get to the actual fight? can we skip the bullshit and not waste time? you are wasting dev time. im wasting gaming time. and it SERIOUSLY PISSES ME OFF.i spend 20 minutes learning the everything of the first phase, but shocker, there is a second phase to waste time on. the real reason shit devs do this? to pad out game time. thats it. second phase boss fights exist purely to pad game time. because, lets face it, if devs were actually good at game deving they would simply make a one phase boss actually, i dunno, hard? never would have crossed my mind. one phase bosses being HARD? thats absured! no, we must waste our players time, forcing them to near-perfect master the first phase, so they can ACTUALLY fight the boss! yes, thats a much better idea. we could double or tripple our play time doing that!and finally, my ultimate sin for this shit game? the game makes it EXTREMELY, PAINFULLY, OBVIOUS from the beginning that there is crafting in the game. but doles it out so fucking slowly, whats the point of adding it?im not asking to craft ultimate gear right from hour one. im fucking asking ""what the fuck is this shit iv been picking up that has no fucking uses? why do i have 99 of snake head mushrooms and no way to use them!?"" 5 bosses later finally fucking unlocking a BASIC FUCKING POTION ""oh, thats what its for. too bad its USELESS FOR ME NOW"""
Negative,Graphics sucked and the combat was repetitive.
Negative,"Won't even launch anymore ""something went wrong error"""
Negative,fuck this game
Negative,fuck this game. 12 hit combos with .5 second window to attack if you can perfectly dodge said 12 attacks is not fun. first 4 chapters were awesome. graphics awesome.
Negative,"controls are very unresponsive, many inputs go unregistered or activate seconds laterspells go on cooldown without activating invisible walls everywhere"
Negative,Pros: Stunning visualsCons: Denuvo Anti-Tamper & Underdeveloped elements
Negative,"Learn to design bosses please. Theres some cool ones but holy hell.many of the bosses arent just not fun, they are straight up dogshit. I wouldnt buy it again."
Negative,"controls are unresponsive and clunky af. Movement is also incredibly awkward. When I want my character to do something, I want them to do it immediately, not 1/2 second from now. The shit controls make this game 2x harder than it would be otherwise."
Negative,"If it isn't obvious don't listen to me unless you're aware that you're similar to me after reading this heavily biased review. This is not very objective of a review and I don't talk about performance so rightfully ignore this if you care about those things/I love the cut scenes, the journey to the west settings is very cool, and the art in the game is something I'm a fan of. Lastly for the good things, I don't have any problems personally with the armor crafting, player advancement, trinkets, and character/enemy visual designs, just to name a few things. For me that's where the good elements of the game end though. In my opinion, the combat is only tolerable half of the time or less which is when the enemies allow it to be. I will say though, the player's attacks and abilities, when looked at alone, seem like a fun arsenal. Most of the time the enemies' attacks, and sometimes their movements or placement on the map, are made (this feels like it's by design) to be so infuriating that it does not feel good to beat most enemies/bosses/levels without doing so as perfectly as possible. Hell, I would say that it doesn't even feel ""okay"" after killing a boss or completing a level most of the time. Controversial take here, but I believe that I shouldn't have to play through a level or boss multiple times in attempt to ""learn"" move sets. I think that a noticeable portion of the enemy attacks, whether that be bosses or regular enemies, are badly choreographed (maybe I'm using that word wrong, but I mean that I can't tell how, how fast, or when and attack is coming, sometimes I cant even tell where an attack is coming from.) I personally like games where at least most of the enemies in the game have attacks that, if you're reflexive enough, you can dodge or counter on the first 1-3 attempts. I would rather not sit and have to dodge earlier than I can visually perceive the attacks and fail to dodge the attacks based on bad visual ques over and over again just to learn how early (or late) I need to dodge to not get hit.At first I thought that maybe there were enough redeeming factors in the game since the attacks, placements, and movements of the enemies was by design. I figured that maybe it was for a good reason since it seems intentional, many other people like this game, let me try for myself I said. Then after more time with it, it became a chore and I wanted to gain back my 120GB rather than play the game most of the times that I thought about playing it. So apparently I'm a rare case where someone doesn't enjoy the game play most of the time. And I didn't even talk about the nanite, lumen, and optimization issues, so overall If you're like me just don't buy the game unless its on sale or you don't care about your money."
Negative,"repetitive gameplay, gets boring fast"
Negative,Black MID wukong
Negative,"Can't really recommend this game. I'm 28 hours in and already tiring of it. It feels very repetitive. If you like learning different boss mechanics and fighting a boss over and over until you can anticipate his moves, dodge perfectly, etc. then you will like this game a lot. There is not much more to it than that, although the graphics are very good. Poor/sparse story line, not much thinking or strategy other than learning the boss moves. Immersion is poor due to frequent brief lag and very poor due to the linear nature of the map, meaning that there are a few paths to follow and if you venture off you hit an edge but you can't really see where that edge so you are frequently trying to figure out where you are allowed to go by trial and error (butting up against an invisible wall) which is easily the thing that annoys me the most . It also takes a relatively long time to reload/try again after you have been defeated. It takes a long time to reset you sparks (skill points). It is just very grindy. It also crashes occasionally."
Negative,rate 5/10noob game
Negative,"the game crashed and stopped too often, sometimes in critical period such as during boss fight, setting graphic to lowest wont' help, this annoying problem persist even after bulky patch update"
Negative,AI upscaling is the worst thing to happen to videogames
Negative,chapter 5 complete unbalanced
Negative,"Style over substance. Rule of cool cranked to overdrive while forgetting to establish any essence.Graphics, audio design, atmosphere, presentation, animations... all of it is 11/10.Gameplay, however, the meat of the game, absolutely sucks. Movement is janky, level design is shallow and full of invisible walls, combat flow is atrocious: bosses and most enemies are extremely hard to read because their attack animations are complete trash, either by going slo-mo in game speed, doing weird AoEs with horrible hitbox or literally jumping in the air and teleporting to the player, it's like gravity becomes 10x times stronger. Either that or they will simply decide to execute an extremely long attack in the air that is laughably easy to dodge while they waste your time because you can't hit them while they are executing it. This isn't instanced stuff, it kills pacing and momentum. Controls are also very unresponsive and inconsistent, I still don't know what exactly configures as a perfect dodge because I just get it by random (the timing is all over the place. Sometimes I press and dodge perfectly and get a normal dodge, sometimes I clearly time the dodge way too early yet I get a perfect dodge). And whoever thought that you should have three different dodge animations, all of them with different i-frames should be fired. Boss design is overall terrible: it's Nioh all over again: melt or be melted. Every single boss fight so far, save for two or three (I'm at chapter 4 by the time I'm writing this), I either get one-shotted by a stupid, poorly telegraphed combo or I destroy the boss with the game's overpowered spells and abilities without consuming a single gourd. I don't feel rewarded or even relieved, I just don't care, I feel apathetic. And don't even get me started on combat variety and skill tree because good Lord is it bad (and pointless).I may update this when I finish the game, but so far it's been a very poor and frustrating experience, it's a 5/10 game at best, with each chapter being worse than the last, it genuinely feels like they gave up on any coherent level design and started throwing random stuff and relying on cheap mechanics and ganking to challenge you (the Pagoda Wheel section was just pure garbage). I hate MTX, I hate pre-order crap, I hate the constant influx of DLCs we get and I hate DEI-infused crap, but just because your game has none of that and has pissed off game ""journalists"" does not make it immune to criticism, so stop with the copium. People love to blabber about how bad toxic positivity is in gaming, but now we're not allowed to criticize this game because it's a ""love labor from Game Science"" or because it's an impressive debut game (it's not, this should be the minimum from a game with this much budget). Lmao, way to be selective and hypocritical guys, keep it up. Maybe if the devs put as much effort into the combat mechanics, level design and gameplay as a whole as they put into the unnecessarily long animation music videos and presentation, this game could've been a GOTY contender. In the end, it's really just a mediocre, forgettable action-adventure game that's continuously brought down by its atrocious gameplay. Unbelievable how our standards in games have sunk so low that this is considered a masterpiece."
Negative,"pretty bad boss design, unfair bosses with undodgeable attacks, the final boss literally freezes you in place, and most attacks are badly telegrafed, some seemingly on purpose to make the boss harder. also it has a lot of trouble regristrating your inputs, especially when using gourd or medicineoverall misserable experience fighting the bosses, and lot of waiting when fighting some, and fights go on for a very long time"
Negative,back to travel old map but cant complete the mission why ?
Negative,"game crashes even on the lowest settings in the first erlang fight if i cant even play it i want a refund, my computer runs everything else i play on high or max settings so its not even that i have a cheap pc either"
Negative,This game runs incredibly bad. Audio stuttering and lagging on opening. Genuinely unplayable. Refunded
Negative,"Neat concept, with a cool setting and visuals, but the combat is lacking.  It suffers from the same issues I have with the souls games with it's poor combat mechanics, but there is still potential here.  I just can't recommend it."
Negative,"40/60. The core game is good. But the buggy graphics and gimicks are really annoying. Everything that's good about this game, is ruined by BS fights. Bosses that have bad hit boxes, cancel moves, exist outside the arena, or become invincible unless you do a sidequest. Enemies that are outside the map or have instant attacks. All of this ruins what could have been a grate game. This game was decent enough even with all that. But after chapter 3, it just kept getting so much worse that it became unredable."
Negative,"This game is definitely a souls like and it makes things unecessarily hard. Beating the hard bosses does not give me a feeling of accomplishment, quiet the opposite, it feels like I wasted my time trying over and over to beat that boss just so I can progress. If you play games for fun this isn't for you, if you enjoy grinding and repeating the same part of a level again and again due to a difficult boss, this is for you."
Negative,"This game is so fcking hard and stpid, i really dont like this fcking game."
Negative,Crash even on low setting yikes
Negative,good game and have bugged
Negative,The game is alright but like the game design and everything this is my first soul like game and I would have to give it at least 3/5 because the bosses gets to boring to progress and the mechanics sounds to me a bit off. Overall I would wait for this to go on sale I wouldn't get full price of this game.
Negative,"Good game but crashes way too often.Edit: I truly don't know how some people have beaten this game multiple times. Chapter 6 has crashed at least 12 times in the few attempts, spanning maybe a couple of hours. Even in compatibility mode the game can't seem to run for long."
Negative,"So, I have roughly 45 hours in this game. I'd give it a solid 5/10. The visuals are next level; I mean this game looks absolutely amazing. The game play is just good I'd say. Starts out kind of stale but get better as you gain new abilities. I also like the fact that you can pretty much change your spec whenever you want. Different bosses require different builds sometimes. As far as challenge goes, its OK as well. Some bosses are pretty easy, but then there are a select few that if i never fight them again it will be too soon. Now, with that said, quite a few bosses are just ridiculous. Some of these attacks lake like 15 seconds to build up, then the next 3 attacks happen in like 3 seconds?? OK, I may be exaggerating a bit but still, that mechanic is super annoying hence making the game less fun. Also, why on quite a few bosses do I only hit them half the time??  The hit boxes on some of these bosses are almost non existent. This, to me, makes the game less fun. I cant tell you how many times I've set up a massive hit just for it to but completely scrubbed by some random ass attack. Or when I dodge 3 times too early because the boss has to wind up  10 different times before the attack, i mean wth ??Anyways, in conclusion, it is overall a decent game that some people will enjoy, obviously. But, for the average casual gamer, this may not be a good buy. After I hit that 45 hour mark I began to lose interest fast. So fast, even, I decided to play Cyberpunk from start to finish again. I haven't logged into black myth since.Edit: So, I decided to give this game another chance. I logged back in and well, within 20 minutes I logged right back out. This game is a scam. Do not buy it. You will most likely regret it. I wish I could refund it. Changing my recommendation to do not recommend."
Negative,"Do you like the ability to jump and ALSO love invisible walls!??  Boy do I have a game for you.This is a good game - very souls-like with an emphasis on ""like"".  It's an RPG with great combat mechanics and interesting leveling design choices.  But let me give the negatives for the die hard RPG and Souls players so they can make an educated decision.  This is not Bloodborne or Sekiro combat, and it is definitely not DS.  It has a strong bias towards aggression and is predicated on astute dodge timing.  But the game is also heavily designed to be an RPG with incremental improvements to stats and checkpoint-gated equipment with the ability to reroll whenever it pleases the player.  That can be empowering; it can also make complicated-feeling decisions practically inconsequential.I wouldn't describe the game as hard.  Though I've only completed two stages (yes, there are distinct chapters in this game with no congruity), I feel as if I've accomplished far more by this point in a Souls game than the slog I expect for the rest of BMWukong.  I would describe the game as tedious, in that each enemy requires the same focus to vanquish as any other, and that makes for a long, consistent experience.  But my biggest gripe, and the reason for writing a review without completing the game, is the catastrophic abandonment of world design.I absolutely cannot understand why a developer would allow jumping in this game.  If a player just visualized the route of BMWukong the overwhelming majority of this game it would be linear.  Yet, in countless areas within just the first 2.1 stages, there are offshoots from that linearity which end in INVISIBLE WALLS.  There are cliffs that in any other RPG you could jump off to your death which BMWukong simply won't let you interact with.  You could move seamlessly (while unintentionally) through games like WoW and Skyrim by jumping on just the right polygons - this game does not follow that tradition.  There are paths which appear to easily be walked across which are simply not a part of the game, despite the graphics showing whatever might lie beyond.  I understand wanting to make a graphically stunning game, and this comes somewhat close.  I don't get building levels which play entirely different to how they appear.I had found the open world experience of Elden Ring lacking prior to the release of the DLC.  BMWukong has inspired me to pick up a controller again.  I am hoping to complete this game within the next week so that I can get back to a real Souls game.  There are absolutely worse games you could spend $60 USD on, and this is not a bad game by any means.  I personally am just triggered by the inability to explore the game how I want.  If that means I jump off of 1,000 cliff edges to my death, so be it.  But it might also mean that one time I try a tricky parkour move it rewards me with the type of experience that makes RPGs special.Edit: 100% in 100 hours.  Changed recommendation to ""No"".  Was dreading playing it further for the last 50 hours.  An entire chain of bosses is hidden behind an absurd secret - which also gates about 4 achievements.  And then another 2 achievements are gated behind respawns that depend on real time.  Same idea as Cookie Clicker, less fun to grind.  NG+ adds nothing to the game.The boss rush is possibly a draw for a speed-running community??  The 6th zone/stage/level(?) in this game must be the most frustratingly boring level design I've experienced in a long time.  It completely breaks the gameplay loop, which was getting very stale by then, but makes the gameplay even more boring.I could probably map out about 50% of this game from memory and yet I still find myself running down paths that simply don't exist outside of the graphical representation.  Invisible walls are still my primary complaint as even the stale combat could be forgiven if the world were actually fun to experience.  For comparison sake, I could probably draw a map for DS1 and I haven't played it for years - yet I have no doubt I'd find something exciting and unique if I replayed it today and that will never be true of Wukong.  This game is also pretty small compared to its influences, probably no larger than Sekiro.Worth $30 buy it on sale.  Best thing I got out of it was the urge to play the Elden Ring DLC."
Negative,"tl;dr: Looks like a PS6 game, plays like a PS3 game. When I first booted up the game and fought the heaven army, I really thought this would be the game of the year. Then the game properly started and it's all downhill from there. Graphically this game is unmatched, but that came with tons of caveats. The biggest issues stem from its ""Souls"" inspirations, it borrowed all of their quirks without learning their strengths. Exploration is more chores than fun since it's always 50/50 whether a path is actually walkable or just a 60 meters tall invisible wall. The boss fights are visual spectacles but their hitboxes are all out of whack, especially if you prefer the bob and weave fight style. I don't believe these are bugs, but issues in boss design. The game simply only allows defensive play styles. The game is very polished in terms of bugs, but the myriad of design issues, invisible walls, and performance issues made this experience extremely painful at times. If it weren't for the fact that this is the biggest success in Chinese video games I would have stopped right at chapter 4."
Negative,"Loved the boss design and difficulty. Combat feels good. Graphics are pretty good. I like the depth of character specialization, equipment, spells, and crafting.would be 10/10 but:No MapNo quest logNo compassNo way for me to tell where I'm goingMany things look like paths but aren'tMany invisible wallsGot to chapter 3 and spent like 2 hours running around not knowing where to go. Whoever designed this act should learn from the act 1 and 2 designers. Just saying. Because of this, 5/10 game, don't care to spend multiple hours being lost because they didn't put any for of map in. Dogshit design."
Negative,"This game is not for casual gamers. You must be a hardcore gamer or close to it that enjoys games like Elden Ring and Dark Souls... I'm on Chapter 1 and have arrived at a boss that i've been fighting for several hours at a time, multiple times per day for 3 full days. I just die die die and get pissed pissed pissed... Now this game is still AMAZING for those who are good at dodging enemies, i for one clearly am not. The game is all about fighting bosses and dodging their attacks, and its EXTREMELY brutal! More so if you arent good at the dodging game, which most casual players (that i know) are not great at.I went through numerous guides, built my character different, played in VERY different ways, and i just cant dodge the attacks without dying. I'm giving this 1 more day of trying and if i cant do it, i'm uninstalling. Its not fun anymore. I'm also 40 something so my twitch responses arent as good as they were when i was 20, and you require excellent twitch responses for this game!"
Negative,"Nice rate drop, 325 Licorice = 0 Goat Skull Soaks drop"
Negative,"Optimization for pc is terrible, its unplayable, every minute fps drop from 120fps to 1fps, dont buy this dog shit."
Negative,another game where u pretty much need a controller to play it
Negative,"i broke my keyboard, lost my life on alchool and lost all my money playing in casino because of this game, love it and recommend to everyone that wants to have fun!"
Negative,I'm voting for Trump so he can nuke China just because of the last boss in this game.
Negative,Very very bad performance
Negative,I lost all my data after a sudden crush of system. I played to Stage 3 then now back to stage 2 again Feel like playing again as so much effort have been done. Very disappointed
Negative,"TLDR:Not a game that regular gamer would enjoy. Here is what I feel after playing it after a long time. I am still at chapter 4.Let me start what I like about this game:1. Graphic: Amazing2. Character design: Amazing. I read the whole Journey to the west book when I was a child, and this is exactly how I would like those characters looks like in real life.3. Sound/Music: Some familiar songs from the early TV show I watched from child. Other musics are also god tier.4. The short anime after each chapter: It touches me each anime after the chapter. It was also a surprise that the fox is actually in chapter 3.Now lets talk about why exactly I do not like this game, even though I read the whole story from childhood and I am a fan of the story.1. Battle system: There is a huge, I mean HUUUUUUUUUUUUGE period of time (sorry not sure what the term it should be, but you got me) after you got attacked. It feels so helpless after get attacked even by a regular enemy and so annoying. Often time if you got several enemies around you, you are dead and you cannot even do a thing but only let it happen. It annoys me so much that I cannot bear it any more. This is essentially what makes the game not even enjoyable anymore.3. Boss bit box: Not sure why, but some boss has weird bit box, some critical shots got missed for no reason and you can die because of the bug. It makes the game so frustrating.4: Camera: The camera, and how it locks on enemy is killing me. It is so stupid (sorry I have to use this word) that it suddenly change the focus to some other enemy when I tried to land my heavy attack on low health enemy. It turned it around simply because of this weird logic of focusing. It aslo focuses on a spot of the boss, where is too far for you to reach, so you cannot deal dmg and just got beaten to the ground.5. Enemy design: It is so hard to tell which enemy is strong vs weak. You can get killed by 3 attacks randomly by a new enemy, or 1/100 of your health by other enemy characters. It is so random and annoying.6: Bugs: so many tiny bugs around.the map. I often got stuck in a weird corner, or by a tree branch that I suppose to jump over so easily. At least visually it looks like so.7. Fun to play: after hours of play, it feels the content, bosses, the way to play is always the same, it gets more and more boring after longer play.Conclusion:I was so excited about this ""first AAA"" game from my home town. I am sad that it annoys me more than surprise and gives me joy to explore the world, or play as Wukong. I really wanted to recommend this game, but maybe it is not as good as what people talk about it."
Negative,fuck u chapter 3
Negative,"I don't hate the game, but I don't think it's worth it really. Not that fun."
Negative,game is way too difficult!!! no way to change difficulty.  literally stuck on chapter 1 i over leveled tried guides. unfortunate i cant enjoy this game really is beautiful and cool mechanics
Negative,shit for pc players if u dont got a controller also very story focused even tho its kind of bad
Negative,"If you like playing a game where you have to hit a boss 300 times, but he can one-shot you, this POS is for you.  And the devs refusal to put in a difficulty setting is an added big FU to players.  I can't imagine how many hours people must waste on trash like this, if they actually want to complete the game."
Negative,"Seriously. This game shines so much in so many areas, and I love those areas.And then suddenly it just gets infuriating because of the below things....A certain boss is immune to ""Seeing Through"" so even though it looks like it works, monkey gets caught in the death animation with half his health bar gone. Very cheap and incredibly annoying. Being punished for using a mechanic that requires skill and is supposed to be fun.Activating the ""rock solid"" spell and seeing the cooldown start, but monkey does not actually perform ""rock solid"", and gets hit with massive damage. Brilliant. Button presses just not registering correctly, Such as pressing a button to cast a spell, and monkey drinks medicine instead. Seriously, what???The camera. I have no words for how bad this is in some boss fights. Being forced up against a wall or into a bush.... I have been so close to launching my controller across the room because of how utterly, ridiculously terrible this is. Why, WHY would you put an extremely challenging boss (such as Yellow Loong) on the side of a cliff with very limited space, or (the Tiger Blacksmith) in a tiny courtyard where monkey gets stuck on furniture CONSTANTLY?? Honestly, who the F made these decisions? Who thought this was a good idea? Devs, did you play test this? Did you not take on feedback? Not only do I have to think about how to beat this boss, but I have to babysit this $hit5how of a camera as well?And wait til you get to Lower Pagoda and traverse the wooden beam of death, Whilst running across it, avoid the arrows, and just as monkey is about to step off the beam onto solid ground, the camera decides to have a seizure and monkey inexplicably falls to his death. I literally did this 7 times before figuring out how to avoid this. Even when I jumped diagonally to the right to avoid the threshold where the beam meets solid ground, the game still pushed me, mid-air, off to the left side over the edge of the cliff.Once or IF the above is addressed, then I can give this a thumbs up. Otherwise, be ready to have your patience severely tested with the above."
Negative,"After finally beating the game, I've earned the right to give a ""review""Consider this a counter balance to the - frankly - baffling reception this game has gotten.It's not bad at all, but I would summarise it as TEDIOUS.It is ironically the most souls-like you could possibly imagine. What else would it be? A character action game with three stances, one combo each? Pardon me as I lol! It is a game about, through trial and error, learning which button to press when, until you eventually win.There are two types of encounters:- Super easy, mash them to death. This includes many bosses.- Very hard. Either by spamming many enemies at you, or bosses that have so many gimmicks you need to have notepad open on the side.- AOEs and other attacks without any visible wind-up? Yes sir- Enemies that heal? Absolutely- Enemies that turn themselves untouchable and (irritatingly) just stand there? Oh yeah- Enemies that disappear from the camera only to come in and hit you from nowhere? My personal favourite!The game is very pretty, but the areas are sort of linear but in an open environment. Everything looks a bit same-y, which makes exploring... you guessed it, tedious Hardly any weapon or build variety. You will be doing pretty much the same things throughout the game.It's an ok game, play it if you like! The hype doesn't make much sense to me though."
Negative,"This is not Action RPG like Horizon, this is soulslike for masochists.Fighting is extremely annoying, character is unresponsive, dodging is just not working. It's not fun at all. Fighting in Horizon was much fun because I felt I control the character, and here this is not the case.Camera work is absolutely terrible. It's not fixed to the character but it moves left and right.Would be great to experience the plot and setting, but unfortunately gameplay is awful. Uninstalled after almost 2h."
Negative,"This game was amazing, until I got locked out due to denuvo. What happened was my PC updated to a new kernel. The game now thought I am a different person and locked my game. I paid full price for this game I can no longer play. I will keep this as a thumbs down until denuvo is removed."
Negative,"I wish I liked it more.It's a game that should exist and I hope the sequel or follow up will improve on this game.It looks amazing, and sometimes feel fun.But the input delay and horrible hitboxes against bosses, in a boss rush game is inexcusable.You should probably wait for an deal and/or updates."
Negative,Attack attack dodge attack dodge and do it again and again invisible walls bad map designs its really boring.
Negative,This game fucking sucks
Negative,bok gibi oyun aq incelemelere bakip almayin guzel goruntuleri disinda bi sikimi yok
Negative,Temu Dark Souls
Negative,I personally cannot recommend this game. The first half was really fun but over time the game progresses into a truly frustrating experience. Bosses that have bullshit moves which one shot you because the dodge doesnt come through. Badly placed respawn points and an abismal stuttering issue in bossfights. I loved the game at the beginning but by now i cant bring myself to finish. For me the gameplay became repetitive at the 4th chapter. All in all the game wastes a lot of your time with dumb shit i cant fathom why they integrated it into their game.
Negative,"Definitely overhyped. Would suggest picking up on sale, not worth it for the full price. Cannot spot anything inherently wrong, but also nothing special, which would justify the ""GOTY"" claims. Looks great, ran OK on my PC, combat feels spongy. Would have refunded, had not passed the two hour in-game limit.🐒"
Negative,idk how people enjoy this game. some of the bosses are fun dont get me wrong but most of them are just dumb mechanic wise. Archers are really annoying for reason and even though i perfect dodge i still get hit or grabbed most of the time. The game looks beautiful and the story is great but im getting more annoyed at it then having fun. i use everything the game gives me but even still im just not enjoying myself. act 2 was the worst thing ever made
Negative,"Performs incredibly poorly, even on the lowest possible settings I am barely able to make it through cutscenes, to the point where it starts to become glitchy, and this carries into boss fights that involve background effects. Normally I can accept low frame rates and simply tolerate them, but in a souls like game with dodge rolling mechanics it essentially artificially throttles my reaction time. I am also experiencing problems such as abilities occasionally failing to work and the character appearing to be locked onto an axis of movement even though I am not locked on to my target. I am genuinely enjoying this game, which is why it is so frustrating that I'm having these problems which are getting in the way of my ability to properly play it, if you haven't bought this game yet I would suggest looking at your performance before hitting the two hour mark and possibly refunding the game before you continue, because at sixty dollars I genuinely believe I might have wasted my moneyEDIT: After reaching chapter 2 I can say with confidence that I wasted sixty dollars, I can't refund it because I've played it for too long, but the problems didn't seriously make me consider refunding until I'd gone well beyond the two hour mark, fighting bosses at a consistent 29 FPS in a fast paced souls like simply isn't worth it. Do not buy this game if you don't have a high end PC"
Negative,"has good visuals but the game has terrible optimization, the half thought out skill trees and level design make for a really souring experience. combat becomes extremely repetitive  very quickly and the enemies commonly have immunity to several of your skills so you are required to build around each enemy or have a really unfun time. if you like good combat and min maxing this game isnt for you, it is poorly thought out the entire way down."
Negative,not a bad game who tf plays hard games for fun fuck that
Negative,too hard to beat bosses i give up
Negative,"The only reason I can think of why this game is getting such gleaming reviews is because of how few people actually finished it. After 60 hours, it's finally at and end, and only 30 hours too late.I cannot think of the last time I've played a game more inconsiderate to a players time. This game GREATLY overstays it's welcome. Running to the boss room, then running some more, then running in some circles, then running some more. It's so much fluff. It's pretty graphics so you're supposed to look at it this much? One problem... different mountain, same toilet. Some of the art style and areas are extremely nice, but most are too bland and much, much too vast.Now the combat, oh boy. You're a god (and a god killer). But you're also an idiot. You stagger to EVERYTHING. Your engage distance is pathetic. You're so goddamn slow compared to what is going on on screen. This works for the first half of the game, but later you find yourself getting 1-2 shotted or just perma-combo'd. Mind you I beat most bosses in 1 to 5 tries. But every time I lost I always felt cheated. I never learned anything from the bosses. Just spell spam to blitzkrieg damage. *SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD* Oh and chapter 4 bosses gave me ass cancer. Literally unplayable unless you find the chapters secret item and negate his second phase.. either that or enjoy beating your head against the wall with the horrendous frame rate and lights blinding you while you get 2 shotted. And I also had to look up how to progress chapter 6 because the developers thought some obscure, basically unsolvable nonsense is fun. Pretty trash-tier combat overall. Trying too hard to be God of War without any of the finesse. They went with flash over any sort of function.The story and the characters are quite fun and charming. But hell, I'm so resentful at all my time that was wasted I can't be bothered to give a shit.6/10 is generous I think."
Negative,"Game is linear. Boring level design and short. Defeat boss, then encounter 10-20 enemies then you're at the next boss already. Rinse and repeat."
Negative,Game crushes randomly every 2 min

Negative,"Beautiful but somewhat boring and repetitive game. Visually stunning levels but annoying layouts that do not make it fun to explore. Strange and random use of invisible barriers to keep players out of certain areas. Crafting and skill building is simple and not very deep. Combat is also very simple and gets repetitive.Cool boss designs and there are MANY bosses (like 1 boss every 5 minutes). You might like this or find it annoying and get ""boss fatigue"". I don't understand why people call it a ""Souls-Like"" as I do not see the similarity at all. This game reminds me more of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.I recommend you wait until it's on sale to check it out. I believe this is the first game from this studio and while it is a strong first attempt - it is lacking something once you get past its beautiful packaging and presentation."
Negative,Game of the year? A story that makes no sense and clunky combat....wish I could get a refund
Negative,"Kang jin loong might be the WORST boss I have ever fought in any game. The camera is so trash, and whoever designed it needs to get their head examined. 1/1000"
Negative,its very laggy and very harddo nto reccomend but its still good
Negative,Way too hard would love a difficult setting.
Negative,5/10. Combat is a BTEC God of war Ragnarok.
Negative,"It's overrated.I dont hate it but after just a few hours i already know i dont want to finish it. Exploration is bad, invisible walls everywhere, bosses are very mid. The voice acting in English and Chinese is shit whichever you choose. I can see why people would enjoy it but i definitely do not. I was hoping id fall in love with it the way i fell in love with Elden Ring (800+ hours of joy) but after like 6 of actual gameplay (i left my pc on overnight with the game running by mistake hence the 14 hours) im done and probably wont be back"
Negative,After updating all drivers and the 9000th Nvidia update...Chapter 6 loads in making Minecraft look realistic.Its all blocks and stutters (on Lowest graphic settings + ultra performance).The game then proceeds to crash making Chapter 6 unplayable.Ive been waiting for a fix for a while but so far nothing.Refund requested but since this happens in Chapter 6 i guess im fckd.
Negative,"I wish I could love this game. I really do. But every time I try to run the game, the lag and stuttering in combat and in cutscenes is unbearable. Specifically, the game will just freeze on whatever frame it feels like, and the audio pauses and resumes constantly, but it never catches up so I only hear the audio from like 3 minutes ago, My PC is well above the recommended specs, and I've tried everything. I've checked the integrity, I've restarted my PC, reinstalled the game, tried it with and without controller, tried it on low settings, tried it on compatibility mode with low settings, all but bought a new PC. Until a patch or some other way of fixing it drops, I'm getting my money back."
Negative,"I would recommend spending under 2 hours making sure this game runs smoothly for it to be good. I used the benchmark tool thing before this and showed i could run it smoothly, though the second i got the game it was laggy, freezing, making my pc sound like it would explode (until i turn't it off), and crashed every 10 minutes. This game is not bad at all and is very good which is why i tried so hard to make it work but it just didnt after all my attempts, stupidly though i left the game in main menu while rushing to look up ways to at least run the game for nothing; this made the game go over its 2 hour refund time and i have got nothing from steam leaving me with a literal useless game i cant even play. good job steam :Thumbs_up:"
Negative,It's fun when it actually lets you play. Too bad the game crashes on start-up 60% of the time and inevitably crashes at any point within 2 hours of play then crashes on start-up for the rest of the day.
Negative,I don't understand the hype.
Negative,"Came back to change my review mid-way into chapter 2..... Game stutters so horribly bad it makes the game near unplayable.Game is fun, when it actually works....."
Negative,"Chapter 3 really shows how incomplete the combat system is. No blocking, no parring. Only short moments where you need to dodge the attacks and counter the attack what is often near to impossible because there is no real window for it. A parring system would be more than necessary in this game(especially when the enemys are cleary designed for such a system). If somebody think you have here the combat quality of a Sekiro, Elden Ring or God of war is completely wrong."
Negative,"I have no experience in such games. When I bought the game, I read in the reviews that the bosses are quite simple and there is no constant grind in the game. In fact, the game is not linear. Every time you get stuck on a “big” boss, it turns out that somewhere earlier you had to complete some kind of quest to find a certain thing against that boss. Without YouTube guides, most of these quests are impossible to find. It's not interesting to die 50-100 times from 1 boss. I'm shocked that in a game like this there are players for whom boss hits are predictable. Often, the animations of the boss's attack do not coincide with the actual damage. Are you evading? Take the damage! Are you standing next to an afk boss so he can finish you off? The boss misses by some miracle! There are no difficulty levels in the game, so if you don't have experience in such games, don't even try. Playing the game is like an emotional roller coaster where you have fun for a while until you get to the boss, which will take you a hundred attempts. It's not fun.I'll try to structure the biggest disadvantages:1) The bosses' damage animations don't always match the actual hit. You can get damage when you're out of range, or you can avoid damage even if you're physically in the area of impact;2) The game does not try to teach you how to play it. When you buy this game, you should already have experience in similar games. Otherwise, the passage will be hell;3) The terrible use of heal. You press a button and the game doesn't respond. You click again - the game doesn't respond. You click again - the game uses the heal twice;4) If you watch a walkthrough on YouTube and think it's easy to dodge, don't get your hopes up. Just like with the heal, the dodges don't always obey you either. It feels as if the game has an in-play lag;5) The game lures you in with beautiful movies at the start. I love it, so I decided not to refund, but later on, there are practically no movies in the game. The game just throws mobs at you in a monotonous circle to kill without explaining anything;6) Terrible lip-sync spoils the whole experience of conversations between characters."
Negative,"There are many issues with the game that have already been talked about, such as performance or invisible walls, but I want to focus on boss design as there are so many flaws in this game. You will often encounter bosses specifically designed to punish the player for simply playing under established rules. Immobilize is a spell you are granted early on that is meant to freeze people for a short duration. Sometimes, a boss can be frozen like usual, and other times, that same boss will instantly break your immobilized spell, going against established rules. Some bosses have attacks specifically meant to counter your move-specific counter. A boss named Yellow Long will instantly parry your ""see-through"" move because he is programmed never to be hit by it. It does not matter if you have a window or executed the move perfectly; it will never land because the game was programmed to punish you for using it. The final boss in chapter 4 will sometimes parry your light attack combo instantly, even if he is in the middle of a different animation, because he is programmed to punish you regardless of his current actions. Let's not even mention how some bosses have absurd health pools that require hacking away at them non-stop for 10 minutes just to get them remotely close to low health. Additionally, so many bosses are programmed to run away from you and create distance, forcing you to end your combo and chase after them.  Some bosses will vanish and break your lock-on while you run aimlessly around the arena before they attack you from a random direction or the sky. Other bosses have attacks that are so quick in succession that even though you time your dodges well, you will inevitably be hit by one of their attacks in the chain because your dodge simply isn't fast enough to dodge them all. And don't even get me started on some sequences of scripted damage that is entirely unavoidable. This boils down to lousy boss design in many areas. There are so many instances where the game does away with ""difficult but fair"" in favor of ""difficult and BS."" The game has potential, but all the hype around ""GOTY"" is misplaced."
Negative,"This game has some fun moments but is extremely repetitive. The linear nature where you are forced to follow a set path is extremely boring, very one dimensional. Having to save a set points is a probably the most annoying issue as it sets you back. all opponent revive but your options remain used. In my opinion this was is big disappointment and sadly a waste of money."
Negative,"I like the game, but the amount of game breaking bugs for falling is higher than any other game invented. I just made it to act 3 and already I have been pushed off edges of cliffs 30 - 40 times at least and you just infinity fall through all the graphics until you quit out of the game and restart it. If I was within the first 2 hours of the game and this happened I would likely have requested a refund. Very disappointing on a game like this where the game mechanics don't have basic boundaries stopping you from going over edges which break the game."
Negative,"This game is Good.  This game is NOT Great.  Invisible Walls EVERYWHERE but also you are encouraged to explore but 95% of the time exploring ends in an invisible wall blocking what clearly looks like a path.  The fighting is good!  Its very limited.  The stances DONT change your attacks.  They only change the heavy attack style.  Not the overall style.  The spells are encouraged to be used but there is no way to recover mana other than resting (I am on chapter 5 and there isn't even a mana potion.)The boss fights are mostly great.  The bosses hit boxes are wacky sometimes, like the final boss of chapter 4 has legs you can hit but the target locks on to the body and the legs are to the side.  you cant get close enough from the front to consistently hit him.  The boss of chapter 2, his arena shrinks throughout the fight and the invisible walls around it shrink.  but the boss can step outside of that anytime.  and will just wait out there.  I got the boss to 1 hit 4 times before he stayed in the arena where I can reach him to hit him.The crafting is slapped on.  Every new set is better than the last stat wise so even the interesting passives on the gear means nothing bc there is no point in not using the new set.  The most fun part is the transformations but you dont get to use those very often in a fight.The level designs are beautiful BUT they are confusing to navigate.  Every path looks the fuckin same and there is NO MAP to figure out where you are.  No Map.  Not one.  anywhere. in the game.  like what? The invisible walls wouldnt be that bad if I could see the barriers of them on a minimap.  I dont need a detailed map.  Just a simple one to help me find my path like the minimap in Final Fantasy X.Game is 5/10 TOPS.  It does a lot of the hard things to get right, really well.  It does a lot of the basic stuff in games very poorly.Edit:  Edited the review to be ""Not Recommend""This game is beautiful.  But thats really it.  The boss fights are okay but the designs of half of the fights are so fucking bad.  Example:I want to build stamina.  ""Well this boss has a phase 2 that halves your stamina no matter how much you have!""  Okay well surely If I have maxed out my stamina I will be able to do a full combo, and have a dodge still yeah?""Oh!  NO you wont!  but to make it up to you, we also gave the boss poison AND Thunder dmg to auto apply shocked state!  Hope you find that fun!""No.  This fight designer should be shot."
Negative,Will not be playing this again. Think the people praising this game are coping that they spent $60 on it
Negative,Would have been a good game if the hundred eyed daoist didn't exist.
Negative,"So here we go. NORMALLY I would give this game a good review but some things are just massive flaws in this game. Wonky hitboxes is one thing but having bosses monologuing while invulnerable just to make things last forever SUCKS. Also unavoidable cutscene grabs that half hp you? fuck you. thats just poor decisions and I cannot abide. If you wanna enjoy the good parts of this game, be prepared for the bullshit."
Negative,"Game crashes sometimes upon launching a new chapter.Some NPC questlines only have 1 outcome.Some grab attacks pierce through your ""See through"" ability.Rare bug where pills suddenly stop working.Against Cloudtreading Deer the tornados can glitch your character stuck when you see below the ground.Against Stone Monkey, when you get frozen and see below the ground you'll also glitch your character stuck.Lang-Baw-Baw does grab attacks when you're downed, completely bullshit of a boss."
Negative,"I wanted to wait until I beat this game to call it bad. This game was designed to be frustrating, not difficult. Coming from 100% Elden Ring, this game has terrible camera during many fights, terrible targeting to add to the terrible camera. That makes a lot of things that might be bearable unbearable. Bosses that have segments of invulnerability while also being able to damage the player is terrible design. Some very notable bosses read your inputs which is also terrible design. The basic combat is repetitive and doesn't encourage much experimentation outside of transformations. Two or three basic strategies take care of 95% of bosses. This is all to say that you will build up a heavy attack and wait for the right moment only for a boss to smack you out of the attack you waited 15 seconds to prepare. It's nothing but frustrating and doesn't lend to the power fantasy at all. It is a labor of love and it shows. I thought the game was beautiful and the animations were well done and the skill tree impressed me at first, but beyond that, it's insufferable to run into an invisible wall every 30 feet and constantly run into enemies that have attacks specifically designed to interrupt your combos. I would love to love this game, but trying to wonder about how they allowed so many egregious decisions into their game makes me incredibly disinterested in continuing to play it for the 100%."
Negative,"Could have been a great game but the game suffers from the difficulty level being too high. It is harder than other soulslike games because you cannot easily level up to beat a much stronger enemy or call in help from someone playing online. Only if you are the kind of person who has the patience to spend hours learning the moveset of an enemy, then this is for you."
Negative,"It's a decent game and its fun to play but has some really poor design choices... For example, fake ledges.. If you see a ledge, you cant jump off it, but an enemy can knock you off? how does that make any sense? It's a silly point I know, but really frustrating. You can tell they designed features around this and that's just lazy. Great job but do better.."
Negative,If you're just buying this product know that it takes at least 10-15 minutes just for the shaders compilation and setup to compile before even getting to play. Be mindful of your play time if you end up not liking it. I'm getting a refund.
Negative,"This is one of the very few games I've given up on, the further you progressed into game the longer the loading times took for each area anything from 4 to 6 minutes plus the incessant stuttering at the start of the area.The story and level design became totally and utterly obscure for me [maybe because I'm not Chinese?]coupled with the tech issues I lost interest."
Negative,"After 13 hours and over 30 different bosses defeated, I simply cannot, for the life of me, figure out how this game has received so much acclaim. Maybe the combat just doesn't click for me. But half of the bosses I've faced are beyond frustrating for a number of reasons. From bosses with gimmicks that aren't fun, to long strings of attacks that can't be interrupted, this game's boss roster peaked with the tutorial boss I'm almost positive you cannot even lose to, and has been nothing but a frustrating slow slide downhill with little to nope of going back up any time soon. \It feels like the game wants you to play it like Sekiro, aggressive and always pushing back against a boss's onslaught. But that becomes hard when any boss smaller than boulder comes with strings that can last upwards of 20 seconds at a time with no chance for retaliation and the fact that they can often combo those immediately, these boss fights stop feeling like combat challenges and more ""how many times can you successfully press dodge until the boss lets you hit it a few times."" Combine this with factors like a lack of poise or super armor on most attacks that makes riskier strategies like trading near impossible, combat quickly becomes incredibly stale and repetitive.The issues with combat extend outside of boss fights as well. I found many regular enemies frustrating on their own. Combine this with the game's insistence of constantly throwing multiple enemies at you at once it leads to constant unfun encounters where you get comboed to death with little reprieve due to mismatched move sets and aggression. And god forbid you have to deal with an encounter that has more than one ranged enemy at one time. Their uncanny accuracy and ridiculous rates of fire often left me getting stunlocked for upwards of half my health.In the end, I did receive this game for free as a gift from a close friend. That helps soften the blow a lot, but does little to actually quell my frustration with the title. I have other issues with the game than the combat, but since that's what most people play these types of games for, this is what I chose to focus on with my review. Overall this is a game that has a lot of potential that is squandered on poor design choices that make combat stale by the time you hit the 20th boss fight. The extremely bloated boss roster definitely contributes to these issues a lot. I never thought I would find myself wishing the game had reused more bosses, as it's clear the quantity of unique ones left the developers creativity thinning well before the end of the game. If the game gets better after Chapter 3's midpoint, I will not know, as I do not plan to force myself to continue with a game I am not enjoying."

Negative,will downvote everytime a boss tilt me until I clear. today it's erlang. Thanks for making a boss that doesn't stop attacking.Edit: I gave up fighting erlang in first playthrough. Here lies the eternal thumbdown
Negative,at chapter 3 and onward bosses start to get weird where you will fat roll and its a glitch not a game mechanic. you can do nothing about it.
Negative,GAME GETS STUCK AND NED TO BE RERSET CONSTATLY
Negative,Many graphics issues with my radeon 7000 series card.
Negative,game goes downhill right after act1. 8 years of developement to make 1 decent act. guess pretty accurate for chinese devs
Negative,Not practical in farming gear.  The BOSSES are over tuned for the gear levels.  Especially in the beginning.  Which hurts progress and makes you want to quit.   Too time consuming.   Worse than what Black Desert Online use to be.   At least you could buy gear if you had game credits.
Negative,"An ok game that can be fun but it has a lot of issues.The combat might be the biggest one for me - the lack of dedicated parry/deflect button just lowers the skill ceiling dramatically and cuts the legs off right under the combat system.With how it is, a lot of the boss fights devolve into running around waiting for cooldowns or opportunity to generate focus without  getting hit. Spamming jump heavy also is the most effective way - its fast, relatively safe, and deals  the most damage outside of max focus points charged heavy. The bosses sure are many, and most of  them  fairly  unique from each other, but very few can actually be called good  boss fights.Normal enemies  do not even deserve a footnote - just environmental annoyance while running from boss to boss than anything else, really. Exploration? Not good, aside  from Chapter 4, which imho is the only  well designed level, the samey environments of each chapter, also lacking any distinct landmarks makes ""exploration"" a tedious walking in circles for the most part.  The level design achieves  the  rare feat of being both linear and confusing, the environments are just needlessly busy  and over-saturated, while lacking distinguished features and landmarks.Story? I enjoyed quite a few of the characters, but overall, if you are not intimately familiar with Journey to the West, a lot of  it  will make very little sense to you.Performance  - Ryzen 5800 x3d, 4070 - i would say the performance and optimization is garbage, but that's part and parcel with the unoptimized mess that is UE5. At the end of the day, messing with the graphics settings did surprisingly little to improve performance, so i left it at 1440p, DLSS on performance mode with ""very high"" RTX, and had 70-80 fps for the most  part, with frame gen on (without it it was 50-60). Lowering  settings and even disabling  RTX actually did next to nothing  for FPS gains, so i just left it as it was. The framerate was stable for the most part, but Chapter 3 and Chapter 6 REALLY did not like to stay stable, so at some parts the fps could drop as low as 30. Overall, not a smooth experience on my hardware.Overall, i would rate this game lower than Stellar Blade as a package, and much lower than Lies of P. Despite being hyped to high heavens, the actual merits of the game are ""descent first attempt from the studio"" and i would recommend waiting for at least a 50%  off sale before getting this one."
Negative,"Close to the end of the game I keep crashing on giant Shigandan. Lowered all settings to lowest, updated bios, windowed mode. But my CPU (i9 9900k) goes berserk at over 90% usage on the lowest settings. Feel I've wasted 50 hours on a poorly optimised game. Cannot recommend until this gets sorted. Not that it shouldn't be an issue in the first place..."
Negative,"I'm surprised I haven't seen many comments regarding the cutscene stuttering on PC. It froze once during my initial boot up, and after restarting it froze 3-4 times in the opening sequences alone.While the fighting seems great so far, I'll have to get this on console since the only (inconsistent) solution seems to be downloading it to an SSD instead of my main hard drive."
Negative,"I keep getting the error ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\BlackMythWukong\b1\Binaries\Win64\b1-Win64-Shipping.exe"" b1 -saferender CreateProcess() returned 2e4. I've confirmed my computer is supported, and I've been able to play the game before until a recent patch. I've reinstalled Visual C++, DirectX, installed UEFI updates, ran as an administrator, ran in compatibility mode, and just about everything else I can think of. I can't get a refund either. It's a great game, but now it's a waste of money because it won't even start now. This is happening to other people as well according to numerous forums."
Negative,"overall just really unpleasant to play. not a good riff on the soulslike formula. encourages exploration however you will run into invisible wall after invisible wall which is just immersion destroying, makes it feel cheap and fake. twisty, yet repetitive level design that is so deeply and purely linear when you look at it overall. enemies are far too easy until they are far too hard. just feels deeply unbalanced and shoddily made. it's shiny. it's pretty. it's also just an absolute mess. i'll just play dark souls 3 or elden ring again instead because i'll get more enjoyment out of that. i have no hopes for a refund however i'm still gonna try because i'm just not gonna play this."
Negative,"This is such a good, fun game. But some things are just absolutely frustrating1) Your hardest hitting right-click jump attack misses half the time on bosses because of shitty hit-boxes and it makes me want to punch my screen. You auto lock on the center body for attacks and your character naturally moves forward with attack swings. Sounds fine and dandy yet several bosses like the violet spider for example have legs that literally body block your attacks from reaching the center target at certain angles and you get sort of  ""pushed back"" so you end up swinging your stick like an idiot right in front of the boss and don't actually hit him even though your literally swinging through his legs. Another cancer boss this applies to is the 100 eyed daoist master with the long tail. This is a boss focused game with something like 95 bosses....2) If you use an ability (like immobilize) right when the boss hits you even though its insta cast you get ""interrupted"" and the ability gets used and wasted but doesnt actually hit the boss??? 3) There is no map. Several times throughout play I dont know if I'm going the right direction because all enemies respawn. I.E. ""Is this an optional boss I can come back to or do I have to beat him to move forward?"" ""Is this the right direction?"""
Negative,"Heavy input lag, won't suggest until this is fixed, expect Nvidia reflex added to the game, until then uninstalling"
Negative,"Movement controls feel clunky and imprecise, environment is poorly laid out so it's very easy to become lost and some bosses feel like their hitboxes don't match the animations"
Negative,"4/10Боевка ничего особенного, уровень дс1Графика - мыло (спасибо ае5)Сюжет - Ну он есть"
Negative,"game is Frustrating, dificulty is obscene and other times is nonsensical easy.no exploration, and armours and experience are obsolete,you only need one armour and the xp is just to gain perks.overhyped. difficulty is the issue."
Negative,"stupid without chose difuculty levelI wasted 3h on the Tiger and 3h on the Stone at stage2 and dont want to play game any more. they require me dodge the to many consecutive attack. Just give upI am 40 years old and want to experience game, game story (from my childhood ), dont want to try hard or became a pro,"
Negative,"Original review: The level design in this is truly terrible and sometimes the bosses forget to be fun, but the combat is great.After beating the game, there is so much to enjoy. It's one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen and the scenes that play between chapters are incredible. The final two chapters are fantastic as well, and there is a lot of variety of different ways to approach combat.However, I spent most of my time frustrated with the combat. I ultimately beat it but some moments drove me crazy."
Negative,"Very shallow combat, and not really a souslike. Staggering is so unbelievably strong compared to everything else the fights just devolve into baiting out certain attacks then spamming, which is both uninteresting and repetitive. The graphics are pretty but it can be difficult to follow particle effects and the like, though that may just be me not fully adjusting to them since I didn't play this game for long. If you really really like GOW combat (I do not) this game is kinda like a worse version of that with the fighting. But if you want the diversity of a soulsborne game or the depth of a game like sekiro, I wouldn't recommend it. Also, pre-emptively, if you think I'm just a casual check my profile lol"
Negative,"sense were all about to die theirs on more secret i have to share with you i did not care for black myth wu kong, didn't like it."
Negative,"I tried to leave a positive review for this game, but there was an invisible wall blocking my path to the thumbs up button.  Unfortunate."
Negative,A boring boss rush
Negative,NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM IMMA EAT THEM INPUTS
Negative,"A semi-important NPC is missing from my game in chapter 2. I've looked up walkthroughs, i've looked for help through reddit, he's just not there. I've checked everywhere for him, his marker doesn't show up on any of the shrine locations, i've gone through ever step and location on where he could possibly show up. This is infuriating. How does that even happen? To me, a glitch like that is bad enough to not want to play the game again."
Negative,"Heals work most* of the time, dodges work most* of the time, there isn't much end move lag most* of the time but why are there times where none of those things work. could be great but having to spam heal 4 times before getting to drink makes it unplayable."
Negative,I honestly think this game tried to one up Elden Ring by adding an unnecessary amount of nerfing to your character during boss fights. A great boss will do the job on its own. Id rather have a boss hit harder than having it poison you or slow your speed down during  already crazy boss fights with kinda bad hit boxes at the moment.
Negative,the combat actually sucks. spam attack and the whole perfect dodge mechanic makes dodging stupid.
Negative,cool scenery and interesting plot but gameplay/combat lacks behind most other games in the genre.
Negative,"stunning graphic, story and boss design with dogshit gameplay and tracking.mf can stop tracking boss in the mid fight for multiple times lolfps drop from stable 60 to 30 with 3070 after playing for awhile consistently.I know its China first 3A game but doesnt mean it should be praised like Jesus."
Negative,Game is a button masher that is unforgivingly hard.  You thumbs will hurt. Yeah its a beautiful game but the bosses will punish you over and over again to the point its not even fun anymore. I don't understand what the reviews are all about I personally think its over hyped.
Negative,Wukong deservers it's high review score. It's great game for current state of gaming.But two thing in game make me to not recomend it:1.Combat have simple and understandable design and due to that should be flawless and feel great. Right?Well no combat is cluncky AF movement is poorly implemented and as whole feels like you constanty have input delays.2.Telegraph of enemy movement and attacks...OMG it's probably one of poorest implenentations that I ever seen in 3D ARPG genre as whole atacks are poorly telegraphed and hitboxes clearly not in great state.As whole I'm having blast playing Wukong and hope issue 1. will be fixed by patches. About issue 2. well it's impossible to fix without reworking vast majority of annimations hope it will be adressed in future games of this studio.
Negative,after playing it the game loses its luster part way through and the audio is awful especially if your recording on obs randomly the game audio will start buzzing and cutting out. no other games do it and wukong doesnt do it all the time just when its a important boss cut scene. honestly i loved the first 2 chapters and chapter 3 and 4 were lacking bad in terms of content and gameplay.
Negative,"The game is janky... the visual is good, lack a lot of stuff, like a map, movement is not fluent too much of a lag movement.  The visual trying to hide the flaws.  What is there to say.  Everytime I use my right stick to move left, it does a action hit.  Doesn't happen to other games that I play."
Negative,"Looked fun, shame I crashed many times in the intro with a 3070 and an i9-12900k. Performance itself wasn't terrible, frames were around 110fps at 1080p on high. After tweaking settings for an hour, nothing seemed to really help and i barely got to the beginning of chapter 1 after 2 hours of working with the game. Almost certainly caused by the AI Upscaling, which you can't turn off for some god forsaken reason. tl;dr would love to play but physically can't, so i'm refunding and giving a negative review."
Negative,after the new update this game is unplayable
Negative,If you are a masochist with entirely too much time on their hands...it might be for you.
Negative,why da fuq so hard and so mny bo$$e$ ...? I am just monk-e
Negative,Final boss is too much of a skill gap compared to all bosses before him
Negative,"Meh, i just dont like the combat. Its really pretty and well made but it feels like im hiting everyone with a wet noodle.After 17 more hours: It just doesnt feel right or good. Still not enjoying it. I wish i did but i dont."
Negative,"The only thing good about this game is the graphics and music.Gameplay is only ok.  Only gets good when you meet bosses.Story, lyrics, scripts are the main problem.  They're extremely childish, shallow, like a bunch of immature untalented people wrote them.  Reminds me of the diablo3 and 4 except this is worse.  And I'm talking about the original Chinese.  After translation, it's utter garbage.Until they fix very simple things like a damn map, fatal bugs, let us bloody save when we quit game, and a tonne of other ordinary things that should have been there at launch already, this is something u definitely want to buy but definitely won't think it's worth it."
Negative,"Its a good game, very well polished but the game play is so boring especially when your not fighting a boss even though the game has so many gameplay systems I find myself defaulting to light attack, dodge and stun so after 8h of doing the same thing over and over I cant find the will to continue."
Negative,"This game is good, but the bad performance on my 3070 holly shit, un- synced voices, shuttering, lag, bad performance on high ! its unplayable for me, hope the studio get it better, .1.50 hours of playing just trying to make the game run smooth, then refunded."
Negative,"This is by no means a bad game, but I'm honestly baffled by where all the hype came from. I put about five hours into it and it's just... okay? The boss fights are perfectly serviceable, but the first six or seven feel pretty similar in terms of how you tackle them and the fodder enemies in between are just a nuisance. It's also surprisingly, disappointingly easy - the multiple health bars and combat skills give you no reason to do much else beyond just wail on bosses while dodging occasionally. It feels awkwardly stuck between a traditional soulslike and something like Ninja Gaiden, but doesn't really capture what makes either genre stand out. Is it fun for a few hours? Sure. But I don't think I'm going to go any further than chapter 2, and I think a lot of people will drop off with me."
Negative,Game crash at last boss
Negative,asssss glitched graphics and stupid hitbox
Negative,"Unless you are into dark souls/elden ring kind of games I wouldn't recommend this one.  It takes too long to get through the intro and realize that also, so you can't refund it.  I just don't have the time or patience to play a game like this.  It's not anything like god of war, remnant or any other game steam suggested also which was super annoying."
Negative,DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY. This game went from a 4 to 5 star game to a 1 star piece of shit that has done nothing but aggrivate me to the point of wanting to kill myself.And its a shity practice companies are playing at where they punish players for playing their game and making starting sequences so long you cant return the game. Biggest waist of money for a game next to elden ring DLC
Negative,"This game is beautiful however, I can not play it much past the intro because of a terrible stutter the game has, I have a bran new machine basically with a Ryzen 9 processor and a AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT with 20 gigs of video ram... And it stutters on low settings. Please fix your game."
Negative,"Finished the game, it's an OK game considering this is the developer's first AAA game but I don't think I can recommend it at the current price point, maybe wait for a sale in a few months/a year.Great character and boss design inspired by Chinese mythology, gorgeous graphics and very aesthetically pleasing Chinese architecture.A bad Souls-Like and a bad action game. The game mostly boils down to mashing the normal attack button and occasionally using your Focus points and the occasional spell which is gated by cooldown. Dodging is very forgiving compared to the typical Souls-like and you can just mash it, it doesn't use very much stamina and you can chain 3 dodges per dodge sequence for really long i-frames. There is the See Through mechanic which acts as a mid-combo dodge but it's much harder to execute and more punishing than just pressing dodge. There is 1 boss that punishes brainless mashing but otherwise every boss can be beat by just mashing.The game starts off well with pretty cool boss fights but from chapter 3 onwards quickly devolves into a series of bosses with multiple mechanics that are either not fun or designed to just waste time. There are a couple of outliers from chapter 3 onwards that are actually cool fights (the final boss of chapter 5 was really cool) but this game easily has some of the lamest Souls-like bosses I've ever encountered and the game is filled with them and you fight them all within short succession since this game is designed to feel like a boss rush right from the start. The game becomes tedious very quickly.For someone who plays a lot of Souls-like games most of this game's bosses can be beaten in one try with decent management of gourd and spell usage and then there is a very small handful of bosses that are Elden Ring DLC level difficulty, nothing in between.For people who don't play Souls-like games I can imagine this game can be quite brutal, even the first chapter's bosses are quite aggressive.All but the last chapter have linear stage designs but multiple forks in the road and circular paths and very uninspired area design being mostly barren wastelands of rocks and trees so it's very easy to get lost. There is also no map/minimap.The last chapter of the game dials the bad map design up to 11 by giving you an Elden Ring sized open world overworld except there's very little landmarks to help you determine where you are, it's mostly rocks and trees and the game expects you to just stumble across the chapter objectives.As a Chinese person myself who had some exposure to adaptions of Journey to the West as a kid, I don't remember the story of the original story so was hoping this game would be a refresher of some sorts however I wasn't able to follow the overall plot of this game's story to be honest. However the individual stories of each chapter were somewhat interesting and I did occasionally shed a tear. The animated cutscenes with accompanying music were beautiful.Between mashy gameplay, tedious area design and tedious boss design I think I spent more time not having fun than having fun."
Negative,"On the plus side: the game has great graphics and it looks absolutely fantastic. The world is very linear, basically a sequence of really small areas, therefore a map is not needed. The bosses look great, have great moves and the fights are really challenging, but become somewhat boring fast, because usually you only chip away a bit of health. There is not a lot in this game beyond the boss fights. All in all 7/10.Postscript: After a while the whole game became boring for me - too many bosses and nothing interesting between them. If you enjoy boss fights and everything else in a game like story, exploration etc. is uninteresing for you, this is your game. For all others there are many more interesting games out there. 6/10"
Negative,"https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199145569774/recommended/2358720/This guy's review and my response to it summarizes why I can't recommend it. Maybe in a few months when they fix the graphic issues I'll try again. But as of right now, other cool games are coming up, and I have to be frugal with my money. Refund requested.Edit:Watching my friend play it that has a computer probably around my specs and it looks 5 times better then what i was getting. So the issue must lie in Nvidia Cards."
Negative,following the patch the game started to crash. whats happening?
Negative,enemy movement is very bad and not perfect and some time enemy boss going out zone.
Negative,I change my review to negative. Ive played 61 hours. about 10 of those hours has just been constant crashing of the game.
Negative,"Pretty game but the controls and timing are so inconsistent, it never feels like I have full control of my character."
Negative,poor boss design smashy teleporting bosses just aint fun
Negative,"Its seems like a fantastic game but it stutters bad and has a lot of issues, not much we can do to fix it unless u have a super computer and even then i have a pretty good pc and still nothing, from what ive read up on its a unreal 5 issue and not much we can do to fix it. until they fix it im refunding this game.if u have a super pc then i highly recommend this game to everyone."
Negative,"All the game positives are completely outweighed by absolutely horrible level map design. 3/4 of the gameplay consists of endless wandering on the already empty map trying to find out where to go. It is like a Blair Witch horror (hey, haven't we been here third time already?) just with added boredom and frustration value. I did not even finish the freaking game. But not because of the enemies, but because I got finally annoyed with endless running through nonsensical maze without a clue where to go next."
Negative,"It's a great game visually and mechanics are nice but not being able to change keybinds is a real kicker. Luckily i can use custom ones on my mouse softwareAfter a couple of hours, its not the game for me, far too difficult with no clear direction of where to go, with some bosses attacks seeming to come out of nowhere but that means you're now stuck and can't progress"
Negative,wait until it's on sale at this point. I'm pretty bored at chapter 3. I don't really like that my character has very little personality but really it's more the bored thing
Negative,"I should have looked into this game more before I bought it because I didn't realize how hard it is. Unfortunately, I've played this game too long and can't get a refund for it. Even though I can't get past act 2."
Negative,"Two things that makes this overated in my eyes as a egocentricit's a pretty game, in a blurry mess.The dodge mechanic upgraded is stiff, camera kick's you in the face eachtime, lack of gamepad customization, hud is anoying with and without, missing a option wich splits the middle.cant say it's the unclunkyiest clunky game i've played movement wise, one of them, still a great game; masterpiece with better movementExpected dark soul's movement. with manual/aimbot combo atackks; became spiderman movement/aimbot attacks. So my niche hates this game because it's blurry and got taccky movenment, makes it a pain to play."
Negative,"I can't even remember the last time i wrote a review but this game is so massively overrated that i just have to do it. Pros+cinematography is great+graphics are goodCons-the storytelling is laughable, the game does not explain shit that is happening-combat has got to be one of the most bland things i have seen in my entire life-exploration is just stupid tbh-performance is badChapter 1 and 2 were absolutely great and I really enjoyed them. Starting from chapter 3 you will soon realize that the gameplay is just bland. You literally spam the same boring combos for the entire 25 hours of this game. There is absolutely 0 gameplay variation whatsoever.Exploration honestly just sucks because there is an infinite amount of invisible walls but on the other hand the game expects you to find a narrow path that leads to a secret area with important items, without a map. That's just lazy and bad design. The bosses feel boring since there is 0 story development in the background. the game literally just doesn't explain what's happening which is especially confusing if you are from any other part of the world than china.The difficulty is also one of the most random things ever. For 2/3s of the bosses you will most likely only need a single try and they are just as forgettable. Some of the others (scorpion king for example) are just so horribly designed that spamming is the only kind of difficulty spike you will find. I just found myself not enjoying the game torwards the end so i did not even bother to finish it.In general this game is very comparable to Final Fantasy XVI - just extremely inferior in every way imaginable. There is no way this game is even close to being Game of the Year. Might be okay on sale for 20-30€."
Negative,"The worst game ever ...a **king bossfight simulator ... repetative ,boring ... the worst 70 euro ever...."
Negative,"4/10 оверейтед хуйня с унылой боёвкой (в ИГРЕ ОДНО КОМБО), разрабы 6 лет делали боссов, а про все остальные аспекты игры вспомнили под конец поэтому они сделаны на отъебись"
Negative,The game is great on PS5 which I brought. On PC game it lacks everything.
Negative,"This game has got so much going for it but is lacking in so many areas like..... :Fighting dynamics, too clunky :Weapons, (Or lack there of) Pathetic against even the early boss's:No difficulty settings:To much contrast:Getting up from being knocked down takes far to long and is very frustrating!:Invisible walls are annoyingSo many other Pro's&Cons but for the now this game feels unfinished and not playable and unbalanced 😒Of course all just my opinions. 😉"
Negative,"Use a Trainer and don't let those elitist ""Git Gud"" people defend an overly hard game. With a Trainer it's only a horrible slog, because the fights drag on way too long. Bosses are just hitsponges and there is only Damage Evasion by timed dodging, no Damage Reduction like blocking. So yeah, it can be a horribly dragged out waste of time. Checkpoints are few and far between and the Combat System is extremely basic. There is basically just spamming light attacks and with Focus Points, which you'll get up to 3 via the skill tree, you can use heavy attacks. Light hits charge the focus points. Mana is empty after about 3-5 spells, and then there are some transformations which are very short and some other useless shit. They packed so much different BS in but made the core combat system you use 95% of the time so mind-numbingly boring. I'll just cheat my way through the story, which makes just as little sense and has about the same cohesion as the combat system and call it a day. You play Sun Wukong for the very first fight, after that it's just a look-alike Monkeyman, aka the ""Destined One"", collecting ""stuff"", which doesn't even have an effect on the character, combat system or story. The ""Destined One"" doesn't even talk, I wouldn't even call him a character, because he doesn't have one. The Player Character just isn't Wukong after the intro. Maybe some time in the end, but so far there is no typical Monkey King Humor in this or anything that would actually resemble Sun Wukong. All it is is wasted potential."
Negative,"Not awful, but not great either. Level design is bad and the story makes 0 sense without already understanding the narrative. The combat is good, and the bosses are good, but that's about it."
Negative,"Apart from the art of game, it is a quite boring game."
Negative,"This is an amazing game but I don't personally know anyone that could finish this game without devoting their entire life to working out the mechanics and gameplay. For me, this game was harder than Bloodborne and Elden Ring. I couldn't recommend this game in good conscience because I had to use mods to get through the game from about the half way point. This game is not for casuals in the slightest."
Negative,i see this purchase as a scam on both party's steam and the game sellers.. if so many streamers weren't paid to say the game is perfect we might have a real list of reviews and it might be mixed or mainly negative. steam refuses to refund this game . Controls do not work and or are wonky they do not respond in time and 90% of the time do not respond at all. this game has so many combat bugs and in game bugs don't waste your time and money it's not worth it. shame this game looks great and i love the legend but again i feel as if i have been scammed buying this game and steam helped scam me.
Negative,"When I saw the description action rpg, I had a different view of what the game would be. Not for me.Press 'dodge' - character stands there doing nothing with full stamina barPress 'use gourd' - character stands there doing nothingPress 'use anti miasma powder' - character stands there doing nothing"
Negative,"Great visuals and smooth gameplay but too many negative points for me to give it a positive review:  - Apart of a few exceptions, most big fights are badly designed, random mechanics and bad camera - All builds become insanely powerful and that makes the fights boring, no way to chose a harder difficulty - Exploration is meh, have to hit all the edges to find the correct path, and it all looks roughly the same with no notable landmarks to help with directions - Story is badly explained and main character is too plain, has no charisma at all"
Negative,"Everything before Chapter 4 was fun, it felt rewarding to beat bosses, after chapter 4 its just run to boss, die over and over, beat boss, run to next boss etc etc, the invisible walls are awful, they're everywhere, i understand its a linear game but theirs better ways than just invisible walls EVERYWHERE. Also i hate how unresponsive the healing gourd and medicines are, you can spam the button so much and it just wont go off in a fight. I also dislike how many flying bosses there are, flying bosses SUCK when youre melee, just waiting for them to land for 3 seconds before they go back up, annoying. The story didnt make sense to me which isnt anyone's fault but mine because im not familiar with journey to the west or chinese mythology, but you can tell the game was for chinese people in mind (obviously) so i cant knock it for that, i just didnt get anything out of the story or world. From a game dev perspective, the locomotion when youre not locked on to an enemy feels crap, really jarring and not smooth at all. And the foot IK isnt good, the characters feet tend to be floating most of the time, maybe most didnt notice that but i did. The combat is very 1 dimensional, same light attacks regardless of stance, just the heavy changes, and the pillar stance is barely ever good. I found the bosses challenging but i think for a game like this it should have a difficulty setting. I wish there was some platforming, games of this genre tend to have SOME, even Elden Ring has platforming. But this game is closer to say, Jedi: Survivor in terms of gameplay, and that has climbing/platforming, to break up the boss fights. i wish it had that, considering hes a monkey too, should climb no? 5/10, wish i waiting for the game to be cheaper"
Negative,Boss Hitboxes are just crap. already hat to beat 2 Bosses were most of my hit while standing litteraly Inside of them didn`t count so many wasted Heavy Attacks because apparently my Enemy is made of Mist at all times. But when ever i am 10 fucking Feet away from the Attack Zone i get blasted to Oblivion.I´ll wait for the Devs to fix their Hitboxes but for what iam concerned i deinstall this game. Dont care how good the Story and the Looks of it is when the gameplay is whacky. If it were to work as it supposed to be probably best Game of the Year
Negative,An absolutely great game only to be ruined by their love for invisible walls and their disdain for a mini in game map.
Negative,good game ruined by artificial difficulty spikes
Negative,Waste of money
Negative,Over hyped. Bad level design and cheesy boss mechanics. Poor optimization.
Negative,frame rate drops
Negative,"its kinda generic and boring, lots of copy paste enemies everywhere.the bosses are the best part but its followed with the most boring level design I have ever seen in videogame history"
Negative,"""From Software has IRREPARABLY ruined gaming."" Game Science has proven that statement with this masterpiece.Do NOT let anyone fool you: this is just another Souls-like. Hard Pass."
Negative,who ever made the non void boss design to be invulnerable almost 90% of the time  i will personally come to visit ur grave even when ur family members have forsaken your filth from their memories just to dig u out then shit on ur corpse
Negative,"The dodge mechanic in this game makes it incredibly painful to play. It completely ruins the experience of each boss fight. It is inconsistent, frustrating and downright out of line with how things are being telegraphed on the screen.This is a good looking game and an interesting story, but honestly, it's not my cup of tea. Really hope I get my money back, but I highly doubt that will happen."
Negative,you need to install on ssd for the game to work
Negative,I cannot play the game because I keep getting a 10007 Error when the game tries to save my progress. Fix your game.
Negative,"poorly optimized, forced TAA, and shadowmaps so bad i don't belive my eyes"
Negative,Brand new Asus ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop cant even play this game. None of my coworkers can get it work on their towers either. My boss even bought a new tower for $1500 and it still wont play.
Negative,"I want to be specific, I don't recommend this game if you're on AMD hardware. The crazy amount of over-sharpening from UE5 and the dithering caused by AMD's available AA methods mixed with the fact that this game was clearly made with Nvidia hardware in mind makes it just generally bad to look at. Hoping to pick it up on sale later after I can upgrade my hardware, but for now, I have to refund and pass on what looks like a pretty great game."
Negative,"The game itself is alright, but the problem is, I probably hit more invisible walls than enemy, the disorienting audio lag, stutter every 3 action I perform or every 20 seconds despite turning every graphic setting to low or medium. I did not have this problem with Elden Ring so I believe its not about the graphic card. The gameplay is just torturing to a point I dont even want to play this game"
Negative,needs a lot of work its grindy and really annoying having to constantly farm will and plants just for a boss battle that and some of the boss hit boxes are just awful swinging and missing right infront of them is irritating as hell its a great game but got pushed out too early because of the elden ring hype it got me debating on uninstalling because its feels like a beta game most times and the loading times take sooooo long you end up losing all the hype you built up
Negative,"Okay, so I know right now that this game is on everybody's wish-list and that everyone who plays it has nothing constructive to say about this game so I'll be the first to say it: Black Myth: Wukong is nothing short of amazing but it STILL has it's flaws. I've spent almost 30 hours on this game and maybe my opinion is biased as I usually don't play these kind of games. Not a fan of dying over and again, sorry. Story? Great. Visuals? Great. Game play? Great, up to an extent. I like that you can customize wukong to your liking by strengthening your skill tree, beating bosses and capturing them for use and weapon/armor crafting but around the 20 hour mark I started to get tired of what I was doing. To me, it seemed to be: explore level > level grind, defeat enemies or get your butt kicked > defeat main story boss or actual boss. That's what every chapter seemed to be to me at that point. There was many times where I got my  butt handed to me by bosses and re-doing fights only to give up and look up walkthroughs was not fun to me. At all. Most fights depend on your skill of dodging and time sequencing as a player. If  you don't have quick reflexes, this game will show you that you don't real quick. Maybe that was my issue. Many boss fights, I tried dodging, only to get hit anyway by the boss or by the force of his attack from far away. This game is ruthless. Some people will vibe with this game, some people wont. This weekend that I'm writing this is labor weekend, and since I work full time I just don't have the time to put a lot of hours into this game level grinding, exploring every nook and cranny of the level(would be easier if there was a map???) and getting my ass handed to me by bosses so eventually, because of the difficulty level this game is going to lose steam with me and possibly a lot of people after people get over the  initial month or so of hype. I think this game is great, but I also think that people are hyping this game up to be more than what it is at moment. I am excited to see the developers try their hand at more games in the future, which will be more polished over time. 7/10."
Negative,"Yes the game looks and plays great. It is just boring.   Walk a bit fight a couple of bad guys, beat a boss get to the save point. Do this over and over. The world is not open, however I like linear games and this just does not do it."
Negative,"Game has a lot of cheat mechanics and it takes the fun out the game, they already nerfing builds and making the bosses harder than they should,, the character feels under powered and stealth nerfs ."
Negative,"I'd rather play Elden Ring or any other Souls game. This game is meh (for now). I'm restricted to one playstyle and one weapon (I get the significance of the weapon, so I was willing to overlook it in hopes every other aspect would be better). Sure, there are different abilities, but they all end up getting real old real fast because there isn't a lot of different abilities. Gameplay is repetitive and bland. Same 1-2 combos over and over again. They tried to make it Souls-like and say it wasn't, but it's obvious they tried to copy it. Dodging can be hit or miss. Sometimes I'll dodge and still get hit, sometimes I'll press the button and nothing happens. Same thing with healing. If I get hit by a boss and tossed to the ground, it takes too long to get back up. By the time I am back up, the boss has already charged another attack and I get pummeled again. Some bosses are too spammy with their attacks, and it feels like I'm playing against a desperate kid in Mortal Kombat who is just button mashing his way through the fight.TL;DR: Game looks good, game does not play good. Hope they update it so it's better. Definitely beatable, so go ahead and try it. Just some problems here and there. Will redownload in future. For now, don't want to play it."
Negative,"beautiful graghic,broken combat system,stupid map guide,7/10."
Negative,ts is too hard. way harder than elden ring
Negative,"Although I gave Black Myth: Wukong a negative review, this is more a reflection of my personal experience with the game and areas where I believe it could be improved. The game undeniably has its standout qualities. graphics and visual details are some of the most impressive I’ve seen in any video game, with a level of artistry that truly brings the world to life. The soundtrack is equally remarkable, with a collection of tracks that enhance the game's atmosphere and immersion.However, as a boss-rush game, one of its most glaring flaws lies in its boss designs. Out of all the bosses in the game, I can count the well-designed ones on the fingers of both hands. These particular boss fights, while incredibly challenging, feel extremely rewarding when you finally overcome them. Even when you lose, you walk away feeling like it's a matter of improving your personal skill.In stark contrast, many of the other bosses feel like they were included simply to give certain designers a chance to contribute, rather than to enhance the gameplay experience. Additionally, a significant number of these bosses seem disconnected from the lore of Journey to the West, which the game is based on. Defeating these bosses often feels more like a matter of luck than skill, leaving you questioning whether you're actually good at the game or just got fortunate in that particular fight. This inconsistency in boss design not only detracts from the overall experience but also undermines the game's potential as a top-tier title.To keep this review concise, I'll list other aspects of the game that I believe need improvement without diving into lengthy explanations. These include flawed game progression (it feels unrewarding to try out other weapons since the weapon and armor set you’re guaranteed at the end of Chapter 6 is far superior to most earlier equipment), poor optimization, confusing storytelling, bad hit-boxes, and perhaps most frustratingly, the presence of INVISIBLE WALLS / BARRIERS.If the game can address and improve / fix all of the issues mentioned above, it would undoubtedly be a 10/10 game for me and fully deserving of the title Game of the Year."
Negative,"This game is a boss rush mode for sure. With some open areas thrown in. If you like escalating difficulty like Nioh 1 & Sekiro then this is likely your game. But for me it became the equivalent of torture and I quit at Chapter 3 after the difficulty spiked too much for my liking. When your game puts you in a bad mood at home its time to play something else...Difficulty is absolutely fun and is the best thing about Souls games. And I LOVE those games... But too much difficulty can bring game progression to a slow burn and then a grinding halt. And that lack of progress can burn you out like it did to me. Fighting bosses for hours of frustration for a quick dopamine hit does not pay off IMO. Especially when there is a lack of what I would call ""quality"" exploration time to break up the bosses. The exploration is pretty sub-par compared to a Souls game. Even the more open aspects feel strangely linear and artificial due to the constant invisible walls.PROS- Its damn pretty. Spectacularly beautiful in fact.- Love the skills pathways.- No woke garbage- Chinese mythology: I grew up watching Monkey in Australia in the late 80'sCONS- No HDR support despite its graphical fidelity. Are you SERIOUS?!- Nonsensical story you cant follow. Worse than any souls game period.- Crazy levels of escalating difficulty. This game goes full insane difficulty in Chapter 3.- Combat feels off somehow and I cant put my finger on it. It feels generally unresponsive.- The land looks natural and ready to explore. But the invisible walls will drive you mad...- Due to the previous point, I feel strongly that the land was mostly procedurally generated.- Once again, due to the previous point, and the nature of exploration, the game always feels gamey and artificial. I never felt overly immersed. And I had to force myself to play at times even before the difficulty got too much. Its hard when the game keeps reminding you that its just a game. Its like ""oh here is another path!"" but the reality is ""oh another invisible wall..."". Then a bit further... ""wonder if I can get through there"", then the answer 95% of the time is ""nope invisible wall..."". - The game teaches you that you cant fall off the edge. Until it decides you can in chapter 3.- The amount of times I selected to drink my healing flask and my controls were ignored.The drop off rate of players in chapter 3 is actually pretty sad to see. The first in-game achievement is held by 97.2% of players. But the last achievement I got in chapter 3 only has 39.6%. That is a HUGE drop off rate and this game has been out for almost a month now.The best advice I can give is: don't be fooled by the easiness of the first 2 chapters. Because this game gets SERIOUS levels of hard. Too hard for me thanks... And that's coming from someone who has beaten all the Souls games.I'm tapping out so best of luck to you."
Negative,game barely runs no crashes but constantly lags pop in freezing for long amounts of time at a time but bosses are good gamplay is pretty good too voice acting is amazing 7/10 for me if the game gets some updates that fix it ill play again and add more points {side note} pls for the love of all that is holy fix the game im begging
Negative,"In my experience, this is the most over hyped game I've ever played. This is less a video game, and more of a pretty live interactive experience. Video games typically give a shit about the buttons you press and the action associated with the button. This game makes you wait until the pretty animation is over before you get to play the fucking game. That's how every move goes. There's not enough fingers in the fucking universe to count how many times I come out of an animation, press the ""use heal"" button, and I sit there like a jackass as if I didn't press a button.The game only stacks very specific actions after very specific animations happen. And it's completely random. There's no thought or reason behind these chosen actions or animations. I can accidentally double press heal, and then he heals twice and I can't attack or cancel the heal. But if coming out of some type stagger animation, or certain attacks, or say a dodge, the heal action won't stack. Not being able to cancel actions add to the bad bad bad gameplay. I don't understand it, because THEY probly didn't understand what they were doing when they were programming this damn game.This game is basically 85% an unreal engine world/atmosphere art showoff, and 15% game. And what game is there, you have to wait until the nice, pretty, unnecessarily long animation is done before you get to play the game and press the next button.DON'T BUY THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE....Play something like Lies of P, or even Steelrising. I'm playing this over hyped game fresh off of completing Steelrising (after previously beating LoP, and playing Nioh) and I still want to keep playing Steelrising NG+. Steelrising being such a B rated game was much more of a fun (infinitely less frustrating) experience than Wukong. A good game is a game where I'm frustrated because I'm being fairly bested by a boss, a bad game is a game where I'm fighting the controls and systems more than the boss. This is a bad gaming experience.Play any of those other games mentioned, especially LoP. Wait to play this one when it's on a good sale."
Negative,"The game is incredibly laggy, does not play well on multiple laptops; they refuse to refund, refuse to respond about performance and now I have a brick of code I wasted $50 on"
Negative,Beat Erlang after over seven hours of attempt..
Negative,my clones jumped me
Negative,Clunky. no sense of progression
Negative,6/10 At best
Negative,Chapters 1 and 2 were pretty great. However combat doesn't get any deeper than mashing R1 while focus builds up and waiting for spells to cool down. Chapter 3 is abysmal to the point that it made me put the game down.
Negative,"I want to like it, but I can't even play it because it crashes before I can do anything. Also lazy devs can't optimize a game to the point they REQUIRE frame gen. Will update review if I am ever able to actually start playing."
Negative,"Good game ruined by the fact that potions, especially heal DO NOT work a very high percentage of the time no matter how much you mash the respective button, resulting in unnecessary death, even with full potion and stamina. Tested on 2 controllers and kbm. THIS NEEDS FIXING BADLY.This issue is a game breaker and 100% ruins the game, especially as it seems to be a known issue from discussions and some forums, and no fix has been issued yet."
Negative,"Really tried to like this game but the precision of hit boxes and the controls are just not accurate enough for what the developers are trying to do. I'm sick and tired of wasting energy trying to perfectly dodge and time attacks to have animations play in the wrong direction, being hit by attacks I'm nowhere in the vicinity of, having spells fail for no reason, having medicine animations take so long to play that I die to poison before the animation even finishes, etc.  I'm also tired of the vague and cryptic plots that all soulslikes seem think is a good approach to storytelling."
Negative,sometimes button input doesnt work and there in so input storage. Sometimes your character will just stop moving. It makes fast paced gameplay not fun.
Negative,As useual are these games made for console. The key mapping for PC is horrible!!!
Negative,"Always has a one Second input delay, plus does not do half the controls you press don’t even think about dodging because dodging backwards causes you to dodge Fords every now and then"
Negative,My internet disconnects when I play this. I have to restart the router entirely to fix it. It isn't one off either. It happens every single time.
Negative,Keeps crashing randomly every 2-10 minutes. Lighting looks like absolute ****. Rest of the game would be great if these things were adressed.Update: the latest patch seems to solve most of the AMD crashing issues.
Negative,FUCKING HITBOX IS TRASH
Negative,Sort out the crashes!!!!!
Negative,"Crashed over 30 times the past 7 hours with a 7800x3d and RTX 4090, this is ridiculous. Game would be fun if it weren't this insanely unstable. Tried everything from upgrading drivers, reinstalling, downgrading, and countless proposed fixes.Even just idling in the inventory screen randomly causes a crash.Thumbs down until they actually fix their game. Constant crashing seems way too widespread, even big streamers struggled with this."
Negative,"I enjoyed the game. If i would give it out of 10 it would be 6 out of 10. It's a good game to play if you own it. However, i wouldn't recommend the game to others. Also i wouldn't recommend people to buy it now. I suggest you to wait until changes happens and updates to come. Other than that, i enjoyed it!"
Negative,"I am genuinely surprised how this game is getting good reviews. Level design is absolute trash, guys are the kings of invisible walls, there are actual visual corridors which are in fact just walls. Combat feels terrible, even something like assassins creed odyssey is miles ahead. I struggle to find a single thing about this game that feels good, the whole experience from minute 0 to 14 hours felt like I was eating s^$t. Cba even finishing this."
Negative,get ready for crashes
Negative,this game is shit
Negative,"Yeah, when I learned that I missed the point to get the Violet Hail transformation and there's no return, I stopped playing. Stupid game design that blows my mind."
Negative,game hay nhưng game play quá tệ nhân vật có quá nhiều động tác thừa và khi né chiêu không thể chính xác theo nút bấm. game chưa tối ưu chỉ đáng 6/10 điểm. Ai khen game hay đỉnh là xạo lol game không bằng 1 góc sekiro
Negative,im not thus good at any game
Negative,"NoAfter NG+, still no, look at Erlang move set, it's look like game is lagging"
Negative,stuck game all time ..... lag
Negative,This games keeps crashing....
Negative,"Could Cut all the skill tree, Cut the open world, cut collectible, keep outfits make them challenge unlocks. and this is a 10/10....problem though.....This game is Buggy and Runs like poodoo on my PC and The SteamDeck somehow. dodging feel Janky and it feels frame related. taking damage from the Giant Scarab crushing me while i can see it hovering in the air isn't fun. I wanna like this game,but it keeps giving me moments where i go......-—- that hit? i didn't dodge that? why didn't my spell work? i hit Rt+LT and it flashed my consumables and i died -—-i have EldenRing and other Triple AAA Titles and they run and perform well on both consoles. This games been my only issue and its unfortunate and a big let down. the first fight teases you with taste of all the abilities then strips it and makes you slowly realize over 2 hours you wasted you're money. it feels like the game equivalent of overpriced jerky R .I.P 60$Last thing is there is 0 Tutorial for how to play, and any enemy that isnt a boss is not worth being called n enemy. its like fighting guards in assassins creed 3 and then fighting Radahn and saying ""what do you mean the game didn't prepare you?"" id be less inclined to say this if boss frames were consistent. i can confidently all 4 boss attacks, n come out clean....then 5 sec later on the same exact attack i dodge the same but the boss's tracker bugs and hits me even though i rolled. am i supposed to dodge that way? or did the game bug? idk because i can dodge normal enemies attacks....ill continue to play but rn feels like pushing a boulder up a hill rather than fighting, feels like ability abuse is intended and bad game progression leads to the player feeling stagnated, and without a guide is lost and unknowing of missed content intended for proper progression. i don't recommend this game if you admire games that make you wanna get better at playing even in failure, rather than grinding xp and progressing strength trees."
Negative,"Not sure what the game is doing, but using 6-8mb/s of disk while playing and makes the yellow wind sage impossible to play against.Loved the game up until this point. Will recommend once performance is improved."
Negative,Don't Play if you have a 14th gen or 13th gen
Negative,keeps crashing very unstable
Negative,bosses are either easy or broken with the worst hit boxes ever
Negative,too fucking hard
Negative,"AMD crash, known issue. refunded. willing to try again if fixed"
Negative,It just isn't fun. A button smasher at best. And worst of all the developers don't know the difference between hard enemies and cheap enemies.
Negative,"My brother told me that this game is like Bayonetta or Devil May Cry, and because I loved these games, I bought this one. I don't know where he got this information from or who said that on the internet, but this is a Souls-like game which has nothing to do with a Hack-and-Slash game. If you like these kind of games, I'm sure this is for you but who somehow anticipates a game like Bayonetta or Devil May Cry will get disappointed. I refunded the game."
Negative,"games kinda annoying, most of the level design in maze like fashion, probably to slow people down with artificial delaying. Lots of roads winding all in the same area all the time. Each map has like what feels like 15 roads, that all circle in and out of each other and then the next areas got 2 optional paths with more 15 roads for each. The bosses are pretty easy, but the maze design ehhhhhhhhh, I hate mazes. They aren't even shortcuts it's just pure maze. Your staff combo doesn't really evolve any, same light attacks 90% of the time mixed with a sprinkle of a few abilities, I don't mind this so much, but his staff animations always locking you into combos is also annoying. it has a bit of the elden ring dlc issue with enemies comboing for days, which is managable, but it sure doesn't make you feel like a badass with how varried and massive aoed bosses are. near unmissable aoe  unless you perfect dodge, sucks. The dodge mechanic in this game is really sloppy too, alot of animations won't go off until your character is in range of the enemy, so he'll go to run up to the enemy for 3 seconds so they are touching before using certain heavy attacks, even though heavy attacks have some amount of range, so that's annoying also. Some bosses will bullet storm hell you firing 15 homing missles every 7 seconds, while you can kinda only dodge 2 of those 15 because of animation delays. i miss dark soul bosses that never getting hit in the fight was a very doable thing. it's hard to justify bosses having shotgun spread 15-30 homing missles in a small arena that can 100 to 0 you in 3 seconds. and if the missles miss they just rehome back in on you, it doesn't really give you time to do much of anything and this is coming from a game that expects you to do like a 10 hit combo everytime you attack but the boss has like 12 seconds of homing missle bullstorm. Obviously i beat said boss, i like challenges and max difficulty, but i'm not a fan of bosses designed to clip your rolls and be safe from being damaged for 12 seconds. every 3 seconds."
Negative,"I love the Dark Souls franchise and have played every one of them. People told me that this game ""Is like God of War!"" I have no idea what they are talking about... It's nothing like God of War. It's like someone decided to take a Dark Souls game. Removed the the Build diversity, the Souls/XP and level up system. The character progression is just weapons and armour but at set points in the game. They also removed large percentage of the Exploring side and just replaced it with more Bosses. Some of which are just not enjoyable to play against. I don't have the same feeling beating a boss in this game than I do in Souls games. more of a thank F**k that is over now i can attempt to enjoy the game again feeling. I felt the bosses were just a bit over the top that they made me dizzy looking at all of the spinny moves they have.I appreciate i do not currently have that much play time on the game (7.5 hours as of writing) But I only have Cons to say about the game If you asked me for a Pro I would probably not be able to give you one. Maybe the transformations are cool but that's about it. I might not have found a way yet but the Mana system is a bad idea, What I liked the look of going into this game was the funky abilities like the Stop or Shroud spell. But because there is no way to gain your lost Mana back out in the field I feel I see the Mana bar as the Fun-O-Meter as once it's depleted there goes my enjoyment of the game. My Suggestion if you have read the above is. If you like Souls-like games and your favourite bit is smashing your head against a boss multiple times then Great! I can say that you will enjoy your time with this game!If people have told you ""Its like God of War"" first ask them if they have played it then proceed to tell them they have no idea what they are talking about. It's not for you unless the above applies. I wish Steam had a Mixed option when leaving a review as i really don't think that this game deserves my Thumbs Down. I will endeavour to keep playing the game because i hate myself as a person and playing this game adds to that. I might change my view in the future but I still stand behind the mana part at this time at least!"
Negative,BUGGS AS FUCK
Negative,Meh. My monkey lamp kept me more entertained
Negative,"If it would work it'd be great, but failing on shader compilation when running a 4090 FE with a 14th gen i9 shouldn't be happening."
Negative,bug update so slow dowload
Negative,Very frustrating game for people who are not familiar with this genre.I wish there was a difficulty setting.
Negative,"Meh. When I play games, I want something that I can't put down. If I am 90 minutes in and there are things I'd rather be doing than memorizing the dance steps needed to beat your bosses in your teeny peener game. . . you failed as a game designer. No further comments."
Negative,"I'm going to be that one salty personPlayed just fine last weekUpdate now:Unable to update, gets stuck every single time I attempt, I have enough storage for the temp filesSo if the first update results in these efforts, I am afraid for upcoming updates"
Negative,This game indeed really beautiful and combat is great however i feel that the bosses are getting harder and need to grind to level up for more sparks. I am pretty new to this kind of game so it pretty hard for me to learn as well as the difficulty don't suit me and there is no difficulty setting as well too.
Negative,"a difficulty setting needs to be added for people who struggle, as well as thoughs that want to enjoy the story and not have to sink fucking hours into making little progress if any"
Negative,incredibly laggy and unplayable even on a 4060ti. trash.
Negative,last boss is trash
Negative,"I have finished the game. Started out not liking it, really liked chapter 4, and chapter 5 was fine, and then 6 was probably my favorite with the bosses. This is not a bad game, I just went into it with the wrong expectations. That's on me for not doing enough research before buying. I expected more of a Sekiro-esque game. I felt a massive want for a real parry a la Sekiro, Lies of P, etc but understand why they didn't do that. Dodge really felt inconsistent at times, but I got used to it. Overall, I cannot say that I enjoyed my time with this, but I wish I could have. Too many points of frustration, and even though this game has some of the toughest bosses I've gone against, I did not get that usual serotonin boost from beating them I do in other games, and in a game that has 81 bosses, that leaves nothing for me TO enjoy. Final boss was great, big respect to the devs for making such a rock solid product on release. If you loved this game, I'm envious but if you're like me and want something more Sekiro, just be wary."
Negative,"Sadly I cannot suggest buying this game on PC (Unless your PC is so expensive and therefore so powerful that you have a mortgage on it). NOTE: I have a middle of the road PC and have set a lot down to low setting even when the game suggested medium.The button response is so bad it creates a false difficulty cap. Invisible walls everywhere, the exploration becomes unfun as you are just running against ghost walls to find the gaps.Most cinematics I end up having to watch on YouTube because they stutter and skip huge chunks. Buy this PS5 - played at a friend's house and it performed much better. PC owners wait for a patch if the dev team can improve the performance."
Negative,Horrible keybinds with extremely limited customisation
Negative,"After getting to one of the tougher bosses in the game and you put an unavoidable cutscene in a boss fight that makes you lose health?? Stupid.. Just make it apart of the fight, i was really liking this game until that. DUMB....PLAYED MORE JUST TO REALIZE ITS EVEN MORE DUMB THAN I THOUGHT. WHY CAN'T I HAVE A BLOCKING MECHANIC??? REALLY F*** THIS STUPID GAME"
Negative,"This is by far the most difficult game I have ever played. I was expecting a game that would be easier than Elden RIng. 9 hours of gameplay, and I can't even get past a chapter 1 boss. I'm not sure if there is an error or something with White Clad Noble, but he is way harder than Malenia, Fromsoftware's hardest boss. If you are looking for a more casual souls'ish game, this is not it. Prepare for frustration."
Negative,"Game has antiquated and poorly made design choices in story and gameplay like silent protag, bloated empty spaces with a lot of pointless running, translation from dialogues felt off cant undestand shit about the story, mediocre combat with shit optimization (averaged 40fps with a 5700xt).Cool things about this game are that the bosses are cool looking and graphics are nice... Thats it wait for a 70% sale 5 out of 10 game"
Negative,"I can't do soulslike games like this anymore. Jedi Survivor isn't this level of frustration but the bosses are way too hard, perfect dodges get me killed, attacks aren't well telegraphed and I get stuck at every single boss fight even within the first hour of play. With how positive the reviews are on steam I'm convinced one of the following is going on: The games reviews are being boosted, everyone playing it is a masochist, or I'm just incapable of figuring out how to play. To each their own, but I'm still going to ask about a refund since I only played it a few hours and almost all of the gameplay was just me stuck dying to the same thing over and over ad-perpetuity. When a good fraction of your time is spent in loading screens because it's too hard and there's no difficulty setting? Well... Here's hoping steam understands that if you give me back the time spent at loading screens or the same spot forced to run back to the boss that keeps sending me to those loading screens I'd be back down to < 2 hours from almost 4.When you're funneled down a hallway and there's nowhere else to go and that hallway has a boss that mops the floor with you... It's kinda nice in other games to have the opportunity to go somewhere else and get stronger until it's easier. This game, seemingly, does not have that. And I'm not about to run in circles for another hour (which I literally did in my short amount of time) looking for where I'm supposed to even go.The game is really pretty though like, seriously. And I love some of the Yaoguai designs."
Negative,"This is another Dark Souls game in disguise. Don't fall for the ""Action RPG"" nonsense being spewed by reviewers and the community. Very over hyped besides the graphics which your computer won't be able to run at full without asking NASA for some help... and maybe a few patches from the devs. Gameplay was fantastic and fun until you hit the ""dodge perfectly and hit boss 2-5 times when you can"" wall I see in all these games. On the plus side, you can grind without worry about losing anything so good luck and chose those abilities wisely.Elden Ring is a better deal at $60 if you're looking for difficulty because it has the amazing open world this game lacks. BM: Wukong doesn't even have a map for all the hallways you have to run around in. I've liked the aesthetic and mythology derived enemies and world, and will probably mod the game later to tone down the sudden 15 combo attacks from bosses so I can enjoy the rest. Enjoy what you enjoy and have fun all."
Negative,Im using a msi 4080 super and AMD 7 7800X3D and game lags and crushes even after the August 29th patch update. not playing till they fix all the issues.
Negative,Fix the Apramana boss diasappearing if i don't have the pig NPC anymore with me. now i missed the boss and i'm not in the mood for a NG+ only to fight this boss.
Negative,"Okay, first time I've put out a review on Steam, but I feel like this needs to be said: This is a Dark Souls game. Maybe the out of combat movement is a bit more fluid; maybe the presentation is slightly different; but make no mistake, this is a Dark Souls game. Is it well executed? Absolutely. Is it Souls-like? 110% yes. For those people who disagree that this is not like Dark Souls, consider this:- When you die, which you will over and over and over, do you have to reset to an earlier portion of the game, only to have to try to re-do the exact same thing over and over? - Do boss battles force you to learn the boss' exact move set? - Can you lower the difficulty?The answers, of course, are 'yes', 'yes', and 'no'. Just like Souls. The difference being that you can't level up past a certain point, without being forced to fight the same ridiculously challenging boss. NGL, I love video games. I've played all sorts. I've pumped 100's of hours into games like Monster Hunter, Fallout, BG3, etc. I like being challenged but realistically, I'm not a competitive gamer. I don't like burning 90 seconds trying to not get hit by weak characters so I can have full health just to get 3 shotted by a boss then re-spawn back to burning another 90 seconds so I can hide from weak enemies only to get 3 shotted again. I've played Dark Souls. I respect the people that enjoy that series. Personally, it's not for me. I've played Sekiro. I have that same sentiment. I do not like that style of game. The style of game that forces perfect timing and relentless difficulty. I bought this game because online reviewers specifically said it was NOT Souls-like. Frankly, those online reviewers are either liars, paid off, or completely out of touch. Make no mistake, this is a Souls game, and as a result a waste of the $80 I paid, and a waste of the time I put into it. I will not be finishing this game. Unless the devs decide to seriously alter the game such that re-spawns to not burn your time, and compromise on difficulty, it is unlikely that I pick it up again. If you enjoy this style of game, you will love it. If you are like me and prefer a game that doesn't relentlessly punish imperfect timing, you are best to spend your money elsewhere."
Negative,Game is far too dependent on hardware.  Recommend devs tighten up their code.
Negative,light spam simulator
Negative,my computer crashes during the shader compilation Don't really know how to fix it
Negative,very hard game to play u cant block just evade pretty repetitive w having to beat a near impossible boss from the very beginning...idk its not for me
Negative,"Beautiful views and interesting fights are completely counteracted by garbage design of some bosses. Whoever designed a scorpion should be ashamed of himself. You've got a full cancer package there - delayed attacks, camera doing 360, boss jumps around the arena 24/7, your attacks miss the boss due to just him doing normal animations.There are around 3 of such bosses in this game, but they will give you the most amount of pain imaginable. For me it overshadowed everything else.Most other bosses are passable, a very few of them are a real challenge really."
Negative,"Stuck on one boss for hours. No opportunity for nooby players just to enjoy the game & combat/adventure that want it a bit easier. I spend all day at work stressed and I wanted to have the option to enjoy and chill playing this. Nothing more frustrating than being unable to progress... I'm not even hardly into the game, stuck on white clad noble.. can't imagine how much stressful and harder it gets after this. Uninstalling, shame I cant refund!"
Negative,"over price asf, you can't do anything in this world. Only go and fight some NPC's every 200m boss after boss. No story, no world explore nothing. If you want to learn the story you have to read what every boss talk so you can understand what is going on. The only cinematic i saw was in the start of the game and that's it. I don't recommend this game to anyone who want to play game with story and some world explore.If you want only to beat bosses then go on and buy it but i don't see anything good in this game to pay that much money for it and not a damn chance this game to become game of the year with this game play. 0/10"
Negative,"I expect this game to be a great storytelling combined with good combat system, but instead I just got an overwhelmingly boss fighting game with really bad combat system. The character is way too weak to fight so many incredibly strong and agile monster in every two minutes, it is waaay to hard for a casual gamer like me just to defeat the boss I should at least have 7 try just to defeat a boss in the first chapter(multiply it by hundred more boss that awaits me ahead) which is i think it's wasting too much times. The problem is your movement is very limited to just dodge and right or left click without no defense mechanism, on the other hand the bosses really have a too much combo with long or close range attack that could kill you with just 3-4 combos, and the most frustrating part is there is NO DIFFICULTY OPTION which make the game is exhaustively boring. I might be just a casual gamer, I play the game for the story with a bit challenging combat to make it more fun, I really hope in the upcoming update they will add at least difficulty option so the game can be enjoyed by more people."
Negative,"Too many CTDs. It would be so worth it, if they could learn how to optimize and ""there are too many hardware configuration variations"" is not an acceptable excuse anymore. I am tired of lazy programmers and game companies (devop/programmer)How can I beat that rat king boss when he can go outside of the fighting area and hit me from where I cannot reach him?? smh. Why did I pay you to be a f-ing beta tester?!!!I have stood there in the game, not in a fight, and pressed the heal button and nothing.. dodge, nothing.. heal, nothing, heal and now it heals., THIS GAME IS SHIT!The game is too contrived and inconsistent. Sad. I gave this game every damn chance I could."
Negative,Lackluster quality with very poorly implemented upscaling that can not be disabled and no HDR. Developers puked and this came out
Negative,VERY laggy if you consider this game make sure your pc is VER up to date but if not dont bother buying the game I got it and I cant even refund it DONT I REPEAT DO NOT buy this game.
Negative,"Finished the game in about 50 hours (secret ending as well). I think this game in general focuses too much on being cinematic and spectacular to the detriment of gameplay. This issue takes form in many facets, but the most glaring ones are exploration and combat. Let's start with exploration.There's a surprising amount of secrets in the various chapters, and I love that, but finding secrets can be a pain in the ass if the only way to understand if a section of a path is 'walkable' or not is try to do it and be met with an invisible wall in 99% of cases. Then in the 1%, yo, you can actually jump down a segment for a secret area. Sometimes invisible walls are entirely unnecessary, like not being able to jump 3-4 meters down despite never risking of going off-map, since you're just trying to jump back at the base of the stairs you just walked through.Now, the worst part of the cinematic issue: combat.I know it's my personal taste in its entirety, but losing control of my character during a fight irks me deeply. In the 'best cases' it's not even due to a gameplay mistake (I'm not accusing grabs animations, despite not loving them), it was just a cutscene meant to happen where Wukong gets man(monkey)-handled like a ragdoll, but you don't actually receive damage at least. The problem is in many cases the bossfights have to show you how cool and cinematic they are, doesn't matter if it's your 10th time watching their super-attack animation. Some bosses, especially the ones at the end of a chapter, or tough optional ones, have a considerate slice of their attacks belonging to the category ""Now you can only dodge for a good 20 seconds without retaliation"". Even worse, when that crap starts, you don't actually have a significant signal: the boss may look basically static or starting a normal attack animation, but they're actually already inside their 'cinematic mode'. This means that they're already incorporeal despite not looking like it. What, you used your Qi summon attack on them? Well you'll see it connecting, but no damage and no effect, enjoy building the bar again kid. What, you tried to Immobilize the boss? Ahah, nah, doesn't work, but get your spell on cooldown anyway, kid. What, you tried to smash them with a 3/4 focus points charged attack that you earned through a series of perfect dodges and full combos? Too bad kid, it's cinematic time, you wasted your effort.There are many more points to make about this type of issue I have with the game, but I think I typed enough. All things considered, this game is a 9 or 10 out of 10 in terms of impact, looks, coolness, atmosphere, cinematography, but its gameplay drags down the score to the abyss.If I had to give it a single score, it would be 5, sorry."
Negative,"Great game.  Really need a way to farm xp and the world is damn near void after bosses are dead.  And, ffs, spending over 3 days to get to the next chapter because of a Boss is getting old.Changed my mind.  4 days on same Boss (different Boss, basically have 3 that can't beat so stuck on Chapter 4).  Looking for a fun weekend that basically turns to fury, not fun anymore."
Negative,Pretty game but you can tell they haven't designed bosses before
Negative,"Just a PSA for people who might be considering buying because most reviewers and their moms pushed this as a GOW-like game more than a souls-like game, it's really not. The exploration, while set in a beautiful environment isn't really enough to occupy you between jumping from boss fight to boss fight. Some bosses are a piece of cake, but then you run into bosses like the Tiger Vanguard/Yellow Wind Sage which are extremely hard to get by, and whose difficulty is really Sekiro-tier. So yes, while I do like the rest of the game, the lore etc. I feel the marketing has been a bit misleading till now.P.S I might change my review once I progress further into the game, but right now, it's been a whole lot of frustration for the last few hours."
Negative,"The game has a decent platform as an action RPG, but fails to deliver on the namesake or setting of the game beyond the superficial face-paint. I was hoping for some of the personality of Journey to the West. There is humor in that story, and a rich cast of well defined characters. Even the demons had color. In this game you play as a silent protagonist. A guy walks out, threatens you, you fight, and move on. And as per the common video game leveling trope, Wukong is fighting as the under dog in each battle, slowly accumulating power - using a mostly normal staff and relatively vanilla powers after 8 hours. You're not fighting as the Great Sage Equal to Heaven at all. You're looking at all the crazy uninterruptable moves of your enemies and wishing you could do anything half as cool.The game is fine if you are looking to play a decent ARPG, but it is not without frustrating moments of jank, and the invisible walls are painfully ever present as you move through semi open world zones looking for hidden areas. The game is definitely flawed, but also does show promise for the studio that made it. However, I bought a Wukong game and am not as interested in an ARPG with some monkey and a bo staff."
Negative,Game keeps on crashing. Hope they'll fix it soon.
Negative,Game crashes after latest patch
Negative,"It was a good game before 29th Aug update.Then it crashes every time after updated, unable to play at all."
Negative,Was working fine before the update now I can't play more than 5 minutes without it crashing.
Negative,Broken map design.. the final boss is even worst than Radahn DLC. Few playing style available comparing to Elden Ring. NPC conversation is tooooo wordy. Weird story. Good graphics tho. 5/10 Not recommended.
Negative,audio cuts out frame freezes this shit trash
Negative,"If you like Soul like genre games, BUY this.If you dont like Soul like genre games, dont buy this game"
Negative,I've put 20+ hrs into this game and trying to tell myself I like it but I just don't something with it just doesn't click with me and I find it harder than anything fromsoft has made besides sekiro and I heard this game was easier than fromsoft games? which i'm alright at plus no proper parry or block is a major L why keep the parry locked behind an ability that draws from a limited mana pool I just found this game more frustrating than fun but hey alot of people like this game I guess so don't listen to me.7/10
Negative,"Well, I guess I'm just a lame old simp gamer but I don't get it. This game is hard AF and soo frustrating... the more I learn about the game I guess that's part of the appeal and again let me say, I don't get it. To grind on trying to beat a boss like 50 times is just not fun to me. I am a casual gamer in my mid 40's, have enjoyed video games for the last 35+ years and maybe there was a point in my life when I thought beating a game like this was worth the frustration of being beaten down over and over but not at this point in my life. This game is too frustrating to play for an old nerd with limited time, wish I could gift it to someone with more time and willingness to explore the potential of this game."
Negative,"Aesthetically beautifully, mechanically abysmal. Save your time elsewhere."
Negative,"Unplayable. The game keeps freezing, and I can play anywhere from 5 minutes to about 30 seconds. My computer is less than a year old and has nice hardware. I'll have to wait for them to optimize it. Unfortunate."
Negative,Massive frame rate issues for me.  couldn't look past them. can't tell if the english dub is terrible or if it's an issue with performance not syncing up audio/visual
Negative,"every area is way too hard or way too easy, and the stances don't change your light attack so what's even the point"
Negative,Bad. Decide if you want to be a CAG or a Soulslike. Godtier boring trying to sit in the middle.
Negative,light attack (3)dodge (1) strong attack (1) repeat
Negative,"If you enjoy doing long combos or using cool abilities, don't play this. You'll be spending 90% of your time dodging in this amazing dodging simulator, until you finally beat the boss and wonder how, since you never actually got to attack. The other 10% was healing, by the way."
Negative,Game is broken reinstalled this game 3 times and still it crashes the second i launch. I've tried everything and still nothing works can't even see the start up menu cause of how fast this game crashes. This game needs to be fixed.
Negative,"This game has outstanding scenery and story line 10/10.  But the game play for and average player is total dumpster fire, bosses get half health hits and secondary hits while getting up and their hit boxes require you to be right on top of them for a hit for next to nothing damage. 2 hours of game play and over 30 deaths to one of the bosses.  The only reason I have tried to play this game I got it free with my new graphics card and based off the play so far this game is not worth the current price."
Negative,"Beautiful game with a story/level design issue.Obviously you need to know about Journey to the West to really appreciate this game, and while it does expand on the original tale by having you explore a sequel of sorts, it just doesn't hold up over the entire game.The game is split into 6 chapters. The first 4 chapters were honestly amazing to me. Great sound design, beautiful landscapes, and tough but fair enemies. The bosses were cool and pretty varied between humanoid and monster-esque ones. The rest of the game felt rushed imo, I had high hopes but I felt the game kinda deflated by the mid point or end of chapter 5.My other gripes are the level design, skill tree, and lack of stat increases. Invisible walls galore in this game, which really soured exploration. The skill tree is varied, but with little impact outside of the skills that improve fighting stances and health/stamina/mana. Damage...or lack thereof, is disappointing. Every upgrade to a weapon is so lackluster that I barely upgraded my staff until I felt I needed to due to the bosses getting spongy in the later game.Great game for a first outing for a dev, but I can't recommend unless you have a deep love for Chinese mythology or want some eye candy to show off your 40 series GPU."
Negative,Meh at best. Half baked game with an uninspired combat system. Don't waste you $$.
Negative,Good game but you need a Phd in gaming to play this game
Negative,Not as i expected
Negative,the updated made my game not playable
Negative,"People treat this game like its the second coming of christ when its a 6/10 at best. The moment to moment is fun but the balancing needs major work. Graphics are beautiful, the story is there, the combat is challenging and fun when its not blatantly requiring you to cheese every fight you are in."
Negative,"At first I semi liked it, then around dune tiger rat part I hated it. After that something clicked and everything was easy again and I finished the game. Prison was my fav level. But last two chapters were boring, especially last one. Whatever, anyway, I dont recommend the game because it doesn't respect my time. There are too many secrets that are missable, some even required to help with main bosses. I was locked out of true ending because at my age I don't care about watching countless youtubes and wanking for hours to game wikis about how to do what when. I restarted one save once because game locked me out of quests that I've done but I stepped my foots pinky toe into wrong boss arena and I lost half a day of progress. After then I just finished the game because I suffer from sunk cost fallacy."
Negative,"honestly this is trash, Grind xp in one tiny arena, go to boss relentless staggering attacks from boss -press b for 90 seconds boss stops attacking for 1 second you get one light auto attack in. press b for 90 more seconds repeat. i really wanted to like this game its just boring."
Negative,"I can't deny that the combat feels very good, however something feels very cheap about this game... From the quality of the voice acting to the invisible walls you randomly run into walking through the trees, it definitely feels like it's missing something."
Negative,"I really wanna like the game because of the theme, overall design and graphics. But the level design is confusing without a map, the fighting system gets repetitive fast and is tbh pretty boring. Also many bosses have weird hitboxes so you dont hit them with charged attacks. I regret buying into the hype and getting the game at full price. Final boss was incredible tho."
Negative,"As a soul-like games fan, I am also Chinese. I am glad to see people interested in this game, Sun Wukong is a well-known mythological character in East Asia. I think this game's four chapters are pretty good, it is worth a TGA game nominee but the last two chapters are shit and I don't want to play anymore after I get the cloud without any guide to the next target. By the way, some boss even if I stay near their head, I still can not hit them. (The last boss in Chapter 4) This is my first time to pre-order a game, totally, this game is worth playing, but open high and go low, lots of details need polishing. 作为灵魂类游戏的爱好者，我也是中国人。我很高兴看到有人对这款游戏感兴趣，孙悟空在东亚是一个著名的神话人物。我认为这款游戏的四个章节都很不错，值得作为 TGA 游戏的提名，但最后两章像坨屎，我拿到筋斗云之后就不想再玩了，没有任何下一个目标的指引。顺便说一句，有些 BOSS 即使我靠近他们的头，还是打不到他们 空气墙 空气墙。(第 4 章最后一个 Boss）这是我第一次预购游戏，这款游戏完全值得一玩，但高开低走了，很多细节需要打磨。"
Negative,"For the first 15h of the game i enjoy it, the game is very beautiful and the combat was fun.But at some point you encounter some boss that are very difficult which i don't mind it but the difficulty isn't linear for every boss.The more you advance and the more you feel the game very repetitive and boring, you spam the same combo on every boss until you get it and that's it... Furthermore the game is very linear and there is no exploration to do (some area are very empty) .... In addition to all of this the music & the lore in the game is inexistant and not engaging.I feel the game is more like a Boss rush rather than a good RPG, oh yeah i forgot to mention there is a skill tree but the design of it is terrible, you just spend your points on base stats and thats it. For the crafting system  same thing there is very few craft to do.So yeah a bit disappointed for the price..."
Negative,Game crashes in shaders every single time
Negative,Roughly 5 hours in and it's a slog to play...boring all around
Negative,"First Time ever Righting a review for a game. I have the say the game is really good, however seeing as I just lost 12 hours worth of game play out of nowhere for seemingly no reason and all of the support teams can't seem to do anything about it. I will like to inform people if you are playing this you are taking a risk of loosing your save file at any point in any chapter for seemingly any reason. For this reason I will have say No I don't recommend this game."
Negative,"Not exactly the type of game I was looking for. Had various stuttering and dialog issues from the very start. Allowed game to set the proper graphic settings, even still...turned down some of them and off others I didn't think would be beneficial. Still had fps drops and skips.Dialog not working at all correctly on the very first movie and from then on...tried setting to Chinese with English subtitles, but did not fix problem at all."
Negative,This game is definitely souls like and it pisses me off. I wanted a new fun action rpg. Not another rage inducing souls like. This game is incredibly buggy and has crashed at least 6 times in my first hour. People only say its good because they cant handle the fact that this game will probably be the only mediocre game that comes out this year and they are too nostalgic off of elden ring.
Negative,"The moment I encounter a boss with 2 distinct phases, it just kills the fun for me. It feels like the game is trying to drag things out unnecessarily, making it more stressful than challenging. I enjoy tough games, but I can't stand when they resort to these tactics to fake difficulty. I regret buying this game because it feels more like a chore than a true test of skill, and that's when I know it's time to stop playing."
Negative,keeps freezing.  PC met requirements and I even adjusted VRAM.Unfortunately no refund available.
Negative,"bruh how fucken hard is it to have my controler not disconnect every 10 minutes? Only game ive ever had this happen to. Updated my drivers and everything, honestly so fucken annoying"
Negative,BEFORE YOU BUY: IF YOU ARE NOT INTO BOSS SPAMMING AND BRUTALLY UNBALANCED GAMEPLAY THEN DON'T BUY
Negative,"Well this is my second review, the first one was I gave it a thumbs up and I actually quite enjoyed the game as chapter 1 wasn't really that difficult. It was challenging, but not frustratingly challenging.However, enter chapter 2 and especially that fuck face tiger vanguard. This is where the difficulty spiked so hard, that instead of being able to enjoy the game, it just went beserk. I've played a few souls like before (Sekiro, Dark Souls, Nioh) and by all the pre release review, people were saying it isn't a souls like but more like god of war, so I was extremely happy and excited. Well, that excitement ended with chapter 2 and it absolutely is a souls like. If a boss takes more than 20 attempts to beat, what the fuck else do you call it. The game is frustratingly difficult.Its good for people out there who like a challenging game, but people who have jobs and a family and also want to enjoy some quality single player games, this isn't fun at all since we have limited time. As I said, Chapter 1 was not too bad, it was fairly easy, however, the difficulty just spiked at the vanguard tiger and instead of having an enjoyable experience with the game, it suddenly turned into a fucking nightmare. It's taken me over 50 hours to reach the final boss and that has come at the cost of me not spending any time with my family this whole week.So, is it enjoyable, well only for those who like a challenge, for casual gamer's, stay away, this is not your cup of tea, especially if you're married, have kids and have a job, this isn't the game at all. I wish it had a difficulty setting, that would make the game more enjoyable and accessible for all. It would make people who want a challenge enjoy the game as well as people who just want to have some casual fun while getting entertained with a nice story line. Honestly speaking, with the game being so fucking hard, I can't even remember what the story was for this game, its just lost on me.Yeah it sold well and nothing against the developers, it really is a cool game, but for fuck's sake just add a difficulty option for casual gamer to enjoy such games too. Not everyone has the time and patience to learn every fucking pattern of a boss move. I really hope they add a difficulty setting in a later patch, so some of us out there could actually enjoy the game play too.I honestly wish I could get a refund for this game as at the end of it, it absolutely didn't feel enjoyable at all. God of War was enjoyable, because the difficulty was manageable, but this isn't manageable at all. I still like the game, I just wished it had difficulty setting option thats all."
Negative,fix the fucking performance
Negative,my stone essence item disappeared by itself
Negative,hitboxes worse than DS1
Negative,"If you had already experienced the whole game who also interested in the story about 《Travel to the west》(which named 《西游記》in Chinese), just buy a picture book and take a watch. Sun WuKong the character in this game is totally a failed role shaping, being COMPLETELY DISCARDED its spirit."
Negative,"I would really like to enjoy this game... But it seems like the game has a random chance of crashing every time I open the pause menu. Runs great otherwise. I have a Ryzen 7 5800X, RTX 4080, and 32 Gigs of Ram. No problem gameplay wise, but the pause menu has been the toughest boss I've faced all so far. Sometimes it crashes, sometimes it doesn't... Roll of the dice, really. I've tried all the ""fixes"" I can.  I'll be happy to change my review once this is patched."
Negative,"worst boss i ever fought inna game and terrible mechanics with dodging, wish i could refund because my game didnt save no progress but exceeded  9 hours but dont recommend this game. this game makes me never want to get this genre of game ever game"
Negative,"Would have given a mixed review if it had been possible.It's OK, but not that good... sorry"
Negative,"Just finished chapter 3, an so far the game is AMAZING definitely Worth it!"
Negative,"This game is quite difficult.  And not in the enjoyable sense.  The bosses are very unpredictable to the point of comical.  The game is beautiful and plays well but outside of the cut scene it doesn't really pick up.  So it does really well with the potential and graphics but falls short in being fun.  I really wish they could have made this similar to a GoW or something but I think they substituted the lack of game development and story to distract with difficulty.  After 11 hours, I'm putting this game down for a different title."
Negative,"The game is gorgeous don't get that mistaken, but when you get past the intro and actually fight enemies and use the mechanics, you will realize just how bare bones combat is in this game. Maps are beautiful, but EMPTY! Enemies are there in small pockets, but they offer no challenge whatsoever. If you come from Fromsoft games and soulslike games, then this game can give you the challenge you wanted, but the environments are so boring. Combat comes down to ""mash light string. When Staff glows, do Heavy move"". You're tricked into believing there are stances in this game that will change up the moveset but all they do is change the heavy attack and the heavy ender of light strings. This game is VASTLY overhyped and is only popular because of the name Wukong and the anime character tied into him. If this game had it's own original MC this game would not recieve the love it gets unfortunately"
Negative,"I feel like the developers intended to make a game that tries to do everything extremely well but ended up falling short on many key pointsPros: looks fantasticworld building is very cool and the Chinese language options make it feel that much more immersivemovement and skill point system is very goodCons: the game revolves entirely around boss fights which if its your thing then its dope but it wasnt for mebosses are difficult and time consuming but tend to lean towards unfair and luck based rather than punishing but learnablevery little exploration making the world feel extremely empty (if you were looking for an open-world souls like, it is far more linear than i expected)your one and only weapon hits like damp baguette (Sekiro did this well, Wukong does not)"
Negative,"Another Souls like wannabe Elden ring game, the game is just plain stupid, the devs have created a beautiful world, with gameplay but hid it behind difficult bosses, I mean the only point of this game is for you to lose weight on how sweaty it is. Basically the game itself can be described as: -----[Hard boss]----[Normal boss]----[Easy boss]----[Extra hard boss]---- etc. and the fact that the bosses are literally in hand distance between is just plain crazy, like why is that done? You progress in the world like little to none and get blocked by bosses every 10-15 minutes. This game is surely not for me, but would really like to see the world of the game, but I cannot as it is hidden behind hard bosses, excellent work. Really do not get the hype of the game."
Negative,"Who would win: a ******* literal monkey god what can ride a cloud or obi wan kenobi having high ground throwing rocksyea... the fact that a single archer is more immortal than a god and cant be touched because monkey forgot how to climb when he discovered internet is braindeadfix thisedit: this is the shitest dork sould wanna be, imagine getting to 1% hp due to cutscene, because thats more realistic because the boss hit you in cutsceneyeathey did it for realismmonkey is flying on a cloud and giants are standing on clouds but they took your full hp bar to 1% due to realismafter a cutscene2 times same boss, what a fucking chinese gamealso, on the principle LOUD IS FUNNY they did ""if they cant see then boss is hardand they just fill your screen with sandthats itsandnot a hard boss with hard moves, combos, not a onetap god, just sandyou got fucked by sandsandsadnsadsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
Negative,"Fuckers just earned all the profits so they will not even give their efforts on fixing the FSR and all the other performance issues, FIRST FIX THE GAME DUMASSES, AFTER THAT MAKE AS MUCH DLCs AS YOU WANT. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PC CAUSE THESE FUCKERS WON'T FIX THE GAME. ALL THE RANDOM LAGS AND USELESS SHARPENING FILTER AND SHITTY ASS FSR."
Negative,"bugs, not responsive"
Negative,"This games is just bad. it seems to be cool at first but deep into it the combat does no feels right at all, there no impact/feedback to it."
Negative,invisible walls. bad dub. especially main character. invisible walls. wait for a sale
Negative,"a lot of bugs, invisible walls are very poorly optimized, fps spikes, fight gameplay is NOT good.on the other hand, the Lore is amazing! not worth 60$, maybe 20$4/10"
Negative,performance is atrocious and completely inconsistent
Negative,"The game is good but it's being held back by performance. The game really needs to be optimize, I get constant frame rates drops during every combat phase. When exploring the world most places runs very smoothly but once I encounter an enemy the frame rates begins to drop making perfect dodge or parry incredibly difficult to perform. Until the game is optimize I do not recommend playing this game."
Negative,"Fair warning, this game had continual crashing errors for me. This may not affect everyone, but after extensive research, I found many others with similar issues. The many fixes stated online did not provide a solution for me.  I may try again once this game has been through its public beta test phase."
Negative,Further play testing and additional patching needed. Inconsistent invisible wall. What should be passable terrain suddenly blocks character during combat. Coupled with fact player character being able to automatically jump over low obstacles creates confusion in navigating and exploring the environment. Mid game in Dark Souls-esque dungeon invisible wall is inconsistently placed/removed and created multiple instances of character auto jumping over low obstacle to his death. What could've been a Sen's Fortress/Duke's Archive like dungeon becomes pure frustration to go through.Overall combat is pretty solid although not particularly innovative. There are some hitbox issue but overall serviceable. It is understandable as the game is not designed to be done no damage. Being able to refund most of your skill points gives players freedom to explore which is a huge bonus.No comment on story since I didn't play this game for the story and was not in consideration for recommendation.The issue in the first paragraph is the main reason I cannot recommend this game at the release price. Would recommend at $30 to $40. Post release patching may change my review and I would recommend at full price if fixed. I understand there are plenty of AAA games that are in worse condition at release. But I feel it shouldn't be the norm for full priced games.
Negative,"unnecessarily spinning the staff to make combat seem flashy is just flat out boring. attacks have terrible registration, game stutters. right click is a 4+ second long animation you can't cancel.STOP MAKING FLASHY ATTACKS THAT MEAN NOTHING OUTSIDE TRYING TO LOOK COOL!!! it gets old really fast."
Negative,"This game is incredibly buggy and most of the enemies are insanely easy. The ""hard"" ones is basically you fighting the camera angles.IDK wtf is going on with the gourd either, it basically works when it wants to for me."
Negative,"If you like constant respawning and doing the same thing over and over again. Get this! Bosses are fun, but thats about it"
Negative,"Complex maps, very little guidance, and it's easy to miss parts of the storyline and NPCs."
Negative,"There's some signaling issues that make it impossible to know when you're on a side path and when you're on the main path. In my first playthrough, I missed a journal entry that's gated off after you beat the level it's in. I reached NG+ with the intention of 100%ing the game, and I accidentally fought the level boss and missed my chance again. I'm not finishing my NG+ playthrough. There's no point now."
Negative,"game of the year? the entire gamer community is a joke. just because the game devs didnt agree sweet baby inc to make changes in the game doesnt make the game our messiah. i was brought into a very slow dissapointment of video games and especially the gamers community. i not longer feel bad missing out on video games because there is nothing to miss.  50% of the time attacks dont land on enemies.cant pause the game during boss fights (escape doesnt work).character is not in sync with me and can really be feld during boss fights.all cutscenes are irrelevant and a lot of them were unskippable due maybe the game devs changed it recently.i will finish the game but i dont thing it a good game, its an average one. ive played sekiro, darksouls, elden ring and never had a bad comment about them."
Negative,"Visually amazing, but design-wise it's poor. The gameplay instantly feels familiar and a little stale, and I wasn't able to get into the groove of whatever system it was trying to present. The world itself contains a lot of invisible walls, and none of the detail I've come to enjoy in From games; similarly, the encylopedia tells you a lot about the literature, but nothing interesting about the obstinate story you're here for. The combat is passable but uninspired, it doesn't feel particularly tight and it's an odd choice to release a game on the shoulders of stuff like Sekiro or Stellar Blade and have just about zero parrying involved outside of a badly-translated skill on the smash tree.It's a good game but I don't think I see it as GotY or something people will talk about all that much in the future. If you've played FFXVI it's roughly all the same pro's and con's for better or worse. More spectacle than substance."
Negative,"Yeah worst purchase i made in years, got more then the recomended for the game yet LAGGGGG, STUTTTTER, CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASH 30min gameplay 3h loading screen bosses go invisible invincible, damage is sooo weak 0 chance to lvl up against bosses my damn fart hits harder than that stick its bearly good for picking my teeth with, cant get my money back wasted 60$ on THIS"
Negative,best boss fight is where they use 30 fps drop to stutter kill you
Negative,"Its awesome i have to say, but the lag, delay in cutscenes, and heavy lag spikes (EDIT): Nevermind this games awesome just perfect"
Negative,Could be a fun game but every boss fight consists of chasing the bosses across the arena as they run away and either hurl stuff at you or evade and go underground and attack you. Basically everything that hits you staggers and nothing you do ever affects anything as most of the enemies and bosses are just damage sponges as you progress. I didn't beat the game I got tired of chasing everything I want to kill. I'd understand this tactic if you had even one single ranged attack in this game but you do not. It's incredibly annoying to have to chase bosses every fight then cast a spell and have it nullified by a cutscene that shouldn't exist in the middle of a fight. You have to crutch spells HARD to win fights and 90% of your charged attacks won't land because whatever you were fighting took like 2 steps back and the developers can't program so you won't track your target then you miss and get hit once then fly across the ground then get smacked again before you can get up. I don't think the people who made this game have ever bothered to play it.This game is overrated and the devs have no idea how to program or else you'd dodge when you hit the dodge button and action queuing would be a thing but neither exist and make the controls feel clunky. Bosses all act the same and run away instead of engaging you. Boring game.
Negative,chapter 4 has way to many bugs in it.. like bosses staying in the air treating it like they're walking on the ground
Negative,"Being unable to rebind important action keys like dodge,jump,sprint etc is totally retarded...who the fuck uses ctrl key for jumping , you serious devs ?? gtfo"
Negative,"too much sticker, no worth to buy"
Negative,-10/10audio delay and stuttering
Negative,"This game is basically a soulslike with no open world, harder bosses, no weapon options and a fraction of the content. I don't find banging my head against a wall repeatedly to be fun.  Regret purchase."
Negative,terrible combat experience
Negative,Very poor optimization. Has the same issue jedi survivor had at launch.
Negative,Input lag is so bad that a lot of the time the inputs will not register. Sometimes I can't even use dodge when outside combat. Must be fixed.
Negative,"Once you get to yellowbrow, be prepared to spend days on him waiting to do anything. He is so bad of a boss he ruins the game."
Negative,"Edit: I'm changing my review. Upon first inspection, this game is fantastic. But the more I played, the less I enjoyed. The bosses near the end are frustrating and designed to be gruelling to face. I enjoy a challenge and, having beaten shadow of the erdtree very recently, thought this would be fresh take on a genre I massively enjoy. But it just isn't good enough. You don't have immunity frames, but bosses do. This means that, when you're performing one of the many flourishing animations they've created, you could very well get half-hit or one-shot.  Near the end, that's pretty much your only options. Everything hits like a truck, and are designed to kill the player. I know that sounds strange, obviously things are designed to kill the player, so let me explain. Later on you fight a deer, it spawns tornados, I'd say about 8 at any given time. These aren't small tornadoes and they do a massive amount of damage. My entire health bar would go from 100% to 0 within maybe 3 seconds. No attempt was made to balance them. They don't blow you away while doing like a third, in fact they can freeze you, meaning you are 100% screwed if the status bar gets filled up. They want to kill the player without any thought as to whether or not its actually fair. It's a tornado, sure make it do damage, but then have me get blown away so that I actually survive. If the boss can spawn 8 of these, and move around itself, they shouldnt be able to kill me so easily. Some bosses have massive combos, a common complaint with shadow of the erdtree. I defended it in shadow because an incredible amount of effort had been made in ensuring the player could safely deal damage while the boss is performing its moves. In some instances, a jump attack would be safe, in others a roll attack. All of this could be done without suffering damage. That was not done here. Late game bosses have massive combos, many of which take place in the air making them practically immune, that can essentially one shot you if you get caught by one. Gear is frustrating. You have to complete a very missable side quest to upgrade your gear. As I prefer to play these games blind, I missed it and I'm sure others did to. Such a crucial aspect of the game shouldnt be optional. Think dark souls, a game Black Myth is obvs trying to ape irrelevant of what the creator says, where the blacksmith is heard before he's seen and is located in a place visited by almost 100% of players. Playing the late game areas without this is an absolute slog. It's poor design all around. Speaking of, invisible walls are an absolute insult in a game in 2024. Sure, I could stomach it in the ""open world"" areas, but the fact that they're included in boss fights is an absolute joke. The amount of times I'd be fighting a boss and suddenly find myself stun locked because of an invisible wall is innumerable. Funnily enough, that was the straw that broke the camel's back. The moment I finish writing this review I'm uninstalling. I won't be completing the game. Chap 6 is as far as I go. I'd also like to touch on some incredibly frustrating design decisions, like having some bosses be immune to damage until you break a sort of shield. To break their shields you have to generate 3 focus points and perform a heavy attack. These heavy attacks are elementary for bosses to dodge so you also have to try and stun them. Quite a few bosses will be vulnerable to stuns are first but, seemingly at random, they will start breaking the stun instantly. At first, I thought it changed depending on the phase, but that was disproven the further I went. As far as I can tell, it is random. Some bosses will also remove parts of your kit. They might half your stamina and make you fat roll, they might make your clones evil and make it so you can't stun them. In a game seemingly designed to allow the player options in how they fight, seeing these options restricted was very disappointing. Later on many bosses just have health bars thrown around like its nothing. Out of the last 3 bosses I've fought, 2 had secondary health bars. One was the deer which could one shot me with one of its 8 tornados, the other was a monkey that, after entering its second phase and getting a full heal, would spawn a copy of itself with its own separate health bar. These monkeys both had massive AOE attacks and I have little interest in forcing myself to beat them just so I can fight the next boss which is also going to be a slog and a pain in my ass. This experience has been almost wholly unsatisfying. Early on the game is an absolute pisstake. Nothing gave me any trouble. I think I died maybe 10 times before the end of the third chapter, which was the first instance of the game manufacturing difficulty. It's isn't refined enough. I know it's their first attempt and, considering that, it's ok but they bit off far more than they could chew. They shouldve reduced the amount of bosses in the game and made a real effort on making sure that those bosses were as refined as possible. There are a few bosses I enjoy, I think my favourite was the secret boss of chap 4, but most of them are either pointlessly easy or unsatisfyingly hard. Other than the bosses, this game doesn't have a massive amount to offer. Gameplay is king for games such as this and none of the smaller minions are going to give you any trouble. To really experience the extent of a player's power and skill you're going to need to fight bosses, but they failed in that respect. It's sad to see."
Negative,"I really wanted to like this game, but it's just not for me. Seems to lack any real substance. Find myself going from one boss to another with no breather in between. Just.. meh.Also, why no difficulty settings? lolwot"
Negative,"The game is amazing, but unfortunately cannot run in 1650 graphic card."
Negative,"Honest opinion, the game isn't special.I don't plan on dick riding the game because people cried so hard about it the day it released.I love Journey To The West, Wukong, and anything associated to it, but this game has brought me nearly 0 enjoyment.This is my 3rd run through on new game+ and I have never been at work wishing time would go faster so I could keep playing, it is a terribly written story, boring silent main character that feels like it was developed by someone who played 10 minutes of Dark Souls and tried to copy it (even if they claimed it isn't a souls-like)The controls feel unresponsive during more intense bosses, which is terrible, since unlike souls and Elden Ring, the bosses in those had rules, the bosses in this seems to be swing randomly and rarely even stumble.If you do stumble them, they recover nearly instantly.if you want a challenge, this is a decent enough game for that, but even after beating it, I felt no pride in overcoming some of the more challenging bosses, I just turned it off and booted up a different game.After all the time since its reveal trailer, this game was on my mind, and in less than 2 days, I felt bored.I cannot recommend this game unless someone sees it on a good sale, because even if it has plenty to do and explore, it is like having a large plate of food with 0 flavor to it."
Negative,"- Graphics (The main reason for not recommending it): I'm playing the game on an RTX 4060 with an AMD Ryzen 7 5700X. Everyone keeps saying the game looks beautiful, but honestly, it looks terrible by 2024 standards (or it has awful optimization). The over-sharpening and contrast are so bad that I can’t really enjoy it. And this is a known issue reported in many online blogs, not just by me.- Story and gameplay: If you're expecting a clear and straightforward story, this game isn't for you. Some people say, ""This is like God of War,"" but I don't see the resemblance at all (aside from equipping armors and the skill tree). Let’s be real, this is a soulslike game, even if some folks don’t want to admit it. Is that a bad thing? Well, not if you’re looking for a soulslike experience. But was I expecting that? Nope!In summary, this is Sekiro being a monkey in a boss rush unable to block or properly parry an attack, which means you are forced to dodge everything or use a future ability in the game. And again, this is a soulslike characteristic, but at least in those games, you can block attacks. ""But man, stop saying that this is a soulslike, this is more like God of War""... well in God of War you have a shield, right?"
Negative,"First of all its a 9 out of 10 game one of the best i played in the last years so why the bad review2 things. First is the last boss and second is the ending with no spoilers ill just say that you have 2 endings 1 good 1 bad and 99.9% of the people will get to the bad ending the problem is that this ending is like spitting in your face for all the hard work you made and like making you feel that you did nothing and it was pointless so i kinda felt suck after that and saw on google that there is another secret ""good"" ending.I had to go back in the save file ofcurse cuz i started new game + didnt had any idea of another ending.Now the boss on this one is the only one that i didnt manage to beat he is so cheap with those scene attack that you almost cant avoid and thats just make you feel frustrated and annoyed most of his attack is like a movie and not feels like souls game which ironically make it harder its more of a scripted boss to look cool but they really have no idea how to make it work and my character is freaking buffed level 100 with everything so in the end the game just make me feel angry and disappointed and thats why the bad review. Still worth getting ofcurse."
Negative,"if you like boring linear design with too many bosses with terrible design, get this game!!!!!"
Negative,"visually stunning, but the gameplay is just really weak. Almost every boss and enemy move-set is boring at best."
Negative,"The screen is constantly glitching when i run the game, it makes the game lag and is overall very annoying."
Negative,very button mashy. combat is boring. not precise like Fromsoft games. bosses are damage sponges. you kill every boss the same way. slap with stick 300 times. wish i could refund. just not for me.
Negative,"Crashes constantly, on a loop in the prologue and can not progress. Ive turned off motion blur, gone in compatibility mode. Game Science, release a patch and fix this."
Negative,My pc restarts constantly I love everything else but they need to optimize and fix this crash/pc restart issue I have a ryzen 5 5600x and a rx 7800xt👎
Negative,"The controller input delay makes the game borderline unplayable. If you thinking about using a controller, forget about it."
Negative,"consistently freezing, had no issues first chapter and now i move 2 steps and i freeze and have to wait 10 seconds for the game to catch up"
Negative,"Honestly I'd wait for a sale for this one, the story is weird and interesting. The combat is fun for the first couple hours, but after a while it kinda falls flat. Almost like its stuck being a soulslike action rpg without really focusing on any one of those elements so instead of an amazing Action, RPG, or Soulslike, its a pretty alright combination of three.Wish I enjoyed it more 7/10"
Negative,"The game is amazingly fun but I would not recommend until the game is actually optimized. Chapter 1 and 2  runs fine but Chapter 3 in the snowy place is a absolute mess and close to unplayable in several sections of the chapter. A lot of the boss fights are extreme stuttering messes. I have tried in both Windows 11 and Linux and both play the same. It is the game and there is nothing that can be done to optimize it on the end users side, besides waiting for future updates to hopefully fix this while I still want to come back to play the game. I have a 3090 TI and 13900KS playing in 1440p. The optimization, no matter how many youtube videos or guides you find that say it will optimize the game and fix stuttering, will not be fixed without optimization from the developers themselves."
Negative,"I love the art direction the ambient sound, music, everything art related felt awesome, but the game felt really restritive on what you can explore, fighting felt a bit underwhelming and I personally feel it could be much better optimized."
Negative,"i5-12600kf32GB RAMRTX 4060The only problem with this game is the Unreal Engine 5 (graphic engine). It does not make it stable for fights like a Devil May Cry since you need precision to dodge blows and its latency stability in fights is essential, depending on the place/ Enemy location latency may vary. It has nothing to do with frame generate or vsync. The game is focused more on environments than combat, so the difficulty of the game is only based on the character's level. If you like challenges, you can try like me (low-level) reach enemies, but you have to keep in mind that the Unreal Engine 5 will be another variable when it comes to combat.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------El único problema con este juego es el motor gráfico unreal engine 5. No lo vuelve estable para las peleas como un Devil may cry ya que necesitas precisión para esquivar golpes y la estabilidad de latencia del mismo en peleas es algo primordial, dependiendo del lugar/locación de los enemigos la latencia puede variar. No tiene nada que ver con el frame generation o vsync. El juego está enfocado mas en entornos que en combates, por lo que la dificultad del juego solo se basa en el nivel del personaje. Si te gustan los retos puedes intentar como yo en llegar a los enemigos con poco nivel, pero tienes que tener en cuenta que el motor gráfico será una variable mas a la hora de los combates."
Negative,"fuck your shitty ass shaders, stop forcing me to use your garbage ass settings and let me turn it off thank you"
Negative,Currently bugs and crashes make the game non-playable. Cannot progress in game without continuous crashes. Will revise review when/if fixed.
Negative,Buttons don't seem to register more than 60% of the time. This game is just frustrating to play. Graphics are good though I guess.
Negative,monke is pretty but just not that fun a world
Negative,"Requested a refund beyond 2 hours+ gameplay, and Steam will not approve. The game is too hard and time consuming - there I said it. I regret purchasing this game and do not recommend anyone buy this game if they do not enjoy the likes of Dark Souls or Elden Ring. It's a difficult, painstaking game, and expensive at that. Think twice before you pay Steam for this. There is no alternate difficulty."
Negative,"not recommend form me this definitely feels souls like when they said definitely not in their marketing. all boss combat is very pattern recognition and punishing if you miss ie souls like. i can say the game play is very smooth and gfx are good, story line is also interesting this is just not my kind of game"
Negative,"Simply put, I like the idea and graphics of the game but the gameplay is not what I expected. I had heard this game described as ""Chinese God of War"" and ""Souls like"" but to be honest I don't think it's very similar to either except very generically, and similarly, it does not play like Sekiro or Ghost of Tsushima either. If you are a fan of tight hitboxes and precise movement based combat with reaction based parries, this game does not have that. It is closer to Nioh in my opinion, with a lot of multihit, long useless animations that require animation cancelling to get out of properly to time against enemy attacks, thusly lending a fairly janky flow to the feel of the combat. For comparison, the most recent melee/magic based game that I enjoyed fully that wasn't Elden Ring was Dragon's Dogma 2. This game lacks some of the pizzaz that game has as well. That being said, the art direction is fantastic, and IMO the English voice actors did a good job from what I've seen. I'm gonna refund because honestly there's a lot of games about to come out, and I'd rather pay 30$ for this later at some point, and get Space Marine 2 and God of War Ragnarok on launch."
Negative,constant crashes during boss fights...cheats in end game bosses for wins to make the game seem as though its difficult when it isnt close to being hard...prepare yourself for a major headache after knowing you won an easy fight that makes you stand in close proximity of a boss and whiff swings then boom youre dead again
Negative,Intel 13700k Nvidia RTX 4090 raytracing in this game doesnt work for me its a shame i thought me pc could handle it i hope they will fix this im struck with real bad performance im gonna ask for a refund
Negative,"Simply not my cup of tea.. Great graphics, great combat but that's it. There is a boss in every corner and it's very souls like even though it says it isn't."
Negative,"MOST WORSE ACTION RPG GAME, ridiculous combat, when I attack enemies, always counter on me, IT NOT FUNNY. IT SUCK!!! such as YELLOW LOONG and SCORPION"
Negative,"Idk, I keep thinking one day I'll like games like this but glorified rhythm games masquerading as combat rpg's just isn't my thing - guess I'll stick to real challenges, like competitive games, against real people, with skill."
Negative,"I cannot recommend this game to any AMD users. This game has done nothing but crash during the games opening sequence over and over. It either crashes while the cut scene is playing, or it crashes while I'm in combat. I've spent hours attempting troubleshoot these issues and nothing has worked. It's a real shame to, because I want to give this game a chance. AMD 5800x3d - up to dateAMD 7900xtx - up to date24gb of ram"
Negative,"Beautiful animations, models & graphics, a well thought out combat system that feels incredibly satisfying when it shines, and nice animation shorts between chapters. Unfortunately, this glorious staging is accompanied by lackluster level design that feels pointlessly large at times without a layout that feels engaging in any way and little to no (good) story telling. While the combat can feel very satisfying at times, most of the time it just looks cool and is far too easy and forgivable.It's a lot better than most AAA releases these days, but that doesn't really make it a good game for me."
Negative,"Can see the appeal but not for me personally. Very linear progression and level design leaving little to the imagination. It didn't feel like there was any weight to my decisions in the skill tree and gear was ""equip whatever you just picked up"". I was very bored after completing chapter one and don't imagine I'll finish the game. Decent combat and great enemy designs though. Would have been more engaged if there was more leading up to boss fights but I know that would be difficult due to the number of bosses in the game."
Negative,"Plenty of secrets and hidden paths, but no map to know where to find them. Most of the game is linear but you can get lost in some areas. It gets boring after 15 hours and combat is a bit samey. You do get a parry attack but it's called different. Get all the hints before starting or you will miss some really good stuff that I wish i knew. Graphics are great and is well optimized, great improvements of frame generator. It no longer causes blur and stutter when you move camera quickly. The only actual good boss design is the first and the very last one because you can read their attacks easily. Too much visuals and particles all around makes it hard to focus. Game is ok, not worth  2,415,714 all time peak which is the biggest reason why I bought it. 8/10 good graphics, only a bit too much."
Negative,"Edit: As I play the same I am finding more and more frustrating and poorly tested bossesI want to rate this a thumbs up, but for its price and hype, I really cannot.     I think if you are looking for a challenging action RPG with soul-lite elements, you can enjoy this game. It isn’t quite the AAA game of the decade some are touting it as but there has clearly been a lot of work put into this. That being said there are some serious areas of improvement:     Worlds are cool but you can’t tell when a path or small step leads to a secret or is in fact an invisible wall.    Lore is incoherent, you can loosely tell what's going on, but most is missing background or explanation of the characters    Bosses are 90% one shot walkovers with the occasional boss with high health and damage, long combos and there is little in between. The bosses don’t feel rewarding to beat, bar maybe one or two. Some of the more “grand” bosses are mostly flashy long animation one shot mechanics, and I found myself wondering if they wanted a Dark souls-style boss or something more cinematic. Many bosses don’t feel play tested and I don’t know if many of the bosses are fun OR challenging.     The combat is good and talent system is mostly interesting. I find the game becomes less of a soul-lite as it progresses as the spells and talents come into play, though you will still be dodging and finding windows for damage for most bosses (if the boss doesn't just roll-over and die).There were some times the game just either so dull or frustrating, I felt like just leaving it. This was wasn't in a fit of rage.   The cocoon bridge is an excellent example of no play testing and no thought being put into if the game is fun or rewarding to play between bosses Some minor things:    There is a shop to upgrade your “flasks” (gourd) but there is no equivalent for the rest of the game, so you are constantly going back to the first chapter to upgrade - something i was convinced was me missing the shop for the next two chapters then had to google to discover you just need to back track every time    There will be  times you will use a spell, only for it not to work because a boss hasn’t finished their animation (i’m mostly         talking about immobilise here), it’s not fun losing mana with no other effect.     The graphics are nice but rely heavily on post-processing. Some will find this distracting and the art style and lighting makes it very easy to miss paths and possible hidden areas."
Negative,animation lock is garbage
Negative,Clunky game with poor controls. Cinematics are very beautiful
Negative,It a great game but its a time waster due to high difficulty. Im never buying another souls-like/ souls-borne game. Before you know it about two hours of you life is spent on one difficult boss.
Negative,Beautiful Graphics but other than that pretty underwhelming. It’s a boss rush game with boring combat. Was fun for the first chapter but getting further and further it was pretty bad. Some of the combat styles doesn’t fit into this game like the heavy strike. 3 seconds of an animation vs something like a dragon missed the point. And the dragon wasn’t the only fight where it was bad. Invisible walls which telling me every 2 seconds I can’t got this direction is also REALLY frustrating. And when i say every 2 seconds I mean EVERY 2 SECONDS! I can’t even tell how many times i thought I could explore this or that and the game said just no here run into invisible walls they are fun! I can’t really recommend this game for 60 bucks. If it’s on a sale for 30 okay get it but in it’s state now it’s not worth that much.
Negative,Product received for free due to purchase of GPU. No incentive to purchase GPU based on receiving product. It's a chinese copy of everything you like except bad. Mechanics from a bunch of games are incorporated badly. Souls progression but no loss on death. So what's the point? You'll eventually face tank through whatever boss/area you're struggling. Character tree progression is all 'this thing gets stronger'. Input lag is atrocious. Game is designed to run at 30 FPS with AI frame generation up-scaling to 60. Combat is button mash light attack light attack light attack oh i built up a heavy icon smash that.....it's boring. Pretty game. No depth. Highly encourage you not to purchase it.
Negative,"I was fully expecting to like this game, graphics are good and sound design is also nice. I've played a bunch of souls-likes and i find it safe to say that this is by far the easiest one i've ever played, which is what i think kills it for me. it has a very large and diverse skill menu which has me guessing a lot as to what to spec into and i feel like i currently am just all over the place with my build (have not looked one up) and yet i'm still rolling over bosses either first try or within 5 deaths max. i've played through 3 chapters so far and have even done the ""hard"" optional bosses and i have not felt challenged by the game, which has me feeling unsatisfied and sorta bored. maybe the last half of the game will get harder but that's not an excuse for the first half being a pushover.I plan on finishing the game just to say i did but honestly it's more out of obligation at this point than enjoyment. I think this game had a lot of potential since it has a lot going for it, but for a souls-like that focuses on boss fights as the bulk of it's content, they are a visual spectacle but not much more.As far as the mechanical reasons that the game is too easy, the primary culprit is that you have SOOO many i-frames on your dodge and even if you dodge a full second early you'll be safe from most attacks. in addition to the dodge, bosses don't punish players for healing. This means that you can just back away, heal up, go to the kitchen for a snack, call your parents, and then come back to continue; it makes it less important to learn a fight since you can just bulldoze through and kill before you run out of resources. this also means that you don't really need to know what you're doing since there's no need to learn a fight pattern, I have one shot almost every single boss by simply LA spamming and tossing in a jump heavy to stagger when my FP is full.To summarize my thoughts, the game isn't bad but it's not rewarding which makes it feel unsatisfying to play."
Negative,Annoyingly unfun combat
Negative,TOO many bugs and ghosting and im not impressed with the graghic
Negative,"Playing on an i9 4090 on latest wukong optimized drivers even with settings less than max. No other issues remotely close to this is other AAA graphic demanding titles. Its not the machine.Literally 7.5 minutes of shader compilations to even get the game going, EVERY TIME I BOOT, then constant horrible frame dropping any time action picks up. I fear that this will happen more and more where DLSS (and others) is now going to become a crutch to make unplayable games have a shot with frame gen. FFS I mean I cant even hold 30 fps without it. With it, I cant get 60, but it causes quite a bit of artifacting and noticeable downside.Also, I have never played a game that so clearly features exploration that has such egregious invisible walls. Can't jump on top of rocks or surfaces that would be obvious walkable terrain in other games, can't go anywhere near most ledges, can't even start to go up pretty average looking slopes sometimes. Game railroads you HARD. Then all the sudden you think you can rely on there being guard rails and you fall down a ledge onto a different path because its inconsistent. Sigh... Very frustrating and arbitrary.I'm still under 2 hours so yes I'm still in the beginning but it simply isn't what its hyped up to be. Maybe after a year of patching like Jedi Survivor this game will be something that deserves all this praise showered on it. Until then I have no idea what game you guys are playing. Requesting refund.Really is a shame because man, that intro was absolutely stunning (and I did actually manage to get through that without too much frame dropping). Got me all hyped up but I crashed harder than the monke hitting the mountain when the real game started."
Negative,It's okay but the combat doesn't feel great and the boss rush gets old fast. Can't say they didn't do a good job marketing it though!
Negative,B r u h
Negative,"Unfortunately cannot reccomend for the steam deck.. shows avg. of 45 fps and the game is borderline unplayable and constantly crashes.. compatibility for the deck would be awesome. Game is fun tho, just not on my fav platform"
Negative,"TLDR; It's Chinese Sekiro without a parry system.It looks really pretty and the music is good, but that's where the positives end.The controls are very clunky considering the combat relies entirely on quick reflex dodging and accuracy. There's about a half second delay between pressing a button and dodging or attacking and that's all it takes for you to get turned into a stain on the ground in most fights. There's an array of spells and transformations you can unlock but the vast majority of them are far less effective than just spamming your regular light attack. And the lack of any ranged attacks at all means you're constantly getting railed by archers that you can't hit. And then there's the way that gear all provides different bonuses for different builds, but then also comes with escalating basic stats. So even if you're using an effective build for your playstyle with your gear, you'll quickly be forced to abandon that build because your gear's stats become completely outclassed by new gear that has horrible bonus abilities but superior stats. It's a common misstep with game design that really shouldn't still be happening.  And then there's the exploration and navigation, the level design is simultaneously extremely linear and extremely confusing. There are invisible walls almost everywhere keeping you from properly exploring, which gets especially irritating when the wall is in front of a spot that looks exactly like a path you should be able to take or a place that would have a item stashed. And all the invisible walls makes it impossible to knock enemies off of ledges or those sort of tactics, but then the only place where there aren't invisible walls are in very exact specific spots where the enemy is designed to knock you off a ledge and kill you. All of this is severely compounded by the fact that the game has absolutely no map of the area available, and the later areas have dozens of branching paths some of which are extremely hard to see and just happen to be the single only path to progress the story. Which brings me to the story, it's completely incoherent and without any context or exposition whatsoever. Major characters appear for a single scene, do something that seems extremely meaningful, only to die a minute later or disappear without any explanation. Are they dead or just unconscious? Were they an enemy or an ally? Which characters work for which? Nobody really knows. The whole thing feels like someone having a fever dream after watching too many bootleg Chinese cartoons."
Negative,Once the xbox controller is disconnected there is no way to get it connected unless you restart the game. Very poor implementation. :steamfacepalm:
Negative,"It was just an annoying experienceThe more you play, the shittier the fights get. They get cheaper, they punish you for learning a fight.Combat feels sluggish, unresponsive and some inputs are just ignored.In fight cut scenes is just a no go for me, I'm not watching a freaking indian dramatic entrance, stop playing with my camera ffs. There's even a fight at the end that has more cut scene time than actual fight.Progression systems are uninspired, having three to four different ways to increase you life, mana and stam, why?There is so much invisible wall, might have hit them more than I hit enemies in the whole game."
Negative,Extremely inconsistent boss difficulties
Negative,terrain bugs fall thru map too much and lazy devs not filling in rest of map
Negative,Not for me. Game is very one dimensional and boring. Clunky and unresponsive combat and story is bland.
Negative,This game is literally impossible.  Just button mashing and dying infinitely on the first boss.  Who has time for games like these.  What happened to challenging but doable?
Negative,too  hard
Negative,"I hate this game, no dificulty to change."
Negative,bindings restricted left handed haters!
Negative,the boss fights are soo buggy im on the tornado boss and the boss constantly goes outside the map complete garbage
Negative,Game keeps crashing I have a pc that is very capable of running it. Reinstalled doesn't work compatability mode doesn't work turn off steam overlay doesn't work. Drivers updated doesn't work.
Negative,"Its okay, like a 6 or 7 out of 10.  The english localization is pretty bad and the story makes no sense whatsoever unless you have read the text it's based off of. The level design also just sucks.  Combat system is good, if a little clunky.All in all, dont be fooled by the overwhelming positive reviews as it is clearly being boosted by mass chinese reviews.  Think they might be getting social credit points for positive reviews, haha"
Negative,"I really wish i could play the game, but the lag during cutscenes is unbearable. I know it is becuase I'm playing on HDD, but my disc SSD is too small. Even after deleting/moving everything (besides Windows itself), I still lack 30GB. I don't think the HDD disc is suppoused to be shown as supported in system requierments, if it causes that much if a lag. Sad because i know the game is good, but i can't enjoy it"
Negative,"The game is very good looking, has great art and aesthetics but for me that's abt all it has good for it AT THE MOMENT...The cutscenes do not render properly, audio is cutting in and out, the stuttering of the game makes it absolutely unplayable. and the combat system is well thought out but not executed good enough. the animation locks in this game are absolutely horrible. The combat seemed to be smooth and can easily transition to different stances and actions but with how long the animation lock you out of doing other actions it just stupid...I do have only 3 hours in the game but it cannot play any further because of performance issues and the frustrating combat system. Maybe once they have optimised the game a little better it will be fun I played on the lowest settings possible and these are my specs.Processor12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700HVideo CardNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Laptop GPUVideo Card #2Intel(R) Iris(R) Xe GraphicsRAM16 GB"
Negative,"The game is overratedPros:Excellent graphics and outstanding combat mechanics.A wide variety of monsters and bosses, offering diverse challenges.Cons:Crashes during the prologue.The action mechanics and skill variations are quite limited, making the gameplay feel repetitive and monotonous over extended play sessions.For those familiar with the original work, the story's structure in the later stages is poorly executed and lacks depth.The map design is highly misleading, with uneven distribution of exploration rewards, some areas having invisible walls for boundary protection while others don't, leading to an inconsistent experience. The lack of clear markers for diverging paths often causes players to get lost, making the exploration experience frustrating.The difficulty curve is not well-balanced, which might frustrate players."
Negative,"Nah i dont like to finance a genocide by the chinese government (CCP), thank you"
Negative,"PC lag and sound stutter is too big to be acceptable. Not paying a game that much to accept this kind of results. Too bad, looked really nice"
Negative,"Its too difficult and linear, You don't get to go somewhere else and level up, enemies scale with you and you cant pass or walk around them anyway. No map, the first 2 locations are just a deep not particulary beutifull forest."
Negative,"If u like Dark Souls Games its worth to play. If u dont, just stay away from it. For me its a completly no."
Negative,overcomplicated crap. and whoever came up with the idea of ​​the boss bear should be put on a bottle. and i think it needs to be patched. hp the bosses have is really reminds me elden ring dlc.
Negative,"I have a lot to say about this game but I'd rather stream my words about this and such. Its not worth the price its setup at that and its not exactly well optimized at all. I will play it off and on to show it to people and to let people know about this game, I got it early at full price to hopefully get people to save their money as I showcase it."
Negative,"Visually yeah it's good looking. Was expecting some grand story from it being it's from a book (adapted TV shots/movie) but it's so basic.Few NPC talk some short grand lines... It's basically a not-stop boss fight. And there it fails miserably. Sometimes you hit your opponent, sometimes you miss even tho you are next to them... Even if you hit them they continue their action like nothing happened. There is some spell when you freeze an opponent and sometimes it happens they just continue their previous action right out of the ""freeze"" basically not logic to it. Oh and there is no block whatsoever. Just evade. Can't remember a game that had a fighting component and only had an attack and evade... Guess in game science nobody heard of a block/parry. Guess they should ditch ""science"" part.  Its basically a full-on grind and its soo annoying even for a Souls game...One big downfall is the camera in combat especially when the boss is super larger than you. It moves frantically and if 2 of you are closeit can position itself (camera) right under your crouch.... you can't even understand where you need to move and what's gonna happen next..The funnies design is ""air wall"" that doesn't let you move out of the designated area. Basically, you can see the lush world but you cant touch it. This aspect is common to games but here it's so badly done.It's done so poorly with no imagination and in a pure 差不多 fashionSo many things need to be polished. Hope they will do some kinda update and fix all these annoying things... It's rather sad actually that it all doesn't move and play super smoothly for a game where such a thing is of utmost importance.I will come in a year and give it another go. Hopefully, they polish it by then. Game of the year... Not even close.If you want to play wait until  they patch it upMaybe when you do Green Snake: Black Myth you polish things properly, well those important bits and you pay some real writers to spice things up. Not all things need to be just basic pleb logic my sword is bigger than yours.All in all this game super feels like one video from old internet.""Look at my horse, my horse is amazing.... """
Negative,"The game is great if it runs.it frequently crashes. it regularly crashes during boss fights. this game crashes more times than I have properly closed the actual game. When it crashes, there is no prompt to report the issue so I am not sure if there will be a fix for what I am experiencing"
Negative,"after 22h I give up, the input read makes me wana stop playing and I finally did. Every move i make the enemy can escape and or stunlock me to hell. I'm done. And yeah you can trashtalk with gid good or anything else but this sucks. U cant just Input read every move with no patterns to learn whatsoever. And also some bosses with grab mechanics that almost kill you instantly every time cause it deals 3 x dmg. Also the input lag, I could swear I press the dodge button but nothing happens. especially in a game where ""perfect dodges"" are a thing you expect to be able to press the button in the last moment but games says nah not today. also the summon spell on LB 2 + RB 2 is fucked up, if you dont manage to press them right, the damn thing wont do shit, just openin up the cast menu. Also a little note, how about a fuckin map where I can check where the fuck I am standing. Act 3  is a Maze that looks all the same everywhere white woods.. like wtfthx but no thx, I am very done with this game"
Negative,Dodgeing doesnt work and no one will convince me otherwise...........
Negative,fuck my destiny play league of legends wukong better
Negative,"Game does not run at all, Runs out of Video memory during launch configuration, All drivers and Bios up to date, game is unplayable,"
Negative,"I appreciate its alternate Dark Soulsesque controller button-layout, though."
Negative,"Beautiful and fun to play for a single play-through. Don't waste your time doing Ng plus. Great boss fights. A shout out to the developers for making respeccing free and available from the start! So, why am I giving it thumbs down? A couple of reasons. So you get to the last boss of the so-called bad ending, which is not only tough, but has no less than 4 phases. Absolutely Ridiculous!  What are they trying to do, one-up Fromsoft?  That's not the end though. If you want to get the alternate, so called good ending, and the relic that doing this ending provides, and you do if you're even thinking of doing NG plus at all, you have to completed no less than 5 secret areas of the game plus another NPC quest to do a three phase boss fight that makes the 4 phase regular ending boss look easy, after which, instead of just giving you the alternate ending, you are required to go back and do the regular/bad ending 4 phase boss again!  Ridiculous! If you want to fully upgrade all your relics you need to get to Ng plus plus plus and then you can unlock the secret staff stance, Wukong stance, which I was very much looking forward to. However, they don't just give you the damn stance, you need to connect with a 4 focus charged attack, only they've extended the 4th charge so that's it's effectively 5 focus points now. Anyway, when you finally get your 5 focus points and do a charged heavy attack you unlock the best, most powerful stance in the game for a measly minute before you lose it again.  WTF!  I'm in Ng plus plus plus and the thing that might have made doing another play through worthwhile would be using my brand new staff stance but in reality it's not practical and there is much better armor and staff's to use which you don't have to do 4 play-throughs to get. Also, if you're a completionist many of the achievements require you to farm plants and enemies for rare drops and not only are these rare but in some cases like celestial peach seeds will only drop from celestial peach trees, you can't just rest at a shrine and go back and try again. This particular item will only only appear every half an hour and you have to go to another shrine and come back after said half an hour.  Also, there are only 6 trees over 4 locations and in the whole game and I'm in Ng plus plus plus and have over 150 celestial peaches but still haven't gotten a single peach seed which is not only required to get an achievement for seed collecting but also is tied to another achievement where an NPC gives you a drink soak as a reward for collecting said seeds, which you need for another achievement, which you can't get without the seed.  This type of disrespecting the players time is disgusting. And what the hell is the deal with all the invisible walls everywhere, even in boss fights. Can't the developers just create make ones we can see?  In the Stone Monkey fight it's impossible to know exactly where the arena begins or ends until you run or roll into it's invisible wall and get destroyed because you were unable to roll away from the ensuing attack."
Negative,"For the most part the game is decent, and don't get me wrong, I like hard games, but this just has some bad and lazy coding that effects your enjoyment, and very inconsistent rules in combat. I have no issues getting owned by a boss in a fair way, but when its down to some pathetic lazy coding, it takes away from the enjoyment.   Bosses can fly, turn invisible, turn into dragons, spew fire, frost, poison, create storms, along with causing attacks from air, from underground and have numerous ranged attacks, at times you just have to roll on the ground for up to 90 seconds as there is no counter to some attacks. What can you do in response, wack them with a wooden stick at super close range.  The BS invisible areas in a Boss fights are down to lazy design, and make a less engaging experience.  The hit box detection on the player is the worst I have experienced in a game like this. A boss can be facing the opposite direction and you are 10 feet behind and somehow you are still hit from a weapon pointing 180 degrees away from you. Your hit box must be 5-10 times the size of your character.  if you start an attack animation before the enemy they cancel yours even though you started to attack first, but you can't effect theirs(in most cases)  The AI gets preference on everything, I have seen enemy's that I knocked on their back, then in 1 frame later, not even 1 seconds, be back on their feet because they haven't bothered to create animations for all the enemy's.  Its not as difficult as Elden Ring, but the poor coding makes it at times feel harder.  So prepare to be frustrated and it not be your fault.Some of the bosses are so badly designed, mostly due to scale, and you spend the majority of combat looking at the feet of the boss.  One boss in particular you can only attack on of the four feet. It is so stupid."
Negative,"Wish I could recommend it but it does not work.Game consistently turns off my entire PC whenever I enter a boss fight for a certain amount of time. I tired lowering my settings, still happened. Tried verifying my steam files, still happened. Changed most different setting having to do with graphics/performance, still shuts off PC once in a boss fight outside the opening tutorial fight.My drivers are up to date, windows up to date. I don't think this problem is because my PC is outdated or not powerful enough. Keep in mind I can run Elden Ring and other modern titles max settings with good frames no issue.Stay away from this or be ready to refund until they work out the kinks I guess. Might buy again once it goes on sale if they worked out their issues...Found out people with AMD cards are having issues... I have one... So if you have an AMD card stay away until further news"
Negative,"除了画质动画有的不错，剧情简直是依托答辩，如果是外国人玩倒是无所谓，但是对于熟悉西游记的中国人来说简直把西游记改成面目全非了。斗战胜佛能死吗？结局更是一坨，总之如果比较注重原著，千万别玩。This game doesn't respect original novel the journey to the west at all. If you don't understand the novel,you can play,The graphic and music is amazing,but if you care about more of original novel,this is not a good game"
Negative,"I will not recommend the game solely because of the boss fights being very gimmicky and by that I mean non stop combo waves, windup attacks to roll catch you, or simply one or two shot attacks that are very badly telegraphed. I finished the game with the true ending and Erlang Sheng can go fuck himself and whoever designed this abomination of a boss fight. I thought this game reached ultra bullshit peak but no it knows how to shove another giant ass staff up you ass. What is wrong with chinese developers and their love for boss designs to implement either constant disengagement and running away but at the same time close gap and then fuck off again or the sheer constant waves of attacks. If you thought Consort Radahn was bad holy shit do I have bad news for you. I wanna fight not play catch up and then dodge next 500 attacks to do 1 light attack.The game is very linear with barely any options to gear up or level up. The gearing system is just after each chapter u get to craft a new armor and sometimes depending on what you found during the chapters can create an extra different set or weapon. This game does not give you freedom of choice in terms of that aspect and you are hardcapped with the Stats in this game.Leveling your Stance Tree is crucial to unlock 3 or 4 Focus Points as that mechanic is basically the entire game and how you deal decent damage everything else is trash and you simply build up focus by whacking the enemy, dodge at the correct moment for 20 hit combo waves of Boss attacks because what the fuck is a break or opportunity window, even if you manage to go through all this shit after 1 or 2 light attacks the enemy starts again with their bullshit. Doing the resolute strike is very tricky and with how many opponents first disengage you whiff your staff into nothingness. Not to mention the sheer amount of punishment you get for failing a dodge or resolute strike that will most likely end up in death.I can rant on and on with how shit this gameplay loop vs boss design is. I don't care how cinematic it is if the feeling of the flow is fucking shit and you constantly only get catched by the sheer amount of combo attacks it is not fun, especially if u don't have any means to get out of them because if the enemy catches you once you will most likely die to their combo.Now lets go over the gimmicks, every boss is a gimmick and you have to play with him or rather he plays with you until you figure out what the fuck is their deal, and no I don't mean u have time to learn the pattern or what not you will die a lot before even having a chance to learn the other attacks. This game does not feature any deflect/parry/block mechanics like Sekiro does so you will be always at the mercy of a perfect dodge or back you go to the shrine.Level and map design is very monotone for each chapter and it is mostly just Mountains with a different flavor of color, while I get that this is very Theme based it does look in the long run very boring especially Chapter 3 felt like a slog and god I never wished to finish this asap. This game also lacks a map to look at where you are which makes it a bit annoying at times.Item descriptions are very off and need an overhaul like holy damn how bad it is. You will know once u read some of them but just consider ""moderate"" what does this mean apparently only 10 HP points which is nothing.Now to the good partsGraphics and Monster Design (not their attacks fuck this I wish I could give it even more negative points)Story is barely existing but it's there and the animations after each chapter are very good and well made.Final Verdict is if you enjoy very very hard gameplay loop and constant reset then sure go for it. As someone who went through every Souls game, this game is maybe for you but at the same time you will realize what I meant by the above points. This game is very little forgiving if anything it doesn't forgive at all so unless you are set to learn literally 95% of enemy moveset each fight and have a decent chance then yea go for it.Else hard pass, go watch some youtube playthroughs instead.before anyone says skill issue, stop playing with cheat engine loser"
Negative,unskippable cutscenes in 2024
Negative,"I honestly can't fathom how everyone is blindly ignoring the combat. It's a decent game, but the combat is wonky. For a game that ""isn't soulslike game"" it sure as hell is."
Negative,Im not a masochistic....
Negative,"Don't know why people are loving this game, to each their own. Something feels off with the combat, almost like the game isn't reading the input of my controller."
Negative,"I'm struggling to continue with this, It's alright, but its problems start to become clear somewhere around the mid point of chapter 3.The vast majority of the bosses are practically the same fightOnce you have a handle on the combat, you will 1 shot most bosses easilyLevel design is quite bad,  it gets particularly bad when it tries to do big open spaces, Invisible walls and pointless branching paths everywhere combined with the most uninspiring loot system ever make exploring feel like a chore and the world feel artificial.Regular enemies are mostly just like annoying little speed bumps, flying enemies are very annoying since you have no ranged attack at all, you have to kind of run up to them and awkwardly light attack them to death.You can put points in to three different stances but there’s really no reason to because you could just specialise in the first one and dump all those other points in to passive stat increases or your special abilities, i’ve not come across a single thing in the game that i can’t easily deal with with the first stance in the tree combined with spells and abilities, and adding more stances just complicates the combat. So it feels poorly designed to me.The biggest thing for me is that after 20 hours, playing through the game just feels boring, there’s no cool loot to find, just generic trinkets and crafting materials, the enemies are boring, the level design is tedious, you’re basically just wanting to get to the next boss as fast as possible because the bosses are at least fun to fight.It might be $90 worth in terms of graphics, but it’s more like $40 in terms of game design"
Negative,"Checker Board scenery and invisible elements, cannot play as many aspects cannot be seen, with my mid-high end PC, went from V. high recommended and tried medium graphics to resolve still problem process, will change to recommend when I can see everything that was meant to be implemented into visuals."
Negative,fuck this shitty game
Negative,don't know why people are giving this game a good rating insanely repetitive combat with zero activities to do as you basically run from one boss to the next with miniscule amounts of boring combat in between.
Negative,It's probably going to be good but god damn do I wish they eased you into it better. The start is brutal. Not sure how I feel about it at the moment.And remapping for controller would be helpful.
Negative,just another poorly optimised ue5 game dont buy unless u have 4090
Negative,Game is to much. It's extremely hard. The save spots are wayy to far apart and you will die thousands of times.  All u do is click 2 buttons and use 1 recharge. You basically be the most skilled played to play this. Also I have no idea what the story is. You just play as some random monkey fighting mobs. Only thing good are the graphics
Negative,"I'd love to play the game, but unfortunately it crashes at the beginning every time.  I've done pretty much everything I can to get it working to no avail, so I'll have to refund it and try again later when they fix their shit.  It's too bad, looked fun."
Negative,"A Beautiful but Ultimately Repetitive ExperienceBlack Myth: Wukong was a game I initially planned to skip. The trailers didn't hype me, and the setting didn’t resonate with me. What ultimately drew me in were the boss fights. As a big fan of the Souls series and similar titles, I couldn’t resist after seeing how intense and epic the battles looked. However, after diving in, I quickly realized this game is not what I expected.While it has elements that give it a Souls-like feel, this is far from a true Soulsborne experience. Instead, it plays more like a blend of God of War and Star Wars Jedi, with a touch of Sekiro sprinkled in. The game leans heavily into hack-and-slash mechanics, which makes it more forgiving and less punishing than the typical Souls formula.Unfortunately, this approach left me underwhelmed. The combat feels repetitive, with a lack of variety in enemy types. By the second area, I found myself fighting the same enemies over and over, which quickly became dull. The story and characters didn’t grip me either, and the overall experience felt shallow despite the game’s visual beauty and the excitement of its boss battles.In the end, Black Myth: Wukong feels overhyped. While the boss fights are a standout, the rest of the game lacks the depth and challenge I was hoping for. It seems to have captured the thirst for single-player games, but for me, this one misses the mark. I do hope it inspires more single-player projects, but as a whole, it just didn’t deliver the experience I was looking for."
Negative,"A simplistic, smooth-running game with mediocre combat relative to similar titles in the genre. Very little depth, and the boss fights are either very easy, or difficult in ways that are either unfun, or flat-out unintended (camera boss, janky hitboxes, etc).I'd rate this a buy at $40 or under. This does *not* feel like a $60 game, and I personally regret purchasing it at that price."
Negative,"cannot configure keyboard to my usual play style. cannot play without controller which i have never used.A shame because graphically the game looks great, but I am playing on a PC not a consol"
Negative,"Unfortunately, in its current technical state, I cannot recommend this. Game crashes are too frequent to possibly recommend. Fun game otherwise, and big fan of the original story, so enjoying in spite of the BS>"
Negative,"Just keeps crashing,  Can't even get thorugh prologue. Just another poorly optimized game on release"
Negative,"I would not recommend purchasing this game at full price.The game was amazing from chapter 1 to 5, absolutely wonderful, fun, exciting, charming.The bosses were well thought out, challenging, fair, it was just fun. Even getting kicked up felt fine.The environments, though somewhat linear were beautiful and full of life.Cinematics after each Chapter Boss made beating them so rewarding.Then we get to chapter 6 and ""ending"".Absolutely horrid. It soured the whole experience just at the end, like having a feast and getting rotten food for dessert.Empty barren ""open world"" style final area, where there's nothing. Just vastness and nothingness. No life, no enemies, no nothing. A couple of copy pasted ""bosses"" all over that provided no rewards nor fun, most of which were a chore to get through, just boring and unfair in extreme contrast to the game thus far, It had me wondering if the developers were the same ngl.Then we get to the ending, a final boss made purposely to be unfair, cuz hahas. So annoying, so bad, they tried to make it epic with cinematics but it was just sour.And then please don't go into New Game Plus! Unless you want to miss the ""completely hidden, randomly placed, secret true ending!"" Which you get no warning about unless you look it up online.Just the most anti-player game design I've seen in a long long time.Overall, I can't rate the game as a whole, Chapters 1-5 get a 9/10; Chapter 6 gets a 1/10.Get this game when it has a discount."
Negative,i lost all of my save files even though they were backed up and the game started in a different language
Negative,"shitty game, give me my money"
Negative,"The game is OK, but it's crashing on cutscenes on my system: Ryzen 9 7950X / Radeon RX 7900 XTX.I tried rolling back to older drivers but the issue still persists."
Negative,"My first ever negative review. Please, implement controller key remapping. It is available for keyboard, why not controller!"
Negative,just another dogshit soulslike with complete bullshit boss fights.
Negative,Please fix the optimization of the game! I have a pretty decent PC and it barely runs the intro of the game and keeps crashing after the first fightI can not recommend it until it starts working properly
Negative,"Honestly this is too hard to be enjoyable.  Endless hard boss fights, that take many attempts, each attempt requires an annoying ""walk back to the boss"" phase.  No where near as much fun as 2018's God of War, play that instead."
Negative,"game is tedious, extremely reliant on dodge mechanics. would return if I could"
Negative,"Low diversity, monkey and I have beef, monkey, clearly pushing banana agendas, monkey, completely disregard for feminism and monkeyism, monkey."
Negative,"Gameplay is generic af, combat feels like garbage. I wish I could refund it."
Negative,"I saw the game on youtube and it looked fun ngl and I believe it is, if i could play it! The game cannot start without my pc crashing maybe I will buy it in the future but idk what is wrong with it?"
Negative,"TLDR; If you like God of War 2019 and looking for something like that with souls elements mixed in then you'll like the game. Overall its a 6.5-7 out of 10.I will say up front that I dont know really anything about chinese mythology nor do really care for it, but I went in with an open mind and some small context reading towards our protagonist. The story has yet to really pull me in, yes even the flashy intro was a little... idk corny (I can see why dragon ball fans liked it). And just like reading the translated version of the Three Body Problem, the dialog and narrative seem off or goofy, so I mostly think that the original chinese translation might have more grace, flow and nuance than whats given here. Especially at the end of chapter one when your given that very beautiful animation that helped give context to the enemies you fought, why was an animation with no dialog better to understand than weird stunted dialog in game? Also the game really could care less about the levels you move around in as there's always a boss like 15-30 seconds from another. Environmental storytelling is minimal (end of chapter 2 into chapter 3 actual has some but its so sparse that its still really boring).Graphically its a mixed bag. Unreal Engine 5 really shows off its technical prowess in this game for better or worse, as I feel like the games intended visual are ment for raytracing which only high end PC can enjoy. Some areas are way to dark, the draw distance on shadows is like 3 feet, and lumen tends to do weird things to the vegetation sometimes. Yes the graphics look very realistic thanks to the lighting and Quixel assets. Though the quality of the textures and models varies so much that it makes it look like an asset flip than a attention to detail. However, I think the game relies on this more than its level design and art as it just feels like im playing a Unreal tech demo. Go a head and pick any test or demo of an unreal engine 5 level/map and drop Wukong in and there wouldn't be a difference. As for visuals on the characters, items and other important assets to the gameplay look fantastic as well as the amazing volumetric practical affects. So it has some good and bad things.The gameplay is very much a God Of War game with the camera pulled back SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE COMBAT with some aspects from souls games mixed in (its not a souls-like game). Combat is fluid and feels very good with it being much more forgiving with dodge rolling than a souls game. There are abilities that straight up let you cheat, and Im not a fan of them. Just like GoW these abilities are on a cool down timer but are also tied to mana... why? Its such a pain to have cool downs in a game and worse to have it tied to a resource. It puts this arbitrary flow and and control to your combat that should be in your hands and not the games. I think the Devs wanted to give you all the ridiculous overpowered stuff Wukong can do lore wise and had no idea how to balance it. Even though I said the combat feels good and kinetic, why do I have to build up focus points to do combos? Even in GoW you can do weapon combos without the need of a resource to do it. Last thing I want to point out is the stamina bar. So everything you do (sprinting, heavy/charged attacks, and dodging) all consume and require stamina to use except light attacks which only consumes stamina. It might seem nice as you get to keep fighting but sometimes when you need to dodge or want to do a combo you just kinda stand there. To me its very weird disconnect of what im allowed to do and what im not, as well as managing the flow of combat. Not a game breaker, just a weird thing in the game.Since good games that aren't broken on release are hard to come by, people are starving and this is the only thing out right now. It is a good game, I just dont think its THAT good. But I did get this game for free so I appreciate my patron's gift and will honor it.  As you can tell I dont really like the game and it has flaws that dont make it good, sorry that my standards are high but thats how we get better games. (yeah invisible walls in the environment and in boss fights are stupid, this game is overhyped. Oh It HaS hEaLtH bAr AnD LoCk On AnD MeLeE CoMbAt, MuSt Be SoUlS gAmE sO iT 10/10 IGN. Y'all are actually the dumbest people to play video games)"
Negative,Keyboard and mouse controls can BARELY be customized.  You are only allowed to choose from a handful of keys (ones I NEVER use) and mouse buttons.  It is extremely frustrating and you will be forced to use a controller to get anywhere.  I will have to wait until someone writes a mod that allows full use of the keyboard and mouse buttons before I can continue with this game.  Voice acting is rather poor so far.  It is visually stunning however.
Negative,"Easily one of the best games I've ever played, love action rpgs, love Journey To The West inspired store, love the combat, love the game engine! Just finished the game and ready for New Game+ ! Unfortunately TAA makes this game a blurry mess lately. Was semi acceptable at launch but now I can't even play the game anymore. I hope developers stop ruining my favourite games with TAA"
Negative,"Honestly a pretty pathetic attempt at following in the footsteps of the souls genre. This game is full of small bugs, abilities that just don't work, perks that you buy that actually don't do anything. So sad they spent all their time making areas look good that you can't even explore. What a hoke, and to make things worse, bosses have little cutscenes they start that wrench your camera view away and make you miss attacks. Just such an unfun waste of time."
Negative,"The game looks great, and I'm sure its fun for some people, but the difficulty is too much for me to enjoy it. There are no options to lower it. I've spent way too much time looking at the same environments while I try to fight the same boss over and over. I'm still in chapter 1, and almost level 20. It took me nearly 4 hours to beat the Wandering Wight, and now I'm 3 hours into the Whiteclad Noble and I just don't care about anything going on enough to continue. For me, this game would have been more enjoyable if it were just a movie that I could watch.This might be saying more about me than the game, but I can't justify the time I've spent so far."
Negative,Game simply has too many performance issue to recommend right now. I will update my review if they can get the massive stuttering fixed.
Negative,"Extreme lag, completely unplayable"
Negative,"The game keeps crashing, even after setting the game at high\Medium and @1080p and turning off Ray Tracing."
Negative,this has potential to be an amazing game but its still unpolished and has some very frustrating bugs during boss fights no less. really wanted to like this game.
Negative,Too many performance issues on a PC well above the recommended minimum specs
Negative,避水金晶兽这个隐藏怪是个极大地败笔，满地的火焰什么都看不清，怪跳来跳去动作太多，视角一会这里一会儿哪里让人想吐。这关的最终boss红孩儿竟然还比他好打，难以置信。    作为一个用于降低最终boss难度的获得装备的支线，难度却高于最终boss。 这合理么？？制作组应该好好反省。
Negative,"1. ужасные прозрачные стены, просто коридор из стеклянных стен2. мы играем за обезьяну, которая даже на дерево не может запрыгнуть?3. ужасный левел-дизайн, локации как будто сгенерированы AIнаиграл три часа, и не могу оформить возврат, попробовал продолжить - дальше лучше не становится"
Negative,"The game is beautiful but the design choices are awful. The invisible walls are the biggest caveat, the entire game is boxed in with interesting things that you can't interact with, Chapter 2 is entirely large spaces with nothing feeding into choke points and oversized enemies back into long-winded dead ends that reward you a bit of will and resources in excess that have no use. The progression of levelling up doesn't actually make you stronger, it's just filler for the most part. it simulates progress after about level 30 when you have all your core features unlocked. Most talents are such an insignificant boon you won't even realise that it's buffed.The bosses aren't as varied or engaging as I anticipated. They can be split between copy-paste lesser bosses that have a unique gimmick or two, or the cinematic focused bosses that are all flash and no substance, especially when they go into long winded secondary phases where you can't do anything but wait.I went in expecting that with no prior knowledge of the Journey to the West it wouldn't be an issue but it's so self-referencing that it negates a lot of the story. I was very excited for the game but it's kind of a disappointment so far. Fundamentally the problems aren't going to get rectified, all my problems with the game are the design choices. It's definitely worth experiencing at least once, but I'd wait until it's on sale."
Negative,If you like a game that is following the straight line and fight bosses this is for you. People saying its like God of war haven't played God of war.
Negative,"constantly crashes, can't even play"
Negative,"If you have a high-end PC then ignore this review. The game seems amazing, but if you don't have a high-end pc it's not worth $90 because it runs at 30-40fps if you want the game to look decent."
Negative,fix yellow bitch wind sage
Negative,"right now I can't recommand this game because of the technical difficulties. I am stuck in the secret area in chapter 1 right now because game crashes everytime during the loading screen when I try to travel to other location or after beating the secret boss.Edit: before the patch, I could at least play with FPS locked on 60 and FSR off without crash. After patch, crash happens even with those settings..."
Negative,"I wasn't going to write a review but I want other people to know. If you've decided to go down the charged attack route and you spend all that time charging to not hit him you're not crazy. The hit boxes are terrible! Downright terrible. I don't know how that's not the number 1 conversation about the game right now since you spend forever charging an attack only for it to smack him in the face and not register.  And not like once or twice, like 9/10 times. I actually found myself saying yes out loud when a charged attack is registered because it's that rare compared to it not registering (specifically stopped on the second form black bear but it was happening in all the fights before too). Please, fix this game!!"
Negative,"I'm sorry, but for me personally this game is just too hard to enjoy. I got like an hour in and it's just these midbosses giving me a few whacks and it's just roll and hit, roll and hit, at the right time.The game is absolutely stunning and I wish I could play and enjoy the amazingly crafted world and Chinese Mythology, but I just can't actually access the game. Same as Sifu, Dark Souls, Life of Pi and a few others.For me, gaming should be fun, and it is not some full time hobby. It's a shame the game industry has moved from giving options to the players with regards to difficulty to allow you to enjoy the gameplay mechanics and the story (e.g. God of War 2018 which gave great options). Leave the 'Hard' and 'Mega Hard' options in by all means, but ffs, just give an easy mode for the guys like me.I feel essentially locked out from a whole genre of amazing looking games because I don't consider my downtime to be something I should find frequently frustrating. TLDR: ""I refuse to 'get good' through hours of annoyance, just let me play the game""."
Negative,"Will change review if they fix this issue.Can not recommend this game, Do to its Super resolution sampling with no off switch.SRS- Made Fur and hair texture fuzzy and blurry. When running DLSS it seem to be the best out of them all, but still is an issue. Wish I can turn this setting off. Seeing how your fighting animals and your own character has fur texture it looks over sharpen and makes the fur just look like a blurred mess and flickering on some animal tails and body do to trying to render the pixels .Its really hard to play the game when its constantly happens and it goes in and out of looking good to looking bad. When the SRS is not generation pixel the games landscapes and graphics look Amazing.Gameplay wise I was having a lot of fun with it, but the constant change of graphic textures really hurts the eyes and immersion . Until they fix the graphics issue I Cannot recommend this game."
Negative,CRASHES ON 7900XTX HEAPS and honestly just feels like a boss fight simulator i couldn't get into the story it was meh as an overall game in the beginning to me couldn't keep me playing its not for me though the boss fights are good graphics are good if you don't crash... but yer just felt like boss fight after boss fight and nothing in the middle just my opinion i only got to act 2 cause i got bored this is just my opinion some people like these types of games maybe it changes further in i don't know but i think if you haven't done elden ring or god of war play those first
Negative,"Everything is fine up to the white dragon boss, great visuals but a horrible experience. Quite possibly the worst boss ive ever encountered in a video game, its like a faster elden beast with a hitbox of a worm"
Negative,Game looked promising  until i couldn't get past the proluge game kept crashing right into the first chapter so i just refunded will wait till these issues are fixed
Negative,"Game is way too hard, the bosses are not fun, kill you super fast. Can't choose difficulty. Looks cool but that's about it. Would like my money back for sure"
Negative,"Jesus, what a load of overrated meh. Count me right out."
Negative,"This game has many bugs, such as slow loading time. It takes about 5 minutes to enter the game.And after entering the game, you may encounter frequent stuttering and audio-visual synchronization issues.Most areas in the game cannot be explored.This is more like a defective product than a game.So I don't recommend purchasing. Unless you are Chinese"
Negative,"UPDATE: I've put a couple more hours into the game to give it even more of a chance, and my opinion has largely not changed. I do have a better understanding of what I think is most wrong in this game: the dodge consistency, including which attacks you are allowed to dodge out of, when you are allowed to dodge out of them and the speed of your dodge. This also includes when you are allowed to cancel the dodge animation. That, combined with the fact that every enemy in the game gains flinchproof after one of your attack strings, no matter how weak the enemy is, has cemented in my mind that BM: W has a really terrible combat system for the game it's trying to be. It turns combat into a slog and makes encounters feel inconsistent, and after trawling through Chapter 3 I had to ask myself why am I even playing this game.========================================================I was a little skeptical of this game getting Overwhelmingly Positive, considering I've barely heard anything about it and it was one of the most anticipated games. I won't speculate on where those reviews are coming from, but I'll say that 3 hours in I have no idea why the rating is this high. I don't think the game is terribly bad, but I would understand Very Positive, but not Overwhelmingly Positive.I will mainly speak on the combat, as that is the focus of the game. To sum up my thoughts on the other aspects of the game: graphics are great, atmosphere is meh, story is meh, voice acting is.. ok? Again, I would not expect this for an Overwhelmingly Positive game, none of these are deal breakers but the rating ain't adding up chief.So far, it seems that it is primarily a boss rush style game. The game feel is just not there. Every boss feels like they have max poise, which wouldn't be an issue except for a few things:- Bosses are huge or at least zip around the arena a lot, meaning your camera will be all over the place. This lack of consistency makes it difficult to time dodges consistently.- Boss attacks are horribly telegraphed. I actually tested it on one of the early bosses, since I thought it was weird how fast the attack animations were on the Wandering Wight. The attacks are essentially 90% feints and the actual hitbox animation is only a few frames at most.- Boss punish strings feel less like greed punishment and more like a cheesy way for the devs to force you to not wail on the boss. You can test this yourself - when you stop attacking a boss, they won't punish you nearly as much as if you keep pressing. It's not like FromSoft games, where bosses have fixed strings and they may terminate a string early, but generally will have an opening after their string. It's not like fighting games where you can keep attacking but eventually your ""turn"" will end and you need to play it safe. No, BM:W will just keep extending the attack string for as long as you keep pressing buttons until you either stop pressing or the boss uses a move that makes them tired/collapsed/change form. Craziest shit I've ever seen. Definition of artificial difficulty. It actively punishes you for finding too many openings. - Boss attacks do not consistently connect with your character. This is most apparent in the Bear fight when he uses the mist attack. I have no idea if it's because he's so huge or what. There are actually so many things wrong with the combat but they generally sum up to the combat does not feel very polished. It doesn't feel janky, just, not balanced. Best example is how inconsistent the heavy attack is. Sometimes it's fast, other times you can use a heavy attack well before the boss attacks and the boss will attack you before it even finishes lol.There are two fights in Souls that I can choose to compare for this game's combat: DS3's Nameless King and Elden Ring's Black Blade Kindred. Those are probably the most annoying fights I can think of, even more annoying than many Bloodborne fights, primarily because of the timing of the attacks and how small the counter window is, giving you only a hit or two of breathing room. Those fights still work however, you keep coming back no matter how many times you die because the fight feels like a dance and you know that you lost because you misstepped, maybe you attacked too early, or you dodged a little too much to the right. You always walk away from a death with dozens of things you could have done cleaner in the fight. I never got this feeling in any BM:W fight. When I killed the Wandering Wight, I didn't feel triumphant like killing the Tree Sentinel because the entire fight was this massive dude just leaping across the map to launch into a 20-move attack string with no way to safely retaliate other than running away and waiting for the string to reset. I only won that fight because I watched a video where someone lead him into the pillars which makes him a cake-walk. This game isn't bad, but it misses what makes Souls combat special. I also thought about comparing this game to Nioh but again, the fact that every boss has such high poise and such long punish strings, I've never played any Soulslike that does this. It feels a lot like some indie 2D games that try to do ""Soulslike"" combat without understanding what that means, and the combat essentially boils down to attack twice then roll away and rinse and repeat."
Negative,"Everyone is glazing this game and for good reason. Unfortunately, it just didn't resonate with me. The skill tree feels like it might be interesting (if they weren't so stingy with the upgrade system) but most of the game your just mindlessly mashing the light attack button. Yes, you can invest your upgrade points into things make your combo heavy attacks different, but your light combo remains the same throughout the whole game and lemme tell ya you are going to be light combo-ing everything in the game because that is how the combo system works. In order to use your heavy attacks you have to build FOCUS, which can be built with light attacks (amongst other things). Leading to a mindless system that requires repetition of that same strategy. The worst part about all of this is the other skills you get don't spice up the encounters you have enough to be invested further. You will ALWAYS be doing the same light attack you did from the START of the game. NO MATTER WHAT. It got to a point where I couldn't even finish the game. You would think the other stances would allow for different light attacks, but they do so only to a minor degree.I could not finish the game with how repetitive it got."
Negative,"Visually stunning graphics and worlds, very much like God of War but that's where the comparison ends. The game is good, fighting feels solid, takes a bit to get use to dodging as there is no block. Story line seems to be lacking so far, just moving from A to B with little to none story progress, can get boring and monotonous. Worse thing about this game is that every second turn is either a boss or mini boss, who are in some cases extremely hard to defeat.If you want a visually stunning story driven game, play God of War. If your after a button mashing monotonous time passer then this is the game for you.Story 3/10 (played 10 hours, 7 of which are just bosses 4 on the same boss)Visuals 15/10Fighting 7/10Boss -5/10"
Negative,"The game is absolutely unpolished beyond the first chapter aka the refund window.Check out youtube reviews for issues including no map navigation, easily missable side quests and horrendous optimisation.The game does look gorgeous but expect stuttering during boss fights.Story wise, not sure what is happening but expect a lot of googling to understand what is happening lmaop/s: finished the game anyway, 7/10 at best, maybe worth getting during a 50% sale I guess"
Negative,why does this have good reviews?? the combat is buggy as fuck
Negative,Boring combat wrapped with UE5's beautiful shell. This game is unfinished.
Negative,Unfair boss fights.
Negative,fcking flying ice dragon is so boring
Negative,"Beautiful cinematics!!!!The difficulty level is just dumb!if i were a child with no life, then it might be worth it.I have a life, and cant find more than an hour or two to play at a time.if you cant grind away for hours at one boss, then dont buy.Its just boss after boss.its a waste of money."
Negative,"Normally I wouldn't care what other people think about this game but I really want to know if I'm playing a completely different game from everyone else. The combat is boring and repetitive with bad hit/hurt boxes and no depth, the skill trees are laughably basic and uninteresting, the level design is just invisible wall after invisible wall funnelling you through a boss rush of obnoxious health pools and uninteresting movesets. The art design is incredible, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this game because it even runs like garbage."
Negative,I got the game free with a computer purchase.  I am unable to progress beyond the first few shrines  and have spent 10 hours or so repeating the same content.  Frankly I don't notice much difference from leveling  27 or so times.   Boredom and frustration has set in as it did with Elden Ring.  Unfortunately I paid for that one.I leveled up to 51 after another 15 hours and if you like endless grinding this is the game for you.
Negative,"I'm disappointed in Black Myth Wukong overall. I was pulled in by the story and enjoy games like Elden Ring and God of War and I hoped this would be a good mix. BMW is nowhere as deep mechanically as those games but there are some nice ideas (magics, some of the skill tree options, focus attacks). Unfortunately after chapter 1 it does start to become repetitive. The initial bosses are fun but as I progressed I got more frustrated with them. This mainly came from the game camera being at odds with the bosses themselves. Often (with the camera locked on or manual) you will be fighting them whilst they are completely blocking the view of the screen, resulting in you desperately trying to attack, dodge or heal etc whilst hoping the boss isn't doing some kind of attack at the same time.As your weapon is limited to a staff you can't alter you boss approach or work around boss design short comings, say similar to something like Elden Ring so you are forced to get in close for combat.Camera's are never perfect in these types of games and often countered with really great controls and combat mechanics. This is where the game falls down again. Too many times I found not only whist fighting the camera , the controller inputs were inconsistent. especially the dodge. Where I would perfect dodge the attack I could still get hit, stun locked and appear to have to wait for the game to decide when I could get control back of the character. There's other aspects of the game that a a bit tedious, such as every level seems to have a section where there is an archer or multiple. As there is no block or standard parry the game wants you to hold a button and twirl the staff, which is only for deflecting arrows and not melee weapons. This on sections results in you holding a button, deflect incoming arrows, wait for them to stop firing, run forward a bit, deflect more arrows, rinse and repeat. There is a skill to allow you to spin the staff and walk at the same time but it feels gimmicky as not useful for any other part of the game.Performance wise it's good. I have a 4080 and 5800x3d. Playing at 4k DLSS quality (67% on the scale) and all settings at cinematic, excluding shadows, global illumination and hair quality at high, Frame Gen and Full Ray Tracing off I was getting between 68 to 95 fps.In hindsight I would wait for the game to come on sale rather than by full price. Hopefully the controls and camera can be tightened up.I am interested in seeing the rest of the story but I've lost interest in actually playing the game. I found the opposite of Shadow of the Erdtree, where the story was uninteresting, but the combat fun and reliable I ended up completing it a few days (PS5)."
Negative,"I had an initial review (5hrs in) that as negative, due to the game being for looks over gameplay.And having finished it and done some ng+ to wrap up all the achievements, that opinion still stands.This game suffers from a big case of looking good, at the cost of its readability.First, what the game does well : the setting and art overall are great to amazing. The story we follow is streamlined, but we can read all about the different characters involved and their stories, from the Myths.The art looks good to great. The cutscenes are especially nice looking, when those don't have some lag appearing or audio desync issues pulling you out of your immersion.The animations also look pretty good, and it feels real nice when one of your bigger attack lands.But those will not land that often, unless you wait for one of the few windows in which you can unwind the whole animations to land that one high damage hit.The gameplay feels pretty stiff : you are discouraged from being initially aggressive, as you are not able to cancel your attack animations, and enemy can start and finish their attacks before some of your own animations are able to finish. This encourages you to be more passive until you know all the ""opening windows"" in an enemy's attack  pattern, or risk getting combo-ed to death because you were a bit too greedy.This issue may also be tied to issues with boss design, especially bosses.A big issue I have with the bosses are their introduction cutscenes. Those trigger the first time you face a boss, and will introduce the boss, but also take control from the players, so that they move close to the boss by the time the cutscene resolves. Upon re-entering the fight later, you will be at the entrance of the arena, instead of much closer to its center, within ""get hit"" distance of the boss.Another issue, present with way too many bosses in my opinion is them having several phases during which you cannot damage them, but they can still damage you. This includes them actively doing attacks while being fully invulnerable (and not offering anything for you to do other than dodging), or them going out of reach of the player, while charging high damage attacks. Those do not feel challenging or hard, just boring phases during fights, which you just have to wait through until you can play again.I also have issues with level design. I initially thought it was bad overall, but later areas showed me that it could be good every now and then too.My main grip with the level design is the use of invisible walls. The game is really inconsistent in the placement of those walls, with nothing other than ""trying"" allowing you to know whether they exist, or it's one of the places without any. You could have two similar looking places, one with invisible walls blocking movement while the other doesn't, and there would be no visible distinction between the two places."
Negative,FUCK WHITECLAD NOBLE ITS A GARBAGE SHIT ASS BOSS THAT IS nOT ONLY MISSPLACED NOT ONLY DOES IT SUCK THE FUN OUT OF THE GAME AND UNFIT FOR THE LEVEL IT HAS A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT ASS ATTACKS FUCK THIS
Negative,hit registration is off facing certain bosses other than that great game
Negative,268 RMB (✓)80 CDN (X)
Negative,"The game is good overall, but it is so damn difficult. With no difficulty levels it makes the things more worse for players like me who just want a normal difficulty."
Negative,"Fa cacare, non mi accetteranno il rimborso perché ci ho giocato un ora in più di quanto è scritto, ma non scaricatelo perché fa veramente cacare"
Negative,"too much input lag, broken hit-boxes and un-dogeable moves makes the game unplayable. fix it"
Negative,"it's extremely middling, i'll maybe update this if I ever feel like playing more of it"
Negative,"Fight a Boss, defeat the Boss, Cutscene- Game crashes...Have to fight the same Boss again, defeat the Boss, Cutscene - Game crashes...Repeat...Peak frustration!"
Negative,"It's not bad. Combat is okay, the chinese voice actors are great. The story is interesting. I want to give it a neutral review honestly. It plays just like god of war, which I hated personally. Got the first boss down and just decided to refund. I didn't find myself enjoying the game overall. I hope everyone else who buys it does though."
Negative,"9/10 gameplay and level progression system0/10 weapon progression system, enough to ruin to whole game for me. Level design is also poor, act 1 has more dead ends than you can count and act 2 tries to make it up with branching paths  except every path looks exactly the same."
Negative,"Invisible walls on boss fight make this very frustrating, boss jump to places where you can't go and get blocked by these freaking invisible walls."
Negative,"this game sucks ballss, all of with anxaiety avoid avoid avoid"
Negative,"Weird difficulty spikes. Wouldn't mind them if it was fun to grind and level up for certain bosses, but that's not the case."
Negative,"Please remove denuvo it makes the game lag hard and make the sound and voices not sync at all. Even though I meet the recommended requirements.GPU 2060Processor i7-11700Fwaiting for performance updates before I rebuy :(For now this stays in thumbs down :(EDIT: Pain even look at required and recommended showing I have both. The games runs poorly :( Sadly I have to give a thumbs down, wish their was an option for neither thumbs."
Negative,"I meannn it's allrighht.Wayyy more difficult than I expected from what the developpers had said so I am a bit disapointed. I did not feel like playing another souls-like after finishing elden ring. Just wanted to smash some buttons with a relatively easy challenge as in god of war.But hey, I guess it's on for dying multiple times to learn boss patterns and multiple times to fight RNG.Also, I dont feel all the acrobatics (which are beautiful) do well for a souls-like. It's quite hard not to smash buttons when there's an almost RNG feel to your combat animations.On that note, the graphics, music and animations are amazingly beautiful and the story seems good from what ive been able to play so far.EDIT: Ok Ive played a bit more and the most frustrating part for me is that there is literally no story whatsoever. It's just boss after boss after boss after boss and almost no mobs, lore or anything else in between.I feel like I'm playing tekken.The lies about the difficulty overshadows everything else though."
Negative,"the world is beautiful, grpahics are really goodtheres bosses legit every 10 minutes and it just takes away from the whole game honestly. combat feels clunky as your special moves and gourd dont activate when you need them to."
Negative,"I haven't had much chance to play the game.Info states full DualSense controller support and the game does not detect my DualSense controller wired or wireless at all.  All my other DualSense supported Steam games work fine.  This is either a bug, or an error in the listed FULL support for the DualSense controller...really disappointing.  Other people are also reporting this issue."
Negative,"I really wish this was it, and the gameplay and graphics are breathtaking... but the crashes are equally bad. I can't even transform into the wolf without crashing, I'm forced to play without it for example, it's just not okay, I am saddened to have spent 60 euros on a game I can't play. I hadn't bought a game at launch since I was in highschool (except Hogwarts Legacy, but that game was ok), but after this, truly, I shall never buy it under 3 months since launch."
Negative,TOO HARD LV20 CANT EVEN BEAT THE FIRST BOSS
Negative,Game was great until chapter 5. Keeps crashing every 2-3 mins
Negative,My PC and ROG Ally both had multiple crashes prior to even getting into the game.
Negative,"2.5 Chapters in and I can honestly say it isn't for me, but, I can appreciate how it appeals to others.Excellent visuals, plays well at release (we all expect to have issues with new releases nowadays) and plays on Steam Deck well enough, although I wouldn't recommend it since the games primary draw is the visuals and such is better experienced (as most other AAA/AA titles) on a machine with the necessary horsepower.Outside of visuals, it offers little more than what I would consider to be a technical demo. It would be an excellent ""Hey look at what we can do in UE5 now"" but it is simply boss after boss, limited build options, linear level design, minimal world building and all of which, in my opinion, creates a shallow feeling. The delivery at the end of each chapter is brilliant, really enjoyed those but they did just leave me trying to work out the relevance.5/10"
Negative,"Trying so hard to enjoy this game, but the combat is clunky and unresponsive. Add that to the fact that it just feels like a boss rush game that offers no significant feeling of advancement leaves me wondering why I should even be trying to put any effort into it at all...It also does not seem to be that well optimised on pc and frame drops are frequent."
Negative,"So far (just finished act 2) the game is a let down for me. 6/10Positives:- wonderful graphics, the game is a real spectacle- no technical issues - with 3080 and Ryzen 5 5600X I have pretty much stable 4K 60 FPS and no crashes, - fun boss design,- fun spells, - somewhat enjoyable combat, - great free and generous respec system.Negatives:  - terrible exploration with a lot of truly inconsistent invisible walls, an environment that looks identical within a given act which makes navigation a nightmare and sparsely distributed, trivially easy mobs,- uninspiring and bad skill tree with boring and useless skills and vague skill descriptions (“moderate”, “considerable”, “slight” increase/decrease etc. of given stat, without, sometimes extensive, testing you won’t know if the change is worth it)  - there are only a handful of useful skills and even they do not significantly affect the gameplay (even stances don’t add anything meaningful),- game doesn’t have any introduction to its lore and plot – either you know Sun Wokung myth by heart (which probably means you are also a Chinese) or you will have no idea what and why is anything happening; moreover I strongly suspect that even with such knowledge the plot is a series of disjointed memberberies and things happens mostly without any reason or explanation (vide: start of second act),- uneven and generally easy difficulty – most enemies in the game (including some bosses) you can just “bruteforce” with magic and LMB spam, only a handful of bosses poses greater challenge, when you have to activate more than 2 brain cells, - problems with input – many times game hasn’t registered my heavy attack input and couldn’t properly execute spirit attack, - general problems – I have bad experience with camera (especially when fighting bigger bosses) and hitboxes, moreover I don’t appreciate that sometimes my paralyze spell is consumed without any effect."
Negative,"This game is just ok.It's graphics and art direction are amazing. It's a good test for my 4090 powered rig.Performance has been fine for me with everything maxed, so I appreciate this optimisation, esp coming from Jedi Survivor.I'm also happy to see a uncommon setting, think we've had enough Norse and Greek Mythology for a little while.That's all this game really has, the rest of it was a big con.Exploration is basic, there are invisible walls everywhere, Elden Ring really had this nailed, go where you want and find new and amazing things, Dragons Dogma 2 had the exploration but not the pay off.Story is a little boring so far, nothing is really happening, its nothing like the epicness that was God of War or Witcher 3, there is no heart in this game.Combat is very basic, being a boss rush game I compare it to Monster Hunter or Horizon, those games had highly technical fights that were satisfying to complete. The moveset here is basic, the bosses here are cool to look at but pretty simple, I'd say the combat is ... fine.On its popularity, its the Chinese audience. Mobile games are big there, so we know that their bar for quality is low, i mean no one looks at a ""made in china"" label and thinks quality lolAlso for some strange reason, it got flagged by my firewall, guess its that infamous CCP spyware.This is a 6-7/10 game at best, wait for a 30% sale."
Negative,"The game is really good, combat is fun, graphics are amazing.But no FOV slider, such simple and important feature is missing so for some people borderline impossible to play. (yes you can hack it into the settings with UUU and writing ""fov 100"" which is not the desired way though)So for now i have to give this negative review.Will update should this ever get fixed."
Negative,"Game continues to crash non-stop. 4090ti and brand new system. Was told to do like 100 different things to get it to ""run"" but still wont work so gave up. Shouldn't have to change a bunch of stuff to get a game to work. Looks amazing from what ive seen but rate this bad because of my experience with support + the fact that some computers cant even run this thing properly."
Negative,"Updated again. The further I have gotten through this game the worse it gets. It's just so god damn boring. It spent all the budget on the visuals, voice & story, but the level design is just boring and the combat is the worst offender. It's just the same droll shit. Just spam an attack and roll, do some magic. Enemies are incredibly tanky also.Game feels inconsistent also in regards to attacks due to it not having a queue.I'm at some shitty Budha fight atm where you're forced down to low hp due to a cut scene. it's just cringe and another time wasting boring fight.There's so many little things in this game that keep adding up to make it really a slog to play through. It's not fun anymore & only reason I am still playing is to get my moneys worth, but I will never play this again >.>It's good [update: decent]. Looks good, but it has completely pointless runbacks, no attack queue, crashes & it feels like sometimes your magic just doesn't work at all. I think it's still worth a buy if you're really into the aesthetic and story, but it has faults. Nioh 2 felt a lot more polished and fun than the combat in this.So after some more hours of play I feel it's a pretty average game. I finished Stellar blade recently & am at Consort in Elden Ring DLC and those just feel much better. There's more impact in the fights and more interesting fighting mechanics. The combat in Wukong feels kinda boring and basic. The levels are pretty uninteresting in terms of game play & maze like qualities. They are stunning to look at, but they're just pretty hallways with enemies dotted throughout. The bosses look amazing and some of the fights really work nicely, but it all feels kinda samey. Hard to explain. I plan to continue with the game and unlock more spells.I still think it's worth a purchase, but it's really just an average game imo, but I would still have returned it as I don't think it's worth full price to me."
Negative,way too many crashes edit; have to play with settings on low even tho recomended are high now it crashes once every 3-4 hours instead of every 5 minutes
Negative,"Worth a try, but currently has unsolvable input lag issues, so wait for a fix."
Negative,Its so repetitive and boring wait for sale atleast.
Negative,the game is good for the first hours but then combat becomes repetitive and bosses are either mediocre or focused more on cinematic than game play leaving to some bosses becoming more annoying then difficult. the game also has a lot of visual artifacts and lags sometimes (but still playable)this game is good on the surface level and would defiantly recommend if it goes on sale.
Negative,"The game is of a high quality for their first try in this genre, you can see all the positive reviews for the good parts but I am saying this game could use alot more work as the game itself isn't hard, it's the underlying mechanics that makes it difficult.Multiple BAD (Kang Jin Loong, the various Captains) boss designs that doesn't play well or awkward camera or character placements.In this case, the toughest boss in the whole game is the camera where you can't tell what's going on during fights to properly dodge or attack."
Negative,"Fuckin terrible. You are all brainwashed if you think the inconsistent hit reg, gourd use, frame rate, lack of map, lack of task list. missable items unless youre a fuckin weeb and have the guide and the game on two monitors, and the absolutely horrendous armor and weapons system; (Half the shits useless and isnt used by ANYONE... dont kid yourself.) makes for a great game. Good first attempt, but misses the mark in every fuckin way. Seek ENGLISH help the next time you make a game. It will translate to a better experience.."
Negative,If you like essentially nothing but boss after boss after boss repeatedly ad nauseum for hours on end with like maybe a dozen enemies in-between then this is surely your game but I like a little more game with my boss rush simulator than this gives me. finished the first chapter and it seemed to get a little better but after another couple bosses back to back i'm not sure if I even want to continue this anymore its getting kinda boring.
Negative,controls are stiff and there is basically 0 rpg elements its essentially an arcade game. the graphics certainly deliver but the game is too linear and while beautifully rendered its annoying seeing places you could go to only to be stopped by an invisible wall everywhere. maybe its because these guys are novice devs but back in the day developers would clearly differentiate where the no go zones are with obstacles rather than making you hunt and peck for what could be another path.
Negative,"The game had potential but the overly sharpened messy visuals, the floaty combat and movement, invisible walls and traversal stutter, horrible LOD for shadows, awful performance with and without RT makes the game an INCREDIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT.Its not bad, but its at most a 6.5"
Negative,"Update, this is still garbage and now it crashes every fifteen minutes or so, hooray!"
Negative,"Its a good game, but the movement is weird and unresponsive in combat. Janky ccpEdit: Just as weird and unresponsive weeks later. Janky ccp"
Negative,ALL SOULS GAMES FUCKING SUCK
Negative,"Runs like trash and I have no issues with any other game, including new AAA titles."
Negative,Overstayed it's welcome. Still better than your favorite FromSoftware game.
Negative,"I mean, it's not the worst. But it's just such a mid game. I'm normally pretty happy with the census in respect of reviews but there is overwhelming positivity for a game that's just kinda - average."
Negative,"im not sure if its just my computer but the game keeps crashing every 30 secs, couldnt even load the starting cutscene at lowest settings, and after skipping it, i cant even get 30 secs into the first boss"
Negative,"This game is cool and seems fun, but its not for me.Personally I have a massive skill issue when it comes to these types of games and I font have fun trying to kill the same boss for multiple hours just to get frustrated and for it to ruin my day.This is a good game, but not for me."
Negative,"I really love the idea of these games, Souls like or just overly difficult games. With this game I have the same experience with any Souls style game, I eat though the mobs np but then I get to a boss or a mini boss and I have so many 1% wipe style deaths it becomes demoralizing. If you like hyper challenging needing perfect timing game it's for you. Game looks great and run well Ryzen 7 5700x3d, 4070 super, 32g kit Gskill neo"
Negative,"AMD Adrenalin Software driver keeps timing out and crashing. Low stuttering FPS. Using an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X and AMD Radeon RX 7900XTX. Maybe when the game is more stable I will purchase it in the future, but as for now, I am requesting a refund."
Negative,"I can't even get passed the shader compilation, it just freezes then crashes"
Negative,"It's a beautiful game and it runs well. I haven't had any glitches. That said, It's boring. The entire game is trying to figure out where to go broken up by mindless mouse clicking. There's no variety. I doubt I'll finish it."
Negative,nice boss. nice graphic. bad combat. bad wall.
Negative,"Denuvo made this game unplayable to me, remove it and let us enjoy your masterpiece.  you already made huge success so no need for it to be in the game."
Negative,"Please fix performance issues with 13th and 14th gen Intel chips. Constant stuttering and low frame rates with all combinations of graphical settings. :(Not playable for me at the moment, so I will be leaving negative review. If this changes (which I'm sure it will with future updates), I will edit my review to positive."
Negative,"Game played and looked horrible on the settings it recommended for me - which is more of a review on my aging PC than anything...but really killed the vibe when it looked like a 16-bit game in cut-scenes. Also the combat in general just felt very hollow. Really like the concept of the game, but just not worth the price or space on my drive :/"
Negative,"beautiful game but has lots of stutters even in cutscenes, audio cuts out a ton, gameplay feels clunky and not fluid at all. also the silent protag trope is zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
Negative,"The game is loaded with micro-stutters, screen tearing, and button inputs are regularly ignored.  This is the worst ""souls-like"" game I've ever played as it feels largely unfinished.  I am glad for you if you enjoy the game, but this simply does not work.  If they can fix these technical issues that should have been addressed before the game was released, I'd be willing to try it again, but this feels a lot like polished turd territory at the moment."
Negative,"20240826过完第四章后的更新：MD游戏科学你们写出了一个什么LJ？多少年了还抱着当年的《斗战神》和《悟空传》的阴谋论剧情不放是吧？说好的参考原著，原著是今何在的《西游日记》不是吴承恩的《西游记》是吧？主角是一个杀妻证道、卖友求荣、反复无常、精神错乱的齐天大圣孙悟空是吧？RNM，退钱！这样的改编是对原著的亵渎，整个剧本的水平不如86年的《西游记》电视剧，不如2000年的电视剧《西游记后传》甚至不如日本人78年拍的电视剧《西游记》。场景美术做工精致90分，战斗感受尚可但过度重复至于无聊80分，剧情0分，平均56分，顶着《西游记》这样的国民级IP，改编出来的一坨sh*t，评价为不及格。20240826 update after finishing Chapter 4: Damn it, Game Science, what kind of garbage story did you write? How many years has it been, and you're still clinging to the conspiracy theories from ""Asura"" and ""Wukong Diary"", right? You promised to reference the original, but by 'original', you meant ""Diary on Journey to the West"" by Jin Hezai, not ""Journey to the West"" by Wu Cheng'en, right? So the protagonist is supposed to be a Great Sage Equal to Heaven Sun Wukong who kills his wife for enlightenment, betrays his friends for glory, is fickle, and is mentally unstable, right? Screw this, I want a refund!This kind of adaptation is a desecration of the original work. The entire script doesn't measure up to the 1986 Journey to the West TV series, the 2000 Journey to the West Sequel, or even the 1978 Japanese version of Journey to the West drama, which is already an overdose of alteration. The environmental art is exquisitely crafted, 90/100, and the combat is decent but becomes tedious due to excessive repetition, 80/100. The story, however, is a 0/100. With an average score of 56/100, this is an utter failure for an adaptation of such a beloved national IP like Journey to the West. It’s a pile of sh*t. My rating: Failing.========================================================登堂入室之作。以神作的标准来要求的话，《黑神话·悟空》尚有诸多不足，实在是难以胜任，但是如果仅以一流的标准来要求的话，《黑神话·悟空》明显是进了门槛的，综合评价88/100。作为一款动作游戏，它的表现相当出色，画面表现力堪称现象级，敌人、音乐、地点的相关考证引据也十分让人惊艳，不过游戏仍旧存在不少问题。例如，游戏的引导系统非常欠缺，居然连小地图都没有，甚至菜单中都无法找到地图功能，反观2002年的《轩辕剑4》甚至2000年的《暗黑破坏神2》在这方面的表现都更为完善。此外，手柄的操作感显得相当混乱，虽然画面的打击感十足，但手柄震动几乎反馈不论是力度还是频率都和画面脱节，实在难以令人满意。教学关卡的提示时间过短，重要的锁定键介绍也几乎被忽略，导致视角经常不受控制，需要玩家自行在菜单中查找。尽管有这些瑕疵，作为一款高水平的游戏，我认为给一流中等的评价是合适的，但要达到神作的标准，开发团队显然还有很长的路要走。""A game that has just entered the hall of excellence. When judged by the standards of a masterpiece, Black Myth: Wukong falls short in several areas and cannot fully meet the mark. However, if judged by the standards of a top-tier game, Black Myth: Wukong clearly meets the threshold, with an overall rating of 88/100.As an action game, its performance is quite impressive. The visual presentation is phenomenal, and the detailed research behind the enemies, music, and locations is truly astonishing. However, the game still has some significant issues. For instance, the guidance system is severely lacking—there isn’t even a mini-map, nor is there any map function accessible from the menu. In contrast, games like Xuan-Yuan Sword IV from 2002 and Diablo II from 2000 had much more polished systems in this regard. Additionally, the controller feels quite clunky; although the impact of the visuals is strong, the feedback from the controller’s vibrations is almost entirely out of sync with the on-screen action, both in terms of force and frequency, making it far from satisfying. The tutorials are also too brief, and the crucial lock-on feature is hardly mentioned, leading to uncontrollable camera angles that force players to search through the menu on their own.Despite these flaws, as a high-caliber game, I believe a mid-tier rating in the top category is appropriate. However, to reach the status of a masterpiece, the development team still has a long way to go.Translated by ChatGPT"
Negative,"This is not a good game.  I don't understand the hype.  It locks you into attack animations although it claims to not be a souls-like.  The basic attack combo makes no sense timing wise, so you never know when you should stop doing it or you will be stuck in the animation a millisecond too long and can't dodge out of one of the longer parts of the chain (like the mulipunch or finisher piece). The checkpoints are placed too far from their respective bosses (Like common, even elden ring acknowledges this is a must and puts stakes everywhere there's a boss).  The levels leading up to boss fights are uninspired.  They intentionally pad out the game by not supplying a map so you get lost for a little bit and refight things because you need to reorient.  The transformations into enemies are very long and you don't get i frames so enemies will just beat on you as you try to perform them.  The voice acting is bad.I had it hard crash the first 20 minutes in.  It runs at 30-40 fps."
Negative,the recommended settings are wrong game runs very poorly
Negative,all aboard the chinese overrated hype train
Negative,"Meh, it's just okay. Not worth the price for me. A little airy and loose feeling after Elden Ring's tight mechanics."
Negative,shitty optimization. dont buy till they fix it
Negative,constant low fps crashing  game not going past loading screen i can play most game high or very high no issue apart from this one even playing on low  settings not helping
Negative,Yellow WInd Sage
Negative,"Good graphics, and nice combat. Lots of bugs, performance issues recurring.Overall overrated. But still worth the play."
Negative,The boss named Captain Kalpa-Wave Boss has zero health but does not die. The game got stuck because the only progression point was this boss.
Negative,for anyone that doesn't like a souls game....stay away from this.
Negative,"Ive tried for about three hours to launch it, the game launches to a black screen with a symbol of the crown on the bottom for two minutes then closes. Pressing stop in the library doesn't work and I have to force quit steam which then makes the webhelper go down and then I have to restart my PC. I've tried many things but nothing has worked."
Negative,"- TOO DIFFICULT!- Too repetitive- Controls are a bit clunkyNice and cool graphics, but too dark visuals on a projector making it hard to see in dark areas."
Negative,honestly pretty bad. only finishing it bc my refund got declined
Negative,"Don't understand the hype, boring and very repetitive."
Negative,no sex scene with the sexy female boss
Negative,"Great! Just buy it.BTW, GAME SCIENCE, Please add the option to enlarge subtitles and adding a background for it. The small white font is not clear and greatly affects the experience, HURRY UP PLS!!!"
Negative,"Great game, the graphics, the lore, but unfortunally the chapter 6 is so bad I am not sure I still want to finish the game. Big empty open world, you watch tv wandering around trying to find hidden bosses ... The hopping thing is just buggy what a mess. It let me with a big down after what was a really good game overall!"
Negative,"Would probably be a nice game, if it wouldn't be unsync, freeze or crash every few minutes, even though I have better way better hardware than needed and am trying to play it at the lowest graphics settings. Very disappointed. Would not recommend to buy"

Negative,"Bought the game again after installing a new cpu. Somehow game crashed my whole pc. This only happened when I reach chapter 4. There are people having this problem too. It runs great for some people, especially ones with high end pc. For me, it runs like hot garbage. Without ray tracing on, game's contrast is way too high and it's very difficult to see with this blinding contrast, especially in chapter 2 and 3. Global illumination at medium causes the grass the flicker. Gameplay was enjoyable in chapter 1. Since chapter 2, it becomes more restricted than I expected and repetitive, even boring at times. Bonuses from gears are... weird, the cons outweigh the pros in some armor sets when not upgraded to the highest rank."
Negative,"Nǐ hǎo,unfortunately, I had to refund the game cos of the not sufficient technical execution. My joy was sadly immediately taken when I was experiencing those unbearable so-called traversal stutters... despite 120 FPS on cinematic @ 3840*1440. UE5 yay... well not. (Pls bear in mind 13700k & 4090 IT-professional here.)But!... I actually do indeed believe that under the hood meaning once technical issues are hopefully patched, then this might be one game I 200% am looking forward to giving another try. Maybe not again for full price and not in this poor state. This game was released too early and this is not excusable.What I can say is that I loved the beginning of the game /-play, the presentation, the sound and the overall vibe and feeling it gave me.It is very impressive what has been achieved so far.Many regards from North of Germany,Hoff"
Negative,"Had No Problem making it thru chapter 1, Started chapter 2 and reached the tiger vanguard and was destroyed must have fought him about 30 times. so I went back and spend 4 hours grinding my level up to 43 fighting the same trash mobs over and over again, hopefully raising my level enough to be able to fight the boss, and I still cannot manage to get his health below 50%, this game was off to a great start and then the difficulty level just ramped up making it unplayable. my advise is don't waste your time if you arent into extremely difficult games like the souls series, this just just a cheap knockoff. I wish I could return the game because its an absolute waste of $60, but I am past the point of being able to return it since I completed chapter 1 and spent that time grinding my level up."
Negative,Can't see any enemy lol. Refund :(
Negative,"The game is beautiful, and I love the setting, but the way the combat feels just doesn't make me excited to open it again. Real shame."
Negative,Hit box on bosses are horrible and the game is simple not good!
Negative,"Very linear, combat wasn't that interesting. Kind of like an easier Dark Souls or Elden Ring. I couldn't really get into the story, just kind of wandering down corridors killing a few very easy enemies and then fighting a more difficult boss. Graphically it's incredible though."
Negative,"I had a lot of visual issues there were screen tearing, stuttering Ect all from the start. I can live with that every once in a while but not every time I turn the camera. I finagled with the settings and it helped a bit but it was still very jagged which is a shame because it looks fun.I thought my RTX 3060 might handle it but it's really jarring to look at and might try again if the game is updated."
Negative,"It's a cool game and has been enjoyable for the first few hours. I don't know about the longevity of the enjoyment I get out of this though, I went in expecting sort of basic combat but it feels really repetitive and kind of lacklustre. Don't expect to find much joy outside of boss fights, especially considering the sheer amount of invisible walls in the environment. It's a beautiful map but you can't really explore it at all, trying to walk even a tiny bit off the beaten path just gives you a wall, which feels like a kind of cheap way to reduce the size of the map instead of just making areas impossible to get to or allowing me to jump off a cliff thinking there's something down there. Even linear games can reward exploration, but with invisible walls everywhere I just don't find myself doing much other than bee-lining for the next boss fight. This in combination with a weird visual filter and tons of artifacts just kinda takes all joy out of it for me. I'm sure a lot of others will enjoy it and I'd still recommend it, and I'll keep playing to see if I come around, but it isn't as amazing as I've seen others say.edit: I played some more and beat more bosses, it just isn't that good for 90 AUD. Also it is absolutely a souls game, I think the devs try to avoid that label because the combat truly sucks in comparison, but it is a Journey to The West themed luke warm souls-like. If you haven't grown up with the book then you may like it, but if you've played all the souls games AND haven't grown up with the book, you probably won't love it as much as it's been hyped up to be."
Negative,"After 2.3 hours of gameplay on the first location I can say in my honest opinion that I wish a refund.You ask why?0. I will be comparing that game to other of similar genres, because Wukong gives another experience while being in the same genre.1. Game has a very fast-pased gameplay, but it has no animations cancelling.Even perfect dodge doesn't fix that issue, because it can only be used when no combo or attack is in progress. Remembered how well it was implemented in Nier: Automata, when you can use dodge anytime you want so you can experience flow-like battle with no blockers of that experience.2. Some skills description is at least misleading.For example, stance branch skill ""Resolute Counterflow"" description says that it can be triggered while player in a light attack combo AND consumes focus point AND then uses heavy attack. That is wrong, because player is unable to consume focus point in a light attack combo, only when long pressing heavy attack. How then that skill can be triggered? By reading a whole reddit post about that kind of frustration. Where you can find that skill can be used when player ALREADY has at least one focus point filled THEN by using light attack combo AND then using heavy attack player can trigger that skill...3. Very ... long ... pickup ... animations...Wukong can find a bunch of items to pickup on locations, but they are not quick or at all absent. They take at least a second. You can rightly say that it is not so much... when you pick up two or three items on a whole location. But those items resets after each rest or death on a location. And if you don't want to leave those items on a ground then you need to wait for those animations to end again and again. It's not that bad, but it frustrates me more.4. Locations are just corridors with texture decorations.Locations in Wukong are gut-like corridors with no real sense of exploration or hidden sections. Mostly all of those corridors are covered in invisible walls to protect our fragile king of monkeys from falling from 5-6 meters high ledge. No tree, bush, water or stick are interactive at all.5. Locations' decorations don't cover you from enemy attacks.I've found that issue in battle with Wandering Wight. On that boss arena there are plenty of trees and big boulders that can completely cover you from boss sight... but not from his Kamehameha directed at your hairy face. So all of those decorations are more of decorations now - empty decorations with no real purpose as just to cover arena with some props.6. Disgustingly unreadable attack delays.No boss (so far) has any clear readable attack, so the fight can be understandable by the player from 2 or 3 tries. You have to go throw 5-8 tries just to memorize all of those attacks specific delays to work with. I'm not new with that kind of issue. Thanks, Elden Ring (who taught me that lesson), I don't want same kind of experience.7. Every enemy attack can stagger you, but only player very heavy attack can stagger other enemies.This is mostly an unjust move from game balance, then a real issue."
Negative,"Buggy controller mappings, and crash to desktop. Despite my controller being fully supported, it will try to interact with the desktop (volume adjust or screenshot), and make playing the game difficult. Refunded."
Negative,"Did refund, keeps crashing to desktop if I did not lower the settings to lowest, I have an ufo as PC so that should not be an issue. Looks very nice but that's it."
Negative,"Yellow wind mage ruins the game. Its not challenging and not fun, just frustrating:The boss can become completely invincible through a bug where in the middle of the fight, he moves outside the arena, and your attacks simply will not reach him, and his attacks will. If you do heavy attacks, there are times when an invisible wall will appear between you and the boss, meaning, your attacks never landed (Also happens with a few other bosses). The Boss's move set does not make any sense, in the final third of the fight, he will create twisters that are impossible to see whilst fighting, if you touch them you get CC'd into the air, and he can chain that into a cutscene attack. Thats not the only cut scene attack he has, and he spams it.It does not matter if you learn the moveset, what you need to do, is defy all logic of how the game mechanics works and consider this boss fight a bug which requires a workaround. Due to this boss I cant recommend this game and it has lost all replayability IMO.Graphically the game looks good, runs nice at 60 fps, the story and lore is cool. The amount of bosses is cool, but if you arent willing to QA boss fights, I would avoid, this is not the type of game where you can simply figure out your own way of defeating main bosses. Also if you enjoy playing a game where everything has armoured attacks except you. Enjoy"
Negative,"Average, was expecting more with the hype. A bit like GoW but not as good."
Negative,wait for some bug fixes before buying it. the game crashed during a boss fight twice one me. Just imagine you are fighting Margit for the 17th and he isat 1 hp and the game crashes.
Negative,this game has bad performance so lag and unplayable
Negative,"Great game, BUT a lot of bullshit mechanics and same lazy things like in other ""souls"" like games.You are keeping distance? Nah, the game will slide the boss to you mid combo.Attack visuals did miss you? Nah, still get damaged.You are above the enemy attack? Nah, still hits you for some reason. Even sweep attacks do.Dodged boss grab attack and now stand behind him? Nah, still grabs you.Dodge away from attack AND from aoe that attack does? Nah, still get damagedBoss going out of the boss arena? Yeah, a fucking lot.Press dodge, gets hit anyways, instinctivly press dodge again to recover faster, get attacked again? Hell yeah, in every boss fight. Its bit annoying that this is what games realy on to be ""dificult""Other times its just straigh up buggy as hell. THe game will hold you in place sometimes forcing you to get hit. No dodge spam or moving is allowed in that state. the game wants you to get hit, so it makes it that way.The more I play the game, the more I see Problems with it. still decent game, but not the mind blowing experience it was in the beggining....21 hours into the game and am sure the enemies in the late game are not tested at all.....I can interupt enemies attack, the get staggered yet I recive damage from the interupted attack.I am now not reccomending this game just becouse I dont think its a good game anymore. 28 Hours now, and I definetly would refund if I could... The amount of bugs in this game is unreal. Final edit of 35 hours in: THE buggiest game I have ever played.... in the late game non of the hitboxes seems to slline, attack hits you even when you are not there. Abuse of stupid mechanics.... Definetly would refund if diven the chance"
Negative,Highly do not recommend this game as you cant edit key binds or controller binds to meet your style... Hopefully this changes because its a beautiful game and i feel like it would be a lot of fun if I could customize my bindings better.
Negative,"The Good things first:Game runs super smooth even without Frame generation and look really good, but that's it!The Bad things:Invisible walls everywhere, and you can get stuck in them!!Combat sucks hard and feels very clunky, Hitboxes are trash and no animation canceling it feels very unresponsive!The worst off all is the dodge it feels so bad even when you stick a view points in it!!"
Negative,"not that anyone's going to read this but is there really no block? That is just insane.  How can you have good fighting without being able to block or parry?? That is just insane.  And for that, I'm out.  Just know what you're getting. beautiful graphics, Very linear play.  Light attack over and over, charge, Heavy attack, dodge, rinse and repeat.  admittedly I'm not going to play past the 2 hour mark so I won't get to unlock the parry/deflect spell or what ever it is but after reading some stuff it looks like its the same attack style all the way through.  i cant just light attack and dodge for an entire game.  that's just crazy.  Lovely graphics tho."
Negative,I like this game alot but I have a 4090 and I keep getting a out of memory error randomly. I will change my review once this issues is fix but right now the game is really buggy.
Negative,game crashes loading chapter 2
Negative,每个怪碰撞体积不一样 机制一坨屎 傻逼nmb boss技能还莫名其妙霸体 太糙了
Negative,I got to level 4 and hit a hard wall. After 2 hours on the same boss I uninstalled and refunded.
Negative,"Game plays like a Souls game. Bosses are acrobatics teleporter's and hit you much more than you can damage them. If you like getting your ass handed to you at the beginning over and over again. Or You grind your levels 56 hours you maybe can beat the first boss. I do got to hand it to the devs tho, they actually worked a little bit into The lore. Than DS did"
Negative,"This game is not as good as people are saying it is. Invisible walls every where make some combat annoying. You hit a invisible wall next to a rock that slows your characters movements. I think most people are wanting for a good game and got this all twisted up. Its not fun, enemies are bullet sponges, no footies just hit them for 5 mins then they die. Doesnt feel good like elden ring or other games like this."
Negative,"The recent update basically made the game look really bad in the ""cinematic"" setting for some reason...Also after playing the 2 first chapters, the overall quality and fun is going downhill real fast, the more i play, the more i'm disappointed.Patch your game, can't fully recommend for now."
Negative,This game feels incomplete as many enemies have very jank hit-boxes where the visuals don't match the actual hit box. There is so much input delay in this game that it feels like actions occur long after I stop pressing everything. The hit stun and action delay feel so clunky as well as it takes many second to get up from getting knocked if you don't roll.
Negative,"A beautiful but vapid and empty game.  Visuals are stunning and genuinely unique, enemy design is top notch, and the story seems like an interesting (if not very captivating) rendition of a tale old as time.  The problems are in the systems and the economy of the game.Combat LOOKS really cool, but is really really really bad.  There is a reason that a ton of fast paced action games, hack and slash types, and other games do not include what is here.  Limited stamina, VERY limited uses of the spells or transformations, and a super spammy and loose light/heavy attack.  This makes the game feel like you are slapping an Abrams tank that is going light speed, with a wet paper towel.  Then when you go to use your spells and abilities...they are not as impactful as needed and you have almost no way to build into or improve the ones that you enjoy.The game constantly shoehorns you into needing one specific set of skills and spells to get past some nonsensical over powered an annoying enemy type you've seen a hundred times before but in a game where you can gain the tools needed to deal with them.  Don't even get me started on ranged enemies in this game.  You have absolutely 0 options and or tools to deal with them and they are dogshit.I really wanted to love this game and I honestly did have very small bites of fun at time.  But in all honestly it just becomes a drag.  The easiest way I can explain this game is...take the last boss of the Shadow of the Erdtree, make it a random animal, give it weird poetic lines to say, and then remove all of the stuff you would need to deal with, and you now understand this game."
Negative,So much audio stuttering and lag (bad performance) even with my high-end pc all this glitches are making the game almost unplayable at the moment.
Negative,"AMD related Crashing makes it currently unplayable, with reconsider later."
Negative,"sh*tty performance with 14900k and 4080, excellent story."
Negative,Was expecting more considering the praise and was honestly surprised how average it was. The combat feels floaty and doesn't feel like you're connecting at all half the time. The visuals do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to overall level design. You're basically zig zaging through simple interconnecting corridors to get to the next boss. Which I wouldn't mind if the combat actually felt good to engage with. It's a damn shame since a lot of the boss designs are some of the best i've seen in a while.
Negative,couldnt get this game to not look like crap on my 3440x1440 OLED. Something to do with the sharpening filters or whatever idk but it was all shimmery and loads of artefacts when ever you move. If you stand still its gorgeous though.
Negative,"2.5/10Mediocre at best, I am honestly surprised with the amount of positive reviews here.Most of things about this game feel like a chore, it's almost as the people who built it never experienced joy in their lives:- Level design forces you to aimlessly wander through a glass wall maze with no map. No consistency in interactions with the environment, like some cliffs that kill you, and some are behind glass walls. Most common enemies are absolutely useless and can be just ignored.- Underwhelming combat system. No variety in abilities or weapons, you have to rely on a single combo all the time. Oh, and forget about the skill tree, as most of those do and change absolutely nothing for you.- Virtually no storytelling, characters keep exchanging obscure lines that you supposed to understand only if you are familiar with the original story. How hard this could be, I at minimum want to know why I need to slaughter my next enemy!- Bosses, while being much easier to beat than in other games of the genre, get repetitive very quickly, as all of them look and do the same. After the third chapter it all turns into a blur, and you just expected to rinse and repeat. Boring!- Other bad design decisions: broken camera that can't follow and gets stuck often, multiple loading screens between the spawn point and the next boss, broken textures, frequent crashes.Also it should not be even called an RPG, it's a Boss Rush game.Maybe one positive thing that stands out is an overall picture quality, but we should thank Epic Games and Unreal Engine 5 for that, not the sweatshop that produced... this."
Negative,"I don't know, it's not for me. I wanted more RPG elements and build variety (I didn't get far, so take this with a grain of salt). I didn't enjoy the combat that much. It felt flashier than it was substantive. I opted to return it.The visual storytelling is excellent and the game is generally gorgeous. The dialogue is pretty good and there are interesting characters. But I just didn't think the core gameplay loop was that fun."
Negative,"Not a souls-like by my estimations.  It's deff an action adventure, reminds me more of Devil May Cry and those types of games. More button-mash-y. Loved the concept. The art style and visuals are all cool and well done. The combat just feels too arcade-y.  If it were all a touch slower paced and felt more meaningful, I would probably feel different. I also think most of the positive reviews are coming from China and seem a little suspicious. This game has racked up more reviews in a few days than some top titles do in years."
Negative,"I didn't like it. I want to like it. But I did not. The combat did not stick with me, if you know what I mean. If you don't, the thing that he carries inside his ear... Yeah. Maybe gets better. In the future I'll try again."
Negative,"Aggressively banal, lifeless and uninspired.  It is the bare minimum effort put in by the developers.  I see it being compared with Dark Souls and God of War, which is a joke.  This is an arcade beat-em-up with a few dog monsters dropped randomly into a flat, forest setting.  Don't be fooled by the awesome 20-minutes at the start of the game.  It starts strong with a backdrop of heavenly warriors the size of mountains, and Monkey King himself is cocky and funny and dangerous. He has an AMAZING voice actor, and I immediately wanted more of that.  But then the character you actually play as is a stoic mute with no personality.  Seriously, why make a game about Monkey King and then have him be a silent protagonist?This game is bland on bland."
Negative,"Game feels super mid. Supposedly not a souls like, but honestly feels worse than one, while trying to copy exactly what a souls like is. If the story was better it might have more meaning. You can't have a convoluted story, with that level of difficulty, and then pigeon hole you into a single play style. I also wouldn't mind the difficulty if the dodge mechanic was more consistent, but it feels all over the place, as does trying to telegraph attack patterns. But hey maybe I just need to ""git gud"", or my old man reaction times aren't what they used to be. Personally though, if I was going to play something like this, I'd rather play Elden Ring or an actual souls game. Just my $0.02...hopefully it's better for the rest of y'all.p.s. game worked fine and graphics/sound pretty freakin good. Was playing 4k max settings at roughly 70fps with a 4070super, on my big screen, and it did look gorgeous."
Negative,"WARNING! YOU CAN""T RE-MAP THE KEYOARD movement keys and others."
Negative,Fun game when its not stuttering on the lowest settings possible
Negative,bought this game just to not be able to play it because it keeps crashing for no reason
Negative,"Boring gameplay loop and map design is pretty bad. I'm also over an hour into the game and have no clue what the story is. There are giant dudes that you hate for some reason, and now you gotta kill wolves in a forest? I don't know, just boring and doesn't do it for me."
Negative,"UPDATE: Since Steam refused my refund even though I couldnt even play the game in their 2hours limit I'll finish the game and update this review accordinglyGameplay wise this game seems okay, nothing that innovative and nothing extremely bad in that aspectGraphics looks superb but runs quite mild and I could not get stable 75fps even with DLSS, but that's fine and stuttering exists but it's now overwhelming About the gameplay, I liked the concept of using bosses and mini bosses as abilities, i feel it was implemented as good as it could get and that's a positive point but I'm the combat part I feel it lacked a lot, I know it's not a souls like but it felt I could mash my way through normal mobs and bosses, which had a cool design, felt somewhat the same but I wouldn't only mash attack, I would mash dodging tooExploration is non existent and we are always being cut by inconsistent invisibles walls (that for me in a 2024 game in this price range is ridiculous), there are some stuff to find but I found myself ignoring side paths and going to the boss and running through the filler between them as fast as I could Technical: I understand that shader compiling is a thing nowadays but it taking 1 hour and 40 minutes to finish, crashing at the beginning cutscene and going again for 1 hour is ridiculous, couldn't even test the game in the 2 hour window steam give us for a refund lolBesides that, I had a few bosses with broken AI standing in the middle of the arena doing nothing and wouldn't die after hitting 0 HP...I wouldn't recommend it right now, maybe in a few updates.Also, being a new studio and not having the capacity of a AAA game developer is not a excuse for a game in this price range."
Negative,"The best way to describe this game is, it's a lesser souls like (but it's not) with more of an RPG/Adventure game. You find shrines to rest at, craft, buy and sell etc. etc. resting respawns all enemies in the area, but that's really all there is for the souls like. Game-play is very fun and smooth, combat is very satisfying and it is challenging. I loved Elden Ring, but never really played any other souls like games besides Nioh 2, This game is nothing like them in that souls-like sense. The bosses are challenging, but in my opinion, the devs have found a very happy medium between action/RPG adventure and ""souls like challenge"". Yes I've heard about all the crashes and bugs, but, those are fixable. So, is this game worth it? absolutely it is. for both Action/RPG adventures and souls-like genres. It is completely worth it.***UPDATE*** The Wing sage boss is by far the dumbest boss I've ever encountered in any video. I've been playing video games for over 25 plus years and this boss is completely ridiculous. For some reason the dodge mechanic doesn't respond half the time during this boss. I get this boss low and his last move set is one of the worst, most ridiculous things I've ever seen. not just that, but this boss will attack you with ranged attacks OUTSIDE OF THE PLAY AREA. Which means, if you use the immobilize spell and he's outside of the play area, YOU HIT AN INVISIBLE WALL WHEN TRYING TO GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO DO DAMAGE. this boss is so bad I'm officially changing my review from recommended, to not recommended. I'm dead serious. This boss is worse than any boss in Elden Ring, not in difficulty, just in complete and utter ridiculousness. This game is stupid because of this one boss. unbelievable."
Negative,"Aside from the obvious performance issues, this game has some seriously bad fighting mechanics. Animation makes dodging a pain, almost as if it has lat between hits and dodges. Not smooth at all. I'll retry the game once it's more playable and stops crashing, but from what I played this game was mid and boring. Just play GOW."
Negative,REMOVE THE COPYRIGHT MUSIC OR GIVE US AN OPTION FOR NON COPYRIGHT MUSIC
Negative,Nioh is better :(
Negative,"I have tried every suggestion under the sun and I still cannot play without constant slow down, stuttering, and extremely low frames. My computer is well within specs and I can play most AAA games on medium or high settings just fine. I have no idea how anybody is getting 100 fps or more on any of the presets. I played Cyberpunk shortly after release and it was more stable than this. Most people I see online that can actually run this have a current gen high end CPU and a 4090. I wouldn't even sniff this game right now unless you have something comparable to that. If the performance issues aren't fixed within 14 days of my purchase I'm probably just going to refund unfortunately.TLDR: Seems like its entertaining, but I would not play this game until they release patches to fix the performance issues."
Negative,"k so the gameplay is kind of weird. enemies easily get into awkward glitchy spots, navigating without a map in some areas is tiresome, and I feel like the combat is stiff and gets tedious and annoying. it doesnt really flow that great imo. If the combat was made anything like arkham kknight or like any other hack n slash I feel like Id want to play this game because its fun, but right now I feel like im just trying to get through these dumbass enemies to see the pretty scenery. Im still gonna finish the game because its pretty but please make game better.im gonna go ahead and give this a thumbs down but id say its worth to try out if youre rich like that"
Negative,many keyboards keys cannot be customized. Especially the movements keys
Negative,"Absolute shite game, wtf kind of story has you go around gathering items to get stronger to then have them taken from you during a boss fight and make that boss spongy as fuck while you hit like a wet noodle and it hits like a train, no fucking point in finishing this pos game when the devs can't be arsed balancing it, when you have to rely on near pixel perfect dodges to even stand a chance at no taking damage but then have bosses do and immediate 2nd attacks that hits you regardless is complete bullshit"
Negative,"I have never experienced worse performance with any game, even at the lowest graphical settings. Constant audio cut outs and desync, with both english and chineese audio. The game constantly stutters mid combat, making it unplayable. I would never recommend this game to anyone in this state."
Negative,"I was having fun but BOY does this mf keep crashing... It can't be my pc because I run a pretty decent rig... I'm able to play a bunch of games, BIGGER games, on a high end resolution... SO IT'S NOT THAT! GOD, I've had like 13 crashes so far and I don't know how to fix it, but I am changing my review based on that problem alone, because what good is a game if you need to reboot it every freaking 2 hours or so!"
Negative,"Not Recommended, but Not Because It’s a Bad GameI'm not recommending *Black Myth: Wukong*, not because it’s inherently bad, but because it isn’t what I hoped, expected, or was led to believe it would be. Other reviews may delve deeper into the game’s mechanics and story, so I’ll keep this simple: if you enjoy *Dark Souls*, you’ll likely enjoy this game. If *Dark Souls* isn’t your cup of tea, you’ll almost certainly dislike *Black Myth: Wukong*. This game is not like *God of War*—it is very much in the vein of *Dark Souls*, except you’re playing as a monkey, with challenging environments that will frustrate both you and the AI as you get stuck on geometry time and time again.That’s assuming the game even runs smoothly on your system. Performance seems to be hit-or-miss depending on your hardware. For context, my RTX 3080 couldn’t consistently maintain a smooth 60 FPS, which is disappointing for a game of this caliber.Should you buy this game? Only if you’re looking for a series of challenging boss fights and don’t mind a game that falls short of “Game of the Year” quality. *Black Myth: Wukong* has potential, but for now, it feels more like a niche experience rather than the groundbreaking title many hoped it would be.One final note: I requested a refund from Steam after realizing this game wasn’t for me, but they refused, citing that I had played the game for four hours beyond the refund window. While I understand the policy, it’s frustrating that Steam wouldn’t consider the unique circumstances—especially for a game that relies on extended play to reveal its true nature. This lack of flexibility left a bitter taste and is something to keep in mind if you’re on the fence about purchasing."
Negative,"The game has great potential, but still feels unfinished. I have rx 7900 xt and running it on 2k, on high settings, without ray-tracing and sharpness on 50 and does not feel smooth. For me it is unplayable. Such a shame... And what is the point of playing in such beautiful world with ""lowered"" graphics. I logged on my PS5 into GOW Ragnarok and in quality mode(30fps) it still feels smoother then this.Hope they will improve it soon..."
Negative,2000 tl yi siz veriyosunuz oyunu chapter bossları oynuyor messmeri geçtiler iyice dans ediyorum resmen aptal bosslarla
Negative,"The plot is very silly and completely disappointing. It's disgusting, F  you game science, it's not Journey to the West,F you!"
Negative,"Amazing game, with some of the worst boss design I have ever seen in my life. The ""final boss"" of the game is just painfully annoying for the sake of being annoying."
Negative,crashes after prologue fight and title card
Negative,Combat feels floaty and unfun.
Negative,All the nonhuman bosses are designed by imbeciles.
Negative,"Sadly does not work on AMD at all, can't get through the intro video"
Negative,"Meh, can't run smoothly above 75% quality with an RTX 4090... Graphics aren't crazy and locked to 21:9 ratio, come on, it's 2024.Will keep exploring to see if the gameplay is worth it and update my review.I got it for free but I wouldn't recommend paying the price they asked for so far...!"
Negative,I just wanted it to end........Thats how I felt after chapter 4 came to a close.  All I could think is dear lord just let this end.  Early on I loved what I was playing but after a while it was all so shallow.I have written 3 reviews now in various stages but deleting it all and just leaving that I believe the next game they produce will be magic.  Sorry but this feels like a demo of a bunch of ideas and a huge bloated roster of uninspired and easyish bosses minus a couple of cheap ones.  Was so tired of whacking things with stick the beauty of the game became the only thing I appreciated.
Negative,"dont buy the delux version.was buying it for the music, turn out not only the music are not complete, but you can't even access the music file but only can listen in game, which is totally pointless."
Negative,"wtf, 4090 i913k still crashhh?? helpopppppp"
Negative,After the first mini boss the game will no longer save and its extremely frustrating because i do want to play the game but i cant because none of my progress will save.
Negative,Game crash after chapter 3 final boss killed. WP overwhelming positive
Negative,"As of right now, way too many crashes at recommended settings for me to review positively."
Negative,能让大圣在全网风评骤降 养活了质疑大圣是不是个正面形象的狗屎饭圈 不蹭大圣流量谁预购买你的斗战神啊 抛开游戏外 游戏内就没有考虑过键盘玩家的感受 2024年了做键盘按键调视角很难吗？ 想学魂又只学到了恶心人的部分 做boss抄都不会抄 抄个冷门粪怪 负反馈拉满的游戏 被处刑画面最多的游戏 不看视频攻略就要纯受折磨的游戏 我就好奇了这些法宝藏起来是想留着跟杨奇木琴下葬吗 给美术组磕个头吧 不是中华文化博大精深有这么多东西让你扫就这完成度跟私货早就被骂烂了 制作几乎完美的前三章单独拿出来都能给个满分 但是加上后两张的完成度粪怪阴谋论只能说勉强及格
Negative,As much as i want to like the game i simply can't for the following reasons1.)Boss rush-even though there is quite a bit of map to explore the bosses are a bit too frequent to my taste2.)Boss quality-i hated most of the boss fights. One reason being that bosses have true combos. Second being noodle dragon. This fight was sooo infuriating i just can't describe it...3.)Combat system-while fun at times for the most part it's just frustrating. No animation cancelling and long animations make me want to punch a hole in the wall
Negative,"Its an okay game if youre a fan of God of War games but outside of being visually beautiful the game is empty. its just boss after boss after boss after boss which grows so boring after the second chapter.  get it when its on sale, i wouldn't pay full price for this game"
Negative,"After more time, would not recommend at full price:While definately a fun way to pass some time, eventually the linearity of it all gets old. Staff sponge bosses that are all very samey, each harder than the last, feels like you get weaker as time goes on. Initially I applauded that the enemies actually have weight behind their attacks and cant just turn immediately when I've moved out of the way.... then later they heat seek just like all the others, or they disappear and attack you as a dashing spirit that almost can't miss, or they AOE, AOE, AOE.Late fights despite upgrades go something like this: dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, attack for 1 hp, dodge dodge, run away, dodge, attack for 1 hp."
Negative,"THE FUCKING ROLLS DOESENT WORK 33% OF THE TIME AND EVERY BOSS IS THE GOD DAM SAME WITH THE SAME RETARDED CAMERA LOCK DISAPEARING WHEN EVER THEY GET INVISE AND DASH. FIX THE CAM RETARDSUPDATE: this game suck balls indie company that cant make a good damn game absolute dogshit all bosses are either super easy or extremly bad made wich make them ""hard"" and this fucking cock roach ""feng tail general"" are a fucking joke 1 hour and i have still not beated him becose the fucking thing doesent work retarded devs. ""turns out to beat the grasshopper you need 300+ stamina"" FUCKING ANIMALS DEVS KILL YOUR SELFstory: nothing specialview: decentgameplay: nothing specialin overall this game is absolute shit but hey atleast they tried i hope dont buy this game unless you want to be molested by CCP #china nmr1"
Negative,Nothing new was hoping for more but basically boss rush with no challenge inbetween levels.Got boring fast.
Negative,"It literally will not launch. I have tried every fix everyones suggested but no dice. Refunding, might get it again when I can actually fucking play it."
Negative,Out of sink audio and very choppy despite being on medium settings with a 4060 TI Wait a couple of months for some patches
Negative,not friendly to greenhorn.what is in need of is a goddamn beginner's tutorial
Negative,"I refunded this game because there are too many invisible wallsreally annoying, plus there is no mapbut the gameplay amazing."
Negative,"I can't even get the game to go past the start menu, he starts flying to giants and then crash. Try to bring it up again over and over and it either freezes and crashes before the start screen, could not even play the actual game. No idea why anyone is singing praises about this garbage."
Negative,Would recommend but you need a really beefy system have a 2080 and crashed 3 times on medium settings before finishing the prologue might come back after a huge performance patch
Negative,"i have a 1000 dollar pc and it cant run without it crashing or being laggy to the point that it has delayed audio so i cant even enjoy the cool cutscenes, i wish i could play the game, but those problems stopped me. Hoping for optimization updates but i already refunded"
Negative,"My playtime is 24 minutes. Never got to control the monkey. It was 100% crashing. Yes, I'm using AMD GPU and couldn't get past the first cutscene. I would not hope for the patch to come soon as no one knows when. The official statement says we should rollback the driver a few versions. We should not be doing that."
Negative,It only showed black screen from the start. I tried all the adjustments recommended by other players and I have AMD ryzen 7 with Radeon 7800 GRE. I'm pretty sure this can handle the game well but it was bugged from the start. I hope they can fix this issue soon.
Negative,The game is unplayable for me. I am using a 4090 laptop with high settings and Ray Tracing - off. Still it does not stop stuttering. Once i die after opening the game this issue starts. Anybody facing similar issue?
Negative,"Love the game, the mechanics are great and the combat is satisfying but if i lose another fight because my entire combo doesnt register damage even when point blank please fix the hit boxes soon"
Negative,Crashed on me over and over again. Black screened my computer. Can't even make it past the main menu. Maybe I'll repurchase the game if more updates and drivers are improved. For now I ain't dealing with games that don't work.
Negative,"Still I say again it is literally a dark souls, elden ring remake. Just boss, boss, boss, there is hardly any sustinance at all. Just straight b line to the next boss. Could have done so much better."
Negative,"The game was running 60 fps on high settings. Then after a point on the first chapter, I now have to run medium settings to only get 30 fps. High settings is unplayable. Restarting my computer doesn't fix the problem. I downloaded the latest nvidia drivers. I don't know what else to do. This is frustrating."
Negative,"you cant remap controls to a gaming mouse leaving you stuck with awkward keybindings, The game cant decide if you want to use a heavy attack skill or charge it leaving you stuck with awkward charge animations mid fight that kills you (why tf is charge not its own button?) Bosses stagger unless they dont so straight up RNG fighting for bs like them ignoring your hits and killing you because your attack animations are so damn long to dodge. so far the ONLY positive i have for this game is the graphics."
Negative,The game starts out great and tries to hide its flaws behind UE5 with Ray Tracing. However there is a lot wrong with this game. A ton of the enemies are beyond frustrating to fight. The main boss designs are fucking horrible when you get right down to it. Could be great but its just okay
Negative,I really want to play this game but unfortunately cannot. In its current state the game is very unstable for AMD graphic cards and has crashed multiple times after the prologue. I tried adjusting the settings and my entire PC crashes to the point Windows disabled my GPU. I tried again with the games compatibility mode only to have the same results except my GPU didn't get disabled. I'll change my review when they fix this issue; otherwise the game looks phenomenal.
Negative,"Black Myth: Wukong is not a bad game, it just wasn't what i expected. My biggest disappointment was when I found out that there was not a standard parry mechanic and that the perfect dodge was not sufficient in creating the type of gameplay expected. That and there were some FPS drops and optimization issues for my rtx 3070 card (on a scale 1 to 10 with 1 being TLOU Part 1 launch issues and 10 being some game that was released without bugs I give it a 7) however this is just day 2 of the release these issues will probably be patched within the first week. That being said it just wasn't the game I hoped it was so I decided to request a refund and move on."
Negative,"Chapters 1-5 this was my GOTY (although Chapter 5 started to be a bit of a chore). Chapter 6 ruined the game for me and I have literally hit a point of the game where I can't progress without going back to Chapter 1 and finding something I missed. This is horrible game design. If its so crucial to progressing at the end of the game, make it where it's IMPOSSIBLE to miss. There is nothing in this game that explains anything to you about what you're doing wrong, or how to fix it, and I am not a player that uses guides. I did look up a guide on this particular instance, and it appears I'd have to backtrack significantly to progress the game.This might be something I would do, if Chapter 6 wasn't so absolutely god awful. Complaints about the empty worlds are readily apparent, the area is as boring as any area I've ever played in a video game, the bosses are the worst bosses I've fought against since Bed of Chaos in DS1. There's no way I'm going through all this extra work to play something that has gotten dramatically unfun.I'd say Chapters 1-5 are a 9/10, Chapter 6 a 1/10. This is Game of Thrones Season 8 in game form. I thought Elden Ring really fell off towards the end, but at least I could finish Elden Ring.I'd also say this isn't really a souls-like (more like modern God of War,), and in my opinion Stellar Blade is still the best souls-like this year."
Negative,is skiping to much
Negative,Performance was bad at launch and was probably my biggest purchase regret of the year.
Negative,Every damn boss is a gimmick
Negative,"优点是出色的美术和boss设计，大多数符合新时代的中国传统神话艺术形象；缺点是贫瘠的动作系统，真假岔路不分、重点不明的地图设计，地图上明暗分界过于明显，亮的地方刺眼，暗的地方一麻黑，但是暗的地方可能就只是明亮场景下的桥洞，过渡太差。故作黑深残完全背离原著西游记的人设和剧情，与宣传差的很多，反而走的斗战神和大话西游的路子，虚假宣传我差评的主要原因。     路边小怪要不几棍敲死，要不在高点对你疯狂射击而你有没有任何反制手段，法术耗蓝高又缺乏回蓝手段，降低了法术在boss rush中的作用，尤其是地图中间的小boss，接连遇到几个如果中间没死那后面就完全无蓝可用，切换架势只能换重击，普攻闪避模组没有变化。目前有很多问题有待优化，剧情、战斗无法更改，但优化、地图指引，小地图等很多问题都能优化解决。综合评分也确实值得82-85，不高不低。建议想体验独特的中华传统美术风格，或者想支持中国首个大作的购买游玩，如果只是单纯想体验一个很好的ARPG,这个游戏还存在很多问题有待优化，目前只能算是差强人意，有更多更好的选择。如果购买需求不那么强烈，可以等后续优化得当后再购买游玩。The advantages are excellent graphics and boss design, with most characters conforming to Chinese traditional mythological art images;The disadvantages are these：a poor action system； confusing map design with false paths and unclear priorities； a clear division of light and dark on the map, with bright areas being too bright and dark areas being too dark, but the dark areas may only be bridge openings in bright scenes, with poor transitions. The game attempts to make it dark, deep, and cruel is completely contrary to the character and plot of the original Journey to the West, and is far from the promotion, which is why I give it a bad review.The roadside monsters either get knocked out with a few blows or shoot at you from a high vantage point while you have no countermeasures. The mana consumption is high and there are no ways to replenish mana, which reduces the effect of magic in boss rushes, especially the small bosses in the middle of the map， if you encounter a few in a row and don't die in between, you will have no mana left for the rest of the fight, and switching stances can only change to a heavy attack. The block and dodge modules do not change.There are many problems that need to be optimized, and the plot and combat cannot be changed, but many other issues such as optimization, map guidance, and the mini-map can be optimized and solved. The overall score is indeed worth 82-85, not too high nor too low. If you want to experience unique traditional Chinese art style or support China's first major work, this game is worth trying. However, if you just want to experience a good ARPG, there are still many issues that need to be optimized. Currently, it can only be considered mediocre with many better options available. If your purchase urge is not that strong, you can wait until the game is optimized properly before purchasing and playing."
Negative,is it possible to get a refund on this game?
Negative,Keeps crashing.  No go for me until issues are resolved.
Negative,cant get past the title screen. unacceptable. patch this now.i have a top notch rig.
Negative,"Can't sex the dude with no head, wouldn't recommend."
Negative,"Hmm no weight in combat, honestly too many bosses and idk just not very fun tbh. Just my humble opinion"
Negative,Can not play just constant crashing upon start up.
Negative,"Uh oh, early access?here we go again...Invisible walls are really bad in stone monke fight. you actually have no idea where the edges of the area are and you can get backed into a corner.  i was a big advocate of simply letting the invis walls prevent immersion block but it genuinely feels weird running into an invisible wall.I have been watching them tweak and fix every fight as i encounter it. they nuke me with bs grabs and animation lock when i get close to defeating a boss if they require more data. actually troubleshot a broken quest and the cart still bugged out in the end. I feel like if i do this, maybe they will fix it and it will be better for everyone else.Weapons don't work. very linear weapon progression. you get knocked outta your light finisher and heavy charge attacks miss 9/10 times.theres tracking and it still misses cause hitboxes are just. the worst i've ever seen.bosses will hit you from behind when theyre attacking in front of them, or the aoe from their ground hit will aoe the entire area and kill you anyways. you basically have to dodge every single damaging ability simply cause the game has no poise. anything staggers you so you can't strategize to tank a hit in order to dump a hit. the parry mechanic is pretty messy as well, it only works about 33% of the time. i've done two playthroughs and its been the same each time. very linear. when i hit the potion, and i can watch the monster jump into the air, soar across to my location and hit me before my potion goes off. i get pissed. it makes me mad every single time.Music - ehh.. i don't really think it matches the game. it adds no flare or aesthetic, and during fights it doesn't mesh with the rhythm of the combat.  the SFX are incredibly loud and the voice acting could be better, american audiences hear a lot of grunts and groans in fights sometimes so thats why they adopted the idea to call out the names of their abilities, ""KAMEHAMEHA!"" sounds a lot better than ""UGH AHH EUHH GUH EHHH"".yes, im asking for a little showmanship. currently its unnoticeable other than being loud and obnoxious.Art - saving grace not even gonna lie. Story - Nicely done. the chapter endings are really neat. i feel like i got more outta it than others would just because i have previous knowledge. otherwise theres no way you can connect some dots."
Negative,"absolutely garbage, you press one button, you restart the game, I tried to play for literally an hour, 50 mins are closing and restarting the game, do not buy now,  you will lose patience and smash your PC hard."
Negative,"So far just crashing when compiling shaders. Tried restarting, uninstalled and reinstalled, updated drivers. Nothing working. Any help? My computer just completely freezes while compiling shaders."
Negative,"I beat the 2nd chapter and I’m almost done with the 3rd chapter of black myth wukong. Overall it’s enjoyable to a degree, but the late-game bosses require repeated attempts to learn their patterns, and many have frustrating gimmicks. The game’s difficulty, combined with time-consuming battles, and a lack of a way to significantly increase attack and defense (the skill points for it are pretty negligible for late game enemies, still feels like you don't do that much damage) and challenging areas, makes it feel tedious. Unlike other games, it demands significant time investment, which makes it feel more like a chore rather than a fun game.  Elden ring is better because you can min max your build so that you actually feel strong. Contrary to what the developers say this is a souls like. If you disagree look at Code Vein, a souls-like where you have skills you can use.  This game is more annoying than it is fun. There are few bosses like Radahn in Elden Ring where you will feel like you just can't beat it. You will usually first try most bosses or beat it in a few tries after dying a couple times to some bs move when the boss was almost dead. The issue with this game is that after you beat a boss there is always some bs thing that happens after it, whether it's getting hit by an attack by a normal mob that one shots you, getting jumped, or dealing with the gimmick of the next boss. It gets to the point where you start thinking yes I can definitely beat this boss in one or two more tries, but what's the point if i'm just going to run into a stupid a** mob or boss after beating it. I died more and struggled more with bosses in Elden Ring and still enjoy it more than this sh** show. Score: 6/10."
Negative,"1. Game Optimization Issues: Some players might feel that the game doesn’t run smoothly on certain hardware configurations, especially in scenes with highly detailed visuals, where frame rates may drop.2. Repetitive Game Mechanics: Some players might find that, while the combat system is visually impressive, it can become repetitive over extended playtime, lacking enough variation and innovation.3. Lack of Narrative Depth: Although Black Myth: Wukong excels in visuals and sound design, some players may feel that the story lacks depth, with a plot that is too linear and lacks complex emotional and character development.4. Overly High Expectations: Due to the early buzz and attention the game received, some players may have had expectations that were too high, and the final product may not fully meet these expectations, leading to disappointment.5. It would be better if it could be more realistic, more open, and have more NPC like RDR 2 or GTA 5.If this game is going to have a sequel, I suggest you talk to Rockstar."
Negative,the combat feels off
Negative,"I hate to say it but I can't recommend this game for any person that doesn't have a really high end system.They clearly put a lot of time and effort into building a precise and challenging combat system but the extreme level of upscaling required just to play at 30 fps makes it really difficult for me to tell what's happening unless the camera and the characters are holding still.Even with the graphics slammed down as low as they'll go the game skips and stutters like crazy.TL;DR Great game, terrible technology. High end GPUs only."
Negative,game keeps crashing
Negative,"""The function of this key cannot be customized""What kind of fuckwit undergrad project is this that you can't change keybinds?"
Negative,"VIsually very nice, gameplay seems fun too. The storyline is most likely good as well but i'm unable to continue playing properly due to restrictions in keybinds. I know it is console recommended but its certainly not hard to give at least the freedom to change keybinds at will for mouse & keyboard. This sure was a dealbreaker for me to refund this if you can't even enjoy playing the game how you want."
Negative,"First cutscene is crashing. Tried 6 times and restarted my computer and ran the game in compatibility mode, no dice. I'll change this later if they fix it. AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 8-Core CPUAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX GPU48GB RAM"
Negative,"This game is garbage. Performance is trash, boss design is trash, the spinning and crap like that is tiresome... so many trash animation just to hit an enemy... the staff.... an entire game using just one weapon type.... this game is trash. Some bosses? I don't even know what the hell is going on. Stutering + trash design + stupid spinning movements = shit. I do not understand how people think this game is good. I really don't."
Negative,"This game is overrated. The combat isn't that great and it tries to be like a souls game which is a turn off for me. I didn't have too many issues as far as performance, but I have a 4080 and 7900x3d. Most of the time above 60fps with dips into the 40s with settings maxed and raytracing on medium, 1440p resolution."
Negative,Starts out fun then becomes frustrating. Takes forever to upgrade anything. Just another game like Elden Ring and noah 1 and 2. Thought it would be something refreshing and it isn't at all. Don't even bother. They say the game is an rpg and that's and understatement. Not worth the time especially when you can't even enjoy it.
Negative,"The game is great, but it has a lot of traversal stutter, shader compilation stutter, and ray tracing microstutter. With Ray Tracing the game plays like a mess, it's playable but barely enjoyable. Without Ray Tracing you can get a pretty decent experience as the game tends to be smoother with it off. If you must play this game, despite these issues, capping to 60 FPS and disabling Ray Tracing is recommended as it will smoothen out the frametime spikes.Will change this review once an optimization patch smooths things out"
Negative,"The reviews saying this is like God of War are absolutely delusional.If you like souls-like games, maybe you will like it. But as a fan of GoW and Jedi:Fallen Order/Survivor (both games Ive seen compared to this), I dont find this the least bit enjoyable."
Negative,"Either crashes on start up or freezes on the first 2 cutscenes. Benchmark has stable 100+ fps on very high.RTX 4070, Ryzen 7600."
Negative,"Please fix DS5 support, I will change the review right away."
Negative,"The Black Myth about Wukong.First: Let's talk about some of the good things.The visuals are some of the best since Cyberpunk 2077. No, really. They're insane. Consistently photo realistic throughout. The combat is fluid and the varied stances and their special attacks are great from the get-go and get even better as you progress through those skill trees. There's also a good bit of variation in the environments. You might go from a snowy mountain to an oasis in a hidden cave within the span of an hour or so.Now for the bad:Inconsistent difficulty is probably my number one bugaboo.This game doesn't know if it wants to be the God of War tutorial section or if it wants to be ""every Sekiro boss turned up to 11."" The craziest part is that you'll get that within a single chapter. Some bosses you'll walk through easier than a normal enemy. Other bosses will have you questioning the design choices. ""Why am I not allowed to use any of the spells I put a bunch of points into?"" ""Why can't I roll in a game that's literally about rewarding perfect dodges?"" ""Why is this boss invincible unless I find a specific item hidden behind a train of other bosses that are harder than the boss I need the item to beat?"" etc.It seems like half of the development team was going for a narrative heavy action RPG and the other seemed more focused on trying to one-up FromSoft's most notorious encounters (all of which I've completed multiple times over).The end compromise between these two camps, unfortunately, is an imbalanced mess with a major identity crisis. Acts 1 and 2 are straight up boss rushes. I was a bit disappointed in the lack of exploration but lo-and behold by Act 3 not only did I like the environmental designs better, but the game world opened up a bit more and allowed for some better exploration. The story even started to take shape. This continued into Act 4. Secret bosses, hidden loot, new enemy types, etc. There was even a bit of verticality to the environments that wasn't as prevalent in the earlier sections of the game.Perhaps the most easily addressable and biggest issue is the technical problems this game is having. While I've had no major crashes, I've had environments that failed to load in, and I've had outrageous lag spikes in the middle of boss encounters that wiped an otherwise perfect run.While a lot of people (including myself) are cheering the ethics behind the studio and their rejection of modernisms in the game, it still doesn't excuse some of the design choices and the persistent technical issues well into release."
Negative,"Performs significantly worse than the provided benchmark, even at minimal graphics settings."
Negative,i tried to click recommend but there's an invisible wall i can't :(
Negative,At this point i dont even try anymore. Tried that first boss a couple times. When hes down to 10% of his health the games decides to crash for no reason. Please fix the random crashes then we're Good. Game crashes like every 10 minuntes.This game is another evidence of why i will never pre order a game ever again. i9 14900k RTX 409064 GB DDR52TB NVMEWindows11the gameplay is fun and the battles are challenging and rewarding ( if you could finish them before your game dies )
Negative,i will change this review when they fix this but it is really annoying.  during cinematic a lot of slow downs and audio issues.  they are very bad ones too.  happen through the game as well completely ruining immersion.  the rest of the game so far is very fun thought
Negative,"After 15 hours I have changed my mind on this game. It's still amazing game, However let me explain my experiences and Why I am leaving a thumbs down.I am on chapter 3 and I am burned out.It took way too long for me to get here, as a casual gamer and a disabled one at that. I tried my best to get through the game. Slogging away at each boss until I basically muscle memory each boss to dodge and kill them.Difficulty is subjective and while I get and understand the craving for hard games these days.This game does need a STORY MODE / CASUAL MODE at least for people like me.Elden Ring drove me mental, but at least I felt the game was rewarding and grinding was fun.Grinding levels in this game is PAINFULLY slow and also extremely frustrating. You get outnumbered in this game (with range as well) and you get off screened quicker than Gojo did against Sukuna.I am not taking anything away from the games beautiful graphics, sound, and presentation. This is hands down one of the best games ever to be made. Period. My personal reason for disliking the game is down to accessablity and misleading marketing.I bought this game based on the hype (like everyone else) I bought this game expecting a DMC like game with souls like elements, not the other way around.I also DID not know there was NO DIFFICULTY SETTINGS.Otherwise I would have never pre-ordered on CDKEYS (you can't get refunds there)So having gone balls deep I decided to play the game and try and get through it.I struggled for ages on the first Bald monk boss and the golden one too.6 hours later. I am on Chapter 2. 8 hours later. Just started chapter 3.Brute forcing myself to dust myself off and get through each boss has not been fun for me.I struggled against almost every boss, except the bear boss and the big rat boss in chapter 2.The massive bug boss and that rat monk drove me insane. Every type of enemy in this game can 1 shot you or do 60% DAMAGE to you at flashing red health, bosses more so. So imagine how frustrating it is for someone like me to get a boss to 20% feel like I am winning I am at 60% hp and BOOM dead.Having to start over.Yeah that is not fun AT ALL.""This game is not for you bro""Yeah I get that. It's not. 100% its not for me. But they should have been clearer on the difficulty, once I pre-ordered the game I didn't read any news or ""leaks"" because of spoilers.I only started looking up stuff because I struggled so much in the game, and imagine my horror when I discovered no accessablity settings or casual mode.Also I am a little disapointed in the lack of MC speaking. We are a silent monkey, and nothing urks my gears in a story based game with our MC not speaking a WORD.I was expecting Monkey King dialogue since we start off as him in the game itself.This story takes place after the events of the journey to the west.All in all. The game is incredible, but it is WAY too hard for casual and disabled gamers like myselfWho don't play for the difficulty, but the story and the fun of beating the crap out of everything.Much like Sukuna did to every JJK sorcerer in the manga.Until the difficulty gets adjusted I will never finish my Journey to the west.Apparently the game only gets harder from chapter 3 onwards.YAY,I just don't see the issue with not having a difficulty setting, if you don't want an easy game, you don't pick it. It's a matter of choice. Give the choice to the player, that is all I am asking.I will keep playing the game but I hope the developers take note of people like myselfWho want to play games like this, support developers like this, but also enjoy the game like everyone else who can actually play game as intended.The game is still incredible, I just wish it had some accessablity options to improve my experience of the game.The games camera is also infruiatingThe auto tracking of some bosses is laughable and outright unfair at timesThe frustration factor goes through the roof when certain bosses cheese you and kill you with imput readingThe game does not feel fair at allI only recommend this game for those that love punishment and extremely hard gamesThis game is not a DMC likeIt is 100% a souls like and I hate the stamina system in this gameI am now on Chapter 4, and it is by an far the worst zone in the game. Flying enemies that dodge you? You can't lock on to team and everything has poison. Ugh.I am gonna beat this game, but right now I am not having as much fun due to the things mentioned above WITHOUT adding a difficulty.Cheers"
Negative,plz fix shader crash 60 euros for a game that crashes on loading screen is not a good thing setting my pc to 1200/800 vsync on 40 hz en the game on windowd it still launched full screen 800 fps wel loading shaders pc crash times 8i love to gif a tumbs up i first need to play the game tho
Negative,"Game runs like crap on a 1080ti, audio cuts out, lipsync way off, frames tank and game crashed after intro fight... Had to put the game on low settings to just make it some what playable and still got a crash after the intro fight. Going to refund if i cant get this resolved"
Negative,i would say its good but I cant even play the fucking thing. Spent 5 pissing hours trying to get the thing to work but it freezes and crashes every time I load it
Negative,"laggy and  poorly optimised. cool concept, not the best execution"
Negative,"The first area played fairly smoothly on my laptop with a 4060 and 13900HX on high settings.  There was some flicker with the shadows I didn't like, so I turned down the settings in the second area.  Now I can't get past a bamboo forest without the game crashing.  Get to the forest, battle an enemy or two, crash.  Reload, run, battle, crash.  Now I'm past the refund window.  Don't be me."
Negative,"Started of great but starts to fall apart after chapter 2.The quality toward the end of chapter 3 is a lot worse than the beggining of the game, bosses, map design etc. just don't cut it anymore.Also problems with crashing is prevelant."
Negative,"Pass and look again, the plot is really poor, and the gap in my mind is too large, do plot analysis of the UP are clowns, without any guidance, seemingly to increase the sense of entrainment, but to give up the root of the end, poor sense of direction of the people experience is very poor, the same place has been circling around, the art is undoubtedly the top of the optimization is very good, the third chapter of the Floating Towers of pure dung map, the bottom of the level of the boos are also pure dung monsters, after the passage of the passage of the feeling of nothing. The main thing is that there is no sense of immersion, just kill monsters kill cool, but I am more interested in the plot!"
Negative,"My first review had a thumbs up because of a really good graphics and unique bosses that are not repeating much. But after few game breaking bugs i decided to change my review to a negative one. - The bug where bosses are stunned and i can just kill them without effort is quite annoying as the game has set on killing bosses.  - I'm using auto detection settings by nvidia geforce experience which should be best optimized variation, somewhere at the beginning of boss fights im getting a frame drop spike and later im fighting the boss with tearing screen. Optimization bug is quite annoying. - If previous bugs could be acceptable in the first place i cannot stand the bugs where i have undying enemies and bosses. I dont know somewhere in desert area there are blue glowing enemies which are somewhat 2 phased, one of them is near a buddha eye statue, the other right before the rock boss offering altar. The amount of flying kicks i received as they kept following me was something else. - Another boss fight is on top of the bridge, i'm wondering for every little area that can be jumped or could be explored has been modified with invisible walls, why this damn boss keep throwing you out of the bridge, despite the boss is quite fast his knocback also out of this world, the amount of times i got thrown of the bridge were not pleasant. - Standart enemies okay but the main reason i decided to give negative review as i have stuck on Foban boss of the secret area in the chapter 2, the boss is not dying, the hp bar is empty, and we are still hitting the boss like no tomorrow. I tried to restart the game kill it once again still the same. I can easily say that game is totally supports the label ""made in china"""
Negative,The actual fighting mechanics are very dull. Sure you have some interesting abilities. But the actual attacking part is just a spam fest with light attacks and rolling. Looks ok but that’s also not very hard when you are on rails. Invisible walls everywhere. I'm glad people are enjoying it but outside of the graphics there's nothing particular fun or interesting about the game.
Negative,"!!!FIX. YOUR. GAME!!! I'm tired of getting a defective product at a high price! The game ran perfectly for the first half hour or so until the benchmark showed the course. Then shortly after that the previously rock solid 70+ FPS went from 20-25! Moving on from that part of the track, it was good again."
Negative,"If you don't like Soulslike games, don't let the other reviews trick you into buying this. This plays and feels pretty much like a Soulslike game, or, perhaps, Soulslike+, if you will, since you are able to cast a few fancy abilities once or twice per one bossfight. Other than that, it has a ""highly engaging"" gameplay loop of a Soulslike: Space - Space - Space - LMB is a key sequence that will make up 90% of your playtime.As a mythology fan, I'm also highly disappointed in the game's storyline. The game has a very poor narrative and most of the time you'll be fighting random enemies with no setup, no backstory and no plot relevance. A good story can still be told through the environment and level design, but the amount of invisible walls and uninspiring convoluted corridors make even the exploration aspect feel miserable."
Negative,DOOO NOT GET THIS GAME RN NOW IF U HAVE A AMD GPU. U HAVE BEEN WARNED
Negative,Crashes every 20min no good.
Negative,"hopefully this gets fixed down the road, but this game COOKS my computer even on low settings."
Negative,I'm sorry women
Negative,"the benchmark lied to me. i CAN run this game at 120+ fps at 1440p very high settings.game was definitely over-hyped tho. looks great, appeals to a very normal audience. but im kinda just bored of it. i wouldn't recommend unless you're okay with a repetitive and boring combat system. feels more mashing than actual combat.no part of me wants to continue playing this game other than trying to 'get my money's worth'"
Negative,I have a maxed out PC and the game crashes at the loading screen. Reports are that this game doesnt work with the newest CPUs 13th & 14th gen. Guess I will wait for an update Ill give it 4 stars because other seems to enjoy it but I hope they fix their problems quickly because I would like to play it
Negative,"Poorly optimized.. Watched some streams, it doesn't seem all that amazingly fun. Not game of the year worthy, cant even play it after pre-purchase. Again, poorly optimized. Expected the studio to have their ducks in a row on this one, because of all the hype. I'd rather get my money back, seems like another dragons dogma.Finally got to play, and im still not that impressed. Nice fun game but not amazingly so. Still dont think it deserves a GOTY nom. Tired of the (learn boss behavior, dodge this, boss one taps, get gud) just want to play a fun game without having to sweat or get overly frustrated with."
Negative,other than it possibly being the most beautiful game out. overhyped clunky gameplay. i was playing a 120fps high setting and felt like weather i was on controller or m and k i was waiting for dodges and attacks. you can attack and sit in a animation for 3+ seconds doing nothing without any ability to dodge. this game has souls difficulty just cause of the lack of attention to the actual playability of the game
Negative,"The game is heavily inspired by the novel Wu Kong, a Chinese fiction published in 2006, rather than the original Journey to the West. It's actually quite different from the classic tale. Personally, I enjoyed Wu Kong, so this wasn't an issue for me. However, if you're not a fan of the novel, you might find the story very absurd.Unfortunately, the game lacks polish in most areas, with the exception of 3D modeling. The combat system seems to take inspiration from Nioh, but it falls short in complexity and engagement. The animations also felt somewhat clunky. The lighting was particularly harsh on my eyes, especially in Chapter 2—every time I exited a cave, the sunlight was so intense it felt like a nuclear blast. The map design was another major issue. Despite not being an open-world game, the map is structured like one, encouraging exploration when there nothing to actually discover. I often found myself getting lost, which became quite frustrating."
Negative,"Game looks monke amazing! Combat is taking a bit getting used to, something about the dodge and movement, or maybe just me and souls games, time will tell.There are a lot of invisible walls, this was the first thing that I found strange, I understand with graphics like this it was expected but it feels odd not being able to fully roam around.Story seems to be very gripping and immersive. A lot of lore within the short space of time I've had it going, and I'm not even at the first boss yet.Update: The combat is definitely weird, input delay, considering you have delayed attacks that don't allow you to dodge and a terrible very delayed heavy attack that doesn't work on most bosses unless you're spamming jump heavy. They have tried to Dark Souls/Sekiro it but bosses that spam the same cut-scene attacks over and over again gets tiring.I'd give the game a 7/10 and I'm disliking it more and more when you have bosses with spam attacks, I'm talking about whirlwind rat boss with invisible walls that get tighter and tighter with each phase, making your staff feel like you're fighting with a twig.Would recommend for die-hards, but personally if I had the option, I'd refund if I could. I'm going to sit it out and wait for the developers to figure out the issues. Beautiful game with sub-par, janky combat."
Negative,"I love this game so far but fucking awful optimization right nowEdit 1: it's been 4 days since this triple AAA game has dropped with the biggest hype surrounding it and I still cannot play unless I wanna dodge on sound queues and fight pixels because of the shitty optimization issuesEdit 2: it's been 8 days since it dropped, still can't play, still no news about the performance getting fixed aside from the devs being aware about it. Getting hungry, need food, need water Edit 3: The Black Myth Wukong lords finally blessed up with an optimization update, but sadly it was to no prevail. My hope slowly seeped into my being, but before I knew it I was crudely pulled back into reality when I noticed the update did ABSOLUTELY FUCK ALLLLLLLLL!!!!  I JUST WANT TO PLAY MONKEY WITH A STICK PLEASEEEEEE!!!!!Edit 4: games still broken, a random dude made two mods on Nexus that fix 40% of the issues i'm having so there's even more proof this game is fucked up and broken"
Negative,Game keeps crashing after intro. Maybe worth trying in a few months.
Negative,"If you like sekiro, you will probably like this, if dont, you wont. Combat is to spammy for my taste. Dont expect a souls like"
Negative,Game crashes 2 minutes in. Can't even play it. Will try again in a few months when they update the game.
Negative,CRASH CRASH CRASH! NOT WORTH IT
Negative,Looks promising but crashed after the end of the tutorial twice forcing me to redo the entire section. Might come back to it later but literally cannot progress until its fixed.
Negative,"Chapter 3 killed it for me; it was pretty good up to that point. Bad pacing, mediocre boss fights, and level design made for a boring experience that I just couldn't force myself to get through. It's like when you think about replaying a game and then remember 'that' segment you need to go through at some point, and you dread thinking about it. Chapter 3 is that segment."
Negative,"until these driver crashing issue gets fix it a thumb down for me, cant even get pass the opening cut scene."
Negative,"unplayable, constant crashes."
Negative,the game is good but dont waste your money buying if you have an AMD gpu constant crashing completely ruining the game
Negative,RTX 4070Ti/i9-13900k couldn't open the game.Keeps crashing during shader compilation.
Negative,A lot of crashes at the moment hope they can fix the issues!!
Negative,"Can't even get past the first cut scene on my I5-13600K, 7900XTX with 64GBs of RAM. I even turned the settings way down and it's still non stop crashing."
Negative,Game crashes during the opening cutscene. Plz fix.
Negative,games great crashed sometimes but i could still get like 45 mins ti an hour and a half of play time before it would do that. but now that ive hit chapter 3 the game is crashing so often i cant even progress because the game will crash before i can even make it to the next checkpoint even though im running past all the enemies. i end up getting a good 2 mins before every crash now
Negative,"I want to like the game as well but unfortunately I can't recommend them. The other negative reviews have already covered most of it, but I'll just add them here.The good- The graphics and environment are very good looking although there are many places that seems a bit too dark and gamma doesn't help with that.- Pretty good for what it is at least for a first game from the studio. Lies of P had the same vibe as well but it did alright at least for their first souls-like game.The not so good- I believe the game was advertised as an action RPG but its just a souls-like game with an action RPG tag - Linear exploration with minimal gap separating the previous boss and the next boss. What this means is that most of the hours in the game you'll be spending on bosses.- As mentioned by others, there are a certain balancing issue here. Actually this is quite similar to the issues in Lies of P where you don't feel powerful even though you explore and play the game in a slow and methodical way. This was made worse due to the fact that the rewards from beating optional bosses seems to make only a tiny difference. This is the same issue in Lies of P where it gives the player tons of P Organ and Legion Arms mechanics but many of them are superficial. This make the constant boss fight eventually becomes a chore (Basically its quantity vs quality of bosses).- As others have mention, the combos only work if your exactly match your actions with those of your enemy. If you miss, your combo break and you are screwed.- If you miss an optional area for the specific items, your next boss fight will be much more difficult than it needs to be.- As some others has mention, there are many skills you can pick from the tree but they have no noticeable effect. It seems like the common gameplay flow goes like this - Before a boss fight, visit the shrine and re-allocate some skills in hope that these works.On one end, I have completed Elden Ring and Sekiro because both of them are that good. Tight controls, excellent combat, beautiful world building, sound & music, punishing bosses but rewarding. And then on another end, I did not complete Lies of P and Black Myth Wukong. I could go further but I chose not to. Both of them are OK game but that's about it.I would rank the following games as follows and the reason why both of them at rank 5 is just an example where they ain't nowhere close to the likes of ER or Sekiro. 1. Sekiro2. Elden Ring3. ...4. ...5. Lies of P and Black Myth Wukong"
